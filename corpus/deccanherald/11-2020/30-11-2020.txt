30-11-2020||First Edit||RBI, drop this risky move||The proposal of an internal working committee of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to allow large corporate bodies and industrial houses to promote banks in the country is a matter of serious concern. The committee was set up to examine the licensing and regulatory guidelines for private banks and its proposal has attracted much opposition from various quarters. The RBI has never been generous with banking licences, and past licensing guidelines have allowed only a few private banks with no links to business and industry. There has even been an explicit bar on large industrial houses entering the banking sector. But there seems to be a rethink now, and that does not seem to be in the best interest of the banking industry and the financial system, and the economy in general. The concern has been aggravated by the fact that the economy is much more vulnerable now than in the past.  The risks associated with allowing corporate ownership of banks are many. There is a possibility of depositors’ money being diverted to corporate houses and businesses linked to them. The standards of corporate governance are not high in the country even with all the laws and regulations and oversight by many bodies. Banks have also resorted to malpractices and favoured parties with dubious credentials with loans, creating NPAs and endangering depositors’ interest. The Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi experiences are only recent. When businesses themselves control banks, this risk will be heightened. Risks like inter-group lending and the contagion spreading from corporate failures and defaults to the banking sector will be very real. Industry and business are the biggest clients of the banks now and the health of the sector depends to an extent on them. To give them controlling interest in some banks is not advisable at all. Overall, the proposal, if implemented, can lead to conflicts of interest in banks and concentration of power and greater systemic risks.  There are not enough checks and balances in the financial system to minimise damage and avoid collapses. Five banks or major financial institutions have failed in the country in the past two years, the latest being Lakshmi Vilas Bank. Regulatory oversight is not always at its best. Very often, a failure or problem is detected only after it has occurred. It should be noted that the working committee's recommendation is not unanimous and three former RBI governors have opposed it. There is the need to expand banking in the country, which is even now largely unbanked. Private sector banks will have an important role in this. But the recommendation which will introduce cronyism into banking is not the solution and it should be dropped altogether.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/rbi-drop-this-risky-move-921466.html
30-11-2020||In Perspective||Walking on thin ice||Changes in the climate system over tens of thousands of years brought about ice ages and interglacial warming periods. Science confirms that climate change, which is a large-scale and long-term change in the earth’s weather patterns, is human-induced and not due to natural causes.  Globally, the past five years have been the hottest on record, extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods, and droughts have gone up five-fold, and economic losses have increased seven-fold over the past 50 years.  In India, temperature rose by 0.7°C in little over a century (1901 to 2018). During the recent 30-year period of 1986 to 2015, India recorded multiple extreme weather events including a rise in severe cyclonic storms over the Arabian Sea, heat waves, floods and droughts. In 2018 alone, extreme climate change events in India resulted in an economic loss of $37 billion, equivalent to 10% of the Indian budget in FY2019.  India’s first national assessment of climate change by the Ministry of Earth Sciences projects that by the end of the 21st century, the frequency of heat waves would be three to four times more, and their intensity would double. The report also warns of storms, floods and rising sea levels.  This is a grave threat to 70% of livelihoods in India that are dependent on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, fishing and forests. It also places cities at risk as they become exposed and vulnerable to climate risks such as water shortages, floods and heat stress. Consequently, combating climate change — one of the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations — is crucial for natural resource management, human security and development. Stressing the importance of a comprehensive strategy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated at the recent G20 virtual summit, “Climate change must be fought not in silos but in an integrated, comprehensive and holistic way.”  Such an approach requires building awareness and systematic efforts at different levels by different participants, including think tanks.  International efforts In 2015, Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reached the landmark Paris Agreement. The Agreement referred to a two-pronged strategy—mitigation and adaptation—to keep the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius, above pre-industrial levels.  While mitigation suggests efforts to reduce and stabilise the emission of greenhouse gases, adaptation refers to the efforts to adapt to climate change that we cannot prevent. Fundamentally, while mitigation is a global issue, adaptation is a domestic and regional issue, given climate impacts vary based on geography, climate, inherent vulnerabilities and adaptive capacity.  Under the Paris Agreement, Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC)—foundational to limit global warming—were submitted by 190 countries, including India. The INDC allows countries to define contributions tailored to national priorities. State Action Plans  The State Actions Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs) were conceived by India to help mainstream adaptation in developmental plans and decisions. Submitted during 2012-2015, the first version of SAPCCs lacked vision and concrete guidelines, and only broadly advocated incremental changes to the business-as-usual scenarios. In many of the state plans, actions were ‘wish lists’ with no clear plan or budget tied to them. This was so because the states were unable to distinguish between business-as-usual development activities and measures required to address climate change in many sectors.  With the states presently revising their SAPCCs, we have an opportunity to make amends for the gaps in the first set of plans. To transform the state action plans into comprehensive policy documents, a few good practices will be required.  Firstly, district-level climate change projections should be used for identifying emerging risks. Secondly, this knowledge, coupled with assessment of vulnerabilities of different regions or communities or sectors should feed into the revised plans.  Thirdly, implementation of action plans should be decentralised with the participation of various state departments, district and city administrations. Finally, the plans should incorporate a clear estimate of the finances required, either through allocation of dedicated budgets in the developmental programmes or targeted plans for seeking finance.  The ongoing revision of SPACCs is an opportunity to align state goals to the INDC commitments while chalking out domestic action on adaptation. A science-based approach will not only help build resilience of systems and communities over the long-term, but also address the immediate developmental needs.  The state action plans could also pave the way for all future developmental and infrastructural programmes to have risk-profiling and vulnerability-mapping integrated into the project design. Such mainstreaming could help attract private sector finance for adaptation in the future unlike today when private sector involvement is restricted to mitigation.  (The writers work in the area of Climate, Environment and Sustainability at Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy, a research-based think tank)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/in-perspective/walking-on-thin-ice-921468.html

With traffic violations on the rise in Hassan, the police have started using body-worn cameras. Motorbike riders and car drivers used to speed away at times and it was difficult to identify and penalise them. However, such people would be caught with video evidence and will have to face action. Superintendent of Police R Srinivas Gowda has directed the traffic police to be equipped with body worn cameras, to enforce strict traffic rules. Although the Police department was provided 40 body-worn cameras two years ago, only a few were using them. Thus, many people used to argue with the police and try to escape, after being intercepted. It had become difficult to chase them and identify the vehicles. The traffic police intercept the vehicles for checking driving license, insurance and other documents. There were allegations against the police about accepting bribe and leaving the violators and sometimes providing receipt for lesser amounts. The body cameras will now put an end to all such complaints. Now, PSI, ASI and all staff of traffic police stations have started wearing body cameras, while on duty. Their interaction with the public are recorded on the cameras. If the public deny the violations, the cops can verify the cameras for confirmation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/hassan-cops-equipped-with-body-worn-cameras-to-reduce-traffic-violations-921804.html

If all goes as per the plan, the devotees may have the darshan of the deity from March 2021. The temple was closed in 2016, to take up the renovation works. A blue print has been submitted to the district administration, seeking approval. The works inside the temple, like wiring and flooring is pending and is expected to be completed by the end of December. The works are under progress since four years and it came to a halt due to the Covid crisis. Now, the works have resumed and the painting is expected to be completed in January. Tahsildar B K Sudarshan said that he has been conducting periodical inspections and giving information to the deputy commissioner. "The artisans are involved in the final stages of work. There is a plan to inaugurate the temple during 'Uttarayana Punyakala'," he added. Astrologers, under the guidance of priest Nagaraja Bhat, visited the spot and identified auspicious dates for conducting the rituals and reopening the temple. Thus, five days have been referred from March 24 to 28, said temple Executive Officer Y N Mohan Kumar. An additional fund of Rs 1 crore was released for the temple. MLA N Mahesh and the then Minister Sa Ra Mahesh had directed the officials to prepare an action plan for constructing steps and for road works. But, due to Covid, the works could not be completed and the funds lapsed. The temple authorities seek more funds to complete the works now. MLA Mahesh said, "The Dodda jatra of the temple is on April 26, 2021. The art work of the temple doors and windows are done in Mysuru.

30-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||2-phase polls for 5,700 gram panchayats in Karnataka announced||The State Election Commission announced a two-phased polls for over 5,700 gram panchayats in Karnataka. The first phase of elections will be held on December 22 for 2,930 gram panchayats and the second one on December 27 for 2,832 gram panchayats. The results will be out on December 30. The gram panchayat elections are often seen as a barometer to gauge the public mood in rural areas. The elections are being held amid apprehension from the state government, which had asked the SEC to postpone the polls due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the High Court rapped the government and directed the SEC to conduct the elections while hearing a petition filed by Congress leader KC Kondaiah and others. State Election Commissioner B Basavaraju said 5,762 gram panchayats will go to polls. “There are 162 gram panchayats whose term ends after December 2020, six whose election cases are in court, 74 that are either completely (33) or partially (41) upgraded to town panchayats are exempt from elections," he said. The total electoral strength for the polls is 2,97,15,048 of which 1,49,71,676 are men, 1,47,41,964 women and 1,048 third gender. The number of voters in all polling booths is reduced to 1,000 from 1,500 as part of the Standard Operating Procedure formulated for the elections. Basavaraju said that half the taluks in a district will vote in either of the two phases and staff from the same district will be used for election duty. This, he said, was being done to prevent the movement of officials or staff to other districts during the pandemic. Polling will be held between 7 am to 5 pm and measures are in place to allow Covid-19 voters to cast their ballot during the last hour of voting, Basavaraju added. Earlier this month, Health & Family Welfare Minister K Sudhakar had said experts wanted the gram panchayat elections to be put off till February 2021. According to him, apprehensions have been expressed that conducting the polls might lead to “door delivery of the virus” as door-to-door campaigns are crucial during such local polls.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/2-phase-polls-for-5700-gram-panchayats-in-karnataka-announced-921613.html
30-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||Allegations of Mahadayi water diversion by Goa CM baseless: Jarkiholi||Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi refuted allegations made by Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant that Karnataka diverted waters of Mahadayi river illegally, leading to depletion of the river's water table. Daring Sawant to prove his claims, Jarkiholi also said that he wuld quit as a minister if the allegations were true. Jarkiholi also said that Sawant's claims were merely for political gain. The Mahadayi River Dispute Tribunal has given its verdict and allocated states their share of water, but we could not utilise them as works could not be commenced due to Covid-19 pandemic, he said. The state had retained the wall built in Kalasa canal to prevent flow of water towards the state into river Malaprabha, he said. On cabinet expansion, Jarkiholi said that the 17 MLAs who joined the BJP from Congress and facilitated the formation of B S Yeddiyurappa's government must be made ministers as assured. The minister said that he too has been lobbying for them and wanted MLC C P Yogeshwar to get a post. He also stated that Textile Minister Shrimant Patil was among the 17 who joined BJP with him and would not be dropped from the cabinet. Adding that his demand to make all those who joined BJP with him be made ministers was fair. Chief Minister Yediyurappa will decide on cabinet expansion or reshuffle. Jarkiholi also stated that talks of chief minister change in Karnataka were rumours and Yediyurappa would complete his tenure and also lead the party in the next assembly elections. Jarkiholi said he had been visiting New Delhi often for department works and for follow-up with concerned union ministers. During the visit, he also met party national leaders. We have been trying to get national project status for Upper Krishna Project and Upper Bhadra Project, which will reduce financial burden on the state as the centre will share project costs, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/allegations-of-mahadayi-water-diversion-by-goa-cm-baseless-jarkiholi-921642.html

The model code of conduct for the local polls kicked in from Monday itself amid uncertainty on what the BJP central leadership will decide on Yediyurappa's Cabinet. “Wait for two days,” Yediyurappa said when asked if his Cabinet will be expanded in the month of December. Yediyurappa said that the gram panchayat elections were as crucial as Lok Sabha and Assembly polls. "They are important to strengthen the party organisation," he said. "Six teams under state BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel are travelling to prepare for the polls," he said."Although there is no party symbol in the gram panchayat elections, naturally people know which candidate is backed by who. That's why BJP is giving more importance to these polls," Yediyurappa added. According to State Election Commissioner B Basavaraaju, it was a "rare thing" to expand the Cabinet during the subsistence of the code of conduct. "There are no specific guidelines for it. We have to examine it separately. When the government wants to expand the Cabinet and if it refers to us, we will look into it," he said. The guidelines, he said, were aimed at preventing rural voters from being influenced. "We have to examine whether such decisions influence voters," he said. He did not have clarity when asked whether inducting MLCs MTB Nagaraj and R Shankar, both of whom have represented rural constituencies, would influence voters. Meanwhile, the Yediyurappa administration continued to make appointments to state-run companies. The government also rejigged some after legislators are said to have thrown a tantrum on what they were initially given. Raibag MLA Duryodhana Aihole, who was nominated as chairman of Dr BR Ambedkar Development Corporation a few days ago, was appointed chairman of Karnataka Adijaambava Development Corporation. Mayakonda MLA N Linganna will now head Dr Babu Jagajeevan Ram Leather Industries Development Corporation Ltd, after Haveri MLA Olekar Channabasappa was shifted to the Karnataka SC/ST Commission.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/gram-panchayat-polls-wont-affect-cabinet-expansion-karnataka-cm-bs-yediyurappa-921767.html
30-11-2020||Main Article||Congress, reform or perish||Former US President Barack Obama’s description of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi as “a student eager to impress teacher” and one who “lacked the aptitude” is sure to warm the cockles of the heart of those who had consistently riled him with different uncharitable appellations. But the extended pedagogic metaphor, especially as it comes from a distinguished former president, and not from a loose cannon like defeated president Donald Trump, is of special attention, because truth be told, it rings true. The apparently invincible march of the Narendra Modi bandwagon that is currently on the rampage is as much ascribable to his charisma as to the feckless opposition, which is led by Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Obama recalls how, during a meeting with then prime minister Manmohan Singh, he wondered about his successor, aware that Singh was picked up by Sona Gandhi because he, devoid of any national political base, posed no threat to her son who was being groomed by her to take over the Congress: “Would the baton be successfully passed to Rahul, fulfilling the destiny laid out by his mother and preserving the Congress party’s dominance over the divisive nationalism touted by the BJP?”  Obama does not dwell on this for long in his memoir, A Promised Land, but does not fail to train our focus on the need for a strong opposition in India and an able pan-India leader mighty enough to take on the labyrinthine ways of Modi and BJP. Rahul cannot usher the Joe Biden moment in India if the prognostications are anything to go by, the outcome in the Assembly elections in Bihar being the latest of the many reverses the Congress faced.  Now that the Congress lies in tatters and inspires little confidence so as to stand up against the Modi juggernaut, one can wonder if it is a role reversal or not. Way back in the 1950s and 1960s, parties other than the Congress failed to establish secure social bases for themselves. It was because the Congress, with unmatched resources for patronage and influence at its disposal, could employ them either to support or undermine local factions, and during the run-up to an election could operate like a great machine, using its wealth and prestige to ensure that its candidates were well supported and well financed in every region.  Its policy of relying not only on zones of safe seats or on established sitting members but also on campaigning everywhere, and stratagems such as snatching seats from opposition incumbents and Independents to compensate for some unavoidable losses, seems to be the model for the BJP today. The early years of the 1950s does offer a crucial insight into the origins of the so-called “Congress system” and the manoeuvres to contain and control political opposition.  Dynastic rule As the Congress today is too inconsequential to be reckoned as the main Opposition party, the time-worn caveat is that the absence of opposition tends to be seen as proof that a political system is not democratic, and attempts to shackle or outlaw opposition have been the hallmark of repressive or authoritarian regimes.  The dynastic rule accounting for the downfall of the Congress has been discussed far too often. But the bad blood against 23 of its senior leaders who raised concerns regarding the functions of the Congress by acolytes close to the Nehru-Gandhi family is proof, once again, of the truth well-known by now.  The simmering discontent and the ideological rupture within the partyfolds that occasionally erupts – as can be seen in the Jyothiraditya Scindia and Kamal Nath feud in Madhya Pradesh, Ashok Ghelot and Sachin Pilot kerfuffle in Rajasthan, the Ajit Pawar episode in Maharashtra or the horse-trading by the BJP of Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) MLAs in Karnataka – point to something even more sinister:  the liquidation of the front-running opposition in India that bodes ominously ill for the state of democracy of India.  Historian Ramachandra Guha early this year rightly summed up that a “fifth-generation dynast” Rahul Gandhi has no chance in politics against a “hard working and self-made” Modi. He came down on the Kerala verdict electing the Congress leader to Parliament. Guha is not exactly a fan either of Modi or the ruling dispensation but he minced no words in saying that Rahul can hardly be expected to hold a candle to an extremely hard working Modi with an experience of running a state for 15 years, and the vast administrative experience at his disposal.  In 2018, Prime Minister Modi, on the occasion of unfurling the tricolour at the Red Fort to mark the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind government, pointed out how leaders such as Subhas Chandra Bose, B R Ambedkar and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel have been ignored at the altar of the Nehru-Gandhi family. If the Congress had earlier protested that Modi misappropriated the legacy of Sardar Patel, there is no gainsaying that Patel remains the neglected icon of the Congress iconography.  Today, Rahul Gandhi’s thrust for new faces at the cost of veterans such as Shashi Tharoor, Kapil Sibal and Manish Tewari put to an ignominious loyalty test – requiring them to grovel before the so-called Old Guard – may prove counter-productive fomenting dissidence and exodus.  A party barely able to keep its house in order or choose a leader thus failed to confront the BJP, is singularly inept as it was in capitalising on the many bunglings of the BJP – be it its economic policies, issues of public health, its stand on China, the frittering away of social securities, civil liberties, its conflation of protest with anti-nationalism, the undermining of democratic institutions – the list is endless.  So, however much Sonia Gandhi cries out that “Indian democracy is being hollowed out”, it is about time the Grand Old Party preening on its past, got overhauled itself and came up with a counter-narrative acceptable to the people before the India that the world knew existed, pales into oblivion.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/main-article/congress-reform-or-perish-921467.html

Harshal Pradhan, a close aide of Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, on Sunday said that Matondkar will join the party in the CM's presence. Matondkar's name has been forwarded to Governor B S Koshyari by the Shiv Sena for nomination to the Legislative Council from the governor's quota. The names of 11 others have also been forwarded by the three-party Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for their nomination from the governor's quota. The governor is yet to approve the list of 12 names. Matondkar had unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Mumbai North constituency as a Congress candidate. However, she had later quit the party over the functioning of the Mumbai unit of the Congress. Recently, she had criticised actor Kangana Ranaut for comparing Mumbai with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and the nepotism issue.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/actor-urmila-matondkar-to-join-shiv-sena-on-december-1-921453.html

The accused, Sunil Anand, was arrested on Friday. He impersonated as one Rahul Sharma and forged documents to obtain the loans, they said. The matter came to light after owner of the house Rita Babbar lodged a police complaint against the accused. In her complaint, the woman alleged that in 2014, she had given her property at Surajmal Vihar in east Delhi to Sachin Sharma, his father Mange Ram Sharma and relative Rahul Sharma on rent. “After the rent agreement expired in 2016, both Rahul and Sachin entered into a lease deed with Babbar and continued to reside as tenants at the latter’s property,” Joint Commissioner of Police (Economic Offences Wing) O P Sharma said. In July 2016, the complainant's husband received a call from a finance firm informing them that Rahul had taken a loan worth Rs 2.25 crore against the security of their property and that he was untraceable. "Babbar also discovered later that besides the mentioned loan, Rahul, Sachin and Mange Ram in connivance with others also obtained a loan of Rs 2.19 crore and Rs 2.25 crore from a bank and a finance company, respectively against her property in March-April 2015," the officer said. During investigation, it was found that the three men had prepared forged documents of the property at Surajmal Vihar. They had also prepared a fake death certificate in the name of Babbar to procure the home loans, he added. According to police, Mange Ram died in 2015, while his son Sachin was arrested earlier this month in connection with the case. "During investigation, it emerged that Sunil Anand impersonated himself as Rahul Sharma, the younger son of deceased Mange Ram Sharma and obtained the loans,” Sharma added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/man-arrested-for-obtaining-home-loans-worth-rs-67-crore-with-fake-papers-921455.html

Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for reiterating that the new agri laws are beneficial for farmers, the Congress on Sunday said the insistence in support of the legislations shows that the government is "drunk with power" and is rigid even in reconsidering the laws. "For the prime minister to say that these three laws are absolutely right when lakhs and lakhs of farmers are sitting around Delhi agitating, demanding their withdrawal, shows that the Modi government is drunk with power and Prime Minister Modi does not care about the welfare of the farmers and farm labourers of India," Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dh-toon-pm-hails-farm-laws-as-thousands-of-farmers-continue-protest-921505.html

The parties had submitted the details to the Election Commission in a sealed cover and the poll body submitted it to the Supreme Court in February this year. Through an RTI, both the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and transparency activist Commodore Lokesh Batra (Retd) had separately received the list of 96 parties which received these electoral bonds.  An analysis by ADR showed that at least 42 registered unrecognised parties with less than 1% vote share had managed to encash donations received through electoral bonds.  Only one among unrecognised parties -- Gondwana Ganatantra Party -- was found to be eligible to collect donations through electoral bonds by getting more than 1% votes.Parties like Vijay Kanth-led MDMK, People's Party of India and Bharat Dalit Party managed to get donations through electoral bonds despite not winning more than 1% votes. This number could be much more as the ADR could not analyse the eligibility of 26 other unrecognised parties that redeemed electoral bonds, due to non-availability of their vote share details on the Election Commission website. It remains a question how these parties, which fail to meet the eligibility criteria, manage to redeem these bonds when it can be encashed only by depositing it in their designated bank account. This also indicates that there is no scrutiny or monitoring at any stage about the sale and management of  the bonds.  While the ADR report speaks about ineligible parties managing to get money through electoral bonds, the SBI that administers the "sale and management" of electoral bonds said in response to RTIs by Batra that it has no such information about ineligible parties cashing in on the bond scheme. A question was raised by Batra in his RTI filed in May this year about the "list of actions" taken by the SBI to tackle the issue of non-eligible parties redeeming electoral bonds. "No information as regards the information request is held by the Bank," the SBI said in its response dated June 24. It had then said that the SBI verifies the eligibility criteria from the Election Commission website and to ensure the proper control, it "centrally monitors the opening of Current Account of eligible political parties for redemption of electoral bonds." In response to another RTI query in October this year about the frequency with which the SBI monitors the eligibility of parties, the Bank said on November 24 that it verifies the criteria of parties before the start of each phase. While the ADR analysis points out that at least 42 parties were ineligible to redeem electoral bonds, the SBI said it has "no information as regards the information request is held by bank" on non-eligible parties despite a claim that it gleaned the EC website before sale of these bonds. Activists also point out that the EC website does not have all information as seen in the ADR report, which said it could not access details of 26 parties.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ineligible-parties-cornering-donations-through-electoral-bonds-due-to-lax-monitoring-rtis-report-921540.html

He was speaking to media persons on the sidelines of Congress workers’ convention at Basel Missionaries auditorium on Sunday. Shivakumar said that though he had not named anyone in particular, some leaders in BJP are already feeling guilty. “They just try hard to prove their innocence. As an Opposition party president, it is my sincere duty to react and inform people,” he stressed.  It is clear that Santhosh was not facing any financial crisis or any differences in the marital relationship. Thus it is obvious there are political reasons behind his alleged suicide attempt. So a detailed investigation should be conducted, he insisted. Shivakumar said he was aware of the ‘dealings’ in political circle involving Santhosh. “An in-depth investigation will reveal the reason behind Santhosh taking the extreme step,” he said. On BJP government’s decision to make ‘Love Jihad’ a punishable offence, he said that BJP should first collect information on how many siblings of its leaders, especially from the Centre, had married people of their choice. He added that India was a secular and democratic country and choosing a religion, caste, belief or a partner is left to an individual’s discretion. To a query on different factional feuds denting the Congress party’s image in the state, he rubbished the claim stating that Congress was now united.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/d-k-shivakumar-wants-thorough-investigation-into-n-r-santhoshs-suicide-bid-921569.html

Sources said that in the morning hours, a trail of smoke was seen above the LoC in Poonch that started from Shahpur area and ended at Saujiyan. “It is suspected that an aircraft flew over the LoC in the area and travelled around 3-5 kilometres,” they said. After the incident, the Indian Air Force was asked by the Army to ascertain the veracity of the possibility of an airspace violation, sources said. “As there was no movement of any aircraft from Indian side in the area today morning, it becomes evident that the suspected aircraft was from Pakistani side as a trail of smoke also moved towards Pakistan in the forward Kahota area of Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir,” they added. An official while terming the issue as a cause of concern said although confirmation from the IAF is awaited, “this clearly seems a case of movement of a Pakistani aircraft.” In the recent months, the movement of Pakistani drones along the LoC and International Border (IB) has become a cause of concern for Indian security agencies. “Pakistan is using drones to airdrop weapons along the LoC and the IB. The dropping of weapons through drones is a big challenge for security agencies as in hilly terrain drones just bypass the forces deployment,” the official said. However, he added, that violation of airspace by the Pakistani aircraft is a new challenge and needs a tough response from India.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pakistani-aircraft-believed-to-have-entered-indian-airspace-in-jammu-and-kashmir-921581.html

Modern flood management principles adopted by the Dutch nation are of great value to India besides the culture of fitness and passion for cycling are worth emulating, he said on the last day of his tenure in this country. “The pandemic has opened everyone’s eyes to the need to stay healthy and build immunity. Bicycles are cheap, efficient and environment friendly. Electric bikes of the kind popular in the Netherlands can transport people over long distances with little effort. If manufactured in India in large numbers, prices will also be reasonable,” Rajamony told PTI in an interview over telephone. He said that India has strong economic interests in the Netherlands in terms of trade and investment. In the financial year 2020-2021 (April-June), the Netherlands is the second largest investor into India at $1.085 billion, the senior diplomat said. In the ongoing fiscal (April-September 2020), the Netherlands was the third largest destination for Overseas Direct Investment (ODI) from India with investments estimated at $679.12 million, Rajamony said. The top two destinations were Singapore and the US. Rajamony, who superannuates on Monday after putting in over three decades as an Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officer, said that the relations between India and the Netherlands are at an all-time high and significant progress has been made during his tenure. “My tenure has been wonderful here. I have been touched by the affection I got from the Dutch people as well as those from India. We have achieved so much,” he said. Speaking about the role of the Indian diaspora in furthering the bilateral ties, Rajamony said that he would like the vibrant Indian diasporas in the Netherlands to be more actively involved in further strengthening Indo-Dutch relationship. “The strength of India is the strength of Indian diaspora too,” he said, citing the diverse and pluralistic nature of his home country. “I came here (the Netherlands) without too much expectation. The job of Ambassador here is a very unique kind of position,” Rajamony said, highlighting the presence of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the Permanent Court of Arbitration and the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in the Dutch nation. A career diplomat, Rajamony has been working as India's Ambassador to the Netherlands since June, 2017. He previously served at Hong Kong, Beijing, Geneva, Washington DC and Dubai among others. Rajamony also served as the chief of staff to External Affairs Minister and as Press Secretary to former President Pranab Mukherjee. He is also the Permanent Representative of India to the OPCW in The Hague as well as responsible for India's relations with the ICJ and the Permanent Court of Arbitration. Rajamony was a member of the Indian legal team which successfully presented India’s views before the ICJ during the Kulbhushan Jhadav case. Jadhav, a retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017. Weeks later, India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence. The ICJ, then, restrained Pakistan from executing him. Ambassador Rajamony also appeared before the ICJ on behalf of India in the matter of advisory opinion on the Chagos Peninsula. India has supported Mauritius over its claim on disputed Chagos islands, which is home to Diego Garcia -- the key military base of the UK and the US in the Indian Ocean. Asked about things that he may wish to bring to India from the Netherlands, he said the culture of bicycling and fitness is something very positive to emulate. “The separate cycle tracks and associated infrastructure is well planned. Flood management systems are very advanced in the Netherlands. I also captured this in my book ‘What we can learn from the Dutch: Rebuilding Kerala Post 2018 floods’,” Rajamony said. “Dutch are quite efficient and direct in their communication. They also enjoy their holidays which are something admirable, particularly when you have a hectic work schedule,” he said. To a question on some of the unfinished tasks, he said India and the Netherlands have two centres of excellence (CoE) in agriculture - one on vegetables in Baramati, Maharashtra and a recently inaugurated Centre of Excellence for vegetables and flowers at Wayanad, Kerala. “Under the Indo-Dutch Joint Action Plan, more centres of excellence are planned. I hope we can operationalise the remaining soon so that India can benefit from Dutch techniques and know-how,” Rajamony, who hails from Kerala, said. Dutch can also contribute towards development of India’s inland water navigation system, port infrastructure and logistics network, he added. In a rare gesture, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte recently wrote a personal letter thanking Rajamony for his contributions in strengthening the Indo-Dutch relations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/huge-potential-for-furthering-indo-dutch-economic-ties-india-s-envoy-venu-rajamony-921621.html

The letter also condemned the "repression" of protesting farmers by tear-gassing and water cannoning them in the bitter cold and accused the BJP-led Centre and state governments in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana of unleashing "unprecedented barbarism" on the peaceful farmers wanting to reach Delhi for the protest. The letter was signed by All India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA), National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW), All India Progressive Women's Association (AIPWA), Pragatisheel Mahila Sanghathan (PMS), All India Mahila Sanskritik Sanghatan (AIMSS) and All India Agragami Mahila Samiti (AIAMS). The organisations said women, even though not recognised as farmers, are equally engaged in agricultural operations and a large number of them still remain as “invisible contributors”. The role of women in the agricultural sector cannot be ignored as they comprise 33% of the agriculture labour force and 48% of the self-employed farmers, they said. "Farmers are reeling from persistent agrarian distress and the economic impact resulting from the unplanned and draconian measures taken by your government to deal with the pandemic. This has put agriculture dependent families under severe indebtedness and resulted in increased farmer suicides," the letter said. "Women farmers from the suicide affected families are in a totally vulnerable situation. Women are not the holders of land titles. Hence they receive no help from the governments to cope with the double calamity of indebtedness and suicide that hits them. The escalating price rise of essential commodities, unemployment and hunger is having serious consequences on the lives of women and vulnerable families," it said. The organisations pointed out that the ongoing protest against three controversial farm sector laws have a huge participation of women farmers. They said these laws will farmers and their families at the mercy of agri-businesses. "These laws will lead to the destitution of women farmers with no protection from the unsparing loot by the corporate lobby. These acts will lead to decreasing decentralised procurement by government and dismantling of the public distribution system...It is unfortunate that your government has chosen to disregard these just demands and push the farmers into further misery by passing the anti-farmer laws," it said. The organisations demanded stopping the repression of farmer’s "legitimate and peaceful protests" immediately, withdrawal of all cases imposed on the struggling farmers and leaders of the farmers’ organisations and repealing the three laws enacted during the pandemic. They also demanded that the government should fix and guarantee a minimum support price for all agricultural produce and ensure decentralised procurement by the government. It should not encourage contract farming, they added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/womens-organisations-come-out-in-support-of-farmers-protest-says-agri-laws-will-have-adverse-impact-on-women-921648.html

In identical letters to Chief Secretaries of all state governments, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla said that occurrence of various fire incidents in hospitals and nursing homes in recent past and non-adherence of fire safety measures by authorities in their respective jurisdiction were a "matter of concern". His letter came against the backdrop of deaths of six Covid-19 patients due to fire in the ICU of a Rajkot hospital and another eight patients in a hospital in Ahmedabad. "At such a crucial time, when the country is fighting against Covid-19 pandemic, utmost precaution needs to be taken to avoid such incidents in future," Bhalla wrote in his letter.  He reminded the states that the Directorate General (Fire Services, Civil Defence and Home Guards) in the Ministry of Home Affairs has been regularly issuing advisories to the states so that suitable directions may be issued to ensure compliance of fire safety guidelines and to ensure that proper fire safety measures are put in place. Bhalla said the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has also issued guidelines for hospital safety by laying down the provisions to establish the minimum requirement for a reasonable degree of safety from fire emergencies in healthcare facilities. "I would urge you to ensure compliance of above advisories and direct all concerned to immediately re-inspect/re-check all hospitals/nursing homes from the point of view of fire protection and means of escape to prevent recurrence of such fire incidents in future," he said. The states have also been asked to submit an Action Taken Report (ATR) with the MHA at the earliest.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ensure-fire-safety-measures-in-hospitals-mha-to-states-after-fire-in-gujarat-hospitals-921649.html

The Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Road Transport & Highways said that currently, "majority of countries are not interested to deal with China"; they are rather interested in India. He said such a situation is advantageous for the country's manufacturing sector to ramp up its capabilities to boost exports from India.  "I am confident that we will get a vaccine as early as possible and 100 per cent we will win this war against Covid-19 and also win economic war," Gadkari said this at a virtual event organised by Dun & Bradstreet. He said disbursement of loans to the tune of Rs 1.48 lakh crore has been completed so far, out of the Rs 3 lakh crore worth of collateral-free automatic loans for businesses announced by the Centre earlier. "We have already reduced our imports from China and already our (India's) exports are increasing. The trends are positive and I am expecting good results in this field," said the minister.  He said the MSMEs are doing an excellent job despite facing an economic crisis. Eligible borrowers for the scheme include MSME units, business enterprises, individual loans for business purposes and MUDRA borrowers. Talking about schemes for the MSME sector, he said, "We have sanctioned some 93 schemes and more than 100 schemes are in the pipeline. We want to clear them as early as possible." He said efforts are underway for reducing India's dependence on import of items such as crude oil. The minister said emerging areas where MSMEs can work include artificial intelligence, robotics, sustainability, green manufacturing, waste to wealth, development of smart villages, e-mobility, and virtual reality-based solutions. Gadkari said the MSME ministry is working on setting up a number of centers of excellence in collaboration with educational and research institutions like IITs and NIITs.  Pointing out that the current annual turnover of the khadi and village industries stands at Rs 80,000 crore, he said the plan is to increase this to Rs 5 lakh crore in two years. At a separate event, the minister said the whole world, including India, is facing the crisis of Covid-19 and the situation is challenging. "We need to create positivity and self-confidence in the mind of the people. Negativity and suspicion will create more complication," Gadkari said this at the Virtual Horasis Asia Meeting 2020. He also said that on the basis of the latest statistics, "we can say that we are coming to the normal situation". At the same time in the manufacturing sector also, particularly trade and business, a lot of opportunities are up, he said. Gadkari said that as compared to China, India has got the huge potential, as the young talented manpower is available in India. He added that there is the availability of raw material in India and policy is favourable. "I feel that it is an appropriate opportunity for the investor to invest in India," said. "Presently, we are facing some crisis due to Covid-19. But, 100 per cent, we are now on a proper track. The manufacturing sector is progressing. In the highway construction, we are on the same foot," the minister said. Horasis Chairman Frank Jurgen Richter said, "Asia as a region is making impressive progress in containing Covid-19, and at the same time is using the pandemic as a means for transformation — to make their respective economies more resilient and sustainable."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/we-will-get-coronavirus-vaccine-as-early-as-possible-nitin-gadkari-921653.html

The most important challenge faced by us in the region is terrorism, particularly cross-border terrorism. Terrorism is truly the enemy of humanity. It is a scourge we need to collectively combat,” Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu said, chairing the annual meeting of the SCO Council of Heads of Governments. New Delhi hosted the meeting, which was held virtually in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. India raised the level of participation in the conclave with Vice President leading the delegation. The Prime Ministers of six of the eight SCO nations – Russia, China, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan – took part in the meeting. Pakistan’s representation was at the lowest level with its Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Andeel Abbas, participating in the conclave, apparently to belittle the importance of the event hosted by India. “India condemns terrorism in all its manifestations We remain concerned about threats emerging from ungoverned spaces and are particularly concerned about (the) states that leverage terrorism as an instrument of state policy,” Naidu said, tacitly hitting out at Pakistan for exporting terrorism to India and other nations in the region and beyond. “Such an approach is entirely against the spirit and ideals and the Charter of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.” During the course of its chairmanship of the SCO Council of Heads of Government in 2020, India has particularly focused on creating three new pillars of cooperation: Startups and innovation, science and technology and traditional medicine and also proposed many other concrete initiatives. Vikas Swarup, Secretary (West) at the Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi, said that the SCO charter had provision allowing other member nations to go ahead and implement the initiatives launched and proposed by India, even if Pakistan decides to stay away.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/most-important-challenge-sco-members-face-is-cross-border-terrorism-india-921654.html

The Mamata Banerjee-led party, which has often been mocked by opponents for not having a well-defined ideological plank, seems to have finally found its calling in Bengali sub-nationalism, as a section of top party leaders feel only an "inclusive message of regionalism, which the Bengalis can identify with, will counter the aggressive nationalism and Hindutva practised by the saffron camp". "During the next assembly polls, apart from development, Bengali pride will be our main poll plank. Bengali pride is not just about Bengalis, it appeals to all sons of the soil. This philosophy will help counter BJP's attempts to import leaders from outside to control the people of the state," senior TMC leader and MP Sougata Roy told PTI. According to TMC sources, much like the regional parties of Tamil Nadu, which are proponents of Tamil pride, and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, which harps on Marathi 'Ashmita' (pride), the TMC plans to emerge as the protector of Bengali culture and identity. "The JD(U) in Bihar had talked about 'Bihari versus Bahari'. Even the BJP, which boasts of nationalism, had campaigned on the poll plank of Gujarati 'Ashmita' during the 2007 Gujarat elections. So if we do the same, we think no one should complain about it," another TMC leader said. A senior leader of the Mamata Banerjee-led party, who was a part of a select group of the members that formulated this ideological plank, said "divisive politics and religious polarisation could never be countered with development politics. Only sub-nationalism and regionalism can do that." Born in the womb of the Congress, the TMC, which rose to power after a long fight against the CPI(M)-led Left Front, had initially adopted the slogan of 'Maa Mati Manush' (Mother, Land and People), carefully blending socialism and secularism -- a powerful concoction that countered the communists and their doctrines well. The party tasted success in 2011 and continued its winning streak in 2016 assembly polls. The rise of the BJP in Bengal's political map, however, has made the TMC realise that its socialist slogan was not all enough to offset 'Hindutva', especially at a time when it has been branded as a party "that favours only minorities" by the saffron camp. According to TMC sources, after the electoral reverses in the Lok Sabha polls last year, and with the emergence of the BJP as a prime contender for power, the TMC initially tried to shed the 'anti-Hindu' tag and embrace 'soft Hindutva', but it soon realised that it could never beat the BJP in its own game. The party then took a cue from the results of the final phase of the Lok Sabha polls in Bengal, where the saffron party, which, despite its spectacular performance in the previous phases, drew a blank in all nine seats that went to polls towards the end. The TMC zoomed past the saffron party in the final phase with its fiery campaign over "insult to Bengali icons", following the desecration of social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's bust during a BJP rally. Although the BJP had denied the allegations, the damage was done. Then on, TMC supremo and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has often invoked Bengali sub-nationalism, and called the BJP a party of "outsiders". "Initially it was a half-hearted campaign, as we were worried about its impact on the Hindi-speaking population of the state. But later it was decided that Bengali sub- nationalism or Bengali pride would be our main ideological plank. Whether we win or lose, this will be our mainstay in days to come," the TMC leader, who played a key role in zeroing in on the idea, said. Citing Bengal's demographic map, where 70 per cent is Hindu population and 30 per cent Muslims, the TMC leader said, "The state consists of 86 per cent Bengalis, that's the antidote of BJP's politics. Bengalis are an independent-minded community since the days of British Raj. "Post-independence, too, be it the Congress or the communists, none of them ever accepted the supremacy of Delhi. Hindu-Muslim politics won't work here," he said. Over the last two weeks, the TMC haed been holding aggressive "insider versus outsider" campaigns to corner the BJP in various areas, and statements such as "Bengal will be turned into Gujarat" with the import of leaders from other states, has provided the much-needed ammo to even out the party's internal conflicts, which is now out in the open. Lack of a face to counter Banerjee and the BJP's "over-dependence" on central leadership has added to the benefits of the TMC. "People have to decide whether they want to be dominated by outsiders or handover the reins to a son of this soil. It is a decision which will impact our next generations," TMC minister Bratya Basu said. Political analyst Suman Bhattacharya feels that "Bengali pride" is a formidable weapon which will benefit any political party that nurtures the cause carefully. "Most of the political parties of the country have their origins in Bengal. But the issue of Bengali pride has never been taken up. Any political party who can properly nourish the cause will gain out of it," he said. Narratives themed around 'Bengali pride' and 'natives versus outsiders' are slowly gaining momentum, with various outfits raising the pitch for reservation for domicile Bengalis in jobs and education in the state, where, until a few years ago, cultural sub-nationalism was an alien concept. Organisations such as Bangla Pokkho, Jatiyo Bangla Sammelan and Bangla Sanskriti Mancha are making their presence felt in the state, where the BJP, according to them, are trying to "impose Hindi and "north Indian culture". "The people of the state should be made aware of the need to fight for the issue of Bengali pride. The BJP is the biggest threat to the Bengali culture. They believe in the domination of non-Bengalis over Bengalis," Kaushik Maiti, senior leader, Bangla Pokkho, said. The saffron party, on its part, said the TMC was making a "desperate attempt" to divide the majority community along ethnic lines and stave off an "imminent" defeat in the assembly elections. "The founding father of our party is Syama Prasad Mookherjee, a stalwart of Bengal. So how come we are a party of outsiders? Is Bengal out of India? These issues are nothing but a sign of TMC's desperation after sensing its defeat," BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said. The saffron party's national general secretary and Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya feels tha the TMC is more interested in welcoming infiltrators than people from other parts of the country. "Nowhere in the country, have we faced such a situation where people of this country are branded as outsiders. Here, infiltrators are welcomed with open arms and people of this nation are outsiders," he said. West Bengal Congress president Adhir Chowdhury slammed the TMC for fanning sub-nationalism and said the party was "dishing out one poison to kill another". Elections to the 294-member West Bengal Assembly are likely to be held in April-May next year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bengali-pride-to-be-tmcs-main-poll-plank-to-counter-bjps-aggressive-hindutva-921662.html

Across the world, people have expressed wonder at the way in which Indians, whether poor or rich, young or old, rural or urban, have shown the ability to be responsible, disciplined, focused, law-abiding, patient and composed during a crisis of unprecedented proportions, he said. "Some may call the year 2020 as a year of external disruptions due to the pandemic. But I firmly believe that 2020 will be known, not as a year of external disruption, but as a year of internal discovery, for our society and for our nation," Modi wrote in an exclusive article in the Manorama Yearbook 2021. "Adversity not only builds strength but also brings out our true innate character. This global pandemic has brought to the fore India's national character for the entire world to behold, as a resilient and united nation," the write-up titled "Atmanirbhar Bharat: Transforming India" said. Many Indian pharma companies are working to develop a vaccine against coronavirus. As on Monday, the number of Covid-19 cases in the country crossed 94 lakh and the recoveries' figure neared 88,50,000, according to Union health ministry data. The official toll in the morning stood at 1,37,139. In the article, Modi also said that in the face of trying circumstances, India has not only stayed firm but also helped the world. "India emerged as a pharmacy to the world, sending life-saving drugs and medicines far and wide, at the same time ensuring no shortage to our own people. "After the pandemic struck, in no time, our Covid warriors rose to the occasion and led India's fight from the front. Remarkable efforts on a war-footing made India self-sufficient in PPE production," the prime minister wrote. Countless unsung heroes, from ambulance drivers to pharmacists, from security personnel to small neighbourhood vendors, kept our lives going even during difficult circumstances, while carefully maintaining social distancing, wearing masks and adapting digital payments, he said. Modi asserted that a slew of reforms across various sectors are strengthening the country's development trajectory as against earlier reforms that used to be "hostage to political expediencies". Highlighting the significance of Atmanirbhar Bharat, he said it means an India which is more competitive, an India which is more productive and an India which celebrates local talent. "An Atmanirbhar Bharat will increase India's role in global supply chains by attracting more global businesses to India to take full advantage of India's policy stability, low taxes and skilled human resources," he said. Modi also wrote that the Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced the ability of technology to be a valuable bridge and from multi-nation summits to multi-national companies, everyone's work had to go online. He was of the view that in the coming year, there will be an even greater focus on self-reliance and resilience in technology. The yearbook is power-packed in 25 sections and has write-ups on post-Covid careers, the cost of Covid-19 on the Indian economy, work from home, Indo-Pak and Sino-India relations and attitude and aptitude among other topics, says chief editor Mammen Mathew. "Looking back at 2020 we can say that we have come through quarantines and lockdowns by maintaining social distancing, self-masking, sanitising, despite disruptions and confinements in our personal space," he writes in the editorial.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/for-india-2020-will-be-known-as-year-of-internal-discovery-pm-modi-921663.html

The national capital has already been witnessing a spike in Covid-19 cases post Diwali celebrations and amid rising pollution levels. Samiran Panda, who heads the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases (ECD) division of the ICMR, sought strict compliance to protective and preventive behaviour to curb the spread of the infection. "A protest is a mass gathering and thus from a public health perspective, I would suggest protective and preventive behaviours against the spread of coronavirus infection failing which a superspreading event might set in. "It is important to note that the SARS-CoV-2 is a transmission efficient virus and such gatherings are conducive for its spread," he stressed. K K Aggarwal, president of the Confederation of Medical Association of Asia and Oceania (CMAAO) and former IMA president, said the agitation should not have been allowed by the government. "Why for every such step we need a Supreme Court direction or intervention? The government has the powers under the Diseases Epidemic Act to take control of any situation which can spread the infection. “The Indian Penal Code section 270 also gives powers to the local police station to file cases if they feel any event can spread infection," he said. Aggarwal also noted that in a pandemic, politics should never get precedence. "The farmers' agitation will end up as superspreading events which will not only be a danger to Delhi but also to the whole country," he added. Any agitation or gathering may cause the spread of Covid-19 and thus gatherings should be avoided during this time and if it cannot be avoided at all, social distancing norms must be maintained, Sanjay Rai, professor in the Department of Community Medicine at AIIMS said. Such gatherings may hamper government efforts to control the transmission of Covid-19, he said. Delhi Police placed concrete barriers and enhanced security at the Ghazipur border with UP as the number of protesting farmers swelled there while thousands more remained at the Delhi-Haryana border for the fifth day Monday to protest against the Centre's agricultural reform laws. Security was stepped up after farmers threatened to block more highways connecting the national capital.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protest-at-delhi-borders-may-act-as-covid-19-superspreader-event-experts-921664.html

These teams were from Gennova Biopharmaceuticals Ltd, Pune; Biological E Ltd, Hyderabad; and Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd, Hyderabad. A statement from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said that Modi also asked the companies, represented by these teams, to come out with their suggestions and ideas regarding regulatory processes and related matters. "The PM advised all the departments concerned to engage with the manufacturers and seek to resolve matters so that the efforts by these companies bear fruit in order to serve the needs of the country and the entire world," it said. The prime minister appreciated the efforts being taken by scientists in these companies to come out with a vaccine solution to tackle Covid-19. The statement also said that the potential of various platforms for vaccine development was discussed. Matters relating to logistics, transport, cold chain etc. in respect of delivering the vaccines were also discussed, the PMO said. All the vaccine candidates discussed are at different stages of trials and detailed data and results are expected early next year onwards, it added. Gennova Biopharmaceuticals Ltd, Pune; Biological E Ltd, Hyderabad; and Dr Reddys Laboratories Ltd, Hyderabad, are involved in vaccine development along with their respective collaborators. In collaboration with HDT Biotech Corporation, USA, Gennova has developed an mRNA vaccine candidate (HGCO19), with demonstrated safety, immunogenicity, neutralisation antibody activity in the rodent and non-human primate models. Biological E Limited (BE), a vaccines and pharmaceutical company, had earlier this month initiated a Phase I/II clinical trial of its Covid-19 subunit vaccine candidate in India following approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI). The company is preparing the vaccine in collaboration with US-based Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Dynavax) and the Baylor College of Medicine. Dr Reddy’s, a leading pharmaceutical company, has partnered with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) to conduct clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Institute in Russia. Modi had on Saturday visited Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Pune to review the development and manufacturing process of coronavirus vaccines at facilities in these cities. The prime minister visited the Zydus Biotech Park in Ahmedabad, Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad and the Serum Institute of India in Pune. The PMO had said that the day-long visit was aimed at getting a first-hand perspective of the preparations, challenges and road map in India's endeavour to vaccinate its citizens. At the Zydus Cadila's manufacturing facility near Ahmedabad, he reviewed the vaccine development process at the company's research centre. Zydus Cadila has announced that the phase-I clinical trial of its vaccine candidate ZyCoV-D is over and it has commenced phase-II clinical trials from August. Modi also visited pharma major Bharat Biotech's vaccine manufacturing facility in Hyderabad and reviewed the progress of Covaxin, a vaccine candidate being developed by the company. Finally, he visited the Serum Institute of India, Pune and reviewed the progress of the 'Covishield' vaccine being made there. The total coronavirus cases in India have mounted to 94,31,691 with 38,772 new infections, while the death toll climbed to 1,37,139 after 443 more fatalities were reported, according to Health Ministry data.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-modi-holds-virtual-meet-with-teams-involved-in-developing-manufacturing-covid-vaccine-921673.html

Kumar, whose JD(U) is a constituent of the BJP-led NDA, also sought to clear misconceptions over the farm legislation that allows sale of produce outside APMC mandis (markets), and pointed towards the state's own experiment with the abolition of these. "The Centre has proposed to hold talks with the agitating farmers. Once they sit across the table, it will become clear that fears over MSP are unfounded," he told reporters here. The chief minister was speaking on the sidelines of programme organised for the inauguration of a 12.27 km-long elevated road that connects AIIMS, Patna to Digha locality, along the banks of the Ganges, which is expected to immensely facilitate travel between the city's southern and northern extremes. Kumar also said "as you all know, we had abolished these (APMC mandis) way back in 2006 and introduced a system for procurement through PACS (primary agriculture credit societies)". "Procurement in Bihar in fact picked up only after that. Earlier, that wasn't the case. I hope the Centre would explain to the farmers that procurement is not going to be hit and the system of MSPs won't get scrapped," said Kumar, who was the Union agriculture minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-should-tell-farmers-msps-procurement-wont-be-affected-nitish-kumar-921676.html

But the wife, for her part, denied it, saying she was fully dependent on her parents for living, though she was qualified to be an advocate.  The court pointed out the issue, whether the wife can be denied maintenance only on account of the fact that she is capable of earning has come before this court earlier too where it has been held that ‘capable of earning’ and ‘actual earning’ are two different requirements. "Merely because the wife is capable of earning was held not be a sufficient reason to reduce the maintenance awarded by the family court," the court said. The court declined to interfere with the trial court's order, saying his admitted salary of Rs1.68 lakh per month has to be divided into three equal shares, keeping two parts for the petitioner and one for the respondent. Therefore, the award of Rs 50,000 per month as interim maintenance to her was "completely justified". In the case, marriage was solemnised on September 15, 2018. The parties resided together at the matrimonial home at Bengaluru till about October 2018 when the wife left the matrimonial home. She sought Rs one lakh per month as maintenance. The man questioned the validity of maintenance order, saying the court has overlooked the fact that his wife is enrolled as an advocate and, therefore, must be earning respectably. He claimed when the wife is professionally qualified and capable of earning, then no maintenance ought to have been granted to her.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/wifes-capacity-to-earn-no-ground-to-deny-maintenance-delhi-high-court-921690.html

''Earlier the nature of the protests was different....they were against the decisions but now they are based on apprehensions, propaganda and misinformation,'' the prime minister said. S&P Global Ratings on Monday retained its forecast of 9 per cent contraction in the Indian economy for the current fiscal, saying there are now upside risks to growth, and it will wait for more signs that Covid infections have stabilised or fallen. S&P, in its report on the Asia Pacific, projected the Indian economy to grow at 10 per cent in the next fiscal. "We retain our growth forecast of negative 9 per cent in fiscal 2020-2021 and 10 per cent in fiscal 2021-2022. While there are now upside risks to growth due to a faster recovery in population mobility and household spending, the pandemic is not fully under control. Tamil Nadu, which faced Cyclone Nivar just last week, and Kerala are bracing for heavy rains over the next few days as a depression over the South-east Bay of Bengal is likely to intensify into a deep depression and later into a cyclonic storm. The depression lay centered about 710 km east-south-east of Trincomalee in Eastern Sri Lanka and 1,120 km east-south-east of Kanyakumari, the southernmost tip of the Indian mainland, at 8.30 am on Monday. Tamil Nadu received heavy to heavy rains last week under the influence of Cyclone Nivar, which made landfall between Marakanam and Puducherry. At least four people died in cyclone-related incidents. Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa’s political secretary NR Santhosh got discharged from the hospital Monday, denying that he had attempted suicide. Santhosh, 31, was hospitalized last Friday evening allegedly due to an overdose of sleeping pills.“Three days ago, there was a personal, family event. It was my cousin brother’s marriage. There, I suffered from food indigestion. I ended up taking a different medicine and due to an overdose, I got drowsy. My wife rushed me to the hospital. This was just a mistake,” Santhosh told reporters. Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Vice President Maryam Nawaz said on Monday that "puppet" Prime Minister Imran Khan should have "some courage" to question the country's top spy agency - Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) - as to why it is tapping his telephone calls. Her remarks came in response to Prime Minister Khan’s recent disclosure that he was aware that the agencies tap his phone calls.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-prime-minister-narendra-modi-once-again-defends-new-farm-laws-921697.html

The decision came close on the heels of the row over gold smuggling case accused and former employee of the UAE consulate Swapna Suresh being posted in the Kerala government's Space Park project in which PwC was project management unit. The government order barring PwC says that PwC did not perform a comprehensive background check including educational qualification of an individual appointed in the project management unit of Space Park, which was a serious breach of contractual obligation. Hence PwC has been barred from participating in projects under the Electronics and IT department for two years. The contract with PwC appointing the agency as a project management unit for Kerala Fibre Optic Network project, which is ending on November 30, would not be extended further, said the order. It was alleged that M Sivasankar, chief minister's principal secretary as well as Electronics and IT department secretary, facilitated the recruitment of Swapna Suresh even though she lacked even basic qualification.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kerala-it-dept-department-bars-pwc-from-participating-in-state-projects-for-two-years-921708.html

30-11-2020||National||BJP urges farmers not to have misconceptions about agri laws||With farmers, especially from Punjab, protesting against new Agri laws, the BJP on Monday urged them not to have 'misconceptions' about these reforms which, it asserted, have nothing to do with the mechanism of minimum support price (MSP) and 'mandi' that will continue along with the government's purchase of grains. The BJP also attacked Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party government for backing protests against the three farm laws, noting that it has already notified these Acts and begun implementing them. In a series of tweets in Hindi, BJP leader and Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad sought to refute criticism of these bills by some farmer bodies and opposition parties. "New agri laws do not end APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) mandis. Mandis will continue to operate as they have been. New laws have given farmers the freedom to sell their produce anywhere. Whoever gives farmers the best price will get to buy their produce be it inside the mandis or outside," he said. Many misconceptions like the farm bills are a conspiracy to not offer farmers MSP, are being spread, he said, adding that the reality is that these legislations have nothing to do with the minimum support price. "The MSP has been in force and will remain in force," he said. Big companies will not be able to exploit farmers following these laws, as farmers can walk out of contract anytime without paying any penalty, the Union minister asserted. Contracts under the new laws will in fact ensure that farmers get the assured price, he said. Another senior BJP leader and Union minister Prakash Javadekar said, "Don't have misconceptions about the farm laws. Farmers of Punjab have sold more paddy in mandi than they did last year and at a higher MSP. MSP is alive and so is mandi. And government purchase is also taking place." BJP leader Anurag Thakur said the Agri sector reforms are opening up new opportunities for farmers to increase their profitability and opportunities. Amit Malviya, who heads the party's IT wing, took a swipe at Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal over his party's opposition to these laws, accusing him of doing politics over the issue despite notifying these legislations that allow farmers to sell their produce outside mandis. "Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government has already notified the new Farm Laws on 23 Nov and had started implementing them. But now that the Khalistanis and Maoists have stepped in to oppose, he sees an opportunity to burn down Delhi. It was never about farmers. Just politics...," he said. The farmers are protesting against the three laws -- Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 -- that took effect from September 27 after President Ram Nath Kovind's assent. The farmers have expressed apprehension that the Centre's farm laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. The government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-urges-farmers-not-to-have-misconceptions-about-agri-laws-921727.html

The prime minister while addressing a public meeting in his Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi strongly defended the new farm laws and claimed that the farmers were being "misled" on these "historic" legislations". "'Pro-people'! We have heard you, PM Modi, saying demonetisation, GST, national lockdown are all 'pro-people'. Result: raging pandemic; economy destroyed; growing misery, unemployment, hunger, deprivation.... Do not destroy Indian agriculture and kisans. Withdraw Agri laws," Yechury said in a tweet.

Addressing a press conference at Singhu border, a representative of protesting farmers said that they will continue their agitation until their demands are met. "Our demands are non-negotiable," Jagmohan Singh, general secretary Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda), said and claimed the ruling party "will have to pay a heavy price" if it does not heed to their concerns. "We have come here to fight a decisive battle," Singh said. "We will remain at Delhi borders and make our strategy from here. We have come to Delhi to ask the prime minister to listen to 'mann ki baat' of farmers, else the government and the ruling party will have to pay a heavy price...," he said. BKU Haryana president Gurnam Singh Chaduni said that around 31 cases have so far been registered against protestors to "suppress" their agitation, adding that farmers will continue their stir until their demands are met. Former AAP leader Yogendra Yadav, who is also a member of Akhil Bhartiya Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti's national working group, alleged that five lies are being spread about the farmers' agitation including that only farmers from Punjab were protesting. Yadav, who is also Swaraj India chief, said that this "historic agitation" by farmers from various states will yield "historic results". Chaduni claimed that due to the Centre's new laws, agri business in the country will be monopolised by corporates. Union Home Minister Amit Shah had appealed to the farmers to shift to the Burari ground and had said the Centre was ready to hold discussions with them as soon as they move to the designated place. A meeting of over 30 farmer groups on Sunday rejected Shah’s offer for talks before the scheduled date of December 3 and demanded an unconditional dialogue. Thousands of protesters refused to budge and spent another night in the cold at the Singhu and Tikri border points. Their representatives had said that Shah’s condition that they shift the protest is not acceptable and claimed Burari ground is an "open jail".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/have-come-to-delhi-for-decisive-battle-say-farmer-leaders-protest-against-agri-laws-to-continue-921748.html

The 59-year-old Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Rana, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was re-arrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. US District Court Judge in Los Angeles Jacqueline Chelonian said in her order on November 13 that the extradition hearing in this case is scheduled for February 12, 2021, at 10:00 a.m. US attorney Nicola T Hanna in his submission before the court in Los Angeles in support of Rana’s extradition to India said that Rana, Headley, LeT members, and the other co-conspirators' plans came to fruition between November 26 and 29, 2008, when ten members of LeT carried out a series of twelve coordinated shooting and bombing attacks. Indian law enforcement apprehended one of the terrorists, who ultimately stood trial, Hanna said. Headley discussed the Mumbai attacks with Rana in the months following the attacks, he said. In December 2008, Headley shared what he had learned from their co-conspirators in Pakistan and told Rana about the different places that had been attacked, reminding him that Headley had made videos of those places. "Referring to a 1971 attack on his school in Pakistan, Headley told Rana, that he believed he was 'even with the Indians now'. In response, Rana said that they (the Indian people) deserved it. Also, in September 2009, the FBI intercepted Rana telling Headley that the nine LeT attackers who had been killed during the attacks should be given Pakistan’s highest military honour," Hanna said in his court papers. 'Rana also asked Headley to tell another co-conspirator in Pakistan – a member of LeT and one of the planners of the Mumbai attacks – that Rana thought that he should get a medal 'for top class'. When Rana learned that Headley already had conveyed this compliment to their co-conspirator, he was pleased," he wrote. The Mumbai bombings, however, did not end the conspiracy between Rana, Headley, LeT members, and the other co-conspirators. In particular, in 2009, Headley conducted surveillance activities for an intended, but ultimately foiled, terrorist plot in Denmark, again using Rana's business as a cover, Hanna said. Headley also conducted surveillance for potential future terrorist attacks in other parts of India. As he did with his surveillance in Mumbai, Headley kept Rana apprised of these surveillance activities. Starting 2009, Rana communicated directly with some of Headley’s contacts in Pakistan, he alleged. Headley was arrested on October 3, 2009, in Chicago. Six months later, Headley pleaded guilty to 12 charges relating to his activities on behalf of LeT and agreed to cooperate with the United States. The Illinois Court ultimately sentenced Headley to a 35-year term of imprisonment. Hanna told the court that Rana let Headley use his business as a cover to travel to India and conduct surveillance. Headley informed his co-conspirators in Pakistan including LeT members that Rana had agreed to use the Immigration Law Center as a cover for his activities. He also showed them the visa that he obtained with Rana’s assistance, the US attorney said. In September 2006, Headley travelled to India, using the opening and operation of Rana’s immigration business as cover for his travel and extended stay in Mumbai, the US attorney said. While in India, Headley conducted extensive video surveillance of various locations, including the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. Headley later travelled to Pakistan and met with LeT members and others, provided them the video recordings he had made, and discussed the video and surveillance he had conducted in India. At the directions of co-conspirators in Pakistan, Headley returned to Mumbai in February 2007 and conducted more surveillance of various locations, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/26/11-key-accused-tahawwur-rana-wanted-medal-for-mumbai-terror-attacks-921756.html

Pandemonium prevailed in the house earlier, during the debate on agriculture and flood relief to the farmers. Monday was the first day of the state legislature's winter session, at Amaravati. Opposition leader Naidu alleged that he was not being allowed to speak and was ridiculed by the YSRCP members. A visibly furious Naidu rushed towards the well and sat in protest, with his party colleagues joining, in front of the speaker's podium. He accused CM Jaganmohan Reddy of suppressing the opposition voice. “I was forced to approach the speaker's podium. In my long legislative career, this is the first time I am suspended from the house. Why am I not given the mike? Do we have to face such ignominy every day?” Naidu questioned while addressing the media later. The ex-CM accused that the Reddy government is casual about providing relief to the flood-affected ryots. “I am striving for the public and putting up with this daily humiliation for their sake. By suspending me they have boycotted the farmers, their welfare,” Naidu said. The ruling YSRCP stated the leader of the opposition's conduct in the state assembly as unacceptable, “especially from someone claiming to be the most experienced politician in the country.” CM Reddy stated his predecessor's behavior as unbecoming of a leader of the opposition. “I never disrespected the house in such a manner, when I was the opposition leader,’ the Chief Minister said. “Naidu rushed to the podium and staged a sit-in. During the discussion on agriculture as well, his body language has been highly objectionable and threatening in manner,” a YSRCP legislator said. House ethics committee chairman and YSRCP MLA Ambati Rambabu said that such conduct by a person with 40 years of experience in public life is highly objectionable.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ex-cm-chandrababu-12-tdp-mlas-suspended-from-andhra-pradesh-assembly-for-unruly-behavior-921769.html

Now we don't need to import from China," said the minister.  He observed that India was exporting a lot of items instead of importing them.  "So I don't want to talk anything much about China and other things because every country has their own policies, but as far as Indian policies are concerned, the way in which we are accepting technology, reducing cost and making good quality (products), our strength is the young talented manpower which is available in India," he said.  The minister said at the same time, our IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology), engineering colleges and research centres are doing a lot of innovation, expressing confidence that this will help India fulfil the requirement of the whole world.  The Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Road Transport & Highways said that currently, the majority of countries are not interested to deal with China; they are rather interested in India. He said such a situation is advantageous for the country's manufacturing sector to ramp up its capabilities to boost exports from India.  "We have already reduced our imports from China and already our (India's) exports are increasing. The trends are positive and I am expecting good results in this field," said the minister. He said the MSMEs are doing an excellent job despite facing an economic crisis. Gadkari expressed confidence that India will get a Covid-19 vaccine "as early as possible" and overcome the pandemic to win the economic war.  "I am confident that we will get a vaccine as early as possible and 100 per cent we will win this war against Covid-19 and also win economic war," Gadkari said at a virtual event organised by Dun & Bradstreet. He said disbursement of loans to the tune of Rs 1.48 lakh crore has been completed so far, out of the Rs 3 lakh crore worth of collateral-free automatic loans for businesses announced by the Centre earlier. Eligible borrowers for the scheme include MSME units, business enterprises, individual loans for business purposes and MUDRA borrowers. Talking about schemes for the MSME sector, he said, "We have sanctioned some 93 schemes and more than 100 schemes are in the pipeline. We want to clear them as early as possible." He said efforts are underway for reducing India's dependence on import of items such as crude oil. The minister said emerging areas where MSMEs can work include artificial intelligence, robotics, sustainability, green manufacturing, waste to wealth, development of smart villages, e-mobility, and virtual reality-based solutions. Gadkari said the MSME ministry is working on setting up a number of centres of excellence in collaboration with educational and research institutions like IITs and NIITs. Pointing out that the current annual turnover of the khadi and village industries stands at Rs 80,000 crore, he said the plan is to increase this to Rs 5 lakh crore in two years. At a separate event, the minister said the whole world, including India, is facing the crisis of Covid-19 and the situation is challenging. "We need to create positivity and self-confidence in the mind of the people. Negativity and suspicion will create more complication," Gadkari said this at the Virtual Horasis Asia Meeting 2020. He also said that on the basis of the latest statistics, "we can say that we are coming to the normal situation". At the same time in the manufacturing sector also, particulary trade and business, a lot of opportunities are up, he said. Gadkari said that as compared to China, India has got the huge potential, as the young talented manpower is available in India. He added that there is availability of raw material in India and policy is favourable. "I feel that it is appropriate opportunity for the investor to invest in India," said. "Presently, we are facing some crisis due to Covid-19. But, 100 per cent, we are now on a proper track. The manufacturing sector is progressing. In the highway construction, we are on the same foot," the minister said. Horasis Chairman Frank Jurgen Richter said, "Asia as a region is making impressive progress in containing Covid-19, and at the same time is using the pandemic as a means for transformation — to make their respective economies more resilient and sustainable."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-does-not-need-to-import-from-china-nitin-gadkari-921780.html

N V Suresh Babu, Director Operations, CSL, Commodore Ishan Tandon, Director Carrier Acceptance Trial Team (CATT), Commodore Sameer Aggarwal, Chief Staff Officer (Technical) of Southern Naval Command, Commodore Cyril Thomas, Warship Production Superintendent (WPS) and Commodore Vivek Dahiya, Commanding Officer (Designated) were present. The IAC project is also a true example of Atmanirbhar Bharat with close to 75 per cent of the material and equipment onboard the IAC being indigenous, the statement said. Further, over 50 Indian manufacturers have been directly involved in this project which has provided significant employment opportunities for Indian citizens. Close to 2000 Indians received direct employment onboard IAC on a daily basis and over 40,000 received indirect employment. In addition, about 80-85 per cent of the project cost of approximately Rs 20,000 Crore has been ploughed back into the Indian Economy, according to the statement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/basin-trials-of-indigenous-aircraft-carrier-successfully-conducted-at-csl-921787.html

The CPI MP said the first such action was taken by the Prasar Bharati in 2017 when 769 TV stations were closed down, and now radio stations are being similarly targeted. "The All India Radio currently has 8 stations and 10 services in Kerala that provide a varied array of programmes from news to entertainment to the people, both in India and abroad. However, the Government now claims that it is no longer economical to run these operations. It is of the opinion that these means are substitutable by the information dispensation through internet websites," he said in the letter. It is "misinformed opinion" that everyone can access internet services efficiently at any time of the day, he said adding that access varies with respect to financial, social and geographical context. This will leave a large number of of people deprived of information and knowledge on regional affairs and cultures. The AIR services in Kerala are the most recent to be effected, he said demanding Javadekar's immediate intervention to reverse the Prasar Bharati's move. He said a meeting of Prasar Bharati held on November 18 decided that programmes originating from Kerala will be "drastically curtailed" to limit only two or three state level channels, with the rest merely being reduced to depend on these few programs in a contributory role. "It is a globally accepted principle that the role of radio stations is to function as the voice of the people of the area, covering the entire social spectrum and work as a catalyst for social development through its informational, educational and entertainment programmes. But this new move by Prasar Bharati is against this principle and its very motto of public service broadcasting," he said. "This will lead to a complete denial of opportunities for common people as well as artists of all sorts of the area to participate in various programmes and it may ultimately result in the closure of these stations," he added. Vishwam demanded that action should be initiated to protect and strengthen the identity of the AIR stations as the voice of the respective zones by providing adequate infrastructure and staff and replacing obsolete technology with new one.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/prasar-bharti-making-efforts-to-shut-all-india-radio-govt-funded-tv-channels-cpi-mp-to-ib-minister-921788.html

The standard operating procedures for markets issued by the Union Health Ministry on Monday to contain the spread of coronavirus infection stated that online booking of groceries and doorstep delivery of those must be encouraged while incentives or discounts for those who shop during non-peak hours may be considered. The SOPs outlined that market places in containment zones shall remain closed. Shop owners and employees living in containment zones shall not be allowed entry into marketplaces, it stated. According to the SOPs, Covid-appropriate behaviour in marketplaces may be regulated by market associations through a number of measures, including creation of a sub-committee for each market to facilitate and monitor implementation of such behaviour in marketplaces. It also suggested setting up mask dispensing kiosks at government-approved rates at entry points of markets and parking lots, establishing hand washing stations in public utility areas while recommending the use of foot-operated taps and contactless soap dispensers. It also sought for providing mass thermal screening provisions at the entry and access points to the market, procuring thermal guns, sanitizers, disinfectants for sanitization of public utility areas and placement of IEC materials and signages regarding Covid appropriate behaviour in prominent locations. "Where self-regulatory approach fails or lacks impact, the planning shall also entail taking enforcement actions, wherever warranted. This may include levying of fines/penalties on defaulters for not wearing mask/face cover, or for not following physical distancing norms. "Exploring the option of allowing markets/shops to open on alternate days and closure of markets in case larger number of cases are getting reported which are found to be having epidemiological links with the market by the administration," the SOPs stated. The ministry said market places are visited by a large number of people. With gradual opening of economic activities, markets are witnessing high footfalls, it said. "Such large gatherings, without observance of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, have the potential to spread coronavirus infection," the SOP document stated. It also suggested strategies that can be worked out by the law enforcing agencies in collaboration with market associations to manage crowd such as engaging civil defence volunteers, home guards and volunteers to regulate crowd, accessing control at parking lots for limiting vehicle entry and exploring staggered time of shops and utilities, thereby allowing them to remain open for longer duration. "Crowd density does not remain the same throughout. It usually peaks during evening hours on weekdays. On weekends and holidays, marketplaces are crowded for most of the day till late in the evening. Planning should specifically factor-in requirement for these peak days/hours," the document noted. According to the guidelines, at the entry point of shops, all employees and visitors should undergo mandatory hand hygiene and thermal screening and only asymptomatic employees and visitors shall be allowed inside shops while a face-cover or mask has to be worn at all times inside and outside shops. To prevent the risk of transmission of coronavirus, it is crucial that a healthy environment is maintained at marketplaces, the SOPs said and recommended sanitization by shop owners prior to the resumption of daily activities. Market associations shall facilitate maintaining a healthy environment of public utility areas and open spaces through their own means and through local urban bodies and civic agencies.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-fines-for-not-wearing-masks-discounts-for-shopping-during-lean-hours-among-sops-for-markets-921789.html

The panel’s report comes at a time when one of the country’s leading vaccine manufacturers, Serum Institute of India, demanded Rs 100 crore in damages from a 40-year-old vaccine recipient who had developed serious neurological conditions after receiving the vaccine and sought Rs 5 crore compensation from the firm. While the company’s move came under criticism from several quarters, India’s drug regulator the Drugs Controller General of India remained silent even after six weeks of the reporting of the serious adverse effect. Though unrelated to the present controversy, the Parliamentary panel’s report underscored the importance of following high ethical standards in vaccine research. “The Committee understands the urgency among the global scientific community for development of a vaccine against Covid-19. However, the Committee strongly emphasizes the need to ensure the highest level of ethical and procedural standards in the vaccine research studies. The vaccine should pass the strictly regulated route of all phases of clinical trials and the data should be made available in the public domain,” the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare said in its report on the Covid-19 outbreak. The lawmakers asked the Union Health Ministry to follow a transparent approach so that any irregularity in the approval or production process of the vaccine could be avoided. Meanwhile, a patients' rights organisation on Monday asked the DCGI to explain why it did not halt the Serum Institute’s trial of Covid-19 vaccine or release the probe findings. “We are shocked at this blatant attempt at intimidation of a clinical trial participant by the SII, which is attempting to divert public scrutiny of its trial. Bear in mind that in SII’s Phase 2/3 trial, safety is one of the primary endpoints in addition to immunogenicity. The company’s attempt to threaten a trial participant in this manner is unacceptable,” said All India Drug Action Network in a statement. “An ICMR official has gone on record to say that a decision on the serious adverse effect from DCGI is awaited. Given that the adverse effect took place in October, it is of serious concern that DCGI did not pause the trial to investigate the incident when it was reported. The silence from the DCGI which granted permission for the trial is deafening.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ensure-highest-level-of-ethical-standards-in-covid-19-vaccine-trial-parliamentary-panel-921802.html
30-11-2020||National||Punjab CM asks Modi govt to listen to farmers, terms their fight 'just'||Terming their fight against farm laws "just", Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday asked the Centre why it was not listening to farmers and was being adamant on the issue. He asserted that his government would stand firmly with farmers in their fight against the black laws. "It is the job of the government to listen to its people. If farmers are joining the agitation from so many states, then they must be really upset," said the Chief Minister while interacting informally with the media during his visit to historic towns of Sultanpur Lodhi and Dera Baba Nanak.  On Prime Minister Narendra Modi's stand that the new laws were beneficial to farmers, the Chief Minister said Modi had been maintaining this since the beginning and it was the reason why Punjab came out with its own bills.  He questioned the governor's decision to "sit" on those bills instead of forwarding them to the president and pointed out that he had done this even last year on a bill related to the CM's advisors. Underscoring out that MSP and arhtiya system was the "backbone of Punjab's successful agricultural model, with the farmers and arhtiyas sharing a very close bond", the Chief Minister questioned the need to change the established system. "Will the corporates, who will take the place of the arhtiyas, ever care to help the farmers in times of crisis," he asked. Singh said that Guru Sahib had attached great significance to the small farmers, who constitute the bulk of Punjab's farming community, with 75 per cent of them holding less than five acres of land.  "It is these very farmers who would be ruined by the black agricultural laws enacted by the Union Government," he said, adding that it was against these legislations that the farmers were currently protesting at Delhi borders, braving the harsh winter cold, the Covid-19 threat and the brutality of the Haryana police. On the Kartarpur Corridor, the Chief Minister said it was time for the Centre to open it since even Pakistan had done so. "I don't know why the central government is not opening it," he added. Citing the emerging challenges of internal and external aggression, Singh underlined the need for unity to counter the forces trying to divide the nation on communal lines.  The great Guru Nanak Dev had promoted the ideology of oneness of all humans, rising above petty caste and religious considerations, he said, highlighting the relevance of this message in the current times. The Chief Minister visited the two towns to mark the culmination of 550th birth anniversary celebrations and the 551st Prakash Parv of the 1st Sikh Guru.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/punjab-cm-asks-modi-govt-to-listen-to-farmers-terms-their-fight-just-921818.html

It said that the Covid-19 pandemic has brought the health care expenditure particularly the public expenditure at the centre stage due to its unprecedented impact on life and livelihood across the globe and added that the International Monetary Fund has asked all advanced countries to make healthcare a policy priority. The agency said health care should be both near-term and long-term priorities, as the country's total health expenditure of 3.8 per cent of GDP in FY17 is much lower than both advanced economies and peer emerging economies like Brazil, China, Russia, Argentina and South Africa. Even though both the Centre and state governments spend on healthcare, the agency said the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution puts the primary onus of health care delivery on state governments, resulting in 70 per cent of the overall spends being done by states. Delhi, North Eastern States excluding Assam, Himachal Pradesh, followed by Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Assam and Uttarakhand have a high per capita government expenditure on health, while Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra having a low per capita government expenditure on health, it said. Assam and Delhi have achieved National Health Policy 2017's goal of devoting 8 per cent of revenue expenditure to healthcare, but have different performance on COVID deaths. As against India's average of 1 death per 10,000 population, Delhi's ratio was 4.7 deaths for 10,000 population while the same for Assam was 0.3 deaths for the same number of people, it said. Similarly, Maharashtra has a higher number of doctors per 10,000 population at 14.1 as against a national average of 8.9, but has a higher death rate of 3.8 per 10,000 population, data collated by the agency said. A significant part of the health care cost in India has to be borne by non-governmental entities, of which out of pocket expenses of households (including medical insurance) accounted for 2.2 per cent of the GDP and the remaining 0.4 per cent was accounted for by non-governmental organisations/ external donor/local bodies, it said, citing official data of FY17.   The share of government in the current expenditure on health in India is only 27.1 per cent and a large share of 62.4 per cent is borne by households, it said. “It is a well-known fact that such a high share of out of pocket expenses imposes a financial hardship on household budgets and more than often pushes vulnerable households in to debt and poverty,” it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/no-direct-correlation-between-health-expenditure-and-covid-19-outcomes-report-921822.html
30-11-2020||National||Farmers continue to converge on Delhi borders to join protest against farm laws||More protesters converged near the borders of the national capital as the stir by farmers against the agri laws appeared to intensify, prompting the Delhi Police to enhance security and place concrete barriers at all entry points from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The farmers, who had on Sunday announced that they would blockade five points of entry into Delhi in coming days while rejecting the Centre's offer to hold talks once they move to the Burari ground, said they have come for a decisive battle and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to listen to their "mann ki baat". Peaceful protests were underway at both the Singhu and Tikri borders, where farmers had gathered from Punjab and Haryana, for the fifth day. The numbers of farmers at the Ghazipur border swelled, with more joining them from Uttar Pradesh. Long queues of vehicles choked the roads in parts of the national capital on Monday as the Delhi Police kept the Singhu and Tikri borders closed and heightened checking at other places in the wake of the ongoing protests by farmers. The closure of borders has also resulted in heavy traffic on other alternative routes between Delhi and Haryana. Addressing a press conference at Singhu border, a representative of protesting farmers said that they will continue their agitation until their demands are met. "Our demands are non-negotiable," Jagmohan Singh, general secretary Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda) said. "We have come here to fight a decisive battle," Singh said. "We will remain at Delhi borders and make our strategy from here. We have come to Delhi to ask the prime minister to listen to 'mann ki baat' of farmers, else it will have to pay a heavy price," he said. As the protests continued, Delhi Police said that it has enhanced deployment of security personnel, and multi-layer barricading is in place following the farmers' call to block all five border points. "Delhi Police has strengthened its presence at various border points in the wake of farmers protest. All internal (Delhi Police) and outside (paramilitary) forces have been mobilised to the maximum," a senior police officer said. He said that concrete barriers have also been placed to prevent the farmers from entering the national capital. In the evening, Delhi Police Commissioner SN Shrivastava also visited Singhu border to take stock of the security arrangements. Talking to reporters, he said arrangements are better at the Burari ground than the existing protest site (Singhu Border). Meanwhile, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also appealed to the people of the city to extend all possible help to the farmers and urged the Centre to hold talks with them at the earliest. The chief minister wished everyone on the occasion of Gurupurab in a video message. "On this occasion, I appeal to all Delhiites to do whatever they can for the protesting farmers in all possible ways," he said. Experts have warned the ongoing agitation could well be a Covid-19 superspreader but protestors, some in masks and many without them, said the new farm laws pose a greater threat to their survival. "A protest is a mass gathering and thus from a public health perspective, I would urge protective and preventive behaviour against the spread of coronavirus infection, failing which a super spreading event might set in,” cautioned Dr Samiran Panda, head of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases division at the Indian Council of Medical Research. Many of the farmers said they are aware the infection is still raging but the Centre’s new farm laws are a bigger threat. Gurmeet Singh from Faridkot in Punjab, for instance, has been at the Burari ground, one of the largest in the city, for three days and counting. And he has no intention of moving. "We may even survive corona, but how will we survive this cruel law that will take away our bread and butter," he said. Many protesters said that they have come prepared for a long haul with rations and other necessities. Sukhwinder Singh, who has been agitating at the Tikri border for the fifth consecutive day, said farmers don't want to go to Burari ground --- the designated protest site identified for the demonstration. "We have enough ration to sustain for at least six months. We do not wish to go to Burari. If we proceed from here, we will only go to Jantar Mantar. We will not protest anywhere else," Singh said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-continue-to-converge-on-delhi-borders-to-join-protest-against-farm-laws-921832.html

The farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders since five days against the new farm laws and have said they will not accept any conditional dialogue and threatened to block all five entry points to the national capital. "Our farmers are being treated as terrorists and attacked on Delhi borders while terrorists are killing our soldiers on the border in Kashmir," an editorial in Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana said. "BJP wants to create anarchy. Khalistan is a closed chapter for which Indira Gandhi and General Arunkumar Vaidya laid down their lives," it said. "The government is using all its might to crush political opponents but why is this determination not seen while dealing with the country's enemies," it asked. In the last one month, 11 soldiers from Maharashtra attained martyrdom while fighting enemies on the borders, the Sena said. Referring to the giant statue of Sardar Patel "erected by PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah" in Gujarat, the editorial said Patel was also a leader of farmers and led many farmers' agitation against the British. "His statue's eyes must be moist now seeing how farmers are being treated," it said. Central agencies like ED and CBI are being used as weapons against political opponents, the Sena said. "These agencies should also get a chance to display their valour," it said and suggested that (personnel of) ED and CBI should be deployed in Ladakhand Kashmir to help the Army fight India's enemies.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/using-water-cannons-on-farmers-amid-cold-wave-cruel-shiv-sena-921600.html

As farmers' protest entered the fifth day, Rahul Gandhi launched an online ‘SpeakUpForFarmers’ campaign, and urged Congress workers to stand in solidarity with the farmers in their “battle for truth”. “Patriotism is protecting the country’s strength. The country’s strength is farmers. The question arises is why are farmers on the road and why are they coming on foot from so far. Narendra Modi says these laws are in the interest of farmers. If these laws are in their interest, then why are they angry? These laws are for 2-3 friends of Narendra Modi,” the former Congress President said. “These laws have been made to loot farmers. That is why we have to stand up with them. Congress workers should come out and help these farmers and provide them food and stand by them,” he said. AICC General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra slammed the Modi government for enacting farm sector laws without consulting them. “How can farm sector laws be passed without speaking to farmers? How can farmers' interests be overlooked,” Priyanka said. Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Ahir Ranjan Chowdhury shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to grant a special loan package for the agriculture sector. Farmers have been protesting at various places in Delhi and Haryana and have rejected the Central government's offer to hold talks on December 3 saying that imposing conditions for starting a dialogue is an insult to them. Around 32 farmer organisations, mostly from Punjab, and a few farmers from Gujarat and Maharashtra as well managed to reach Delhi on Friday and assembled at the border areas to continue their protest. The farmers are protesting against The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/farm-laws-have-been-made-to-loot-farmers-congress-921680.html

Modi referred to the return of a statue of Goddess Annapurna from Canada, a century after it was said to have been stolen from here. "Today is a special occasion for Kashi,” he said, in his second address during a visit to his Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi. “The ancient idols of our gods and goddess are symbols of our faith and also invaluable heritage,” he said, adding that had similar efforts been made earlier, the country could have got much more of its heritage back. “For us, legacy ('viraasat') means the country's heritage ('desh ki dharohar'). But for some people, legacy means their family and the name of their family. For us, legacy means our culture, our faith, our values. For them, legacy means their own statues and the photographs of their family," he said, without naming any party. He was speaking at Varanasi’s Dev Deepawali festival when the banks of the Ganga were illuminated with rows of lamps. Earlier in the day, he dedicated to the nation the six-laning of the highway to Allahabad and offered prayers at the Kashi Vishwanath temple. "Today when the heritage of Kashi is returning, it seems that Kashi has decked up for the coming of Mata Annapurna,” the prime minister said, calling the spectacle of illuminated ghats 'alaukik' or divine. He paid tributes to fallen soldiers, indirectly referring to Pakistan and “expansionist” China. "Be it attempts to infiltrate across the border, the audacity of the expansionist forces or those hatching a conspiracy to break the country from inside, India is replying, and is giving a befitting reply," he said. He reiterated his call of 'Vocal for Local', saying the manner in which people celebrated Diwali this time, using local products, was inspiring. But this must not remain confined to festivals and should become a part of everyone lives, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/pm-modi-takes-dig-at-political-dynasties-says-for-some-heritage-means-familys-name-921778.html
30-11-2020||National Politics||Bengal BJP leaders not familiar with state's culture, mouthing 'Gabbar Singh-type' dialogues: TMC||The Trinamool Congress on Monday alleged that majority of the BJP leaders of West Bengal are not conversant with the cultural heritage of the state and are uttering dialogues akin to those of Gabbar Singh, the villain of 1975 Hindi film 'Sholay', to the chagrin of people. These leaders have no idea about the lyricists and singers who enriched Bengali culture, and the love for the state they are professing ahead of the assembly election is not real, Minister of State for Information and Cultural Affairs Indranil Sen claimed in a press conference here. The assembly poll is due in the state in April-May next year. "On the birth anniversary of singing icon Manna Dey, a prominent BJP leader tweeted a song of Kishore Kumar to show his respect," Sen, who himself is an acclaimed singer, alleged without naming anyone. "The same leader posted a song of Md Rafi on the birth anniversary of Kishore Kumar, stating that he grew up listening to this Kishore Kumar song. Such is their level of knowledge about the works of the pride of Bengal," he said. Such BJP leaders, who are mouthing dialogues like those of Gabbar Singh in various areas, are instigating fights between brothers", Sen alleged but did not elaborate. "People of Bengal may enjoy films filled with action and goondagiri. They may clap after hearing Gabbar Singh-type dialogues in jatra (folk theatres) and films. But in real life, they will never accept those elements who utter such words," he said. That these BJP leaders are divorced from Bengal's culture was proved from the fact that none of them took part in the last journey of legendary actor Soumitra Chatterjee on November 15, though "I have information that some of them were present at a party meeting at Jadavpur (in south Kolkata) around the same time on that day," Sen said. Prominent leaders of the Trinamool Congress and the CPI(M) seen walking in a procession following a hearse carrying the mortal remains of Chatterjee from the Rabindra Sadan, a government auditorium, to Keoratala crematorium here. Several BJP leaders had, however, put wreaths on the actor's body at Rabindra Sadan where it was kept for the public to pay their tributes. Sen said that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was in touch with Chatterjee's family since he was hospitalised on October 6 as she, "rising above ideological differences", believed in giving due respect and recognition to those who made the state proud. Chatterjee was a staunch Leftist. On the development programmes of the TMC government, Sen said that from Tuesday to January 28, 2021, the administration will reach out to people living in 344 blocks as part of the "Duare Duare Paschimbabga Sarkar" (West Bengal government at every doorstep) initiative. Banerjee on November 23 announced this scheme for redressing grievances of people at the block level. Also from December one, all people of the state would come under the Swasthya Sathi, the state governments health insurance scheme "which is unique and unprecedented in the entire country", the minister said. "Since 2011, our honourable CM has introduced several such social welfare schemes. The Centre and many other states later came out with similar projects, either imitating the original one or inspired by it," he claimed. The TMC does not create division between Bengali and Non-Bengali population and believes in inclusiveness, Sen said and named several luminaries who hailed from outside the state but made Bengal their homes and got thousands of followers. He said that 1.94 lakh folk artists are getting monthly financial assistance from the state. To a question, he said that the chief minister will decide whether she will attend a virtual meeting convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 4 to discuss Covid situation. Claiming that the PM did not discuss with Lok Sabha member or chief ministers before announcing the lockdown, he said, "We think such meetings are nothing but eyewash." Asked to comment on disgruntled TMP MLA Suvendu Adhikari, who recently resigned as minister, stating at a public meeting on Sunday that "people are the last word," Sen said, "He is right. That is why 10 crore people of the state are with our leader Mamata Banerjee." Sen said that fund allocation for cultural projects was Rs 61 crore before the TMC came to power in 2011 in the state and it has been increased to Rs 631 crore now. Ten new academies have also been set up by the TMC government for the promotion of various cultural forms, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bengal-bjp-leaders-not-familiar-with-states-culture-mouthing-gabbar-singh-type-dialogues-tmc-921799.html

The chief minister also directed officials to establish a 100-bed hospital and a trauma centre near the Yamuna Expressway at Jewar in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Adityanath virtually joined the ceremony for the ambitious data centre project from the state capital along with Cabinet Minister Satish Mahana, among others. The state government had on October 24 given its approval to the data centre which will be set up by Mumbai-based real estate group Hiranandani on a 20-acre plot and would cost approximately Rs 600 crore, according to officials. In the absence of adequate data centres, data is largely stored in locations outside the country but with this data park it will now be safely kept within the state, the officials added. "A 100-bed hospital and trauma centre should be built near Yamuna Expressway: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath," his office tweeted. Responding to the development, Greater Noida-Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh said the setting up of a hospital in the region would benefit the local residents. "This is a unique gift from the chief minister to the Jewar assembly constituency. The hospital will give relief to local residents from the arbitrary and costly treatments given by private facilities," Singh tweeted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-cm-yogi-adityanath-lays-foundation-stone-for-data-centre-in-greater-noida-orders-setting-up-of-hospital-near-jewar-921451.html

Earlier, the wife of the journalist, who was charred to death along with his friend in a fire that broke out in his house in Balrampur district, threatened to immolate herself on Sunday if police failed to arrest the accused. Vibha Singh, wife of the deceased journalist, on Sunday told reporters that if the police are unable to arrest the accused persons responsible for the death of her husband, she will immolate herself along with her children. She also said police had assured her that the case will be resolved in a couple of days, but it has not happened. Rakesh Singh, 35, working for a local newspaper, and his friend Pintu Sahu, 32, suffered serious burns in the fire at the house in Kalwari village, Balrampur Superintendent of Police Dev Ranjan Verma had said on Saturday. While Sahu died on the spot, Singh suffered 90 per cent burns and was referred to a Lucknow hospital where he succumbed to the injuries, the SP said. The father of the deceased journalist, Munna Singh, has demanded a probe suspecting that his son was murdered. According to the police, Rakesh Singh's wife and children had gone to a relative's house two days ago following some dispute between the couple. On Friday night, there was an explosion in the house after which one of the walls collapsed and one of the rooms caught fire, police said. The SP said investigations are on and two people have been detained for questioning.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-govt-hands-over-rs-5-lakh-cheque-to-wife-of-deceased-journalist-921483.html

30-11-2020||North and Central||Farmers' protest enters 5th day: Key things to know||Two months after the Parliament passed the new Farm Laws, farmers from Punjab and Haryana decided to go to take seige of the national capital Delhi ('Delhi Chalo') to protest against the laws. Farmers have been protesting since the laws were being discussed in the Parliament but now decided to step up the attack against the Centre by protesting in Delhi. Several political leaders and parties including Punjab CM Amarinder Singh, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, Shiromani Akali Dal and the Congress among others have extended support to the agitating farmers. 1. Farmers start marching to Delhi in protest against newly implemented farm laws Farmers started the 'Delhi Chalo' march on November 26 against the farm laws that were passed in the Monsoon Session of the Parliament in September. They were enacted soon after and farmers in several states have expressed displeasure over the new laws. Punjab, whose main source of income comes from farming, has been the most vocal against these laws. Last week, the farmers lifted the 60-day 'rail roko' agitation for 15 days starting November 23 and agreed to let all goods and passenger trains operate across Punjab. Over hundreds of farmers have started gathering at the Delhi border along with Haryana despite barricades. BJP-ruled Haryana has imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC in several parts of the state to prevent assembly of protesters. 2. Farmers face tear gas, water cannons, attempt to murder charges in Haryana; one farmers' supporter burnt alive Farmers from Punjab faced water cannons and broke police barriers at the Tikri and Singhu borders as they pushed towards the national capital on November 26th.. Haryana and Delhi Police used water cannons and lobbed teargas shells as agitators pushed through barricades. Haryana Police has booked state Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Gurnam Singh Charuni and several farmers on attempt to murder, rioting, causing obstruction in government duty and other charges for violations during their "Delhi Chalo" march, officials said on November 28. 3. Punjab CM Amarinder Singh, and Haryana CM M L Khattar engage in a war of words Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on November 26 slammed the BJP-led government in Haryana for stopping farmers from moving towards Delhi, alleging the use of "brute force" against the agitating farmers and claimed that it was “totally undemocratic and unconstitutional”. Haryana had sealed its borders with Punjab to prevent farmers from entering the state for their 'Delhi Chalo' protest march. “Why is Haryana govt provoking them by resorting to force? Don't the farmers have the right to pass peacefully through a public highway?", Singh asked. Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar said that he would quit politics if the Minimum Support Price mechanism is ever dismantled. I've said it earlier and I'm saying it again, I'll leave politics if there'll be any trouble on the MSP -- therefore, please stop inciting innocent farmers,” Khattar tweeted. “I've been trying to reach out to you for the last 3 days but, sadly, you have decided to stay unreachable -- is this how serious you are for farmers’ issues? You're only tweeting and running away from talks, why?,” Khattar said in another tweet. I've been trying to reach out to you for the last 3 days but sadly you decided to stay unreachable - is this how serious you are for farmer's issues? You're only tweeting and running away from talks, Why? Amarinder Singh vehemently slammed Khattar for allegedly accusing the former of instigating the farmers for protest. "Is Amarinder Khalistani? What nonsense is this? Once they say Amarinder is heading it, once they say Khalistan is heading it. Tell them to make up their mind first," Singh said. 4. Amit Shah puts forward a conditional deal to advance talks; protesting farmers refuse the offer As more farmers' groups converged at the national capital, Home Minister Amit Shah stepped in with an offer to expedite talks, asking the protestors to clear highways and shift to the Burari grounds. “I appeal to the protesting farmers that the government of India is ready to hold talks. The Agriculture Minister has invited them on December 3 for discussion. If farmers' unions want to hold a discussion before December 3, then, I assure you that it will happen as soon as you shift your protest to a designated place,” Shah said. Shah said that at many places, farmers were staying in their tractor-trolleys on highways in this cold. “I appeal to them that Delhi Police are ready to shift you to big ground, please go there,”(sic) he said. However, farmer leaders held a crucial meeting on Sunday and rejected Union Home Minister Amit Shah's offer of talks after moving to the Burari Ground. “The conditions put for talks is an insult to farmers. We will never go to Burari. It is an open jail,” Surjeet Singh Phul, President of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Krantikari) told reporters at the Singhu border, where a large number of farmers have staged sit-in protests for the past four days. 5. Farmers stay put; Tikri, Singhu borders closed, traffic snarls across Delhi Farmer leader Harmeet Singh Kadian, who is the president of BKU (Kadian) said that the protesters will not shift to the Burari ground. Traffic continued to be disrupted in the city due to the protests. Taking to Twitter, the Delhi Traffic Police on Monday alerted commuters to take an alternate route since Singhu and Tikri borders continued to remain closed. 6. PM Modi talks about the farm laws in the 71st edition of Mann Ki Baat As farmers continued protesting against the farm laws, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday sought to allay their apprehensions insisting  that the reforms have opened new opportunities for farmers, who have already started benefiting from the initiatives. “These reforms have not only broken shackles of farmers but have also given new rights and opportunities for them,” the prime minister said in his monthly ‘Mann ki Baat’ radio talk and listed out instances where farmers have benefited from the new laws. He also gave examples of farmers who have benefitted from the new farm laws. However, he did not mention the protests or protesters at the borders. Simultaneously, Amit Shah held campaign rallies for the Hyderabad civic polls on Sunday, where hundreds of people gathered in support, which was criticised by several leaders and political analysts as farmers pashed pushback in Delhi with Covid-19 protocols as the reason.

30-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality in 'very poor' category||Delhi's air quality turned “very poor” on Monday and is predicted to deteriorate further with calm winds and low temperature allowing accumulation of pollutants. The city's air quality index (AQI) was 307. The 24-hour average AQI was 268 on Sunday. It was 231 on Saturday, 137 on Friday, 302 on Thursday and 413 on Wednesday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". The winds were calm at night time. During the day, the maximum wind speed is expected to be 10 kmph, according to the India Meteorological Department. Winds are predicted to slow down further. Therefore, Delhi's air quality is likely to deteriorate further and remain in the “poor” to “very poor” category over the next two days, it had said earlier. The minimum temperature was 6.9 degrees Celsius on Sunday and the maximum is expected to settle around 26 degrees Celsius, the weather department said. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.  The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the city's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – will be around 2,500 m2/s on Monday and is likely to be 2,000 m2/s on Tuesday. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. The share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution has reduced as the harvesting season has ended. The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring states to Delhi's PM2.5 levels was 6 percent on Sunday, 4 percent on Saturday, 2 percent on Friday and just 1 percent on Thursday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor,||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-in-very-poor-category-921578.html
30-11-2020||North and Central||Mayawati asks Uttar Pradesh govt to reconsider its new anti-conversion law||BSP president Mayawati on Monday asked the Uttar Pradesh government to reconsider the new anti-conversion law, saying it is full of "doubts and apprehensions". Her remarks come after Uttar Pradesh registered its first case under the new law in Bareilly district based on a complaint from the father of a young woman. In a statement issued here on Sunday, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi said a case was registered on the complaint by Tikaram who accused a man -- Uvaish Ahmed -- of the same village of trying to convert his daughter through "allurement" (bahla-phuslaakar). "The ordinance on love jihad brought by the UP government in a hurry is full of doubts and apprehensions. There is neither any recognition nor acceptability to conversion through force or deceit in the country. There are many laws already effective in this regard. The government needs to reconsider the new law," Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi. "Love Jihad" is a coinage used by right-wing activists to refer to the alleged campaign of Muslims forcing Hindu girls to convert in the guise of love. Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel on Saturday gave assent to an ordinance against forcible or fraudulent religious conversions that provides for imprisonment up to 10 years and a maximum fine of Rs 50,000 under different categories. The promulgation of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, came four days after the Yogi Adityanath government approved the draft of the legislation which also curbs religious conversions only for the sake of marriage. Under the law which deals with different categories of offences, a marriage will be declared "null and void" if the conversion of a woman is solely for that purpose, and those wishing to change their religion after marriage need to apply to the district magistrate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/mayawati-asks-uttar-pradesh-govt-to-reconsider-its-new-anti-conversion-law-921579.html

30-11-2020||North and Central||At 10.2 degree celsius, Delhi faces coldest November in 71 years||The month of November was the coldest in the national capital in 71 years, with the mean minimum temperature dropping to 10.2 degrees Celsius, according to the India Meteorological Department. Delhi had recorded a mean minimum temperature of 10.2 degrees Celsius in November 1949. The mean minimum temperature for November was 9.6 degrees Celsius in 1938; nine degrees Celsius in 1931 and 8.9 degrees Celsius in 1930, according to IMD data. Normally, the mean minimum temperature for the month of November is 12.9 degrees Celsius. The mean minimum temperature was 15 degrees Celsius last year, 13.4 degrees Celsius in 2018 and 12.8 degrees Celsius in 2017 and 2016. Delhi also braved four cold waves in November –on the 3rd, 20th, 23rd and 24th.  For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days. “However, for small areas such as Delhi, a cold wave can be declared if the criteria is fulfilled even for a day,” Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said. On Monday, Delhi recorded a minimum of 6.9 degrees Celsius. This is the eight-day this month that the minimum temperature remained below 10 degrees Celsius. On November 23, Delhi recorded a minimum of 6.3 degrees Celsius -- its lowest minimum temperature in the month since November 2003, when the city recorded a minimum of 6.1 degrees Celsius, according to Srivastava.  The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degree Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover on most days, according to IMD officials. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground. The month of October was the coldest in 58 years in the national capital.  The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/at-102-degree-celsius-delhi-faces-coldest-november-in-71-years-921587.html

The government issued guidelines for surveillance, containment and caution for the period of December 1 to December 31. Taking in account the prevailing Covid-19 scenario in the state, it has been decided to force lockdown in containment zones till December 31, according to the order issued on Sunday night. “Effective demarcation of containment zones is key to break the chain of transmission controlling the virus. The zones will be demarcated by collectors following guidelines issued by the Government of India. Only essential services will be allowed in these areas and intensive house-to-house surveillance be conducted,” Principal Secretary, Home, Abhay Kumar, said in the guidelines. The state government has increased the number of districts from 8 to 13, where the night curfew will be imposed from 8 pm to 6 am. Kota, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Udaipur, Ajmer, Alwar, Bhilwara, Nagaur, Pali, Tonk, Sikara and Ganganagar are the districts where the night curfew has been imposed. However, it will not be applicable on factories with production of continuous nature and having night shift, IT companies, chemist shops, marriage etc. “Rajasthan is at a critical juncture in its fight against Covid-19. Over the last few weeks, the number of new cases has been rising. The confluence of certain factors such as recent festival season, onset of winter and laxity in observance of the Covid-19 guidelines pose the risk of the situation becoming aggravated, thus putting a strain on the health infrastructure," he said.  Schools, colleges, educational and coaching institutes will remain close till December 31. Also, cinema halls, theatres, entertainment parks, social or religious, or any large congregation is not permitted. Rajasthan reported 18 coronavirus deaths and 2,518 fresh cases on Sunday, taking the total number of fatalities and positive cases to 2,292 and 2,65,386, a health bulletin stated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/lockdown-in-covid-19-containment-zones-in-rajasthan-921611.html

30-11-2020||North and Central||Farmers' protest: Concrete barriers at Delhi-Ghaziabad border point as more join protest||Thousands of farmers continued their stir against the Centre's new farm laws at the Delhi-Haryana border for the fifth day, even as the number of those protesting at the Ghazipur border swelled on Monday, leading police to place concrete barriers and enhancing security at the border point connecting with UP. Security was stepped up after farmers threatened to block more highways connecting the national capital. Peaceful protests were underway at both the Singhu and Tikri borders with no untoward incident reported for the last two days, but the numbers of farmers at the Ghazipur border swelled, with more their counterparts from the state joining them. Rejecting the Centre's offer to hold talks once they move to the Burari ground, the farmers protesting at all Delhi border points said they will not accept any conditional dialogue and have called a meeting to discuss their next course of action later in the day. Farmers, who had reached Nirankarai Samagam Ground in Burari on Saturday, continued their protest there. A Delhi Police officer said the situation at the Ghazipur border near UP Gate remained peaceful. He said, "Cement jersey barriers have been placed to prevent the protesting farmers from entering the national capital. "The protestors do not wish to go to Burari ground and want to carry out their protest at Jantar Mantar," he said. However, the Delhi-Ghaziabad border has not been sealed, police said. Sukhwinder Singh, who has been agitating at the Tikri border for the fifth consecutive day, said farmers will continue to protest at the Delhi borders as they don't want to go to Burari ground --- a designated protest site identified for the demonstration. "We have enough ration to sustain for at least six months. We do not wish to go to Burari. If we proceed from here, we will only go to Jantar Mantar. We will not protest anywhere else," Singh said. He said that they are ready for talks with the Centre, but if they do not find solutions despite talks, they will block all the ways leading towards Delhi. "We will not leave from here (Tikri Border) unless their demands are met. We are ready to face cold weather, we are ready to face every challenge ahead," Singh said. A medical camp has also been set up at Singhu border, which is being run by two individual doctors. Dr Sarika Verma, who has come from Gurgaon, said, "We have come here today. We are helping farmers at our own level. We have blood pressure medicine, PCM, crocin and other medicines." "The farmers are not so much aware about COVID-19. Many of them are not wearing masks, which poses a threat to human lives. We are distributing masks especially to those who have cough and the elderly here," Verma said. Another doctor Karan Juneja said that he has distributed basic medicines to 300 farmers, adding that there is need to conduct the COVID-19 test at the protest site. Traffic continued to be disrupted in the national capital due to the protests. Taking to twitter, the Delhi Traffic Police on Monday alerted commuters to take an alternate route since Singhu and Tikri borders continued to remain closed. "Singhu Border is still closed from both sides. Please take alternate route.Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba Chowk & GTK road.Traffic is very very heavy. Please avoid outer ring road from signature bridge to Rohini & vice versa, GTK road, NH 44 & Singhu borders," it tweeted. In another tweet, it said, "Tikri border is closed for any Traffic Movement. Available Open Borders to Haryana are following Borders Jharoda, Dhansa, Daurala Jhatikera, Badusari, Kapashera, Rajokri NH 8,Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders." Union Home Minister Amit Shah had appealed to the farmers to shift to the Burari ground and had said the Centre was ready to hold discussions with them as soon as they move to the designated place. A meeting of over 30 farmer groups was held to discuss Shah’s offer for talks before the scheduled date of December 3 once they move to Burari in the city, but the thousands of protesters had refused to budge and spent another night in the cold at the Singhu and Tikri border points. Their representatives had said that Shah’s condition that they shift the protest is not acceptable and claimed Burari ground is an "open jail". Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla in a letter to 32 farmers organisations sent on Saturday cited the cold conditions and the COVID-19 outbreak and said the farmers should move to the Burari ground where adequate facilities have been made for them.

30-11-2020||North and Central||Farmers' protest: Concrete barriers at Delhi-Ghaziabad border point as more join protest||Delhi Police placed concrete barriers and enhanced security at the Ghazipur border with UP as the number of protesting farmers swelled there while thousands more remained at the Delhi-Haryana border for the fifth day Monday to protest against the Centre's agricultural reform laws. Security was stepped up after farmers threatened to block more highways connecting the national capital. Peaceful protests were underway at both the Singhu and Tikri borders with no untoward incident reported for the last two days, but the numbers of farmers at the Ghazipur border swelled, with more their counterparts from the state joining them. Rejecting the Centre's offer to hold talks once they move to the Burari ground, the farmers protesting at all Delhi border points said they will not accept any conditional dialogue and have called a meeting to discuss their next course of action later in the day. Farmers, who had reached Nirankarai Samagam Ground in Burari on Saturday, continued their protest there. A Delhi Police officer said the situation at the Ghazipur border near UP Gate remained peaceful. He said, "Cement jersey barriers have been placed to prevent the protesting farmers from entering the national capital. "The protestors do not wish to go to Burari ground and want to carry out their protest at Jantar Mantar," he said. However, the Delhi-Ghaziabad border has not been sealed, police said. Sukhwinder Singh, who has been agitating at the Tikri border for the fifth consecutive day, said farmers will continue to protest at the Delhi borders as they don't want to go to Burari ground --- a designated protest site identified for the demonstration. "We have enough ration to sustain for at least six months. We do not wish to go to Burari. If we proceed from here, we will only go to Jantar Mantar. We will not protest anywhere else," Singh said. He said that they are ready for talks with the Centre, but if they do not find solutions despite talks, they will block all the ways leading towards Delhi. "We will not leave from here (Tikri Border) unless their demands are met. We are ready to face cold weather, we are ready to face every challenge ahead," Singh said. A medical camp has also been set up at Singhu border, which is being run by two individual doctors. Dr Sarika Verma, who has come from Gurgaon, said, "We have come here today. We are helping farmers at our own level. We have blood pressure medicine, PCM, crocin and other medicines." "The farmers are not so much aware about Covid-19. Many of them are not wearing masks, which poses a threat to human lives. We are distributing masks especially to those who have cough and the elderly here," Verma said. Another doctor Karan Juneja said that he has distributed basic medicines to 300 farmers, adding that there is need to conduct the Covid-19 test at the protest site. Traffic continued to be disrupted in the national capital due to the protests. Taking to twitter, the Delhi Traffic Police on Monday alerted commuters to take an alternate route since Singhu and Tikri borders continued to remain closed. "Singhu Border is still closed from both sides. Please take alternate route.Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba Chowk & GTK road.Traffic is very very heavy. Please avoid outer ring road from signature bridge to Rohini & vice versa, GTK road, NH 44 & Singhu borders," it tweeted. In another tweet, it said, "Tikri border is closed for any Traffic Movement. Available Open Borders to Haryana are following Borders Jharoda, Dhansa, Daurala Jhatikera, Badusari, Kapashera, Rajokri NH 8,Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders." Union Home Minister Amit Shah had appealed to the farmers to shift to the Burari ground and had said the Centre was ready to hold discussions with them as soon as they move to the designated place. A meeting of over 30 farmer groups was held to discuss Shah’s offer for talks before the scheduled date of December 3 once they move to Burari in the city, but the thousands of protesters had refused to budge and spent another night in the cold at the Singhu and Tikri border points. Their representatives had said that Shah’s condition that they shift the protest is not acceptable and claimed Burari ground is an "open jail". Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla in a letter to 32 farmers organisations sent on Saturday cited the cold conditions and the Covid-19 outbreak and said the farmers should move to the Burari ground where adequate facilities have been made for them. "As soon as you shift to the ground at Burari, the very next day a high-level committee of union ministers will hold talks at Vigyan Bhavan with the representatives of all farmers unions, with whom dialogue had taken place earlier,” he had said in the letter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-protest-concrete-barriers-at-delhi-ghaziabad-border-point-as-more-join-protest-921638.html

30-11-2020||North and Central||Mayawati asks UP government to reconsider its new anti-conversion law||BSP president Mayawati on Monday asked the Uttar Pradesh government to reconsider the new anti-conversion law as it is full of "doubts and apprehensions", prompting a quick response from the newly elected BJP MP and former head of state's SC/ST commission,  Brijlal who claimed that majority of those becoming victims of love jihad belong to the Dalit and backward castes. "The ordinance on love jihad brought by the UP government in a hurry is full of doubts and apprehensions. There is neither any recognition, nor acceptability to conversion through force or deceit in the country. There are many laws already effective in this regard. The government needs to reconsider the new law," Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi. Her remarks come after Uttar Pradesh registered its first case under the new law in Bareilly district based on a complaint from the father of a young woman. In a statement issued here on Sunday, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi said a case was registered on the complaint by Tikaram who accused a man -- Uvaish Ahmed -- of the same village of trying to convert his daughter through "allurement" (bahla-phuslaakar). In a prompt rejoinder,  BJP MP Brijlal in a series of tweets said, "Mayawatiji, do you know that mostly the Dalit, backward and most backward castes have become a victim of love  jihad? Do these castes not have the right to live with respect? Tell me who are you with.” In another tweet, he said, "Most of the Dalits, oppressed and most backward caste people have not only lost their original religion but also their existence is at risk. Is it a crime to provide security to these people?” Questioning Mayawati', he said that daughters coming from Dalit and backward castes of the state are mostly the targets of love jihad, and instead of talking about their rights who was she supporting? In another tweet, Brijlal said, "Mayawatiji it has been seen that in most of the cases of love jihad, girls belonging to the Dalit and backward castes have become victims, the section of society you consider yourself to be the messiah of. Explain who are you with." "Love jihad" is a coinage used by right-wing activists to refer to the alleged campaign of Muslims forcing Hindu girls to convert in the guise of love. Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav has already said that his party will oppose the state government's bill on religious conversions when placed in the assembly for passage. Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel on Saturday gave assent to an ordinance against forcible or fraudulent religious conversions that provides for imprisonment up to 10 years and a maximum fine of Rs 50,000 under different categories. The promulgation of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, came four days after the Yogi Adityanath government approved the draft of the legislation which also curbs religious conversions only for the sake of marriage. Under the law which deals with different categories of offences, a marriage will be declared "null and void" if the conversion of a woman is solely for that purpose, and those wishing to change their religion after marriage need to apply to the district magistrate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/mayawati-asks-up-government-to-reconsider-its-new-anti-conversion-law-921657.html
30-11-2020||North and Central||No social distancing at protest, farmer leaders says new laws bigger threat than coronavirus||Amid fears that the 'Delhi Chalo’ protests by farmers will lead to coronavirus spreading faster, their leaders said the 'black laws' enacted at the Centre are a bigger threat than the contagion. There had been few signs of social distancing as thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana began their protest last week against the three new agro-marketing laws, setting off on a march to the national capital. On the way, they skirmished with police at barricades and since Friday are massed at Delhi’s entry points, many of them sheltering inside tractor-trolleys. Masks appear to be a rarity and there is little attempt at keeping distance from each other, safeguards meant to prevent the infection from spreading. But as experts fear that the event could become a coronavirus “superspreader”, farm leaders say there are more pressing concerns before them. “The new farm laws brought by the (Narendra) Modi government are a bigger threat than coronavirus as farmers fear they will lose their livelihood with the implementation of these laws,” Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan told PTI over the phone. Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher asked why coronavirus posed a serious threat to life only during the farmers' agitation, and not during the recent Bihar assembly polls. “When Bihar elections took place, where was Covid-19? When any political gathering takes place, where is coronavirus,” he asked, in an apparent reference to the election rallies. He claimed that the issue comes up only when farmers begin an agitation for their rights. The Delhi Police initially declined permission for the farmers’ protest in the city, citing the threat of Covid-19. On Sunday, Haryana Chief Minister M L Khattar lashed out at his Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singh, saying he will be responsible if the gathering of farmers worsens the coronavirus situation. Singh has backed the protest. A spokesperson for the BKU’s Haryana unit led by Gurnam Singh Charuni on Monday claimed that farmers are trying their best to keep Covid-19 at bay. “As much as we can, we are trying to follow the guidelines. But at the moment thousands of farmers are saying that getting the Centre's farm laws rolled back is the first priority as these will anyway destroy them,” he said. He said it is now up to the Centre to accept their demands. When asked if they fear that the infection may spread as thousands have gathered over a large area, he said, "No farmer fears this disease at the moment. All they have on their minds is to get these laws rolled back." In Sonipat, a Haryana Health Department official said they have so far distributed 5,000 masks to the protesting farmers. “Also, after every kilometre we have stationed an ambulance,” he said. Mobile toilets have also been installed at various points and sanitisation is being regularly carried out, he added. The health department also plans to carry out random tests for Covid-19. “We are trying to take all necessary measures so that everyone remains safe amid the pandemic,” he said. “We are also urging farmers to wear masks and try to maintain social distancing.” Unions have expressed apprehension that the new agri-marketing laws enacted at the Centre will lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving farmers the mercy of big corporates. The government, however, says that the new laws give farmers options to get higher prices for their crops and the MSP regime will still continue.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/no-social-distancing-at-protest-farmer-leaders-says-new-laws-bigger-threat-than-coronavirus-921658.html
30-11-2020||North and Central||PM Modi accuses opposition parties of 'misleading' farmers on farm laws||Amid the ongoing protests by the farmers from Punjab and Haryana, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday once again defended the new farm laws and said that the opponents are ''spreading apprehensions' and 'misleading' the farmers. Speaking at a function on the occasion of completion of a six-lane highway connecting Prayagraj and his Lok Sabha constituency of Varanasi, Modi launched a veiled attack on the Congress and said that those, who had 'duped' the farmers over the years, are now opposing the new farm laws. ''Earlier the nature of the protests was different....they were against the decisions but now they are based on apprehensions, propaganda and misinformation,'' the prime minister said. ''Very soon those, who are protesting against the farm laws, will be exposed before the people....even the opponents of the laws will reap the benefits in future,'' he added. He said that the farmers had been 'duped' for years in the name of MSP (minimum support price). ''The small and marginal farmers could not get the benefits....the farmers were duped even on the pretext of loan waiver,'' Modi said. He also sought to allay the apprehensions that the government wanted to abolish the mandis. He also cited the figures regarding the purchase of wheat, paddy and pulses during the past few years to buttress his claim that his government had bought more from the farmers than before. ''We are strengthening the mandis....why will we do that if we want to abolish them,'' he said. He sought to assure the protesting farmers that the government would take every step to allay their apprehensions with regard to the farm laws. Modi's remarks came at a time when thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana have gathered on the borders of Delhi and threatened to block the entry points of the national capital.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pm-modi-accuses-opposition-parties-of-misleading-farmers-on-farm-laws-921669.html

According to an order issued by the health department, private laboratories have been asked to charge Rs 800 for testing “samples collected by government teams and collected from collection sites by private sector labs as requisitioned by districts and hospitals”. However, the testing of samples collected through home visit will cost Rs 1,200. All labs and hospitals have also been asked to display the revised rates at a prominent place within 24 hours. The private laboratories have also been asked to process samples, share the reports with the client (government or individual) and update all reports on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal within 24 hours of collection of samples. Health Minister Satyendar Jain had earlier said that labs were finding it difficult to release the results of all tests within a day. Earlier in the day, the chief minister said that he had issued directives to reduce the price of the RT-PCR test in the national capital, saying it will help those going to private labs for Covid-19 tests.        "I have directed that the rates of RT PCR tests be reduced in Delhi. Whereas tests are being conducted free of cost in govt establishments, however this will help those who get their tests done in pvt labs," Kejriwal tweeted.          Jain in reply to the chief minister's tweet said orders for this will be issued immediately.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-govt-reduces-rt-pcr-test-price-to-rs-800-921672.html
30-11-2020||North and Central||Tractors, trolleys, farm equipment turn into temporary shelters for protesting farmers||Tractor-trolleys and key farm equipment have turned into temporary shelters for thousands of farmers who have assembled at the borders of the to protest against the Centre's new farm laws. The ongoing protests by thousands of farmers entered the fifth day on Monday, with the protesters threatening to block all five entry points to Delhi. As temperatures have dipped, the farmers demanding that the laws be repealed are spending the chilly nights inside their tractor-trolleys covered with tarpaulin, which they have turned into temporary shelters.           Most of the farmers have brought at least two trolleys with each tractor with one of them carrying ration and other essentials and the other being used to accommodate the protesters. Stubble or crop residue, disposal of which otherwise becomes a major challenge for the farmers, is also coming in handy as many have cushioned their trolleys with layers of straw and laid mattresses over it to protect them from the cold. Night temperatures over the last few days have been settling in the range of around 9 degrees Celsius.      The tractor-trolleys have occupied over a 10-km-long area in this Haryana district which lies along the Ambala-Delhi national highway.        Among the protesters are several men and women, some of them aged over 70 years.         Flags of various farmers' outfits from Punjab and Haryana can be seen fluttering atop the tractors, some of which are fitted with loudspeakers and used by the leaders of peasants' bodies to address the gatherings. The protesting farmers say they will force the Centre to repeal the “anti-farmer” laws.         Having gathered here in thousands amid the coronavirus pandemic, they claim adverse conditions do not affect them as they are used to various challenges anyway while working in the fields.        “If these laws are implemented, farmers will be destroyed,” said Trilok Singh, a farmer from Amritsar as he sipped freshly prepared tea with some bread and biscuits.          Protesting farmers have said that they have come prepared for a long stir and have stocked themselves with ration, clothes, cooking gas cylinders, quilts and other essentials.     “We will rest only when these laws are scrapped. In Punjab, we peacefully sat in protest for two months, but our plight did not move the Centre, now they will have to listen to us because our livelihoods are at stake,” said another farmer Lakhwinder Singh from Moga district.         When asked that Centre claims these laws will benefit them and give them wider choice to sell their crops, Lakhwinder Singh said, “The one who is going to eventually benefit are the big corporates, we don't see much gain for farmers.”         Another farmer Kuldeep Singh said, “When the Centre first brought ordinance before these laws were passed, did they consult farmers at any stage. When farmers don't want these reforms, why are these being thrust upon us?”           The farmers said that they would not return to their homes, till their demand for scrapping of three farm laws was accepted.           Meanwhile, the farmers on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev on Monday, the founder of Sikhism, performed 'Ardas' (prayer) at the Haryana-Delhi border and distributed 'karah parshad' among protesters. The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh and various factions of Bharatiya Kisan Union had given a call for the Delhi Chalo protest to press the central government to scrap the three new farm laws. Farmers protesting against the Centre's three farm laws have expressed apprehension that the laws would pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/tractors-trolleys-farm-equipment-turn-into-temporary-shelters-for-protesting-farmers-921674.html

30-11-2020||North and Central||Farmers' protest: Supply of vegetables, fruits from other states impacted||The supply of vegetables and fruits to the city from other states has been impacted and it has been halved at Azadpur Mandi, one of Delhi's largest wholesale market, owing to the protest by farmers at the Singhu and Tikri border points of the national capital for the last five days. Vendors in other parts of Delhi said due to curtailed supply, the wholesale rates of seasonal vegetables has gone up by Rs 50- Rs 100. They said the roadblock at Singhu and Tikri border has impacted the supply of vegetables and fruits from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. The arrival of vegetables and fruits to Delhi's largest wholesale market at Azadpur has been reduced by half due to the closed borders, said Adil Khan, chairman Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee at Azadpur. "During normal days, around 2,500 trucks of vegetables and fruits used to arrive at Azadpur Mandi from other states. The number has come down to around 1,000 trucks now and if the borders remained closed for a few more days, the situation will worsen," Khan said. He, however, said the rates have not registered any significant rise so far because local produce and stocks are being sold. Some other vendors said the wholesale rates of seasonal vegetables have already gone up by Rs 50- Rs 100 due to the short supply. They said due to obstructions at the border, the trucks are finding it difficult to reach Delhi and those somehow managing to do so are getting delayed by several hours.  "The supply and rates will have a further impact if the borders are not opened and traffic is brought back to normal," they said. Gopal, a wholesale commission agent of green pea at Azadpur market, said supplies have drastically reduced. Normally 40-45 trucks of peas from Punjab's Amritsar-Hosiarpur belt would arrive on a given day in winters but it has reduced to 15-20 trucks now, he said. "The rates have gone up due to reduced supply and hike in transport charges that have increased by around Rs 10,000 per truck," he said. The trucks from Punjab carrying fruits and vegetables that would normally take around 9-10 hours for a trip to Delhi, now takes 12-14 hours due to closure of Singhu border, said another wholesaler. The reduced supply has also pushed retail rates in the markets of the city. The rates of potatoes, tomatoes and onion that were already high, have relatively been less affected, said the wholesalers. "The major supply of potatoes and onions to Delhi are from states like Maharashtra, Karnataka and MP and the routes to these states are not affected by the farmers' stir. "However, supply of vegetables and fruits from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir has been affected," said Hakim Rahman, a wholesaler at Okhla Mandi. Some wholesalers said the supply was badly impacted for two days of the farmers' protest but now it has been restored as the trucks were using alternate entry points and routes to enter the city from other states. "The supply had reduced initially for two-three days as the farmers blocked the Singhu and Tikri borders. But, now, the trucks are using other roads and avoiding highways although it has resulted in longer hours of travel and increased transportation charges," said a vegetable commission agent Srikant Mishra at Azadpur Mandi. He said the supply of new crop of potatoes has also been hit. A fruit wholesaler at Azadpur Mandi, R K Bhatia, said the supply of fruits like apple and Kinnow was hit but rates were more or less the same. Apple in Kashmir was not good this season, so rates were already high and demand was less, he said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Pravin Kapoor claimed that availability of vegetables and fruits is getting short in Delhi and requested Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to pay attention towards the issue.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-protest-supply-of-vegetables-fruits-from-other-states-impacted-921723.html

Addressing a meeting in Bhalla village ahead of the second phase of District Development Council (DDC) polls, he alleged that former CMs Farooq Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti have been aware of the corruption of each other. "But no leader from these parties ever went to jail because there has been an understanding between the two to take turns for fillings their coffers,” Chugh said. He said that these leaders deliberately brought laws to favour some people, while other sections of the society like women and Gujjars were deprived of any benefits. Calling the people to vote for the BJP in the coming elections, he said that it is time power should be taken away from the Abdullah-Mufti gang and given to the common man. "The people should get rid of Abdullah-Mufti duo who have been looting Jammu and Kashmir for the last 70 years and deprived the people of development and progress,” Chugh asserted.

Both the border points at Singhu and Tikri remained closed with the farmers rejecting the Centre's offer to hold talks over the new farm laws opposed by them. The closure of borders has also resulted in heavy traffic on other alternate routes between Delhi and Haryana. The Delhi Traffic Police tweeted, "Singhu Border is still closed from both sides. Please take alternate route. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba Chowk & GTK road. Traffic is very very heavy. Please avoid outer ring road from signature bridge to Rohini & vice versa, GTK road, NH 44 & Singhu borders.” Traffic AlertSinghu border is still closed from both sides.

They said the farmers will not accept any conditional dialogue and will block all five entry points to Delhi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/traffic-woes-continue-in-delhi-amid-farmers-protest-921749.html
30-11-2020||North and Central||Protesting farmers say got MSP this kharif season; worry if they will get after 4-5 years||"I have sold about 125 quintals of kharif paddy in an APMC mandi and received MSP payment in my bank account. But what is the guarantee this will continue if such trade is permitted outside mandis. This is our worry," said a protesting farmer Ranveer Singh at Singhu border here. Ranveer Singh 44, Pradhan of Shahbazpur village in Tarn Taran district of Punjab, has travelled with his fellow 125 farmers in six tractor-trolleys covering a distance of about 425 km in this winter and reached at the Delhi border. Like other protesting farmers associated with over 32 farm organisations, his only demand is "repeal of the three new farm laws" enacted by the central government which he fears will dismantle the MSP system and put next-generation farmers at risk of exploitation by private players. "No doubt, we are getting MSP now. We are not sure we will get it after 4-5 years. This fight is to protect the interest of next generation farmers," he said. Stating that many options are given under new laws to trade outside mandis, he said, however, this will only weaken the existing government's APMC (Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee) mandi system. "Like government schools and hospitals, the new farm laws will only weaken our mandis. We know mandis will not go away, but entry of private trade in over next few years will only weeken the mandi system," he explained. Another farmer Baksheesh Singh, 60, from Patiala said, "All that we are demanding from the Centre is an assurance that the private players like Adanis and Ambanis will not buy below MSP if we sell our produce outside the mandi." He also said that the entry of private players has weakened many of government sectors from education to healthcare, where poor cannot afford to get admission. When asked that the Centre under the new law has provided for dispute resolution mechanism at sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) and District Collector (DC) level, Singh said: "They are government people and they will listen to private players instead of farmers." "When the current system is running smoothly, what is the point of having new laws. Even arthiyas (middlemen) are private players, but we are dealing with them for many years," he said. Another farmer Balavinder Singh from Bathu Chak village in Amritsar district -- who has reached the Delhi border to be part of the protest -- is of the view that the way farmers are treated by the central government does not instil confidence even if it claims the reforms are in the interest of the farming community. As per the official data, the government's paddy procurement has increased by 18.60 per cent to 316.93 lakh tonnes so far in the current kharif season. Out of which, Punjab alone has contributed 202.74 lakh tonnes which is 63.97 per cent of the total procurement. Jagveer Singh, 60, who has travelled all the way from Patiala district, said, "We are protesting peacefully here. We have right to protest -- good or bad. We are not goondas, which some ministers are saying to us. We will return to hometown only after the Centre repeals the laws." While most of the protesting farmers are demanding for a repeal of all three new farm laws enacted by the central government, but their concerns are largely related to only one law  -- The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act (FPTC Act). Farmers also claimed that they are protesting out of their will and not been funded by any political parties. In a series of tweets, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad sought to refute criticism of the farm laws by some farmer bodies and opposition parties. Many misconceptions like the farm bills are a conspiracy to not offer farmers MSP, are being spread, he said, adding that the reality is that these legislations have nothing to do with the minimum support price. "The MSP has been in force and will remain in force," he said. Big companies will not be able to exploit farmers following these laws, as farmers can walk out of contract anytime without paying any penalty, the Union minister asserted. Union minister Prakash Javadekar said, "Don't have misconceptions about the farm laws. Farmers of Punjab have sold more paddy in mandi than they did last year and at a higher MSP. MSP is alive and so is mandi. And government purchase is also taking place." Upset over the government's response, Bharat Kisan Union (Dakunda) General Secretary Jagmohan Singh said: "We want unconditional talks with the government. We will not come to the discussion table unless some of our farmers who are in Burari ground are not allowed to come out. It is a mini-jail." Sticking to their demands, hundreds of farmers from Punjab -- who have reached Delhi borders in their tractor-trolleys from districts of Sangrur, Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Patiala and Fatehpur Saheb -- said the ball now is in the court of the central government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/protesting-farmers-say-got-msp-this-kharif-season-worry-if-they-will-get-after-4-5-years-921765.html
30-11-2020||North and Central||Punjabi singers lend support to farmers' protests||Several Punjabi singers, including Sidhu Moosewala and Babbu Maan, have lent their support to farmers who are protesting against the Centre's new farm laws at Delhi's border points for the last five days. Besides Moosewala and Maan, singers Kanwar Grewal and Harf Cheema have also joined the stir. Moosewala, who reached the Tikri border on Monday, said that the government must address the concerns of the protesting farmers. He also said that a large number of farmers from Punjab have assembled at the Singhu and Tikri borders of the national capital and claimed that the people of Haryana too have extended immense support to the farmers' movement. "We thank them," Moosewala said.           Grewal, who has been supporting the farmers' movement, urged people to give maximum support to them through social media.           He along with another singer has even come out with a song urging farmers to go to Delhi in large numbers.           Ever since farmers from Punjab started opposing the farm laws, several Punjabi artistes and singers have come out in support of them.       They had even participated in protests organised by farmers at various places in Punjab in the last two months.           Over the past few days, a large number of farmers from Punjab and Haryana have gathered at the Delhi borders against the three new farm laws as part of their 'Delhi Chalo' march. Farmers who have reached Delhi borders in tractor-trolleys and other vehicles are spending nights on the national highways. The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh and various factions of the Bharatiya Kisan Union had given a call for the Delhi Chalo protest to press the central government to scrap the laws. Farmers have expressed apprehension that the laws would pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/punjabi-singers-lend-support-to-farmers-protests-921777.html
30-11-2020||North and Central||'Shehla Rashid took Rs 3 crore to join politics': Father demands probe against her NGOs||A family dispute between student activist and former JNU Students Union vice-president Shehla Rashid and her father Abdul Rashid Shora has snowballed into a major controversy with the two parties washing their dirty linen in public about the Shoras and politics. While the father accused his daughter of having grabbed Hawala funds worth crores from an alleged terror financer arrested by the NIA, the daughter claims to be victim of a patriarchal family head. On Monday Shora sought a probe into his daughter’s finances, accusing her of receiving Rs 3 crore from two people under investigation for terror funding. The father had also claimed that he was facing a threat to his life from Shehla, her sister, her mother and her armed security guard. Shora claimed that his daughter had been first offered the amount through him to join a party that was to be floated by former IAS officer Shah Faesal. While he refused, his daughter allegedly accepted the “deal”. “Shehla threatened me not to disclose this deal to anybody or my meeting with Zahoor Watali and Engineer Rashid, otherwise my life would be in danger,” the dad claimed. To corroborate her allegations, Shehla posted a 2005 letter purportedly written by masjid committee of Chanpora in Srinagar, where the family lived, to her father asking him to present himself to clarify regarding his “abusive behavior” towards his wife and daughters. “….As reported you are misbehaving, abusing and using unparliamentarily language with your family. ….you are threatening your family of dire consequences and heavy losses as is evident from copy of your letter addressed to Asma and Shehla (copy enclosed for your reference),” the letter reads. The Committee had asked Shora to present himself before them on 27th February 2005 “so that they can narrow down the differences within the family.” 32-year-old Shehla emerged as a prominent face after fellow JNU students Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya were arrested for a February 2016 protest against the execution of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru. In January 2019, she joined active politics as a member of fellow Kashmiri and former IAS officer Shah Faesal’s new launched J&K People’s Movement. However, she quit the party last October claiming that the Center was trying to portray “normalcy” to the world by holding BDC polls in J&K and that she “cannot be party to the exercise of legitimizing the brutal suppression of my people”. Shehla, who has 7.61 lakh Twitter followers, has emerged as a major social media influencer, even though her views have often landed her in controversies. She is facing sedition charges for accusing the army of torturing people.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/shehla-rashid-took-rs-3-crore-to-join-politics-father-demands-probe-against-her-ngos-921782.html
30-11-2020||North and Central||Remote Photoksar hamlet of Ladakh gets electricity for first time||Sandwiched between two major high altitude passes of the Union Territory of Ladakh, Photoksar village in Leh district got electricity for the first time, triggering lifetime joy and happiness among its residents. As cities across the country adopt the latest technological advancements, residents of this hamlet are celebrating getting electricity for the first time post Independence. Chairman and Chief Executive Councillor (CEC) Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC), Leh Tashi Gyalson inaugurated the NHPC powergrid line for Photoksar village on Sunday, Power Development department (PDD) officials said. A village resident, whose joy knew no bounds, said the electricity supply would help his children do well in their studies. “We are very happy now that we finally have electricity in our village. Now our children can study well and progress in life,” Chandol said. Gyalson said it is because of the visionary initiatives of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who launched the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana, and the energetic efforts of Ladakh MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal that after 70 years of darkness, the village like Photoksar got electrified. "We thank PM Modi and our MP for electrifying this remotest village. I feel very lucky to inaugurate this power line within one month after becoming the councillor of the area and later CEC,” he said. He also assured to electrify five more hamlets -- Yulchung, Nyraks, Skyumpata, Lingshed and Dipling -- in the coming years. Talking about the upcoming telecommunication facilities in Singhey-Lakok area after 70 years, Gyalson said work on installation of Jio towers at Photoksar is underway and soon Yulchung and Lingshed will also see such development. He also promised to install more mobile towers in remaining villages of the area in the future. Regarding electrification of remote villages of Leh district, CEC hoped that all other villages of Nubra, Changthang and Sham will also be connected with Northern Grid in the shortest possible time.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/remote-photoksar-hamlet-of-ladakh-gets-electricity-for-first-time-921831.html
30-11-2020||North and Central||Farmers refuse to budge as PM Modi bats for reforms||Agitating farmers on Monday rejected Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s assertions on the benefits of agriculture sector reforms and declared a “decisive battle” against the new laws. The move by the farmers’ organisations came even as the Centre launched a campaign to highlight the finer details of the three laws, with Modi assuring the farmers yet again that the minimum support price (MSP) regime would continue and that the government was spending crores of rupees to modernise and strengthen the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs). “If the government had to end MSP and shut APMC, why would it invest so much to strengthen these systems,” he asked at a public meeting in Varanasi. Farmers agitating on the Delhi borders appeared in no mood to buy the Centre’s arguments on the virtues of the law and countered by saying that the prime minister’s defence of the laws in ‘Mann ki Baat’ was an indication enough that the government was completely opposed to resolving the issues raised by them. “The prime minister is telling us his Mann ki Baat but is not ready to listen to the grievances of farmers,” Jagmohan Singh, General Secretary, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda), told reporters at the Singhu border. “Our demands are non-negotiable… We have come here for a decisive battle (aar paar ki ladai),” Singh said. The BJP also faced some trouble from ally Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) led by Hanuman Beniwal in Rajasthan, who threatened to quit the NDA if the government failed to repeal the three farm sector laws. “The RLP is part of the NDA, but it derives its strength from farmers and soldiers. If prompt action is not taken in this matter, keeping the interests of farmers in mind, I will have to rethink being part of the NDA,” Beniwal said. Top BJP leaders held back-to-back brainstorming sessions on ways to deal with the farmers’ agitation, but were in no mood to give in to their demands. BJP President J P Nadda chaired a meeting with Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Sunday night. On Monday, Shah deliberated on the issue with Tomar. “Farmers, beware of falsehood. Farm sector laws have provision for progress,” Tomar said even as the Agriculture Ministry released short films in different languages listing out the details of the reforms.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-refuse-to-budge-as-pm-modi-bats-for-reforms-921835.html
30-11-2020||North and Central||Coldest November in Delhi in 71 years: IMD||The November of 2020 was the coldest in the national capital in 71 years, with the mean minimum temperature dropping to 10.2 degrees Celsius, according to the India Meteorological Department. Delhi had recorded a mean minimum temperature of 10.2 degrees Celsius in November 1949. The mean minimum temperature for November was 9.6 degrees Celsius in 1938; nine degrees Celsius in 1931 and 8.9 degrees Celsius in 1930, according to IMD data. Normally, the mean minimum temperature for the month of November is 12.9 degrees Celsius. It was 15 degrees Celsius last year, 13.4 degrees Celsius in 2018 and 12.8 degrees Celsius both in 2017 and 2016. Also, the month of October this year was the coldest in 58 years in the national capital. The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius. Delhi also braved four cold waves in November -- on the 3rd, 20th, 23rd and 24th.  For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days. "However, for small areas such as Delhi, a cold wave can be declared if the criteria is fulfilled even for a day," Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said. On Monday, Delhi recorded a minimum of 6.9 degrees Celsius. This is the eighth day this month that the minimum temperature remained below 10 degrees Celsius. On November 23, Delhi recorded a minimum of 6.3 degrees Celsius, its in the month since November 2003, when the city recorded a low of 6.1 degrees Celsius, according to Srivastava. The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degree Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover on most days, according to IMD officials. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground. The prominent wind direction remained westerly-northwesterly on most of the days. These winds blow from snowcapped western Himalayas towards the plains. Another reason for the below-normal temperatures is La Nina, a phenomenon associated with the cooling of Pacific waters and an antithesis to El Nino.  "Currently, Sea Surface Temperatures are below normal over central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and moderate La Niña conditions are prevailing over the equatorial Pacific Ocean. The latest forecast indicates that the moderate La Niña conditions are likely to continue at least till the end of winter season," the IMD said.  The impact of La Nina was visible as 2020 witnessed above normal monsoon with nine per cent excess rainfall this year. The winter season last year had long spells of cold waves.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/coldest-november-in-delhi-in-71-years-imd-921846.html
30-11-2020||Oasis||The strength of being a woman||Trying to be a man is a waste of a woman,” said Coco Chanel, the legendary French fashion designer and founder of the distinguished Chanel brand. Her words encapsulate the strength of being a woman. It is interesting to note that all accomplished women are those who have grasped the strength of womanhood. The victory of Kamala Harris, the Vice-President-elect, in the recent US election is a testament to this great truth. As a second-generation immigrant and a daughter of mixed parentage, Kamala could have considered herself to be in a vulnerable situation and settled for a mediocre life. Yet, she grasped the strength of her womanhood and was quick to rise from strength to strength. She never once deliberated on the prejudices attached to her lineage. Rather she was quick to grasp all that she could make of her womanhood. This gave her a glimpse of what she could achieve notwithstanding her circumstances of growing up as a second class citizen. Today, she has made history as the first woman, first black woman, first woman of South Asian descent and first daughter of immigrants ever to be elected to the national office of a large and developed country such as the United States of America.  When she takes her seat as the Vice-President of one of the world’s largest democracy in January next year, it will be yet another defining moment of the strength of women.   There is no doubting that the strength of a woman comes from her womanhood. The innate qualities of endurance, empathy, creativity, tolerance, dignity, gentleness, kindness and integrity, among others, that naturally come to women make for their womanhood. These qualities have stood the test of time and won for them the recognition they rightly deserve in the contemporary world.   As C. Joybell C. the author of ‘Sun is snowing’ rightly put it, “The strength of a woman is not measured by the impact that all her hardships in life have had on her; but the strength of a woman is measured by the extent of her refusal to allow those hardships to dictate her and who she becomes.” Grasping the strength of being a woman has empowered many women, including America’s first Vice-President-elect, Kamala Harris!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/the-strength-of-being-a-woman-921473.html
30-11-2020||Opinion||Bitcoin is winning the Covid-19 monetary revolution||By Niall Ferguson In “Shuggie Bain,” Douglas Stuart’s award-winning and harrowing depiction of alcoholism, sectarianism and deprivation in post-industrial Scotland, money is always scarce and often dirty. Deserted by her second husband and unable to hold down a job, Shuggie’s mother, Agnes, relies on her twice-a-week child benefit to feed her children — or her booze habit. As the latter nearly always wins, she and Shuggie are regularly reduced to desperate expedients to fend off starvation: Extracting coins from electricity and television meters, pawning their few valuable possessions, and ultimately selling their bodies for brutal sexual favours.  Stuart vividly captures the miseries of a Glasgow of greasy coins and filthy banknotes. After one of many wretched copulations in the back of a taxi, one of Agnes’s lovers inadvertently showers her with coins from his pocket. Shuggie’s father briefly reappears at one point, handing his son two 20-pence pieces from his taxi’s change dispenser by way of a gift, grudgingly adding four 50-pence pieces when the boy looks nonplused. ﻿(“Don’t ask for mair!”) The “rag-and-bone man,” who goes from house to house buying old clothes and junk, pays “with a roll of grubby pound notes” bound by an old Band-Aid. The image is especially startling because banknotes have so rarely featured in the narrative. The only credit in this world is from rent-to-own catalogues, the Provident doorstep lender, and a few hard-pressed shopkeepers. I grew up in middle-class, mostly sober Glasgow, but I still remember the tyranny of those damned coins: the nightmare of having too few for a bus fare or the wrong sort for a phone box. To my children, all this is as much a part of ancient lore as pirate chests of doubloons once were to me. Coins are fast fading from their lives, soon to be followed by banknotes. In some parts of the world — not only China but also Sweden — nearly all payments are now electronic. In the U.S., debit card transactions have exceeded cash transactions since 2017. Even in Latin America and parts of Africa, cash is yielding to cards and a growing number of people manage their money through their phones. We are living through a monetary revolution so multifaceted that few of us comprehend its full extent. The technological transformation of the internet is driving this revolution. The pandemic of 2020 has accelerated it. To illustrate the extent of our confusion, consider the divergent performance of three forms of money this year: the US dollar, gold and Bitcoin. The dollar is the world’s favourite money, not only dominant in central bank reserves but in international transactions. It is a fiat currency, its supply determined by the Federal Reserve and US banks. We can compute its value relative to the goods consumers buy, according to which measure it has scarcely depreciated this year (inflation is running at 1.2%), or relative to other fiat currencies. On the latter basis, according to Bloomberg’s dollar spot index, it is down 4% since Jan. 1. Gold, by contrast, is up 15% in dollar terms. But the dollar price of a bitcoin has risen 139% year-to-date.   This year’s Bitcoin rally has caught many smart people by surprise. Last week’s high was just below the peak of the last rally ($19,892 according to the exchange Coinbase) in December 2017. When Bitcoin subsequently sold off, the New York University economist Nouriel Roubini didn’t hold back. Bitcoin, he told CNBC in February 2018, had been the “biggest bubble in human history.” Its price would now “crash to zero.” Eight months later, Roubini returned to the fray in congressional testimony, denouncing Bitcoin as the “mother of all scams.” In tweets, he referred to it as “Shitcoin.” Fast forward to November 2020, and Roubini has been forced to change his tune. Bitcoin, he conceded in an interview with Yahoo Finance, was “maybe a partial store of value, because … it cannot be so easily debased because there is at least an algorithm that decides how much the supply of bitcoin raises over time.” If I were as fond of hyperbole as he is, I would call this the biggest conversion since St. Paul. Roubini is not the only one who has been forced to reassess Bitcoin this year. Among the big-name investors who have turned bullish are Paul Tudor Jones, Stan Druckenmiller and Bill Miller. Even Ray Dalio admitted the other day that he “might be missing something” about Bitcoin. Financial journalists, too, are capitulating: On Tuesday, the Financial Times’s Izabella Kaminska, a long-time cryptocurrency skeptic, conceded that Bitcoin had a valid use-case as a hedge against a dystopian future “in which the world slips towards authoritarianism and civil liberties cannot be taken for granted.” She is on to something there, as we shall see. So what is going on? First, we should not be surprised that a pandemic has quickened the pace of monetary evolution. In the wake of the Black Death, as the historian Mark Bailey noted in his masterful 2019 Oxford Ford lectures, there was an increased monetization of the English economy. Prior to the ravages of bubonic plague, the feudal system had bound peasants to the land and required them to pay rent in kind, handing over a share of all produce to their lord. With chronic labor shortages came a shift toward  fixed, yearly tenant rents paid in cash. In Italy, too, the economy after the 1340s became more monetized: It was no accident that the most powerful Italian family of the 15th and 16th centuries were the Medici, who made their fortune as Florentine moneychangers. In a similar way, Covid-19 has been good for Bitcoin and for cryptocurrency generally. First, the pandemic accelerated our advance into a more digital word: What might have taken 10 years has been achieved in 10 months. People who had never before risked an online transaction were forced to try, for the simple reason that banks were closed. Second, and as a result, the pandemic significantly increased our exposure to financial surveillance as well as financial fraud. Both these trends have been good for Bitcoin. I never subscribed to the thesis that Bitcoin would go to zero after it plunged in price in late 2017 and 2018. In the updated 2018 edition of my book, “The Ascent of Money” — the first edition of which appeared more or less simultaneously with the foundational Bitcoin paper by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto — I argued that Bitcoin had established itself as “a new store of value and investment asset — a type of ‘digital gold’ that provides investors with guaranteed scarcity and high mobility, as well as low correlation with other asset classes.” “Satoshi’s goal,” I argued, “was not to create a new money but rather to create the ultimate safe asset, capable of protecting wealth from confiscation in jurisdictions with poor investor protection as well as from the near-universal scourge of currency depreciation … Bitcoin is portable, liquid, anonymous and scarce … A simple thought experiment would imply that $6,000 is therefore a cheap price for this new store of value.” Two years ago, I estimated that around 17 million Bitcoins had been mined. The number of millionaires in the world, according to Credit Suisse, was then 36 million, with total wealth of $128.7 trillion. “If millionaires collectively decided to hold just 1% of their wealth as Bitcoin,” I argued, “the price would be above $75,000 — higher, if adjustment is made for all the bitcoins that have been lost or hoarded. Even if the millionaires held just 0.2% of their assets as Bitcoin, the price would be around $15,000.” We passed $15,000 on Nov. 8. What is happening is that Bitcoin is gradually being adopted not so much as means of payment but as a store of value. Not only high-net-worth individuals but also tech companies are investing. In July, Michael Saylor, the billionaire founder of MicroStrategy, directed his company to hold part of its cash reserves in alternative assets. By September, MicroStrategy’s corporate treasury had purchased bitcoins worth $425 million. Square, the San Francisco-based payments company, bought bitcoins worth $50 million last month. PayPal just announced that American users can buy, hold and sell bitcoins in their PayPal wallets. This process of adoption has much further to run. In the words of Wences Casares, the Argentine-born tech investor who is one of Bitcoin’s most ardent advocates, “After 10 years of working well without interruption, with close to 100 million holders, adding more than 1 million new holders per month and moving more than $1 billion per day worldwide,” it has a 50% chance of hitting a price of $1 million per bitcoin in five to seven years’ time. Whoever he is or was, Satoshi summed up how Bitcoin works: It is “a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash” that allows “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.” In essence, Bitcoin is a public ledger shared by a network of computers. To pay with bitcoins, you send a signed message transferring ownership to a receiver’s public key. Transactions are grouped together and added to the ledger in blocks, and every node in the network has an entire copy of this blockchain at all times. A node can add a block to the chain (and receive a bitcoin reward) only by solving a cryptographic puzzle chosen by the Bitcoin protocol, which consumes processing power. Nodes that have solved the cryptographic puzzle — “miners,” in Bitspeak — are rewarded not only with transaction fees (5 bitcoins per day, on average), but also with additional bitcoins — 900 new bitcoins per day. This reward will get cut in half every four years until the total number of bitcoins reaches 21 million, after which no new bitcoins will be created. There are three obvious defects to Bitcoin. As a means of payment, it is slow. The Bitcoin blockchain can process only around 3,000 transactions every 10 minutes. Transaction costs are not trivial: Coinbase will charge a 1.49% commission if you want to buy one bitcoin. There is also a significant negative externality: Bitcoin’s “proof-of-work” consensus algorithm requires specialized computer chips that consume a great deal of energy — 60 terawatt-hours of electricity a year, just under half the annual electricity consumption of Argentina. Aside from the environmental costs, one unforeseen consequence has been the increasing concentration of Bitcoin mining in a relatively few hands — many of them Chinese — wherever there is cheap energy. But these disadvantages are outweighed by two unique features. First, as we have seen, Bitcoin offers built-in scarcity in a virtual world characterized by boundless abundance. Second, Bitcoin is sovereign. In the words of Casares, “No one can change a transaction in the Bitcoin blockchain and no one can keep the Bitcoin blockchain from accepting new transactions.” Bitcoin users can pay without going through intermediaries such as banks. They can transact without needing governments to enforce the settlement. The advantages of scarcity are obvious at a time when the supply of fiat money is exploding. Take M2, a measure of money that includes cash, bank accounts (including savings deposits) and money market mutual funds. Since May, U.S. M2 has been growing at a year-on-year rate above 20%, compared with an average of 5.9% since 1982. The future weakness of the dollar has been a favourite 2020 talking point for Wall Street economists such as Steve Roach. You can see why. There really are a lot of dollars around, even if their velocity of circulation has slumped because of the pandemic. The advantages of sovereignty are less obvious but maybe more important. Bitcoin is not the only form of digital money that has flourished in 2020. China has been advancing rapidly in two different ways. Nowhere in the world are mobile payments happening on as large a scale as in China, thanks to the spectacular growth of Alipay and WeChat Pay. Those electronic payment platforms now handle close to $40 trillion of transactions a year, more than double the volume of Visa and Mastercard combined, according to calculations by Ribbit Capital. The Chinese platforms are expanding rapidly abroad, partly through investments in local fintech companies by Ant Group and Tencent. At the same time, the People’s Bank of China has accelerated the rollout of its digital currency. The potential for a digital yuan to be adopted for remittance payments or cross-border trade settlements is substantial, especially if — as seems likely — countries participating in the One Belt One Road program are encouraged to use it. Even governments that are resisting Chinese financial penetration, such as India, are essentially building their own versions of China’s electronic payments systems. Some economists, such as my friend Ken Rogoff, welcome the demise of cash because it will make the management of monetary policy easier and organized crime harder. But it will be a fundamentally different world when all our payments are recorded, centrally stored, and scrutinized by artificial intelligence — regardless of whether it is Amazon’s Jeff Bezos or China’s Xi Jinping who can access our data. In its early years, Bitcoin suffered reputational damage because it was adopted by criminals and used for illicit transactions. Such nefarious activity has not gone away, as a recent Justice Department report makes clear. Increasingly, however, Bitcoin has an appeal to respectable individuals and institutions who would like at least some part of their economic lives to be sheltered from the gaze of Big Brother. It is not (as the term “cryptocurrency” misleadingly implies) that Bitcoin is beyond the reach of the law or the taxman. When the Federal Bureau of Investigation busted the online illegal goods market Silk Road in 2013, it showed how readily government agencies can trace the counterparties in suspect Bitcoin transactions. This is precisely because the blockchain is an indelible record of all Bitcoin transactions, complete with senders’ and receivers’ bitcoin addresses. Moreover, the Internal Revenue Service is perfectly prepared to demand information on bitcoin accounts from exchanges, as Coinbase discovered in 2016. A rumor of new U.S. Treasury regulations requiring greater disclosures by exchanges caused a sharp crypto selloff over Thanksgiving. The point is simply that the financial data of law-abiding individuals is better protected by Bitcoin than by Alipay. As the Stanford political theorist Stephen Krasner pointed out more than 20 years ago, sovereignty is a relative concept. Rather than seeking to create a Chinese-style digital dollar, Joe Biden’s nascent administration should recognize the benefits of integrating Bitcoin into the U.S. financial system — which, after all, was originally designed to be less centralized and more respectful of individual privacy than the systems of less-free societies. Life in the East End of Glasgow in the 1980s was nasty, brutish and short of money. But all those transactions in grubby pounds and pence — genuine shitcoins — were, if nothing else, private. If Agnes Bain bought Special Brew instead of oven chips, it was a matter for her, the shopkeeper, and her long-suffering kids; the state was none the wiser. That was scant consolation to poor Shuggie. But, as we have learned again this year, a free society comes at a price that is not always payable in cash.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/bitcoin-is-winning-the-covid-19-monetary-revolution-921574.html
30-11-2020||Opinion||Reshape manufacturing sector to improve FLFPR||When society talks about women empowerment, a fundamental question that arises is how can we measure whether our women are empowered or not. The Female Labour Force Participation Rate (FLFPR) i.e. the section of the female working population in the age group 16 to 64 years in the economy that is currently employed or seeking employment is a good measure of the autonomy and power that women hold in society. For starters, India is one of the worst-performing countries in the world when it comes to women participation in the workforce. As of 2019, India was ranked 175 with 20.52 per cent FLFPR.  Pakistan was ranked at 171 with 21.92 per cent and Bangladesh at 155 with 36.26 per cent. The most obvious question to ask here is why is India’s FLFPR dropping and why it is not on par with China which stands at 60 per cent FLFPR. And why is a country like Bangladesh with similar socio-economic realities, doing better than India? There are multiple cultural and religious barriers for women to get into the labour force. FLFPR is not just an outcome of the economic participation of women; it talks about all the factors that contribute to women working and feeling comfortable to do so. If policymakers are serious about their commitment towards women’s empowerment, they need to pay more attention to setting up industries where barriers of entry are low for women. We can follow Bangladesh's lead and focus on the garment and textile industry. Bangladesh has jumped nearly 10 per cent points in FLFPR since 2006. In India, 80 per cent of the Female Labour force is employed in rural areas, while only 20 per cent in the urban area. More than 70 per cent of the Rural Female Workforce is traditionally engaged in agriculture. In comparison, close to 10 per cent are a part of the manufacturing sector for both rural and urban India, which implies that either the manufacturing sector hasn't kicked off in India or it is just not employing enough women. The former seems more plausible, and that is where policymakers should focus in the coming decade. In 1993-94 the Rural Female Labour Force was 32 per cent  which declined to 9.4 per cent by 2011-12. Niti Ayog,  in a July-September 2015 report on Rural Female Labour Force Participation, states: “This maybe due to the decrease in demand for the products from traditional industries which led to the loss of job for women.” So, focus on manufacturing alone is not sufficient, but a focus on the manufacturing of profitable products is the key. We need to start looking beyond handloom, art and crafts, pottery for the Rural Female Labour force. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry should look at setting up 50 SEZs dedicated to the rural economy. Identify strategic industries for SEZs, which the Central government wants to give a push. These SEZs should be across the country near a Tier 3 town and averaging 500 sq. km. in size. Incentives designed for industries in terms of tax exemption for the first five years, relaxed labour laws ensuring higher participation of women, and tax incentives for companies that have at least 50 per cent women in their workforce can help boost LFPR. The benefits of setting up SEZs are plenty. It stimulates the manufacturing sector as well as facilitates considerable economic growth by an increase in exports and FDI. The Factories Act, 1948 puts restrictions on working hours of women as they are allowed to work in the factory only between 6 am to 7 pm. This results in women not being able to fulfil a significant chunk of their labour requirements. Women should be allowed to work night shifts or perhaps any shift they want to work. Instead, safe transport for women doing night shifts should be arranged. Encouraging women-only buses can go a long way in providing safety for women travelling long distances for work. Thirdly, take teasing, sexual advances, sexual harassment seriously, and this requires a mindset change. Currently, daily wage workers, women from marginalised groups, and many subaltern groups face these challenges in their places of work/employment. Due to social pressures, these cases go unreported and often are tied up in litigation for several months after the first report. Until the time business owners face intense pressure from the community and the government, regarding guidelines for the prevention of sexual harassment, factories will not be a safe workplace for women. While the Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) Act have made significant inroads in corporate workspaces, we are yet to see some best practices replicated in rural areas. Setting up SEZs will be an excellent opportunity to extend protection to women working in rural areas. Ensuring more women join the workforce should be a national concern. There is a limit to which economics can solve the problem. There has to be a change in mindsets for women to be empowered.

30-11-2020||Panorama||Select only competent academics as vice-chancellors||In recent years, academic circles are anguished that non-performers are occupying the position of vice-chancellors (VCs), sending wrong signals to stakeholders. If such persons are rewarded with top academic positions, students and faculty members would be disillusioned.  About 30 state universities in Karnataka are governed by different procedures for appointment of VCs. A common set of procedures for appointment of VCs by amending the relevant provisions is called for.  Search committees constituted for selection of VCs enjoy total freedom of function, owing to the high level of academic expertise involved and are solely responsible for the names of persons empanelled. The roles of the government and the Chancellor are subsequent to and entirely dependent on the panel forwarded by the search committee. The search committee is mandated by the relevant Act to empanel only eminent academicians and assist the government and the Chancellor in choosing a good academician. Powers, duties and responsibilities of the search committee may need to be redefined so that the desired objectives are obtained. New universities are established to fulfil the special needs of a region, special purpose or theme to promote knowledge. To fulfil these goals, it is fundamental to appoint the first vice-chancellor with the required experience and academic leadership to ensure that the new university takes strong roots quickly.  At present, there are no particular standards for the appointment of VCs. For instance, it is prudent to appoint an accomplished woman academician as the first VC of the new Maharani Cluster University. Therefore, and notwithstanding anything else mentioned in the various universities’ Acts, the government should prudently use its special powers to nominate an accomplished academician as the first VC to ensure a strong foundation.   In general, the screening process need not be limited to the applicants alone; if necessary an eminent academician may be invited from any part of the country or even an NRI to demonstrate that merit alone is under consideration.  Relevance to NEP My recommendation to appoint visionaries to lead universities finds ample support in the NEP as it identifies sub-optimal leadership and governance of Higher Education Institutions as one of the key weaknesses (performance drags) of the higher educational ecosystem in the country.  The NEP also prescribes that in addition to the top leadership, all other leadership positions in an HEI should be offered to persons with high academic qualifications. In essence, NEP has explicitly put in place a governance system for an HEI with a visionary as the leader. Section 19.4 of NEP prescribes that all leadership positions (not only the Head) in institutions must be offered to persons with high academic qualifications and demonstrated administrative and leadership capabilities along with abilities to manage complex situations.  Leaders of HEIs must demonstrate strong alignment to Constitutional values and the overall vision of the institution, along with attributes such as a strong social commitment, belief in teamwork, pluralism, and have a positive outlook. Leadership changes will come with sufficient overlaps, and not remain vacant, in order to ensure smooth transitions. Outstanding leaders will be identified and developed early, working their way through a ladder of leadership positions.   The key tasks expected of a VC in the 21st century, as detailed in the quotes from NEP, set very high expectations. He/she has the challenging task of aligning the university with the aspirational mandates of the NEP by: Revamping the administrative system to deliver expected services Exercise powers with caution and prudence to perform to full potential, in the best interest of the institution and the nation Ensure a congenial academic ambience, a research culture Chose competent academicians and educationists to the key positions of Academic Council and the Syndicate/Executive Council Organise a Mentoring system to help the affiliated colleges attain competence for self-governance (autonomous status) Usher in the new four-year undergraduate degree format and devise mechanisms and processes to ensure that students’ choice prevails; Ensure maximum placement/employment opportunities for the graduates by establishing a university-industry linkage In essence, lead the university from the front in academic, administrative and research sphered, to inspire staff and students. Obviously, only an accomplished visionary-academician qualifies for the post of a VC to deliver the above solutions; appointing a VC merely on qualifications on paper without real academic accomplishments would be self-defeating.   My recommendations: The government should initiate urgent steps to align the procedures for appointment of VCs with my recommendations and the aspirational mandates of the NEP. In addition to academic excellence, a VC appointee should have high integrity; otherwise, the cure would be worsethan the disease.   Prudence should be exercised by the authorities nominating experts to the screening committees. Appointing administrators as members of screening committees is unwarranted and anti-academic, else it will defeat the aspirations articulated by the NEP. The government should demonstrate its commitment to promote merit and NEP to appoint a visionary and accomplished academician as the first VC of a new university.  In about a decade or so, all the colleges would move towards self-governance and autonomy as degree awarding institutions. Therefore, the stringent yardsticks prescribed by NEP for leadership of HEIs are also equally applicable to the Principals/Directors.  In view of my and NEP recommendations, it is incumbent upon the government to bring modifications to the existing Act. The issues discussed above, should be reflected with appropriate emphasis to carry forward the objectives of NEP.  (The writer is Adviser, Education Reforms, Government of Karnataka)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/select-only-competent-academics-as-vice-chancellors-921471.html
30-11-2020||Panorama||Off the record||Quid pro quo? The Indian Union Muslim League, a key coalition partner of the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kerala, is left shamefaced as three leaders of the party are now facing serious allegations. Former minister V K Ebrahim Kunju was arrested on corruption charges, MLA M C Kamaruddin was arrested by the police for allegedly cheating investors in his jewellery business and K M Shaji MLA faced a vigilance probe for allegedly accepting a bribe from a school. Ebrahim Kunju and Shaji were also under the ED scanner. In a recent press conference, party senior leader and Lok Sabha MP P K Kunhalikutty, while alleging that the cases against party MLAs were politically motivated, commented that when the UDF was in power, many such complaints had popped up against left front leaders but the UDF had not initiated cases. This statement has been widely dubbed on social media as a quid pro quo. Arjun Raghunath, Thiruvananthapuram  Rare praise  Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to vaccine manufacturing units over the weekend has brought out generational differences in the Congress. While young Congress leaders mocked the Prime Minister’s visit to vaccine makers Serum Institute, Zydus Cadila and Bharat Biotech as a “fancy dress” event, veteran leader Anand Sharma hailed it as a recognition of the achievement of scientists. Sharma said the PM’s visit would lift the morale of the frontline warriors and reassure the nation – rich praise from a person who earlier lost no opportunity to criticise the Prime Minister. Sharma, who is among the 233 dissenters in the Congress, also urged the PM to ensure that an efficient and equitable platform is functional as the vaccine arrives. Sagar Kulkarni, New Delhi Diamond rush Social media posts about some glittering stones at Wakching village in Mon district in Nagaland triggered a rush among villagers last week to dig up stones on the hills, suspecting these to be diamonds. There was so much of a rush that the Nagaland government had to send in a team of geologists to the coal mining site. An investigation suggested that the “diamond rush” has arisen after some traders in Assam bought those glittering stones for lakhs of rupees from villagers and spread rumours that these stones were diamond. Geologists, who carried out a study at said that the stones were quartz, not diamonds. Quartz is far cheaper than diamond, but it still has some use. Although the rush at the site has reduced, people continue to dig up other stones on the hills, in search of “costly materials”.  Sumir Karmakar, Guwahati.  Changing loyalties  The other day, Junaid Mattu became the mayor of Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC) for the second time after winning the mayoral elections. Mattu was removed as the SMC mayor in June after he lost a no-confidence motion moved against him by some corporators. He had then claimed that the BJP and National Conference had joined hands in Srinagar to remove him. Interestingly, he had won the 2018 elections with the BJP’s support. However, immediately after sitting on the ‘hot-seat’, Mattu, who was formerly associated with the National Conference and People’s Conference, joined Apni Party, which is believed to be a proxy of the BJP. Mattu, who returned from the US barely a decade ago to join politics, has a history of changing parties and ‘loyalties’ at will. Some compare him with late Ram Vilas Paswan, who knew the ‘art’ of changing friends and ‘loyalties’ to remain relevant in politics. Zulfikar Majid, Srinagar  Pawar’s humour NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, who will turn 80 next month, has a subtle sense of humour. Often, he displays it on public platforms and sends people to peals of laughter. Last week, senior BJP leader and Union Minister of State Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Raosaheb Patil-Danve said the BJP government will be formed in the state in the next two to three months as the Maha Vikas Aghadi government will collapse. However, in a lighter vein Pawar gave a befitting reply. “Raosaheb Patil-Danve has been an MP and politician for years but I didn’t know of this quality of his. In politics, he was never known as a ‘jyotishi’ but now I know that he has this talent too,” he said. Mrityunjay Bose, Mumbai||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/off-the-record-921472.html
30-11-2020||Right in the Middle||A joyful gift||As the sun set on another tiring day, I made my way to the fifth floor of the hospital building to pick up my friend. The towering glass roof basked in the evening sun, bathing the entire floor in a golden-orange hue. A young girl ran into the middle of the corridor, her laughter resounding in the quiet of the late evening. Oblivious of her grim surroundings, she bumped into my legs. Her bright, hazel eyes shone into mine. “Harnoor, come here”, a woman’s voice from behind made her wriggle out of my hands. She ran towards her mother, flashing a radiant smile at me. In the ward, my friend was busy filling case sheets. “Are you done?” I asked him. “Almost”, he said, barely looking up.  A burst of squealing laughter slowly became louder. It was Harnoor. She walked into the ward, with a pompous. Bemused onlookers stared at her as she strode past in gay abandon. As I washed my hands in the side room, looking at the mirror, I took in my unkempt appearance. At the edge of the mirror, a child’s face peeped into the door for a split second and vanished. I dashed to the door, and there she was! Her laughter was a mix of innocence, mischief, ingenuity and pure joy which only a child can have. Then, standing in the middle of the ward, she gave that peculiar, unmistakable expression. Half scared, half delighted, a little guilty and a little innocent. A tiny stream trickled past her legs as she soon found herself in a puddle of urine! As her mother changed her clothes, she watched me with amusement. I hid my face behind the wall and suddenly reappeared. She was in splits. She looked at me again, expecting me to repeat the act. And I did. Having nothing better to do, we started doing this repeatedly. She burst into laughter every time. Such a small girl, boundless enthusiasm, enormous joy. Indefatigable. Truly the father of man! My friend was finally ready to go. “Who is this girl?” I asked him. She was now in her mother’s arms, innocently rubbing her eyes and yawning. “Stage IV neuroblastoma with metastasis (a form of cancer of the nerve cells), poor prognosis, did not opt for therapy, going home tomorrow”, he muttered in a single breath. A breath that shook me back from a refreshing reverie into the ruthless reality that surrounded me.  Harnoor’s reverie continued. Safely asleep on her mother’s shoulder, with a quiet smile on her lips, her face gleamed under the crimson sun. True to her name, a ‘gift of God’!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/a-joyful-gift-921470.html
30-11-2020||Second Edit||Take steps to heal ties||India’s security forces have done well to avert a major terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir. The attack, which was said to have been masterminded by Abdul Rauf Asgar, brother-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar, was reportedly aimed at disrupting the district development council elections in Kashmir. To this end, the terror group dispatched four operatives from Pakistan into India. However, their mission was unsuccessful, as security forces intercepted the truck they were travelling in, at a checkpoint in Nagrota. All four were killed in the exchange of fire that followed. Indian intelligence agencies have found strong evidence pointing to an ISI hand. Not only are the weapons and other materials found in the truck and on the body of the four terrorists were made in Pakistan but also complex logistics were involved in sending them across the border into India. This would not have been possible without the support of the Pakistani state.  The terrorists used a 200-metre-long tunnel under the International Border at Samba to enter India. Digging the tunnel required engineering equipment and infiltrating a heavily fortified border would not have been possible without the support of the Pakistani military. In addition to summoning the Pakistani charge d’affaires in New Delhi to protest the Jaish attack, India has begun briefing foreign diplomats about Pakistan’s role in the foiled Nagrota attack. It has provided them with evidence and information pointing to Islamabad’s continuing aiding and abetting of anti-India terrorism. Securing the support of the international community on the issue of Pakistan’s sponsoring of terrorism and getting it to isolate Pakistan has been an important part of India’s counter-terrorism strategy. This has served to some extent to mobilising support of governments for blacklisting of Pakistani terrorists and Pakistan-backed groups. However, drawing foreign governments to deal with Pakistan will lay India open to the possibility of these countries offering India help in resolving Kashmir. As a large, sovereign and democratic country, India is fully capable of addressing its problems. Ultimately, New Delhi has to beef up its own defences: strengthen its intelligence gathering and improve border management to prevent terrorists from infiltrating. Pakistani terrorists entering India need local guides and transporters to help them execute their plans. They would not find such support if locals were not as angry and alienated from the Indian state as they are today.  New Delhi must act to heal the relationship with Kashmiris and address their grievances. Once that is done, Pakistan’s attempts to fish in troubled waters would not be successful.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/take-steps-to-heal-ties-921465.html
30-11-2020||South||Rahul Gandhi to discuss assembly elections with Tamil Nadu Congress leaders||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will, on Monday evening, hold discussions with senior leaders of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) regarding the party’s plans for the assembly elections due in the first half of 2021. The discussions via video conferencing will see the participation of TNCC President K S Alagiri, working presidents, Congress Working Committee (CWC) member and senior leader P Chidambaram, MPs, MLAs, AICC secretaries hailing from Tamil Nadu, former TNCC chief E V K S Elangovan and other senior leaders. AICC General Secretary K C Venugopal will moderate the discussion that will begin at 4 pm, sources told Deccan Herald, adding that Gandhi will elicit the opinion of the party leaders as the assembly elections are just six months away. The meeting assumes significance in the wake of media reports that the Congress was planning to leave the DMK-led alliance and stitch together a Third Front with parties like Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) led by actor Kamal Haasan. “The meeting will put a full-stop to all these speculations. Rahul Gandhi will discuss the Congress’ plans for the assembly elections with senior leaders. He will seek their opinion on the issues to be raised by the party during the campaign,” a senior leader who will attend the meeting told DH. He added that the Congress has been making it clear every now and then that its alliance with DMK was “intact”. “Our leader Rahul Gandhi had proposed M K Stalin as the Chief Ministerial candidate of the DMK-led alliance in 2019 and there is no deviation from the stand,” he said. During the meeting, TNCC leaders are likely to ask Gandhi to “actively campaign” in Tamil Nadu where he “enjoys considerable support” for the alliance. “This meeting is all about planning for the assembly elections. We want Gandhi to campaign actively in Tamil Nadu and we will stress this fact during the meeting. This will help the alliance greatly,” another senior leader said. Gandhi’s meeting with Tamil Nadu leaders comes a fortnight after AICC in-charge of the state, Dinesh Gundu Rao, making it clear that the party will not “bargain” for seats during talks with the DMK. His comments were made after speculation that the DMK may not “gift many seats” like it did in 2016, following Congress’ “poor performance” in Bihar assembly elections. Congress and DMK have been in an alliance since 2004, except for three years between 2013 and 2016.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/rahul-gandhi-to-discuss-assembly-elections-with-tamil-nadu-congress-leaders-921552.html

While classes for students who have enrolled for UG and PG medical courses in the 2020-2021 academic year will begin on December 1, students who are in the final year in medical colleges will have to report at the institutes from December 7. The relaxations were announced by Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami who extended the Covid-19 lockdown till December 31, 2020. He also said Marina Beach will be opened for public from December 14, while allowing political and religious functions inside auditoriums with a cap of 200 participants. In a statement, Palaniswami said classes for final year students of all UG courses in arts and science, engineering, technology, fisheries, veterinary, in all colleges and universities will resume on December 7. He added that hostel facilities in the above institutions will also function. “By following standard operating procedure, classes for all UG and PG medical courses will begin from December 7. However, the classes for freshers in UG and PG medical courses will begin on February 1,2021. Hostels will also function,” Palaniswami said. He also announced that swimming pools will function from December one, while exhibition halls can be opened for business to business purposes. He also announced that the government will allow meetings of political parties, religious and social organisations inside auditoriums capping the number of participants at 200. However, e-registration will continue for people coming to the state from other states except Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Puducherry. Palaniswami said the relaxations are being announced as the state has witnessed a down slide in the number of people testing positive for Covid-19.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/classes-for-final-year-ug-students-in-tamil-nadu-to-begin-from-dec-7-921565.html

They aired their views. I also shared my views with them. They assured me that they will stand by me whatever decision I take. I will announce my decision as early as possible,” Rajinikanth told reporters here. He was speaking to reporters after a nearly two-hour discussion with district secretaries of Rajini Makkal Mandram, an extension of his fans’ club, at Raghavendra Kalyana Mandapam owned by him. Around 300 fans gathered outside the marriage hall on Monday to give a rousing reception to their Thalaivar. After the meeting, Rajinikanth made a brief appearance on the balcony of the meeting venue, sending his fans into raptures. Sources told Deccan Herald that the actor did admit that his health condition may not “cooperate” in indulging in intense campaigning due to the situation arising out of Covid-19. The actor had, in October, admitted that he underwent a renal transplant in 2016 while suggesting that it would be very difficult for him to keep himself immune from Covid-19 if he takes the political plunge and meets people. “The decision that he finally takes may be disappointing for us. That is the sense we got after the meeting,” a source in the actor’s camp said on condition of anonymity. They added that the actor did explain his health issues to his fans during the meeting. Speculations that the “decision” may come as early as Monday evening also got credence, as today is the birth anniversary of Mahavatar Babaji, whom Rajinikanth considers his guru. Rajinikanth had, on the last day of 2017, announced that he will launch his own political party and contest the assembly elections. However, the actor did not take any concrete steps to build his party in the past three years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/rajinikanth-meets-office-bearers-of-fans-association-says-decision-on-entering-politics-very-soon-921588.html
30-11-2020||South||Hyderabad gears up for civic polls after fiery campaigns||The stage is set for polling on Tuesday in the Hyderabad civic polls which witnessed a high decibel campaign resembling an Assembly or parliamentary election with top leaders from different parties participating in the electioneering. As many as 74,44,260 voters would exercise their franchise using ballot papers to elect their representatives in the 150-ward Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), according to official data. The polling would begin at 7 AM and come to an end at 6 PM. The total number of contesting candidates is 1,122. The Telangana State Election Commission (SEC) has made elaborate arrangements for the balloting process by deploying 48,000 (including reserve) polling personnel and 52,500 strong police force. The Commission had decided to conduct the election with ballot papers after obtaining the views of major political parties, Health department in view of Covid-19 and taking into consideration various relevant issues, it said earlier. The SEC has conducted a campaign, featuring some film personalities, to motivate the electorate to vote. Observing that all arrangements, including those in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, have been made for smooth polling, State Election Commissioner C Parathasarathi has appealed to the voters to exercise their franchise. Buoyed by its victory in the recent bypoll to Dubbak Assembly constituency, the BJP conducted a powerful campaign to win the GHMC polls. It has drafted its General Secretary Bhupendra Yadav, who has been its in-charge for Bihar, to supervise the preparation for the poll in Hyderabad. Top leaders, including Union Home Minister Amit Shah, party president J P Nadda, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Union Ministers Prakash Javadekar, Smriti Irani and MoS (Home) G Kishan Reddy, who is Lok Sabha member from Secunderabad, party MP and BJYM national president Tejaswi Surya participated in the campaign. The BJP highlighted the TRS' "alliance" with the AIMIM and sought votes to provide clean and transparent governance in the city. The TRS, however, denied any alliance with the AIMIM. The TRS' campaign was led by its Working President and state Municipal Administration Minister K T Rama Rao, while party supremo and Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao addressed a public meeting. The state's ruling party has deployed several state ministers and legislators for canvassing in the city. The Congress campaign was led by its state president N Uttam Kumar Reddy and Working President A Revanth Reddy and other senior leaders. Once a major force in the state, but marginalised now, the TDP sought to revive its fortunes highlighting the development witnessed in the city, including in the IT sector, during N Chandrababu Naidu's regime as Chief Minister in undivided Andhra Pradesh. The TRS and BJP leaders were engaged in a war of words attacking each other. BJP's Telangana president Bandi Sanjay Kumar found himself in a row following his comments that his party would conduct a "surgical strike" in the old city here to send away Rohingyas and Pakistanis after it wins the post of Mayor in the polls. AIMIM's Akbaruddin Owaisi in a poll campaign earned the wrath of his opponents by asking whether the 'samadhis' of former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao and TDP founder N T Rama Rao, built on the Hussain Sagar lake bank, would be removed as he questioned the eviction drive against "poor people" residing near water bodies.

As the southern state is gearing up for the local body polls due next month, an array of candidates are grabbing the headlines not for their political ideology nor their poll promises, but for their strange and unique names. From Brasilia and Lookman to Corona and JP 77, a majority of these candidates feel that strange names are giving them an edge over their political opponents as people identify and remember them easily. K King Kong, a 57-year old Congress nominee, was one among the most notable candidates in the impending LSGD polls in the southern state who have grabbed attention due to their unique names. The very name "King Kong" would bring the image of the giant gorilla in Hollywood movies for many. But, this candidate King Kong is a soft-spoken person who is trying his political luck from the fourth ward of Mararikkulam North Village Panchayat. Admitting that his name was strange, King Kong said he was happy for it now as the name helps him become the centre of attraction easily. "My parents and elder siblings, who were hardcore fans of Hollywood movies, are responsible for my name," he said. "Though many people have tried to make fun of me over my name earlier, it has now become a blessing in disguise during the campaign as I feel people are showing a special interest in me due to my name," the candidate added. A football-crazy uncle had gifted Brasilia, a United Democratic Front (IUML) candidate, her unique name. Contesting from Payyanakkal ward of northern Kozhikode district, she said her uncle was a huge fan of the Brazilian soccer team. "My family was looking for a good name starting with the alphabet B When the uncle suggested this name, everyone accepted it," Brasilia said. The name of the BJP candidate in Kayanna village panchayat of Kozhikode may also sound very strange-JP 77. He said his father, an RSS worker, was a great admirer of freedom fighter Jayaprakash Narayan. "In his memory that I was named as JP, how Jayaprakash Narayan was popularly known among his followers. As an RSS activist, my father was jailed during the time of emergency in the year 1977. So, in remembrance of his jail term, 77 was also added to my name," he said. Nowhere else in this world other than Mathilil ward in Kollam Corporation, the word 'Corona' would be used with love and affection as the name of the young BJP candidate contesting from there is Corona Thomas. "My parents never would have thought that this name would becomea synonym for a viral disease one day and the whole world would hear it with fear. But, now I am happy that my rare name is helping voters to identify me easily," she told P T I. Do not argue with anyone if they say that Modi is contesting in the upcoming LSGD polls in Kerala, that too as a CPI(M) candidate because it is true. Jijo Modi, a journalist-turned politician, is seeking his luck from Malayalappuzha district panchayat division in Pathanamthitta district. Though Modi is not a rare name, this candidate is making heads turn as he seeks votes on the CPI(M)'s symbol- hammer, sickle and star. Rani Jhansi, Bilkul P K, Lookman, Vichitran were some other candidates who have garnered attention through their unique names. A total of 74,899 candidates including 36,305 women and one transgender, are trying their luck in the upcoming local body polls in Kerala. Malappuram district has 8,387 candidates, the highest in the state, while Wayanad has the lowest at 1,857. While the first phase of the three-tier poll, scheduled on December 8, would cover the districts of Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha and Idukki, the second phase is on December 10. It would be held in Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad and Wayanad while Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur and Kasaragod would go to the polls in the third and final phase on December 14. An electorate of over 2.76 crore would exercise their franchise to elect representatives to 941 gram panchayats, 152 block panchayats, 14 district panchayats, 86 municipalities and six municipal corporations. The votes would be counted on December 16.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/from-king-kong-jp-77-to-brasilia-and-corona-name-matters-more-in-kerala-civic-polls-921612.html

The depression lay centred about 680 km east-south-east of Trincomalee in Eastern Sri Lanka and 1,090 km east of Kanyakumari, the southernmost tip of the Indian mainland at 11.30 am on Monday. “It is very likely to intensify further into a Deep Depression during the next 12 hours. It is also likely to intensify further into a Cyclonic Storm during subsequent 24 hours. It is very likely to move west-north-westwards and cross the Sri Lanka coast around the evening of December 2. It is very likely to move nearly westwards thereafter and emerge into the Comorin area (Kanyakumari) on December 3,” the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said in its forecast.

30-11-2020||South||Kerala high-speed rail project in troubled waters||Kerala's much hyped Semi-High Speed Rail corridor, Silver Line, project that aims at reducing the travel time between Thiruvananthapuram in the South to Kasargod in the North to four hours from at least ten hours required now, is running into troubled waters in the initial stages itself. Protests against the project, especially due to the massive land acquisition and displacements of households involved, has now gained momentum with the NITI Aayog also raising serious concerns over the viability of the project. An action council formed against the project has called for an agitation in front of the state Secretariat on December 3. The Opposition Congress in Kerala has also came out in the open against the project and sought an all-party meeting before it is taken forward. Kerala Rail Development Corporation, a joint venture company of Kerala government and Railways Ministry for the infrastructure development of railways, is implementing the 529.45 kilometre rail line project with an estimated cost of Rs 63,941 crore. However, NITI Aayog said in a recent communication to the Kerala government that it would require at least Rs 1.33 lakh crore. At least 1,383 hectares of land is need to be acquired for the project, which would involve displacement of at least 20,000 families, even as the authorities maintained that the rail line would be laid through less-populated regions in order to minimise displacement of households. Another major concern being raised against the project is the environmental impact as the project involves acquiring wetlands. Proposed fare of Rs 2.75 per km in standard class is also quite exorbitant compared to the existing modes of transport. S Rajeevan, general convener of the action council against the project, said that the announcements of high compensation to the evictees would remain more or less on papers. Plight of hundreds of families evicted for similar projects earlier are instance, he said. He also said that instead of investing heavily in a green field project, the existing rail line could be improved by straightening the curves and thereby reducing travel time. Even as Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that attempts to sabotage major infrastructure projects would not be allowed, leader of opposition Ramesh Chennithala demanded the government to convene an all-party meeting before initiating land acquisition for the project. The project proposed to be commissioned by 2025 also aims at decongesting the roads apart from reducing the travel time. Trains that could run at a speed of 200 kilometre per hour are proposed to be operated. The passenger carrying capacity would be 675 in business and standard classes and the number of stations are eleven.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-high-speed-rail-project-in-troubled-waters-921683.html

The Customs probing into the gold smuggling case said in a report submitted at a court in Kochi seeking extension of custody of Sivasankar that there was link between the gold smuggling and dollar smuggling cases. Earlier there were reports that Sivasankar helped gold smuggling accused Swapna Suresh convert Rs 1.90 crore to US dollars and it was handed over to an Egyptian national Khaled Mohamed Ali Shoukry, who was a former employee of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. Swapna was learnt to have stated that Sivasankar was aware of the illegality in the transaction and smuggling of dollars. Customs already registered a case in connection with dollar smuggling. Sivasankar is likely to be arraigned in the case. Meanwhile, Chief Minister's additional private secretary C M Raveendran is likely to appear before Enforcement Directorate for quizzing. Though the ED earlier issued summons to him twice, he did not turn up citing Covid infection and treatment for post-Covid ailments. The ED carried out verification at some premises, including those associated with Kerala government, as part of the investigation. The investigation agencies are also suspecting that gold smuggling was carried out through ships also.

30-11-2020||South||Tamil parties condemn Centre's move to air Sanskrit bulletin||Political parties in Tamil Nadu on Monday scoffed at the Union Government’s decision to air a 15-minute news bulletin in Sanskrit everyday on Doordarshan, seeking to know why “undue advantage” is being given to a language which is spoke “just by a few thousand” people. DMK President M K Stalin, PMK founder S Ramadoss, MDMK chief Vaiko, VCK chief Thol. Thirumavalavan, and a couple of MPs issued separate statements condemning the move by the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. They said several efforts are being made to impose Hindi and Sanskrit ever since the BJP came to power in 2014. “Why is the BJP government trying to impose a language that is not being spoken now? Only 15,000 people across the country speak Sanskrit and such moves are nothing but cultural invasion. The Centre should stop such activities,” Stalin said. VCK MP D Ravikumar said according to the 2011 census, only 803 people in Tamil Nadu spoke Sanskrit and questioned the need for a 15-minute news bulletin. “Why cannot the government telecast bulletins in languages that are spoken by crores of people?” he questioned. Madurai MP and award-winning writer Su Venkatesan also asked why the government was giving “undue importance and preference” to a language that is not spoken by many. The move by the Centre comes amidst a renewed debate in Tamil Nadu over “Hindi imposition.” DMK MP Kanimozhi was in August last asked by a CISF personnel if she was an Indian for not knowing Hindi, while doctors from Tamil Nadu were allegedly asked to leave a meeting for not knowing the language. MPs from the state have also been complaining that ministers and government secretaries respond to their letters in Hindi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-parties-condemn-centres-move-to-air-sanskrit-bulletin-921744.html

Gandhi was addressing senior party leaders via video-conferencing on the party’s plans for the assembly elections due in the first half of 2021. The meeting discussed ways to strengthen the Secular Progressive Alliance led by the DMK of which Congress is a part and how to identify seats to be contested by the party. The discussions via video conferencing was attended by TNCC President K S Alagiri, working presidents, Congress Working Committee (CWC) members P Chidambaram, Manickam Tagore, and A Chellakumar, and MPs, MLAs, AICC secretaries hailing from Tamil Nadu, former TNCC chief E V K S Elangovan, K V Thangabalu and other senior leaders. Moderated by AICC General Secretary K C Venugopal, the meeting also decided to campaign against the “anti-Tamil” activities of the BJP government like Hindi imposition, and conducting of NEET exam. The meeting assumed significance in the wake of media reports that the Congress was planning to leave the DMK-led alliance and stitch together a Third Front with parties like Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) led by actor Kamal Haasan. While mentioning that the Congress was a formidable force in Tamil Nadu despite not being in power for 50 years, Gandhi said the party can be strengthened further if efforts are put in, Alagiri quoted Rahul as saying. During the meeting, TNCC leaders are understood to have asked Gandhi to “actively campaign” in Tamil Nadu where he “enjoys considerable support” for the alliance. Gandhi’s meeting with Tamil Nadu leaders came a fortnight after AICC in-charge of the state, Dinesh Gundu Rao, making it clear that the party will not “bargain” for seats during talks with the DMK. His comments were made after speculation that the DMK may not “gift many seats” like it did in 2016, following Congress’ “poor performance” in Bihar assembly elections. Congress and DMK have been in an alliance since 2004, except for three years between 2013 and 2016.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/efforts-being-taken-to-strengthen-dmk-led-alliance-tncc-tells-rahul-gandhi-921784.html
30-11-2020||South||BJP, TRS engage in accusations day before GHMC polls||The BJP and TRS were engaged in accusations and counter-charges on Monday, a day before the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polls. Arrangements are made for the 74.67 lakh registered voters in the city to exercise their franchise on Tuesday to elect the new civic body of 150 wards from among the 1122 candidates. Paper ballots and boxes are being used, instead of the EVMs in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The civic body polls dubbed as a “gully vs Delhi fight” by the TRS leaders, saw an unprecedented level of campaigning from the BJP involving its top guns including party chief JP Nadda and Home Minister Amit Shah. The ruling TRS too took the poll seriously and even held a large public meeting addressed by Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, in its attempt to match the 99 wards it had won in 2016. The GHMC, presently governed by the TRS, has a total of 150 wards. TRS is contesting in 150, BJP in 149, Congress in 146, and the AIMIM in 51 seats. Asaduddin Owaisi's party had contested in 60 seats last time and won 44 wards. Confining its contest in areas of influence in the old city now, AIMIM hopes to win around the same number of seats. On Sunday, soon after the campaigning officially ended, BJP alleged that the TRS leaders were distributing money to influence the voters. In a letter to the State Election Commission, T-BJP complained that their election office in Chaitanyapuri was damaged by the TRS activists and that when complained, the police have instead attacked their party men. On Monday, BJP has led a protest at the SEC office, alleging that the police were acting in a biased manner, not acting on their complaints. The TRS leaders have brushed aside the complaints as BJP's false accusations. Meanwhile, the state election commission and police officials stated that all election arrangements are in place. Voters have to wear a mask to enter the polling station. Cell phones, other electronic gadgets are prohibited inside. In view of Covid-19, sanitization is carried at every polling station a day before and on the polling day, sanitizers provided at the entry/exit points and markings made for social distancing in the voter queues, officials said. Counting is on 4 December. GHMC elections stats:  Number of registered electors - 74,67,256 Number of wards - 150 Number of contesting candidates - 1122 Number of polling stations - 9101 Number of ballot boxes - 18202 Number of polling personnel - 36,404||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/bjp-trs-engage-in-accusations-day-before-ghmc-polls-921790.html

He also accused a 'media syndicate' of working against him. Allegations suggesting Srivastava's crucial role in the recent decision to amend the Kerala Police Act, which had to be withdrawn hardly 24 hours after it was passed owing to criticism, as well as vigilance raids at a financial institution of the state government had surfaced. Vijayan, however, told reporters on Monday that Srivastava had no role in the two incidents. The chief minister said that a vigilance raid at Kerala State Financial Enterprises (KSFE) was a normal procedure as a part of intelligence inputs gathered by the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau. Raids have been carried out at many such institutions in the past as well, he added. Vijayan also alleged that a media syndicate was working against him again and baseless reports were being given against him. Attempts to create a rift among the CPM leaders would also not work, he said, referring to reports regarding Finance Minister Thomas Isaac stating that the vigilance raid at KSFE was a mad decision. There were allegations that the vigilance raids at the KSFE were aimed at destroying the credibility of the institution and thereby helping private players in the field.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-defends-advisor-targets-media-syndicate-921814.html

30-11-2020||State||Babu-neta nexus denies quota benefit to SC/ST contractors||The people's representatives and officials in local administrations have come up with a few tactics to deny compulsory reservation for SC/ST contractors in projects below Rs 50 lakh. In order to deny contractors from the communities from claiming 24.45% reservation in these projects, authorities are learnt to have either floated tenders slightly above Rs 50 lakh or split the project into 10 piece-works, work orders for which are allegedly issued without tenders. Owing to complaints, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department has issued a circular to list all projects below Rs 50 lakh at the beginning of the fiscal, and randomly select 24.45% of the projects for SC/ST contractors. N Mahadevaswamy, president of Karnataka State SC/ST Contractors Association, said that authorities had devised these measures to bypass contract reservation ever since the state government made it mandatory in June 2017. “According to the government order, 17.5% of the works are reserved for Scheduled Castes, while 6.95% is reserved for contractors from Scheduled Tribes. But it is being denied due to manipulation by authorities who are in cahoots with local panchayat members,” he alleged. The Association has now urged the government to increase projects where reservation is applicable to Rs 1 cr. “Authorities float tenders for Rs 51 lakh or Rs 52 lakh or split projects costing Rs 50 lakh to smaller piece-works,” he said. These works which will be below the amount required to float a tender are then sanctioned to contractors of their choice, so as to deny SC/ST contractors, he alleged. Piece-works are in violation of government directions which prohibits it, as they incur additional expenses, Mahadevaswmay added. Apart from it, smaller projects were also clubbed together to increase the project cost beyond Rs 50 lakh. Based on these complaints, the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department has issued an order prohibiting the same. “If projects costing less than Rs 50 lakh is clubbed as a package, SC/ST contractors do not get reservation benefit. Therefore, all projects below Rs 50 lakh should be listed in the beginning of the year, and measures should be taken to ensure 24.1% of the projects are selected via randmoization and reserved for SC/ST contractors,” according to directions issued by L K Atheeq, Principal Secretary, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/babu-neta-nexus-denies-quota-benefit-to-sc/st-contractors-921449.html

Considering the clinical environment within which the colleges work on a daily basis, the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS) has issued stringent guidelines to students and staff. As per the Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) issued by the RGUHS, all students and faculty members must undergo RTPCR tests latest by 72 hours before reporting to attend college. No conferences The university has advised all colleges to avoid conferences, seminars, workshops and interviews till the pandemic ceases. Keeping in mind the lurking threat, elder employees, pregnant employees shall not be posted to frontline work at hospitals, clinics. The university has advised colleges to post only final-year students and post-graduate interns to work at the Covid-designated centres or hospitals. “Junior students shall be given low priority and deliberately restricted from working in high-risk areas,” the SoP says.

Disinfection As the students are exposed to clinical facilities in the colleges particularly during practical sessions, all students have been advised to disinfect themselves before leaving the premises and before entering the hostels. All students both in college and hostel are advised to wear surgical masks. “Students shall use disinfectant solution to wash hands, feet before leaving the campus. Hostels must provide separate restrooms for freshening up as soon as students return from hospitals. They must dip their clothes in disinfectant solution on return,” the advisory said. Specific instructions have been given to hold practical classes at the moment. All students must obtain consent letters from their parents.  All medical colleges hostels must facilitate only two students per room besides avoiding bunker cots and dormitory arrangement.

Siddaramaiah, a prominent Kuruba leader, was conspicuous by his absence at the Kuruba ST Horata Samiti convention that was largely seen as a show of strength of the community. Indirectly targeting Siddaramaiah for skipping the convention, Eshwarappa said, “Bragging that the community has the ‘blood’ of Sangolli Rayanna and Kanakadasa flowing in them is not enough. Such statements will get a real meaning only when the leaders participate in the struggle, and ensure that the Kurubas get the ST tag.” The minister added, “The ongoing struggle of Kuruba community for ST tag will meet its logical conclusion only when the leaders of the community, across the party lines, unite and work towards the goal under the guidance of Kaginele seer.” The community members and seers have planned a padayatra to Bengaluru from Kaginele on December 15.

According to sources, former speaker K B Koliwad lamented that the party lacked unity. “We did some introspection on the Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar bypoll results. For future elections, we want to prioritise local leaders. A committee has been formed to advise on choosing candidates who can be recommended to the high command,” Shivakumar said.  The KPCC chief also announced the creation of three new party wings. “We’re setting up a cultural wing to promote workers who excel in cultural activities. We will also have a drivers’ wing and a cooperatives wing. They will be set up right from the panchayat up to the state levels,” he said.   Think tank? According to sources, the Congress is likely to set up a think tank that will help formulate a stand for the party to counter ideological and policy challenges posed by the BJP. “Nobody owns Hindutva. We believe in the Hindutva propounded by Gandhi and Vivekananda,” Shivakumar said. “We will discuss this through a separate committee,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-congress-plans-big-for-booths-921793.html

Santhosh, 31, was hospitalized last Friday evening allegedly due to an overdose of sleeping pills. “Three days ago, there was a personal, family event. It was my cousin brother’s marriage. There, I suffered from food indigestion. I ended up taking a different medicine and due to an overdose, I got drowsy. My wife rushed me to the hospital. This was just a mistake,” Santhosh told reporters. “I do have the habit of taking sleeping tablets. I usually take 0.2 mg and I should’ve consumed a half tablet. Instead, I took a full one that made me drowsy,” he said. At one point, Santhosh refuted the police FIR and the hospital’s information that he had consumed 12 sleeping pills. “I’ve seen the FIR. Where does it say 12 tablets,” he asked. When reporters showed the FIR copy, Santhosh clarified: “FIR means ‘first information received’. Once I gained consciousness, I gave the right answer.” Santhosh, who is Yediyurappa’s grand-nephew, said there was no political pressure on him. “Let me tell you, there’s always political pressure, but I’m not someone who’d take pills because of it,” he said, adding that there was no pressure on him to resign as the CM’s political secretary. “I am not depressed. I have strong will power. The wrestling ring in which I grew up will keep me strong for the next fifty years,” he said. Hitting out at Congress president DK Shivakumar for claiming that a video was behind Santhosh’s suspected suicide, he said: “It’s not the first time Shivakumar has spoken like this. Earlier, he claimed I had some diary. Maybe he has lost his mind after the Rajarajeshwarinagar bypoll defeat. He should get admitted to a hospital or take a break.” Threatening Shivakumar with protest, Santhosh said that he would mobilize a lakh people in Bengaluru if anything bad was spoken against Yediyurappa.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/i-m-strong-willed-didn-t-attempt-suicide-says-karnataka-cm-bsys-political-secretary-nr-santhosh-921634.html

Launched in April 2012, there are presently 1025 services related to 98 departments guaranteed under the Sakala scheme which are provided to the applicants within the time limit. Eight years after the launch of the scheme, the Sakala department carried out the assessment of its performance. The assessment revealed that 22.92 crore applications were received since the launch of the scheme, out of which 22.85 crore applications were disposed of. Based on the number of applications received and disposed of, the department came out with the ranking. Announcing the ranking, Karnataka Minister for Sakala, S Suresh Kumar told reporters on Monday that Mandya, Chikkamagaluru and Chikkaballapura are among the top three districts in providing services under the Sakala scheme within the time limit. On the other hand, Bengaluru urban, Bidar and Raichur are among the least ranked districts in providing services. "This assessment provides an opportunity to the respective districts to improve their citizen-oriented services," Kumar, who also holds the primary and secondary education portfolio, said. The rankings were announced as the state launched the Sakala week during which period, the departments will have to create awareness among masses. The Minister cited three reasons for the poor performance of Sakala, which are not accepting the applications, rejection of applications and delay in providing the service. He said people do not know that there are appellants in each department where people can approach and appeal against the rejection and delay in providing services. Kumar directed the deputy commissioners of the district to conduct a meeting of the Sakala Coordination Committees to analyse the performance of Sakala scheme.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/mandya-on-top-bengaluru-at-bottom-in-providing-services-under-sakala-scheme-921740.html
30-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Wait for another two days, says BS Yediyurappa on cabinet reshuffle||Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Monday said the announcement of gram panchayat polls will not delay the much-awaited expansion or reshuffle of his cabinet. "Wait for another two days," Yediyurappa told reporters here in response to a question about the possibility of cabinet expansion or reshuffle in December. Asked whether the announcement of gram panchayat polls in the state would delay cabinet exercise, he merely said, there was no connection between them. Karnataka State Election Commission on Monday announced polls to 5,762 gram panchayats in the state in two phases on December 22 and 27, and the model code of conduct has come into immediate effect. However, Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, speaking to reporters in Belagavi, indicated that the cabinet expansion/ reshuffle may get delayed. Jarkiholi said he has requested the leadership that all those, who came to the BJP quitting the Congress and JD(S) and have "sacrificed" or worked for the party to come to power, should be taken care of during the exercise. "... The cabinet expansion should happen. We have been requesting the Chief Minister and the party leadership in this regard.. have requested that all those who sacrificed should get ministerial post, but unfortunately election has been declared and we may have to wait one month," he said. Jarkiholi also expressed hope that all those who came to BJP and sacrificed for the party to come to power will not be dropped from the Ministry if there is a reshuffle. The Minister has been strongly lobbying for the induction of BJP MLC C P Yogeshwar, who is said to have played a key role during the political crisis last year that eventually led to the collapse of the coalition government and the saffron party to come to power, along with few among those who defected. As per the agreement, Yediyurappa has already inducted 10 Congress-JDS rebels into the cabinet after they won subsequent bypolls on the BJP ticket. Few rebels who have been made MLCs along with newly elected Rajarajeshwari Nagar BJP MLA Muniratha (also a rebel) are now waiting for their turn. The cabinet expansion or reshuffle is expected to be a tightrope walk for the Chief Minister, considering that there are too many aspirants, from the party old guard to Congress-JD(S) rebels who are now BJP legislators. The cabinet currently has 27 members, and seven berths are still vacant. Yediyurappa has been waiting for some time now to carry out the cabinet exercise, as he was asked by BJP national president J P Nadda during their meeting in New Delhi on November 18, to wait for clearance from the central leadership. The Chief Minister on Friday had told reporters he has spoken to Union Home Minister Amit Shah on cabinet expansion, and the central leadership will convey their decision soon, and that the exercise may take place in two-three days.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/wait-for-another-two-days-says-bs-yediyurappa-on-cabinet-reshuffle-921753.html
30-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Less than 1,000 new Covid-19 cases reported in Karnataka||Karnataka topped the states recording a maximum decline in the number of active Covid-19 cases in the last one month followed by Maharashtra, the Union Health Ministry said here on Monday. The four southern states and Maharashtra are the five provinces registering the highest dip in the number of active cases in the last 30 days, which saw a rise of such cases in northwest India in the same period but on a smaller scale. On October 29, there were 68,180 active cases in Karnataka, but the number fell to 24,770 on November 29 – a drop of 43,410 active cases within 30 days. “It is important to improve the testing strategy. Even when the state was under increased scrutiny for reporting more cases, Karnataka not only increased the number of tests during the surge in cases but also was among the foremost states in using the syndromic approach for the review of district performance. This enabled a curb on the transmission by isolating as many symptomatic people who can spread to more people,” Giridhar Babu, a senior epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India told DH. “Karnataka’s success is also possible due to the success in Bengaluru, which saw a series of reforms and enhanced testing. Moving forward, the state conducted a statewide survey whose findings were used to implement future interventions.” The number of active cases also fell in Maharashtra with the number of active cases reduced by more than 39,000 within a month. Similarly, the number of active cases declined by nearly 28,500 in Kerala and in excess of 15,000 in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Such a trend seems to suggest that the pandemic is in a recession in south India, which was the driving factor in the spread of the Covid-19 epidemic in India not so long ago. But there is a rise in the number of active cases in north western states like Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Himachal Pradesh as well as Madhya Pradesh in the same period, albeit on a smaller scale. The maximum rise was seen in Rajasthan (by 13,043) followed by Haryana (8,902) and Delhi (7,200). Meanwhile, continuing his engagements with domestic Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday reviewed the progress of indigenous vaccine development undertaken by Genova Biopharma of Pune and Biological E and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories in Hyderabad. The last one is responsible for the clinical trial and distribution of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine. The Prime Minister asked the companies to come out with their suggestions and ideas on the regulatory processes and suggested that they should take extra efforts to inform the general public about the vaccine and its efficacy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/less-than-1000-new-covid-19-cases-reported-in-karnataka-921763.html

30-11-2020||West||Maratha quota row: BJP's Udayanraje attacks Maha govt||BJP MP Udayanraje Bhosale on Sunday launched a veiled attack on NCP chief Sharad Pawar on the issue of the Maratha reservation. Speaking to reporters, the former NCP leader said reins of power in Maharashtra should be handed over to senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis again if the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is incapable of implementing reservation for the Maratha community. Bhosale said the Maratha quota was overlooked even at the time of the implementation of the Mandal Commission report as the party which ruled the state during that period (in 1990) ignored problems of the community. NCP chief Sharad Pawar was the Congress chief minister of Maharashtra at the time. "Give the reins of power in Maharashtra to Devendra Fadnavis and I will take the responsibility of getting the Maratha quota implemented again," he said. "All communities, except Marathas, were given reservations under Mandal Commission. The people you trusted and voted for will pull you down," Bhosale said. He also hit out at the Uddhav Thackeray dispensation for "not taking the issue ahead" and claimed "the state government lawyer" missed a hearing of the quota issue in the Supreme Court, adding that the "community will react to such tactics". Praising Fadnavis, Bhosale said the former CM "took the initiative and enacted a law to give Marathas reservations". "Now you (Sena, NCP and Congress) are in power. Why aren't you taking this issue forward," Bhosale asked. He demanded Maharashtra Public Services Commission (MPSC) exams be conducted now by keeping aside seats that will be part of the Maratha quota as the issue was now being heard in the apex court. The SC recently stayed the implementation of the 2018 law granting reservation to Marathas in jobs and education and referred the matter to a larger Constitution bench. Meanwhile, state Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant wondered if Fadnavis can influence decisions of courts. "Bhosale's comments are shocking and objectionable," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maratha-quota-row-bjps-udayanraje-attacks-maha-govt-921464.html

The three generations of Amtes have been into social work in Maharashtra. According to initial reports, she reportedly injected herself and ended her life in the morning in Warora. The body has been sent for post-mortem. Chandrapur police are making the investigations. Dr Sheetal Amte-Karajki, who was in her forties, was the CEO of Maharogi Sewa Samiti, which has done commendable work among leprosy patients. Baba Amte’s work is now being spearheaded by his sons Dr Vikas and Dr Prakash, with the assistance of their wives Dr Bharati and Dr Mandakani, respectively. Dr Sheetal, daughter of Dr Vikas and Dr Bharti, had recently put out a social media post bringing to fore differences in the family. However, the post was removed. She also established Maharogi Sewa Samiti to run the facilities, which include a range of health care, rehabilitation, education, agriculture, and economic empowerment programmes.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/baba-amtes-granddaughter-allegedly-dies-by-suicide-921602.html

Considered a “thinking actress” with a “charismatic image” she is known to take up daring roles and make a mark. The 46-year-old Urmila, who has the image of ‘Marathi-mulgi’ is all set to join the Shiv Sena on Tuesday in the presence of Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. Known to be frank in her words, Urmila had joined the Congress in presence of Rahul Gandhi ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, unsuccessfully contested the Mumbai North seat against BJP stalwart Gopal Shetty – and called it quits ahead of the Vidhan Sabha polls the same year. She was perturbed because of the infighting in the Mumbai Congress unit factions led by Sanjay Nirupam and Milind Deora. The path ahead in the wake of transition from Congress to Shiv Sena, which runs the Maha Vikas Aghadi government along with NCP, is not an easy one – but Urmila like her roles – prefers to take challenges. With the elections to BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) – one of the biggest civic bodies of Asia - scheduled for 2022, she will be one of the key faces of the Sena, founded by late Bal Thackeray. Her background as a good student and knowledge of politics and ideologies will surely come in handy to the party. The BJP will leave no stones unturned in targeting her – and she is well aware of that. Matondkar married Kashmir-based businessman and model Mohsin Akhtar Mir – and is involved in a lot of social causes. During the Lok Sabha campaign, in an interview to DH, she had said: “In films, there is a schedule,  in politics there is no schedule. In films, there is a script,  in politics there is no set script. In film, you don't get hit, in politics there are chances you may get hit. I have given 100 per cent to films, I will give 100 per cent to politics.” This was a clear indication that she was not going to stop. Recently when actor Kangana Ranaut attacked a section of Bollywood, the Thackerays and the MVA government, Urmila responded strongly.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/urmila-s-new-innings-with-shiv-sena-to-be-challenging-921603.html

Located near Karjat in Raigad district, Matheran -- at an elevation of 800 mts (2,625 ft) -- is nearly 100 km off downtown Mumbai. Administered by the Mumbai-headquartered Central Railway (CR), in the past, there have been attempts to put it on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. “It is always a thrilling experience getting into the train,” said Mumbai-based writer and analyst Abhijit Mulye, who had gone on umpteen trekking missions to Matheran. “The hill station is unique and offers a great view,” he said, adding that for tourists, a trip on the train is a must. Since no vehicles are allowed except for a solitary ambulance, one has to walk from Aman Lodge to Matheran. The majority of the tourists prefer to walk along the track – which too is a very good experience. According to Tista Bhowmick, in Matheran, "If you have not boarded the toy train, you have missed something. The nearly 10-minute journey takes you back a century,” she says. The Neral–Matheran Light Railway was built between 1901 and 1907 by Abdul Hussein Adamjee Peerbhoy and financed by his father, Sir Adamjee Peerbhoy, at a cost of Rs 16 lakh. The consulting engineer was Everard Calthrop. The train was initially hauled by a steam engine but now it is a diesel engine. The original steam engine is preserved for display and is a popular selfie point in the hill station.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/matheran-s-toy-train-still-draws-a-crowd-921610.html

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in a release on Sunday said from April till November 28, it took action against 4.85 lakh citizens for not wearing masks in public places and collected over Rs 10.7 crore as fine from them. The BMC said when an offender, after being fined, goes ahead without a face mask, the objective of implementing the Covid-19 prevention protocol remains unfulfilled. "Therefore, in order to fulfill the objective, the citizen concerned will be provided a free mask and charged a penalty of Rs 200," it said. The relevant penalty receipt will also mention about the free mask, it said. To curb the spread of infection in the post-Diwali season, the civic body has increased inspection drives in the city, with the violation of mask rule attracting a penalty of Rs 200. From April till November 28, the maximum number of 32,010 citizens without masks were fined in the K-west ward, which includes areas like Juhu and Versova, a BMC official said, adding that Rs 63.39 lakh was collected as fine from them. Besides sanitisation of hands and maintaining social distance, regular use of mask is necessary for controlling the spread of coronavirus infection, he added. Till Sunday, Mumbai city reported a total of 2,82,821 Covid-19 cases and 10,865 deaths due to the disease, as per official figures.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/free-mask-rs-200-fine-in-mumbai-for-covid-19-rule-violators-bmc-921623.html

The three generations of Amtes can be considered Maharashtra’s numero uno family in the field of social work. The family is in the news after one of the members – Dr Sheetal Amte-Karajgi died by suicide on Monday. Born on December 26, 1914, in Wardha, Murlidhar Devidas Amte joined the freedom struggle and went to jail for civil disobedience. He became a disciple of Gandhiji and decided to fight for the fear of leprosy- it is for this reason he gave him the title of AbhayaSadhak, a fearless seeker of truth. Baba Amte first took a course on the care of leprosy patients and then settled down in Chandrapur. The ashram became a home for the destitute and homeless, many of whom were leprosy patients. Many of them, who had been cured, had lost their fingers, hands, toes, or feet and could not go back to their professions because they were disabled. Baba Amte helped each one of them to acquire skills, despite their disability. These people under Baba Amte's guidance transformed this rocky and barren land into a model farm.  This farm now produces vegetables and dairy products for neighbouring villages and is economically self-sufficient. The place is named Anandwan, literally a Forest of Happiness.  Baba’s has two sons who are also doctor-social workers - Dr Vikas and Dr Prakash. Incidentally, their wives, Dr Bharti and Dr Mandakani, too are doctors. While Vikas oversees the functioning of Anandvan in Chandrapur and runs the Maharogi Sewa Samiti, his brother Prakash runs the Lok Biradari Prakalp, which translates to Brotherhood of People project, at Bhamragad in neighbouring Gadchiroli district. Incidentally, Baba Amte got the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1985, while his son Prakash and daughter-in-law Mandakini got the award in 2008.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/the-amtes-three-generations-of-social-works-921668.html

This is said to be the first public-private partnership (PPP) between a state government and a private entity in managing the leopard population, to begin with. Forest officials said 23 more leopards, which were captured after they came in conflict with the humans over the years, will be handed over to the private rescue centre as part of a memorandum of understanding between the state government and the RIL. "These leopards were not going to be released in the wild and hence 35 of them are being handed over to the RIL's rescue centre. Primarily, it will ease the state government from the burden of feeding and incurring others expenses to keep them in cages," said a forest officer on the condition of anonymity. Roughly, the officer said, the government spends Rs 800 to Rs 1,000 per day on an adult leopard that needs a minimum of 5kg to 6 kg meat every day. These leopards were kept at the Sakkarbaug Zoological Park in Junagadh. Officials said there are 70 such leopards which have been captured over the years after they were found to be involved in conflicts with humans. "With half of the wild cats gone in the private hands, it will ease the burden for us," said the officer. "This is perhaps the first time that such an arrangement has been made involving a corporate house. This may help the government since the population of leopards has grown so much that even zoos don't want to keep them," another forest officer told DH. Principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden, Shyamal Tikadar, told DH, "The MoU has been signed between the government and the private firm with the approval of Central Zoo Authority (CZA, the regulatory authority for zoos in the country). The new rescue centre has all the facilities prescribed by CZA. Besides, we will be monitoring the leopards."    The population of leopards has surged significantly over the last five years. In the 2016 census, 1,395 leopards were counted. Last year, 442 lions had been captured after they entered into human habitation in various parts of the state. According to the state government, 338 of them were released back into the wild while 82, which were involved in killing or attacking humans, were caged. When contacted, Parimal Nathwani of RIL, said in a statement, "As a CSR (corporate social responsibility) initiative and to support the state forest department, the RIL has established a rescue centre in Jamnagar district after obtaining all the necessary approvals from the CZA (central zoo authority) and the state forest department. So far 12 leopards from Sakar-Baug Zoo-Junagadh have been received in our rescue centre for their upkeep." The statement added that the rescue centre will not be open for public display as per norms.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-govt-shifts-a-dozen-leopards-to-ril-owned-rescue-centre-in-jamnagar-921737.html

The Shiv Sena leader in question is veteran Pandurang Sakpal, Shiv Sena’s vibagh-pramukh for South Mumbai. “I live near Bada Kabarastan…I have to hear Azan every day and I find it pleasing. Once I have heard in the morning, I eagerly wait to hear the next Azan of the day,” Sakpal said. A Mumbai-based NGO – My Foundation has organized the Azan competition to encourage Muslim children and Sakpal has backed the idea. According to Sakpal, Azan lasts for nearly five minutes as it is as important as maha-aarti. “It symbolizes peace and communal colour must not be given,” he said. However, the BJP has lashed out at the Shiv Sena and MVA govenrment.  “It is surprises as in the past, Shiv Sena had opposed namaz on roads,” said BJP leader Atul Bhatkalkar, reminding that the Shiv Sena had campaigned for votes against Congress and has equated it with seeking votes for terror. “The larger issue is religious politics,” he said. While Shiv Sena leaders have not commented, Sakpal found support from allies Congress and NCP.  “Similar competitions are already being organized for Bhagwad Gita in Maharashtra and other parts in which Muslim girls have won top prizes… What’s wrong with an azaan competition,” NCP chief spokesperson and state’s minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said. “Those who have hatred in their hearts can never comprehend the beauty of conversation between humans and God,” said state Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/shiv-sena-leader-backs-azan-competition-in-mumbai-bjp-lashes-out-921824.html
