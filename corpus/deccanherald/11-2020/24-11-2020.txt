The policy aims to take India to international level, he added. Addressing the 18th convocation of NITK-Surathkal virtually, he said that it was an inclusive policy that would help in nation-building. The Union Minister said that the NEP by advocating mother tongue and regional languages aimed at strengthening Indian languages. “People who argue that if we do not learn English we cannot progress at the international level, need to look at countries like Japan, Germany, France, who all provide education in their languages,” he stressed. The NEP 2020 will help India to regain the title of ‘Vishwa Guru’ and help in reviving the glory of ancient universities of Takshila and Nalanda in spreading knowledge, science and ancient traditions among students. “We want India to emerge as an education hub in the world. The NEP helps students to opt for any subject of their choice,” he added. India which was lacking in research and innovation in the past will get a boost through setting up of National Research Foundation, he said. The Minister urged graduating students to face challenges in life and contribute to the country’s progress. He urged students to give back ‘gurudakshina’ to teachers by serving the nation. Dr G Satheesh Reddy, Secretary, Department of Defence (R and D) and Chairman of DRDO said for the success of Atmanirbhar Bharat, India needs to concentrate on advanced technology and futuristic technologies. “We should become technology leaders rather than technology followers and become self-reliant in advanced technology ahead of the world.” He urged institutes to concentrate on basic and applied research. During the initial days of Covid-19 pandemic, the country was not manufacturing ventilators and PPE kits. Within four months, India with advanced technology could have its ventilators and PPE kits. DRDO had invested Rs 1,000 crore in institutions to research futuristic technologies, he added. NITK Director Prof Umamaheshwar Rao said that under DRDO-Academia Programme, 10 research scholars will work in DRDO labs on live problems of interest to DRDO. Four faculty members from the NITK have found a place in top 2% of researchers in the world as per a survey carried out by a team of scientists from Stanford, five patents have been awarded to our faculty members in 2020. Chairman of Board of Governors (BoG), NITK, Prof K Balaveera Reddy presided over the programme. Degrees Degrees were awarded to 1,549 students of BTech, MTech, MTech (Research), MCA, MBA, MSc and PhD programme who graduated during the academic year 2019-20. Thirty-eight students were awarded Endowment Gold Medals.

Earlier, Vijayapura MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal had made similar remarks on activists.  "They do not have any work to do, and people do not recognise them. In the name of Kannada, some of them extract money from businessmen in Bengaluru, who have come from other states. They behave like goondas, and people will not worry about the bandh call," Bellad said. He said that Marathas settled in Karnataka have become Kannadigas, and they have contributed to the growth of the state. Many of them even do not speak Marathi. There is no need for playing unnecessary politics in the issue of setting up a corporation for the welfare of the Maratha community. People like Vatal Nagaraj have lost relevance in politics, and they oppose the formation of Maratha Development Corporation, just to be in limelight, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/mla-aravind-bellad-says-bandh-call-over-maratha-corporation-given-by-roll-call-activists-919366.html

Inspired by the famed Lalitha Mahal Palace, stands the new office of the Mysuru Police Commissioner, just in front of the earlier office, on Sir Mirza Ismail Road. The earlier office was the century-old Band House of the Wadiyar era. The new building, built at a cost of Rs 19.36 crore, is surrounded by the Band House, Kuppanna Park and Children’s Park in Nazarbad, in the heart of Mysuru city. The foundation stone for the building was laid in 2014 by then-Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, but he could not inaugurate it, due to a few PILs. The Karnataka State Police Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation has built the building with an area of 4,268.42 square metres, spread over three floors. It will house the City Crime Records division, Foreigners Registration Office, separate section for police verification, computer and photography divisions, records rooms, Wireless section, Traffic Automation Centre, CCTV division and library. There is also facility for probe of accused and evidence via video-conference. Even though the building was ready for inauguration in 2018 itself, its inauguration was delayed as a PIL was filed before the High Court alleging that the building has been constructed on the land of Kasturba Park. DCP A N Prakash Gowda said that now the legal hurdles have been cleared. On the same occasion, the CM also inaugurated police residential quarters at a total cost of Rs 20.31 crore. They include 36 houses in Jyothi Nagar and 72 houses in Jockey Quarters areas.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/karnataka-cm-b-s-yediyurappa-inaugurates-new-police-commissioner-s-office-in-mysuru-919525.html

24-11-2020||National||India could get Covid-19 vaccine by December||In what may cheer up millions around the world, pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca on Monday announced that its Covid-19 vaccine developed in partnership with Oxford University has been proven "highly effective" in protecting people from the novel coronavirus infection. The company will now seek an emergency use listing from the World Health Organization and approach regulatory authorities around the world for a conditional early approval of the two-dose vaccine for front line workers and vulnerable groups identified by the governments. With 70% efficacy and its ability to be transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions (2-8 degrees Celsius), this could very well be India’s first Covid-19 vaccine if the Indian drug regulator is convinced with the trial data. AstraZeneca's Indian partner, Pune-based Serum Institute is independently conducting safety and immunogenicity clinical trials on 1,600 patients across India. SII chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla on Monday said that the company was aiming for an approval by the year-end and the vaccine might be available in a limited way either by December end or in early January. By July 2021, up to 400 million doses of the vaccine could be made available. Poonawalla said the vaccine would have a maximum retail price of Rs 1,000 for the private market but pointed out that his company was negotiating with the Union Health Ministry for a purchase price for the government. Based on the trials carried out on 23,000 individuals in the UK and Brazil, AstraZeneca said that the vaccine offers 70% efficacy. Surprisingly, one of the regimens in which only a half-dose is used in the first shot offers 90% protection whereas the second regimen with two full doses generates 62% efficacy. The two doses are being given at least one month apart. “These findings show that we have an effective vaccine that will save many lives. Excitingly, we’ve found that one of our dosing regimens may be around 90% effective and if this dosing regime is used, more people could be vaccinated with planned vaccine supply," Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial at Oxford University said in a statement. The regimen with one half and a full dose that generates 90% efficacy was given to 2,741 individuals whereas the second regimen with two full doses were administered to 8,895 people. The combined analysis from both dosing regimens (n=11,636) resulted in an average efficacy of 70%. An independent data safety monitoring board determined that the analysis met its primary endpoint showing protection from Covid-19 occurring 14 days or more after receiving two doses of the vaccine. No serious safety events related to the vaccine have been confirmed as the vaccine was well tolerated across both dosing regimens. "A vaccine with 70% efficacy is very good because the idea was that a vaccine even with 50% efficacy is good enough in a pandemic situation. The added advantage of the AstraZeneca vaccine is that it can be transported to every corner of the country as it doesn’t need an ultra low cooling environment for storage,” Chandrakant Lahariya, an independent public policy and health systems expert told DH. Two other Covid-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNet and Moderna showed an efficacy in excess of 90%. But the first one needs a storage temperature of minus 80 degrees Celsius while the Moderna vaccine is more expensive than the AstraZeneca one. More data will continue to accumulate and additional analysis will be conducted, refining the efficacy reading and establishing the duration of protection.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-could-get-covid-19-vaccine-by-december-919228.html

Assured all possible support from the Centre. I pray for the safety and well-being of those living in the affected areas." The deep depression in the Bay of Bengal intensified into a cyclonic storm 'Nivar' on Tuesday morning. It will in all probability make landfall around Puducherry on Wednesday evening as a severe cyclonic storm, prompting the Tamil Nadu and Puducherry governments to mount massive efforts to minimise damage. When cyclone Nivar makes its landfall, it is likely to pack winds with a speed of 100-110 km per hour gusting to 120 km per hour.

24-11-2020||National||Government identifies one crore frontline health workers for Covid-19 vaccination||An estimated one crore frontline health workers will receive the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine whenever it becomes available, with around 92 per cent of government hospitals and 55 per cent of private hospitals across all states and UTs providing data identifying the workers, official sources told PTI. The anti-coronavirus vaccine, once available, would be distributed under a special Covid-19 inoculation programme, using the processes, technology and network of the existing Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP). It would run parallel to the UIP. The Centre, with the help of state and UT governments, has started the process of identifying around 30 crore priority beneficiaries who would be given vaccine dose in the initial phase, sources had said. The government has demarcated four categories which include around 1 crore healthcare professionals including doctors, MBBS students, nurses and ASHA workers etc, around two crore frontline workers including municipal corporation workers, personnel of the police and armed forces, about 26 crore people aged above 50 and a special category of those below 50 with co-morbidities and requiring specialised care.  Medicine, nursing students and faculty members will be involved in the training and implementation of the immunisation programme.  Health Ministry's existing digital platform eVIN which is being used for the UIP is being enhanced for the Covid-19 vaccine distribution and delivery, through which SMSs would be sent to recipients informing the time, date and venue to get the shots and digitally connect them and also track them, sources had earlier said. Each person in the immunisation list would be linked with their Aadhar cards to avoid duplication and to track beneficiaries. However, in case a person doesn't have an Aadhar card, a government photo identity can be used, the sources said. Currently, there are five vaccine candidates at different stages of development. The AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is in phase 3 of the trial by the Serum Institute. Bharat Biotech has begun phase 3 trials while Zydus Cadila has completed phase 2 trials. Russia’s Sputnik V in collaboration with Dr Reddy has just begun phase 2-3 trials. Biological E is in phase 1-2 trials. Additionally, 1,000 cold storage points have been added to the existing 28,000 points in government facilities for the storage of syringes and needles. Walk-in cooler, fridges and deep freezers are also being procured. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had said that a Covid-19 vaccine is likely to be available by the first quarter of 2021. He had said that the Centre estimates to receive and utilise 40-50 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine covering around 25 crore people by July next year.  “The prioritisation of groups for Covid-19 vaccine shall be based on two key considerations -- occupational hazard and risk of exposure to infection, and the risk of developing severe disease and increased mortality,” he had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/government-identifies-one-crore-frontline-health-workers-for-covid-19-vaccination-919322.html
24-11-2020||National||SC rejects sacked BSF constable's plea challenging PM Modi's election from Varanasi||The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a plea by Tej Bahadur, a sacked BSF constable, against the Allahabad High Court's order that had dismissed his election petition against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said the High Court had rightly dismissed the petition by Tej Bahadur. The court had on November 18 wrapped up hearing in the matter, rejecting repeated requests by petitioner's counsel for adjournments. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Modi, said that this gentleman (petitioner) filed two nomination papers, one as independent and another for Samajwadi Party. In one, he said, he was dismissed from the job, and in another, he denied it, Salve added.  Tej Bahadur's nomination papers were rejected as the Samajwadi Party candidate in Varanasi constituency in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. He challenged the validity of the High Court's judgement of December 6, 2019. The High Court has dismissed his election petition as having no locus and further that he was neither a registered voter nor the resident of Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency. In a special leave petition, he contended that his nomination papers were rejected by the returning officer under "illegitimate pressure" from BJP.  "The officer acted in an arbitrary manner and the High Court also committed a grave error by ignoring the fact that when any person files nomination in a constituency and his candidature has been rejected, then he has locus to file election petition," his plea contended. The petitioner sought a direction to set aside the rejection of his nomination papers on May 1, 2019, and take action against the returning officer for misuse of his official powers.  The petitioner was sacked from the BSF after a video, in which he showed the alleged poor quality of foods served to jawans, went viral on social media networking sites.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-rejects-sacked-bsf-constables-plea-challenging-pm-modis-election-from-varanasi-919342.html

How can one bring jihad into a relationship? How can one be restricted on the grounds of religion in marital things? We hope the apex court looks into a law if passed, and strikes it down,” said Delhi-based Sheena Shahulhameed, who is married to a Hindu man.   On Sunday, the BJP termed ‘love jihad’ a serious problem and backed the decision of its governments in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh to enact laws against it.      “Many mothers and sisters have suffered its bad consequences. This is a state matter and state governments should enact law against it," BJP general secretary Arun Singh said.   The same day, debate over Mira Nair’s “A Suitable Boy” escalated with Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra saying state police had been asked to examine a scene of two protagonists, a Hindu girl and Muslim boy, kissing with a temple in the backdrop. And once more, there was heated debate on ‘love jihad’, with ‘#BoycottNetflix” even trending on Twitter. The following day, on Monday, an FIR was registered in Madhya Pradesh on Monday against two Netflix executives for allegedly hurting religious sentiments through the series. It was a gathering storm. Last month, the term reared its head when jewellery brand Tanishq was forced to pull down an ad showing a Muslim mother-in-law organising a baby shower for her Hindu daughter-in-law. A few days later, a Hindu girl was shot dead by her Muslim classmate in Faridabad and her family claimed ‘love jihad’.   “The Tanishq case was not a big one. It was done simply to create fear in the society. Any ‘love jihad’ law, however, is against the fundamental rights enshrined in our Constitution,” Shahulhameed said.   The term ‘love jihad’ is increasingly being associated with dangerous outcomes, added author and columnist Natasha Badhwar, who is married to a Muslim man.   “When I first heard the term ‘love jihad’, I laughed at the absurdity of the conspiracy theory. When (Yogi) Adityanath became chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, we heard more and more about this from people in power and realised we could no longer dismiss this as a laughing matter.   “People's lives were under threat and it had become urgent to frame a response that countered this communal narrative of hate. I refuse to succumb to the fear and control that the rightwing wants to exercise on minorities and women by stigmatising and criminalising relationships between communities and across caste boundaries,” she said.   The term ‘love jihad’ first drew attention in 2009 after Catholic groups and Hindu groups in Kerala and Karnataka, respectively, reportedly said women from their communities were being forcefully converted to Islam. But it became part of popular discourse ahead of by-elections in Uttar Pradesh in 2014 when the state’s ruling BJP took up the issue in a big way, deepening communal faultlines.   According to sociologist Parul Bhandari, “any eruptions, disruptions in society are emblematic of its state of being”.   “The fact that there was such a furore over the Tanishq ad clearly reveals that certain groups are increasingly disapproving of inter-religious unions,” said the associate professor of Sociology at the O P Jindal University.    Many have taken upon themselves the responsibility to break out of set norms for people of different communities.   Like Waled Aadnan, who is dating a Hindu woman. For him, religion is a determining factor when it comes to relationships but not in a way one would expect.   “Religion was important to me when the relationship started. I believe it is our responsibility to look outside our bubble of class, caste, linguistic group and religion in our choice of partners to build a world that can talk to each other more. That's definitely a conscious decision.     “Everyone can't just happen to fall in love only with people with similar surnames,” Aadnan said.   To him, the recent controversies over the Tanishq ad and “The Suitable Boy” are “soft battlegrounds for everyone to outrage or support”, and there are bigger and more important battles to fight.    “There are actual people in prison for love, people being murdered for love and if anything, that's where all the support should be channelled,” he said.   A law on ‘love jihad’ will only aggravate the challenges in his view.    “India's marriage laws for interfaith couples have anyway been restrictive. The Special Marriage Act has in-built patriarchal checks to make inter-caste and interfaith marriages difficult. Any 'love jihad' law will just continue on the same path,” he said.   Enacted in 1954, the Special Marriage Act was legislated to govern marriages that could not or were not performed according to religious norms. The validity of some provisions of the law were challenged in September this year by a plea, claiming they violated a couple’s fundamental right to marry and privacy. The discourse around a potential ‘love jihad’ law has also rattled interfaith couples where neither partner is a Muslim.   Annu Matthew, who is married to a Hindu and relocated from Delhi to her hometown in Kerala a few years back, said she had always felt “on the edge” while she was in the capital.   “It has crossed my mind at least once that I am in an interfaith marriage and thank goodness I married a Hindu man. There is this sense of relief that if I ever get pulled up for my religion I can at least say I am married to a Hindu. I know it is a wrong thought but deep down I feel a little bit safer,” she said.   Sharing successful love stories across religions can be a starting point to normalise interfaith relationships, said Bhandari.   “One way to combat the anger and anxiety (and desire to dominate) by one group is to remind the society of the merits of peaceful coexistence and secularism.   "In the context of interfaith unions, this would imply bringing focus to those stories where the couples have lived happily ever after with each other, without allowing their religious differences to be a thorny issue in their marriage,” she said.   “The India Love Project”, an online platform, does just that. Founded by journalists Priya Ramani, Samar Halarnkar and Niloufer Venkatraman, the platform tells stories of “love and marriage outside the shackles of faith, caste, ethnicity and gender.” On Monday, Halarnkar said on Twitter that the project requires counsellors and lawyers to advice couples and they are “getting more and more appeals for help”.   As the issue gathers momentum, plans seem to be firming up. The BJP government in MP, for instance, said it plans to introduce a Dharma Swatantrya (Religious Freedom) bill in the next Assembly session. The bill will propose rigorous imprisonment for the period of five years for luring a person through fraud and forcing marriage by religious conversion, state minister Mishra said.   Several states, including  Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Uttarakhand, already have in place “anti-conversion laws” that regulate religious conversion.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/interfaith-couples-uneasy-as-love-jihad-storm-gathers-force-919355.html

At a digital meeting of Chief Ministers with the Prime Minister, he told Modi that Delhi saw a peak of 8,600 cases on November 10 in the third peak and since then cases and positivity rate are steadily decreasing. Kejriwal told the meeting that the high severity of the third wave in Delhi was due to many factors and pollution was an important factor. He sought Modi's intervention to get rid of pollution caused by stubble-burning in adjoining states, especially in view of the recent bio-decomposer technique. He also appealed to the Prime Minister to reserve 1,000 ICU beds in central government-run hospitals in the capital for Covid-19 patients while pointing out that there are adequate number of non-ICU Covid-19 beds available but there is a lack of ICU beds. "We are not concerned about the non-ICU (common) Covid-19 beds, since we have an adequate number of non-ICU beds. Out of the total ICU beds available across Delhi, around 3,500 ICU beds are occupied and 724 ICU beds are still vacant. Home Minister Amit Shah is helping in increasing the ICU beds, but if the central government decides to reserve 1000 beds for the people of Delhi, it will be a great support to us," he said. He said that the first wave of Covid-19 in Delhi came in June, during which 20,000 samples were collected every day across the city. The Delhi government had increased the sample collection in September to 60,000 per day. "The third wave of Covid-19 is still going on in Delhi. Since November 10, the positivity rate in Delhi has been constantly declining, but the rising mortality rate is a matter of concern and we have to reduce the mortality rate. We hope that the mortality rate will also reduce along with the declining positivity ratio in the coming days," Kejriwal said. On the reasons for increase in cases, he said several factors were instrumental in making the third wave of Covid-19 in Delhi more dangerous. "The pollution from stubble burning in the neighbouring states has been one of the major reasons," he said demanding Modi's intervention to resolve the issue of stubble burning with the help of bio-decomposer technology. "We want that under your leadership, the Chief Ministers of Delhi, Punjab, and Haryana should work together as a team to eliminate stubble burning," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pollution-played-key-role-in-severity-of-third-wave-of-covid-19-in-delhi-kejriwal-to-pm-919368.html

"100 Million Doses By January," Says Adar Poonawalla On Oxford Vaccine - hopefully DCGI will give EUA immediately after MHRA in December to start vaccination in India which is the need of the hour," Mazumdar-Shaw said in a tweet. On Monday, Poonawalla had said that by January, Serum Institute will have 100 million doses. It already has 40 million doses. He had also expressed happiness at pharma major AstraZeneca's announcement that its Covid-19 vaccine candidate has been found to be 70 per cent effective on average. Serum is conducting clinical trials of Oxford University-AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine candidate in India. On Monday, AstraZeneca had said one dosing regimen showed vaccine efficacy of 90 per cent when the vaccine was given as a half-dose followed by a full dose at least one month apart, while another dosing regimen showed 62 per cent efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart. "The combined analysis from both dosing regimens resulted in an average efficacy of 70 per cent," it had said. AstraZeneca also said that it is making rapid progress in manufacturing with a capacity of up to 3 billion doses of the vaccine in 2021 on a rolling basis, pending regulatory approval. "The vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions for at least six months and administered within existing healthcare settings," it added. India saw 37,975 new coronavirus infections in a day taking the country's Covid-19 caseload to 91.77 lakh, while recoveries crossed 86 lakh, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Tuesday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/mazumdar-shaw-hopes-oxfords-covid-19-vaccine-gets-dcgis-emergency-approval-919369.html

The country registered less than 40,000 fresh coronavirus cases in a span of 24 hours after six days. Since November 8, the number of daily cases has been sustained below the 50,000-mark, the ministry said. On an average, more than 10 lakh daily tests have ensured that the cumulative positivity rate is sustained at low levels, the ministry underlined, adding that it is presently following a downward trajectory. The tests per million (TPM) figure has increased to 96,871, it highlighted. India's testing infrastructure has seen a significant boost with 2,134 laboratories across the country currently. In line with its commitment to conduct more than 10 lakh tests per day, 10,99,545 samples were tested in a span of 24 hours, the ministry said. "The cumulative national Covid-19 positivity rate stands at 6.87 per cent as on date, less than the seven per cent-mark, while the daily positivity rate is just 3.45 per cent. Higher volumes of testing eventually lead to a low positivity rate," it said. There has been a sustained decrease in the number of active cases over the past few weeks, the ministry said, adding that 42,314 Covid-19 patients recovered from the disease and were discharged in a span of 24 hours. The active Covid-19 caseload of the country has fallen to 4,38,667 or merely 4.78 per cent of the total cases reported so far, while the number of recoveries has crossed 86 lakh, the ministry said, adding that 75.71 per cent of the new recoveries were concentrated in 10 states and Union territories. Delhi has reported the highest number of 7,216 single-day recoveries, followed by Kerala (5,425) and Maharashtra (3,729), it said. Further, 77.04 per cent of the fresh Covid-19 cases were reported from 10 states and Union territories.

The trend of an increase in the spread of the pandemic in countries where its impact was earlier lessening, is being seen in some (Indian) states as well, which necessitates greater caution by the administration,” Modi told the chief ministers. Many Indian states are currently witnessing a rising trend in the daily number of fresh infections, which may have happened due to people lowering their guards during the Dussehra-Diwali festivities. Last week, the Union Health Ministry had sent teams to eight states to aid the state authorities in their battle against the epidemic. Modi reviewed the Covid-19 situation with eight high focus states - Haryana, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat and West Bengal. Subsequently in a separate meeting, he discussed the modalities of Covid-19 vaccine delivery, distribution and administration with all the states and asked them to keep their cold chain network ready. With many states using the rapid antigen tests more despite the technique’s inability to pick up half of the cases, the Prime Minister stressed on enhanced use of the gold standard RT-PCR tests with the aim of bringing down the positivity rate to 5 per cent and fatality rate to 1 per cent. On the vaccine front, he discussed the requirements of additional cold chain storage with the states as the hope for getting a Covid-19 vaccine at least for doctors, front line workers and the vulnerable within the next few months, brightens. Earlier, Health Ministry officials had pointed out that that there were 28,000 cold chain points and 700 plus refrigerated vans that would be put to use for the Covid-19 vaccination programme. There are also 70,000 plus trained individuals to administer the vaccine but efforts are on to find out more. Modi asked the chief ministers to ensure regular monitoring through the state level steering committee and district level task force in order to curb the epidemic. India’s Covid-19 tally stands at 91.77 lakh on Tuesday with the addition of 37,975 fresh cases in the last 24 hours. The toll is 1,34,218 of which 480 were added in the same period.

This is the first instance of policemen getting exonerated in this case that involves policemen from Mumbai and Gujarat along with officers of the Intelligence Bureau in Mumbai. "This court finds that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against present applicants. There is no ground for presuming that these applicants have committed an offence," the special CBI judge Bharat A Dave stated in the order pronounced on Tuesday. The court found that "there is nothing to show that they have committed any overt act with knowledge or have tacitly consented to the object of detention and killing of Sadiq." This is also a case where the CBI argued that "Sadiq was not a terrorist but a victim". The court noted that "this is not the stage to decide this issue."   The order came on pleas filed separately by R L Mavani and Ajaypal Yadav. Yadav retired a few years back while Mavani is Deputy Superintendent of Police in Vyara, south Gujarat. He was a sub-inspector in 2003 when the encounter took place. They had moved the pleas through lawyer RS Verma. On January 13, 2003, Sadiq was killed in an encounter near Jai Ambe Traders, Naroda in Ahmedabad by a team of policemen posted with Detection of Crime Branch, Ahmedabad. He was branded as a "terrorist" who had come to kill the then chief minister Narendra Modi, among other leaders, to avenge 2002 riots. Later in 2013, the CBI probe, carried out on the orders of Gujarat high court, found that he was killed by a team of eight policemen including J G Parmar, Tarun Barot, I A Saiyed, K M Vaghela, R L Mavani, G H Gohil, Ajaypal Yadav and Chhatarsinh Chudasama in a fake encounter. The CBI also stated that the investigation was on and it would file a supplementary charge sheet. However, nearly seven years on, the central agency is yet to wrap up its probe. The CBI has claimed that Sadiq was first apprehended in a "stage-managed joint operation of SIB (Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau), Mumbai and CIU (Crime Intelligence Unit of Mumbai police), Andheri, Mumbai on November 19, 2002, from a place near Arsa Hotel, Andheri (E), Mumbai and he was subjected to interrogation at CIU, Andheri by the officials of SIB, Mumbai." Subsequently, he was brought to Ahmedabad by retired Deputy Superintendent of Police Tarun Barot, the then police inspector, Detection of Crime Branch days before the encounter. The court granted relief to Mavani and Yadav while noting that "CBI has alleged that present applicants were involved in the whole process of conspiracy, kidnapping, detention and stage-managed encounter, but no such evidence is found on record." Earlier in 2017, the special court had rejected a similar plea moved by retired Deputy Superintendent of Police K M Vaghela.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sadiq-jamal-encounter-special-cbi-court-discharges-two-accused-policemen-919435.html

The telecom department has asked telecom firms to make necessary arrangements by January 1 to implement the new system. The department has accepted Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) recommendation for having the '0' prefix for such calls, a move that will create sufficient numbering space for telecom services. The Department of Telecom (DoT) in a circular on `modification of dialling pattern from fixed line numbers to cellular mobile numbers' said in order to ensure adequate numbering resources for fixed line and mobile services, Trai's recommendations dated May 29, 2020 have been accepted by the Department. "Following may be implemented...Fixed-to-mobile calls shall be dialled with prefix '0'. Suitable announcement may be fed in the fixed line switches to apprise the fixed line subscribers about the requirement of dialling the prefix '0' for all fixed-to-mobile calls," the DoT cricular said. The circular also said that the announcement should be played whenever a subscriber dials a fixed-to-mobile call without prefixing '0'. It is pertinent to mention here that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) in May this year had recommended dialling prefix '0' for a call from fixed line number to mobile number. The regulator had, however, stated that the introduction of a dialling prefix for a particular type of call is not akin to increasing the number of digits in the telephone number. Trai had also stated that this change in dialling pattern will generate 2,544 million additional numbering resources for mobile services to cater to future requirements.

"Both are in Phase-III clinical trial stage. Our premier institution - the Indian Council of Medical Research - is involved in their trial executions. India is also hosting clinical trials for all the major vaccine contenders," he said. He was referring to the Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, conducting trials for the vaccine developed by Oxford University. Addressing the first virtual Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Young Scientist Conclave, the minister of Science and Technology said the Covid-19 pandemic is a test, demonstrating that multilateral cooperation is the key to overcoming such global challenges. From development of indigenous vaccines to novel point-of-care diagnostics and therapeutic formulations, India has put to use its significant scientific calibre in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Union minister Harsh Vardhan said on Tuesday. Vardhan, who is also the minister for health and family welfare, said Covid-19 has emerged as one of the greatest global challenges, requiring a strategised, collective global response which has seen young scientists play a significant role. Talking about response by India, he said, "India has put to use its significant scientific calibre. "From the development of indigenous vaccines, novel point-of-care diagnostics and therapeutic formulations based on traditional knowledge, to establishing research resources, Indian R&D entities both public and private, have been working relentlessly to develop effective interventions for combating the pandemic," he said. With government's support, more than 100 start-ups have provided innovative products and solutions to tackle Covid-19, he said. About 30 vaccines are in different stages of development, he said. "One of our pharma giants, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, will distribute the Russian vaccine in India after conducting final-stage human trials and receiving regulatory approval," he added. Vardhan said India has also proposed a working group on traditional medicine to spread the knowledge of traditional and ancient medicine in SCO countries so that it can complement the progress in contemporary medicine. The first ever SCO Young Scientists Conclave is being hosted by India. Vardhan noted that India maintains close cultural and historical ties with the SCO nations. The SCO Young Scientists Conclave is a platform for young scientists to further deepen relations and the broad aim of the conclave is to bring the brightest young minds on a common platform to harness their potential to address the gravest societal challenges using research and innovation. "The pandemic has taught us that today, the world is dependent on science, technology and innovation. It has highlighted the heightened need to transform this landscape," Vardhan said. Innovation, he said, is the key driver for enhancing productivity and prosperity and India has emerged as a hub for start-ups and innovation.

The comments came ahead of the possible launch of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine by early next year in India, the country with the world's second-highest number of coronavirus infections after the United States. The question of who pays any claims for damages for unexpected side-effects has been a tricky point in supply negotiations between countries and drug makers over potential vaccines. Some richer countries have agreed full or partial exemptions from liability for firms to secure shots. Indian officials have not commented on who would be held responsible if any vaccine led to serious unwanted consequences. Brazil has said it will not exempt vaccine makers from liability, but Mexico could share some of the burden with laboratories. Modi said both speed and safety were equally important in launching a vaccine, but that, once established scientific processes had determined the right path, India would follow it. "Even medicines popular for 20 years and used by hundreds of thousands of people lead to reactions in some, even today," Modi said in a video conference with state chief ministers. "It's possible with vaccines too. Any decision on them should only be weighed on a scientific scale. Whatever vaccine makes it through the world's certified processes, we will have to accept them and move ahead." Modi said it was not yet known which vaccine would be launched in India and at what price, but urged states to work with the federal government to keep distribution infrastructure such as cold storages ready. After the AstraZeneca vaccine's third-stage trial results were revealed on Monday, its Indian manufacturer the Serum Institute of India said it would first focus on supplying its home market in the next few months. The other experimental vaccines on trial in India are the government and Bharat Biotch's COVAXIN; Russia's Sputnik-V; Zydus Cadila's ZyCoV-D and lastly one that Biological E. Ltd is developing with Baylor College of Medicine and Dynavax Technologies Corp. India on Tuesday recorded 37,975 new infections, taking the total to 9.18 million. Deaths rose by 480, with the total now at 134,218.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/as-india-readies-vaccine-strategy-pm-modi-warns-of-possible-side-effects-919452.html

The Ministry of Electronics and IT has issued the order for blocking the access of these apps by users in India based on the comprehensive reports received from Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Center, Ministry of Home Affairs, an official release said. Earlier on June 29, the government had blocked access to 59 mobile apps and on September 2, 2020 another 118 apps were banned under section 69A of the Information Technology Act.   India has conducted over 13.36 crore tests so far to detect Covid-19 cases, including 10,99,545 in a day, while the cumulative positivity rate in the country is sustained at low levels and the daily positivity rate has fallen below four per cent, the health ministry said on Tuesday. The country registered less than 40,000 fresh coronavirus cases in a span of 24 hours after six days. Since November 8, the number of daily cases has been sustained below the 50,000-mark, the ministry said.   Russia will charge less for its Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine than rivals as Moscow aims to produce more than 1 billion doses at home and abroad next year, the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund said on Tuesday. "The cost of one dose of the #SputnikV vaccine for the external market will be less than $10 (two doses per person is necessary) – two or more times cheaper than mRNA vaccines with similar efficacy levels (based on announced mRNA vaccines pricing & interim Phase III results)," tweeted the vaccine maker. The vaccine will be free of charge for Russian citizens.   Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday cautioned states and union territories against any laxity in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic and called for reducing the positivity and fatality rates by focusing on curbing the virus transmission. Interacting with Chief Ministers, the Prime Minister also called for more RT-PCR tests, even as he underlined that India's Covid-19 situation is more stable than other countries in terms of recovery and fatality rates.   Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa on Tuesday said that the Covid-19 vaccine may be available in a month. Speaking to media persons, at the Mysuru Airport, at Mandakalli, on the outskirts of the city, the CM said, "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has directed the CMs of all states, in a video conference, to make arrangements to administer the vaccine in phases, on priority".   Virat Kohli and Ravichandran Ashwin were on Tuesday nominated for the coveted ICC Men's Player of the Decade Award with the Indian captain featuring in all five men's categories for his incredible run in the last 10 years. Kohli and veteran off-spinner Ashwin are the two Indians among seven players nominated for the most prestigious award. Besides the Indian duo, Joe Root (England), Kane Williamson (New Zealand), Steve Smith (Australia), AB de Villiers (South Africa), and Kumar Sangakkara (Sri Lanka) are the other contenders in this category.   The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) busted an international drug racket and arrested four persons including two women and two Nigerian nationals in Bengaluru. NCB officials also seized 6.8 kg of the drug - Pseudoephedrine - worth nearly Rs 20 lakh. Based on intelligence inputs on November 11, NCB officials under the guidance of Amit Ghawate, zonal director of Bengaluru, raided a courier outlet in Amruthahalli and seized the parcel. The drug, Pseudoephedrine, was concealed in baby bags. Preliminary investigation found that the parcels were destined to two different consignees in South Africa.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday said that India had signed an agreement with Afghanistan for building the Shatoot Dam on the Kabul River basin. He made the announcement while participating at a virtual conference held to pledge support of the international community for reconstruction of Afghanistan. Jaishankar also announced that India would soon launch the Phase-IV of its High Impact Community Development Programme in Afghanistan, including around 150 projects worth $80 million. The Shahtoot Dam is proposed to be built in the Chahar Asiab district near Kabul. The dam will be built on a tributary of Kabul River, which originates from Sanglakh Range of Hindu Kush Mountain and flows through Kabul, Surobi and Jalalabad in Afghanistan before flowing into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan. New Delhi’s plan to support Kabul to build the Shahtoot Dam is likely to raise hackles in Pakistan. Islamabad has been opposing the proposed dam arguing that such projects on the Kabul River and its tributaries in Afghanistan will reduce the flow of water into Pakistan. Pakistan has in fact been nudging Afghanistan to sign a treaty on sharing of water of Kabul River and its tributaries. The proposal, however, has not yet received a positive response from the Afghan Government, which fears that such a treaty might make it difficult for it to go ahead with its plan to build irrigation and hydroelectric projects in the Kabul River basin. The construction of the Shahtoot Dam may cost $ 300 million. Apart from providing potable water to over two million residents of Kabul, it will help irrigate 4,000 hectares land in Chahar Asiab and Khairabad in the vicinity of the capital city of Afghanistan. It will also help provide drinking water for the first phase of the new city at Dehsabz in the outskirts of Kabul, sources told DH. New Delhi agreed to support the Afghan Government build the Shahtoot Dam near Kabul, more than four years after completing construction of Salma Dam at Herat province of western Afghanistan, the last in a series of major infrastructure projects New Delhi embarked upon since 2001 to help in the reconstruction of the war-torn country. India has already spent $3 billion to support development projects in Afghanistan. Jaishankar’s announcement on New Delhi’s support to construction of Shahtoot Dam in Kabul came amid concerns about the possibility of Pakistan trying to elbow out India from Afghanistan by taking undue advantage of its role in setting the stage for the peace process with Taliban. The announcement by the External Affairs Minister signalled New Delhi’s intent to continue to support development of infrastructure in Afghanistan. “Increasing level of violence in Afghanistan remains a matter of grave concern. While we support all efforts to bring peace and stability in Afghanistan, India calls for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire,” Jaishankar said on Tuesday, adding: “We also believe that the peace process must be Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-signs-pact-for-building-dam-in-afghanistan-brushing-aside-opposition-from-pakistan-919455.html

Addressing an election rally here, BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh came down heavily on the NC, the PDP and the Congress, saying they have kept J-K hostage for more than five decades and claimed that the Roshni scam was only the tip of the iceberg. "The two private companies, Abdullah and sons and Mufti and sons, have played havoc with Jammu and Kashmir, both administratively and economically," he said. He alleged that "the two families" conspired to deprive women of their rights on the pretext of Article 370 and owed an explanation to them.   "The recent Rs 25,000-crore scam unearthed by the government was just the tip of an iceberg," he said, referring to the alleged Roshni scam. "There are hundreds of such scams that have taken place in the last 50 years by the Abdullah-Mufti families to build their properties," he alleged at the rally for the BJP candidate in District Development Council polls Sushma Devi. The Jammu and Kashmir State Land (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act, 2001, also known as the Roshni Act, was struck down by the High Court. It is alleged that several prominent leaders had benefited from the law which legalised their encroachments on government and forest land. The BJP asked the Congress to explain its support to the Gupkar alliance which, he alleged, was indulging in anti-democratic and anti-national actions. Chugh also alleged that the Congress had been surreptitiously supporting the Chinese designs in the region and has been working hand-in-glove with anti-national forces. Former minister Sat Sharma, J&K BJP Vice-President Yudhvir Sethi, spokesperson Rajiv Jasrotia and other senior leaders from the union territory also addressed the gathering.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/muftis-abdullahs-acted-like-private-companies-deprived-jk-people-of-development-bjp-919463.html

"There should be some arrangement so that Covid-19 victims are buried at graveyards in their neighbourhoods and their relatives do not have to come here because space is limited," said Haji Mian Faiyazuddin, secretary of Qabristan Ahle Islam in the vicinity of the walled city. He said the management committee will write to the Delhi government for help to ensure that Covid-19 burials from other parts of the city are not shifted to the graveyard. Faiyazuddin said a problem faced by the graveyard management is that it also has to provide space for burial of Covid-19 patients from neighbouring cities like Noida, Ghaziabad and Meerut who die while undergoing treatment in Delhi. "Yesterday itself we provided space from a Covid 19 victim who passed away here in a hospital. We do not have any problem but space is a real issue," he said. Although the space issue is not that grave at the moment but if the current rate of burials continue, there could be difficulty in accommodating even normal burials in around two months, he said. "We receive around 4-5 bodies of Covid-19 victims these days. A total of 67 Covid-19 victims were buried here in September, 57 in October and in November so far 50 bodies have been buried," Faiyazuddin said. Staring at space crunch, the graveyard management last month had readied 5-6 acres of extra space for burials of casualties caused by the virus. The Covid-19 burials at the ITO graveyard, measuring about 50 acres, started in April. Delhi reported 121 deaths due to Covid-19 on Monday. On Sunday, 121 fatalities pushed the death toll to 8,391, authorities said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-graveyard-running-out-of-burial-space-with-rise-in-covid-19-deaths-919477.html

One of the two accused, Suryadeep Malhotra, is a friend of accused Showik Chakraborty, brother of Rajput's girlfriend and prime accused Rhea Chakraborty in the drugs case. Besides Malhotra, who was arrested in September this year, special NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act court judge GB Gurao also granted bail to a suspected drug peddler, Ankush Anreja, on a personal bond of Rs 50,000. The court also directed them against tampering with the evidence or investigation of the case. According to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Anreja used to run a kitchen in a posh locality in the city. He is allegedly involved in selling contrabands like weed, Hash and MD to high-profile clients, the agency had said. The NCB has been probing the alleged use in some quarters of Bollywood after the death of Rajput in June on the basis of WhatsApp chats involving drugs. The Central agency had earlier arrested Rhea Chakraborty, Showik, some staff members of the deceased actor and a few others under various sections of the NDPS Act. Rhea Chakraborty and some other accused are already out on bail.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/showik-chakrabortys-friend-peddler-get-bail-in-drugs-case-related-to-sushant-singh-rajputs-death-919482.html

Speaking online from the United States on ‘Every Child Counts Towards a More Democratic Education for India’, he said that though the closure of schools is driven because of the pandemic, it is surely a matter of concern. “We still do not know when schools would re-open fully across the country,” said Prof Banerjee, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2019 along with Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer. According to him, the government has called for a rapid shift to online learning, however, as of 2017-18, only 28 per cent of Indian households had internet. In rural areas, it was just 14 per cent. “Just getting a small smartphone will not help…you need more,” he said. Prof Banerjee said that there is going to be automatic promotion to next grades for many children. "The levels are going to be even more heterogeneous....Don’t attempt to quickly go back to the curriculum,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nobel-laureate-abhijit-banerjee-likens-covid-19-to-tsunami-on-education-in-developing-countries-919487.html

The court allowed an appeal filed by B K Ravichandra and others against the Karnataka HC's order which had in 2008 rejected their claim to the Union government to vacate their over four acres of lands in Bengaluru South, acquired in the 1960s for defence purposes. The court said the HC by its judgment "committed an error in refusing relief to the appellants". It pointed out 33 years after cessation of the Union government’s legal possession, was a long enough time to be kept away from one’s property.  It directed the Union government to hand back possession of the lands to the appellants, within three months. Justice Bhat, who authored the judgement, said it was, however, open to the appellants to seek compensation based on fresh fixation of capital value and recurring annual value, based on the different five-year period for the last 20 years. It also directed the Centre to pay Rs 75,000 as cost of litigation to the appellants. "The courts’ role is to act as the guarantor and jealous protector of the people’s liberties: be they assured through the freedoms, and the right to equality and religion or cultural rights under Part III, or the right against deprivation, in any form, through any process other than law," the bench said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/permitting-govt-to-occupy-ones-property-indefinitely-would-lead-to-lawlessness-supreme-court-919489.html

The Union Ministry of Housing has issued notices to several prominent artists including Kathak exponent Pandit Birju Maharaj, Dhrupad vocalist Ut Wasifuddin Dagar, Kuchipudi dancer Guru Jayarama Rao, painter and sculptor Jatin Das, iconic Mohiniyattam dancer Bharati Shivaji and Kathak guru Geetanjali Lal, asking them to vacant government houses by December 31. Protesting the Ministry diktat, 27 artists in their joint letter to the government said that it was inhuman to evict them during the pandemic. Though the Ministry was well within its rights to vacate their accommodation since most of the artists are aged and made a lot of contribution to society, the government should reconsider its decision, the appeal said. However, the Housing and Urban Development Ministry is no mood to change its decision. "They have been asked to vacate their houses as they were overstaying in the government accommodation," said an official in the Ministry. If allottees don't vacate their accommodations by December 31, eviction proceedings would be initiated as per Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, the eviction notice issued to them said. The government also decided to waive all punitive charges from 2014 to September 30, 2020. If artists failed to vacate by December 30, they will have to pay their outstanding dues. But if they vacate within the deadline, all their dues will be waived off, said the official. These accommodations are in posh colonies, including Lodhi Colony, Shahajan Road,  Pandara Road, Asian Games Village, Kaka Nagar, Gulmohar Park and  R K Puram.  The Ministry in 2014 itself had decided to end the allocation of bungalows under different quotas including artists, sportspersons and journalists. The Ministry of Culture has 40 residential units under different quotas, some are still staying it despite the government has been asking them to vacate it, said an official in the  Culture Ministry. According to the Housing Ministry, these artists have found overstaying in government accommodation. Even in some cases, they were overstaying for more than 30 years, paying a nominal licence fee against the limit of stay for six years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/union-housing-ministry-asks-27-eminent-artists-including-birju-maharaj-jatin-das-to-vacate-govt-bungalows-919512.html

The central government has arrested the suspected Chinese agents. Earlier this year, in August, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had registered a money laundering case against a Chinese national for allegedly running a hawala racket worth an estimated Rs 1,000 crore using shell or dubious firms. They said the central probe agency had pressed sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against 42-year-old Charlie Peng, alias Luo Sang, who is alleged to be the kingpin of the racket. Investigations revealed that he had crossed into India in 2013 and first settled in Manipur where he married an Indian woman and later moved to Delhi to collect information on the whereabouts of key Tibetan refugees and people close to Dalai Lama in India, the report said. Peng, according to PTI sources, was alleged to be holding a fake Indian passport and tax officials had said he created a "web of sham companies to launder hawala funds to and from China" in the past two-three years. They said his front or showcase business was of import and export of medical and electronic goods and some other items. Evidence of foreign hawala transactions involving Hong Kong and US dollars have also been unearthed, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had said, when Peng was held.  "Incriminating documents of hawala transactions and money laundering with active involvement of bank employees and Chartered Accountants have been found as a result of the search action," it said.

Farmers have boarded tractors and driving cars from Punjab, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Rajasthan with plans to reach the national capital on Thursday or sit on a protest wherever they are stopped, Darshan Pal Singh, President of the Krantikari Kisan Union, told reporters through a video link. Even as farmers were spelling out protest plans, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar invited leaders of 32 farmers’ organisations from Punjab for further talks on the farm sector reforms after they agreed to temporarily suspend their two-month old agitation and allow running of railway services in the state. Singh claimed Haryana government had already launched a crackdown against farmers’ leaders and closed down border points with Punjab to prevent farmers from reaching Delhi. “We have decided to approach Delhi through all the nine border check posts and plan to stage protests right where we are stopped,” he said. “Farmers’ indefinite struggle with Dilli Chalo on November 26th onwards has been launched in full strength and we will intensify the struggle from here on,” the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee said. Sunilam of the Kisan Sangharsh Samiti claimed that the Delhi Police had withdrawn the permission for holding a rally at the Ramlila grounds and instead asked farmers to stage a token protest at Jantar Mantar with a maximum 100 participants given the Covid-19 pandemic situation in the capital. Kavita Kuruganti of ASHA-Kisan Swaraj said farmers had also planned localised protests across the country with newly elected MLAs of Left parties in Bihar sitting on demonstration at the state assembly premises.

Sonia Gandhi-led party has been divided into two after its poor performance in the Bihar Assembly Elections.  Talking about facing repeated defeats, Baghel maintained a positive stance and said that there would be improvement and change.  He also slammed BJP for "scrapping through" in Bihar polls. He said, "Is the BJP winning everywhere? How did they perform in Goa or Karnataka? Yes, they formed the government through backdoor breaking parties but how did they perform? Even in Bihar, they just scraped through. They managed to get just three seats more than the halfway mark. They have 125. Are they comfortable? It is not a clear-cut majority. Just scraping through is not enough. The question is how much the people appreciated your policies and programmes." Recently, senior party leaders like Ghulam Nabi Azad, Kapil Sibal opened up about problems in the party. But Baghel feels that these issues must be discussed at the party and not outside. "It can be said in the party forum. The CWC meets regularly. Ghar ki baat toh aap bahar main thodi na karenge. See, if there is some issue between father and son at home. It has one meaning and if they take it outside, it will have a different meaning," the news website quoted him as saying. Two days ago senior Congress leader Azam slammed his own party by saying that there was a huge disconnect between people and Congress leaders and "five-star culture" had crept into the party.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/party-issues-must-be-discussed-at-cwc-not-outside-says-congress-leader-bhupesh-baghel-919357.html

Now, give people’s savings directly to banks set up by these same companies,” former Congress President Rahul Gandhi said. Hitting out at the Modi government with the ‘Suit-boot ki sarkar’ jibe, Rahul referred to reports about former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan expressing strong reservations over the RBI Working Group proposal to allow corporate houses to set up banks. “Its most important recommendation, couched amidst a number of largely technical regulatory rationalisations, is a bombshell,” Rajan said in an article co-authored by former RBI Deputy Governor Viral Acharya. AICC General Secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala described the RBI proposal as a “concerted conspiracy of the Modi government to demolish the last edifice of keeping people’s money safe in banks.” “This is a perverse idea to help big businesses access public money to fund their own ventures by banks owned and controlled by them. A new model of economic subjugation by a few,” Surjewala said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/understand-the-chronology-congress-takes-a-jibe-at-bjp-slams-rbis-move-to-allow-corporate-sector-to-start-banks-919418.html

Without taking any name, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said BJP's Minister of State for Home Affairs earlier this year said in Parliament that the concept of 'Love Jihad' has no place in law and till now no case has been reported by central agencies in this connection. "Hence, the legal definition of 'Love Jihad' needs to be decided first," the editorial said. Referring to the short-lived BJP-NCP government formed in Maharashtra a year ago when Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar took oath as chief minister and Dy CM, respectively, in a ceremony held at dawn in Raj Bhavan, the editorial termed it as 'love jihad'. That government collapsed within 80 hours of its formation. Later, the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress came together and formed the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Some BJP-ruled states have announced plans to prevent the so-called 'love jihad', a term coined by Hindutva activists to describe an alleged conspiracy to convert Hindu women to Islam by marrying them. Fadnavis had last week said that incidents of 'love jihad' were taking place in the country and therefore, laws to curb the practice were justified. "BJP leaders should come out of the illusion that they can trouble the Maharashtra government by harping on the issue of 'love jihad'," the editorial said. Hindutva needs to be protected at all levels and "not just when it comes to marriages and elections", it said and also pitched for bringing in the Uniform Civil Code.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/love-jihad-needs-to-be-first-defined-legally-shiv-sena-919468.html

According to the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) mobile application SAMEER, the city's air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 361 in the morning. The six stations that recorded an AQI in the "severe" category are Anand Vihar (413), Ashok Vihar (407), Chandni Chowk (410), Jahangirpuri (424), Patparganj (411) and Vivek Vihar (426). The capital's AQI was in the "severe" category on November 15 but it improved since and remained in either the "poor" or the "moderate" category until November 22. Delhi's AQI was 302 on Monday, 274 on Sunday, 251 on Saturday, 296 on Friday, 283 on Thursday and 211 on Wednesday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". However, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, the stubble-burning count significantly decreased to 149 on Sunday, contributing to six per cent in Delhi's air on Monday. It said winds are expected to slow down and a low ventilation is expected, adding that if the stubble-burning count increases, the AQI will further worsen to "severe". Stubble-burning accounted for 12 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on Sunday. It was 13 per cent on Saturday, 15 per cent on Friday, 20 per cent on Thursday and eight per cent on Wednesday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-remains-in-very-poor-category-919317.html

Last week, Baghel had written to the Union Minister Shah seeking the Centre's assistance in creating employment opportunities in Naxal-hit areas of the state and Shah assured immediate action on the same. Talking about Naxalism in the state, the chief minister told the publication that some of the famous Maoist leaders had been arrested or killed in encounters. Apart from job opportunities, he pointed out that there was also a need for road connectivity, electricity, mobile towers, health and education facilities for the people in Naxal-hit areas. He further added that the state has set up a commission to review cases lodged against people in Maoist-affected areas. "We have had meetings of all officers at the DG level and taking into consideration all aspects we will soon act. Our officers are looking into the cases of those who have been arrested or detained in the name of Naxal… There will be results soon," the report quoted him as saying.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/cm-bhupesh-baghel-praises-amit-shah-for-positive-response-to-end-chhattisgarhs-maoist-problem-919321.html

But according to Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, the situation is rapidly changing. "There is much talk about the Chhattisgarh model nowadays. Be it the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana or Gordhan Nyay Yojana…and be it arrangements we made for people who returned to the state during the coronavirus period… the issue of forest rights or minor forest produce… or the fight against malnutrition… our state is number one", he said. He said that people in Chhattisgarh have become economically prosperous, and a proof that is the record sales in motorcycles.  "Chhattisgarh has seen record sales in motorcycles. That shows money has reached the hands of the people. And there is record coal and steel production because we did not allow mines or plants to shut down," he explained. He also said that the state government's performance on providing jobs under MGNREGA during the coronavirus period is a matter much discussion, for the coronavirus outbreak and subsequent lockdown resulted in a large scale loss of jobs in the country. And also, at a time when the Indian economy is described by experts to be in a perilous situation, Chhattisgarh's GST collection has only improved and the 'economic slowdown' has kept a safe distance from the state. "In this time of economic slowdown when GDP growth is on the decline and GDP size is shrinking…when other states are lagging in GST collection…Chhattisgarh registered a 24 per cent growth in GST collection in September and came second in the country," he said. "In October, Chhattisgarh was ranked No. 1 in the country in GST collection with a 26 per cent growth and shared the top slot with Andhra Pradesh. There is a slowdown across the country but not in Chhattisgarh," he added. When asked to elaborate on how Chhattisgarh has implemented the MGNREGA scheme, he stated that the state government had increased its implementation during the Covid-19 lockdown, resulting in the procurement of more jobs and people started becoming stable monetarily. He also revealed that the state had bagged the second position in the country in providing jobs under MGNREGA during the lockdown. Then, the government launched Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana on May 21 and started depositing money in the accounts of farmers. "Similarly during the lockdown..we made arrangements for procurement of minor forest produce ..tendu leaves, mahua, tamarind…so money reached the hands of the tribals. We ensured that money reached the hands of farmers, workers and tribals. And we have topped in steel and coal production and in the procurement of minor forest produce," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/record-sale-of-motorcycles-shows-that-chhattisgarh-is-economically-prosperous-says-cm-bhupesh-baghel-919323.html

The meeting comes after farmer leaders laid a condition for another central ministerial meeting while calling off their 'rail roko' agitation in Punjab on Monday and lifted the nearly two-month-long blockade, allowing resumption of only goods trains. Speaking to PTI, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said, "We have called the representatives of over 30 farmer organisations for the second round of discussion on December 3 at Vigyan Bhawan at 11 am". The secretary has sent the invitation to the farmer bodies on behalf of Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar. Food Minister Piyush Goyal is also expected to be present in the meeting. Officials from food and agriculture departments of the Punjab government have also been invited for the talks. The first round of talks was held on November 13, but it remained inconclusive, with both sides sticking to their ground. Punjab farmers have been demanding the repeal of the new farm laws and replace them with another set of laws framed after wider consultation with stakeholders. They also demanded a guarantee on the MSP front, as they claimed that these new laws may lead to the end of minimum support prices (MSP) procurement, which the Centre has denied. When asked about their demand on MSP, the secretary said, "Earlier laws too did not have any mention of MSP. Even the new agri-laws do not mention it. MSP is mentioned only in the National Food Security Act (NFSA) which has not been changed. Till Public Distribution System (PDS) is there, MSP will continue". The Prime Minister has also stated this and even the Union Agriculture Minister has said in Parliament that MSP will continue, he added. "We have explained in detail to farmer unions about this issue. Hopefully, we will resolve the issue with them at the December 3 meeting," he noted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farm-laws-protest-centre-calls-punjab-farmers-for-2nd-round-of-talks-on-december-3-919329.html

The query by Justice Navin Chawla came after the central government said it has issued an office memorandum on November 18 allowing reopening of spas, while Delhi government said it was not going to permit that in view of the third wave of Covid-19 infections in the city. The counsel appearing for Delhi government told the court that he was given oral instructions that spas would not be reopened in view of prevailing conditions in the national capital and sought time to file an affidavit giving reasons for the same. To this the court asked, "Why? Why only spas? What is so special about spas? You have opened everything else. Look at markets, restaurants, metros, buses, all are open and running full time." It directed the Delhi government to indicate, in its affidavit, what was special about spas that they were not being allowed to open, when everything else was being permitted. During the hearing, the central government told the court that while it "has cleared the decks" for reopening spas, the final decision with regard to the same has been left to the Delhi government. The court, thereafter, listed the matter for hearing on December 4. It was hearing a plea moved by several persons who run spas which have been shut since the first lockdown was enforced in Delhi. In their plea, filed through advocates Rajeshwar Dagar and Himanshu Dagar, the spa owners have contended that they have been trained as professional therapists under the National Skills Development Mission launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They have further contended that when a maximum number of businesses, like salons, gyms, restaurants and bars, have been granted permission to reopen and even Delhi Metro has been restarted, then why not the spas. The petitioners have claimed that the spas in other states are running with full safety measures, but are not permitted in Delhi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/why-spas-not-reopened-when-markets-restaurants-buses-metro-running-hc-asks-aap-govt-919375.html

Madhya Pradesh reported 1,798 and 1,701 fresh Covid-19 cases on Sunday and Monday, respectively, taking the total caseload in the state to 1,94,745. "About 4,000 prisoners are currently out of jails on parole in the state.

Parole is the temporary or permanent release of a prisoner before the expiry of a sentence, on the promise of good behaviour. The decision to grant parole to inmates of jails was taken in March this year after the Supreme Court directed states to take steps to decongest jails so as to contain the spread of coronavirus in these facilities. In Madhya Pradesh, parole of prisoners was extended by another 60 days in September this year. 4,000 of the total 43,000 inmates from 125 jails in the state had been granted parole while 3,000 others were released on interim bail.

24-11-2020||North and Central||SC mulls notice to Maharashtra Speaker over letter to Arnab Goswami||The Supreme Court on Tuesday mulled issuing notice to the Maharasthra Speaker in a contempt case against Assistant Secretary of the State Legislative Assembly. The Assembly official had earlier questioned Republic TV's Editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami for his petition in the top court against a privilege notice for criticising Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.  This had on November 6 led the apex court to ask the official to show cause why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against him. On Tuesday, hearing the petition by Goswami, a bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde broached the idea of issuing notice to the Speaker. "The Speaker should not argue tomorrow that he was not heard," the bench said. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Goswami, submitted a notice should be issued to the Speaker as well. Senior advocate Arvind Datar, appearing as amicus curiae, agreed that a notice should be issued to the Speaker since the Assistant Secretary submitted he was acting as an agent of the Speaker. Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for the Assistant Secretary, said there was no contempt nor was there any attempt to obstruct the administration of justice, when the letter was issued questioning Goswami why he produced Assembly proceedings before the top court. He also objected to contempt notice to the Speaker. Dave maintained that there can't be contempt notice unless it was shown that there was contempt. The court, however, put the matter for consideration after two weeks. On November 6, the court protected Goswami from arrest in the case related to privilege notice, issued for criticising Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, and summoned the Assistant Secretary personally before it. The court had then expressed anguish at the conduct of Vilas Athwale, Assistant Secretary of the Assembly, saying "it amounts to serious and direct interference into the administration of justice". Athwale had shot off a letter to Goswami on October 13, questioning him how he produced the missives sent to him by the Speaker and Privilege Committee since they were confidential in nature. "No authority in the country can penalise someone for approaching this court. This is in teeth of Article 32 of the Constitution. How dare this officer wrote something like this in his letter," the bench had said. On Tuesday, Athwale maintained that the letter was issued at the instance of the Speaker.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sc-mulls-notice-to-maharashtra-speaker-over-letter-to-arnab-goswami-919396.html

During a press conference here, Rai said that a 15-member impact assessment committee has ascertained the effectiveness of the Pusa bio-decomposer solution in reducing stubble burning in the capital and it was submitted to the Environment Ministry's Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas on Monday. He said the commission was informed that the bio-decomposer used in 2000 acre land in the capital turned 90-95 per cent crop residue into manure in 15-20 days.  “Stubble burning has contributed to escalation of Covid-19 cases in last 15 days as it has made Delhi's air more poisonous. We need to find a permanent solution to this problem as we cannot put more lives in danger. “We urge the air quality commission to get the Pusa bio-decomposer sprayed in the states of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan considering its success in Delhi,” Rai said. He said that the government could do so at half the cost of providing subsidy to farmers. “In last many years, government has been spending money in providing subsidy to farmers to procure machines to cut crop residue. But farmers still have to spend a lot of money from their pocket which is why they resort to burning the crop residue. “In half the amount being spent on machines, government can get the bio-decomposer sprayed in the neighbouring states without farmers having to spend anything,” he said. According to scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, the solution can turn crop residue into manure in 15-20 days and can prevent stubble burning.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/air-quality-management-commission-should-consider-use-of-bio-decomposer-for-stubble-919398.html

J&K administration made public names of people, including politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen, who were beneficiaries of the Rs 25,000 crore Roshni Act enacted by Jammu and Kashmir Assembly in 2001. On November 1, the UT government cancelled all land transfers that took place under the J&K State Land (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act, 2001 – also known as the Roshni Act – under which 2.5 lakh acres of land was to be transferred to the existing occupants. The list of the beneficiaries was made public by the administration in accordance with the October 9 directive of the High Court which has declared Roshni Act “illegal, unconstitutional and unsustainable” and ordered a CBI probe into the allotment of the land under this law. As per the details of state land (physically encroached but not shown in revenue records), uploaded on the website of divisional commissioner Jammu on Tuesday, Abdullahs have encroached on seven kanals and seven marlas (nearly an acre) of state land in Sunjwan area of Jammu. Reacting to his name surfacing in the Roshni scam list, Farooq Abdullah said, “Not only my house, there are hundreds of others in the area. I will not react to this as they just want to disturb Farooq Abdullah. Let them do it.” His son Omar said the news is completely false and is being spread with malicious intent and both his (senior Abdullah’s) houses at Jammu and Srinagar have nothing to do with the said Act. “Dr Farooq Abdullah has NOT availed of the Roshni Scheme for either his residence in Srinagar or in Jammu and anyone who says otherwise is lying. The fact that they are using sources to plant this story shows that it has no legs to stand on,” he said. Roshni Act was first introduced in the budget speech of 2000 by then finance minister Abdul Rahim Rather of the NC. In 2005, the PDP government-led by (late) Mufti Mohammed Syed relaxed the cut-off year to 2004. The Congress government led by Ghulam Nabi Azad, further relaxed the cut-off year to 2007. The Comptroller and Auditor General, in a 2014 report, had stated that only Rs 76 crore had been collected from the transfer of encroached land between 2007 and 2013, as against the target of about Rs 25,000 crore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farooq-omar-abdullah-figure-in-rs-25000-crore-roshni-land-scam-in-jk-919424.html

These rights are guaranteed under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. A division bench comprising Justice Vivek Agarwal and Justice Pankaj Naqvi, in its 14-page order, said that ''interference in a personal relationship would constitute a serious encroachment into the right of freedom of choice of the two individuals. The court's judgement, which was delivered around a few days back, came on a writ petition filed by Salamat Ali Ansari and Priyanka Kharwar alias Alia, who had invoked the extraordinary jurisdiction of the court seeking quashing of an FIR lodged by Priyanka's parents charging Ansari with kidnapping and abduction to compel her to marry him. Priyanka and Ansari, both residents of Uttar Pradesh's Kushinagar district, about 350 kilometre from Lucknow, had married last year, later she had converted to Islam. ''We do not see Priyanka Kharwar and Salamat as Hindu and Muslim, rather as two grown-up individuals who, out of their own free will and choice, are living together peacefully and happily over a year...the courts and the Constitutional Courts in particular, are enjoined to uphold the life and liberty of an individual guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India,'' the bench said. ''We fail to understand that if the law permits two persons even of the same sex to live together peacefully then neither any individual nor a family nor even State can have objection to relationship of two major individuals who out of their own free will are living together,'' it said. The court, citing previous decisions in this regard, said that once a person becomes a major (above 18 years of age) he or she could marry whosoever he/she liked. ''If the parents of the boy or girl do not approve of such inter-caste or inter-religious marriage the maximum they can do is that they can cut-off social relations with the son or the daughter, but they cannot give threats or commit or instigate acts of violence and cannot harass the person who undergoes such inter-caste or inter-religious marriage,'' it said. The court ordered quashing of the FIR on the ground that no offence was committed out as also the fact that two grown-up individuals were before us, living together for over a year of their own free will and choice.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/choice-of-partners-by-adults-is-a-fundamental-right-allahabad-hc-quashes-fir-against-interfaith-couple-919439.html
24-11-2020||North and Central||UP okays ordinance against 'love jihad', violators face up to 10 yrs in jail||Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday gave its approval to the law against religious conversion through deceit, force, allurement or any other fraudulent means or for the purpose of marriage, providing for a maximum of ten years imprisonment, along with a fine. The draft ordinance in this regard was approved by the state cabinet at its meeting here chaired by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. According to an official spokesman here, the ordinance puts religious conversions under certain situations under the category of an offence. "Religious conversion, if done under duress, force, allurement or any other fraudulent means or for the purpose of marriage will be an offence under the law," he said. He also said that the registration of certain social organisations involved in mass religious conversion would be cancelled and stern action would be taken against them. The onus of proving that the religious conversion had not be undertaken through the means mentioned under the law would be on the person converting and the one, who was getting him converted. "If conversion is done for the purpose of marriage only then such marriages will be declared as void under the this law," he added. The ordinance provided for a punishment with imprisonment for a minimum period of one year and maximum period of five years besides a fine of Rs 15,000. In case of minor girl and women from SC and ST communities, the minimum imprisonment would be of two years while the maximum imprisonment will be for ten years besides a fine of Rs 25,000. Three years of minimum and ten years of maximum imprisonment had been provided for mass religious conversion. A fine of Rs 50,000 would also be imposed on the offenders. Any one wanting to convert on one's own volition to marry would have to compulsorily give an application in this regard to the concerned district magistrate a month in advance. The ordinance comes with days after UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's warning that those indulging in 'love jihad'  should be ready for 'Ram Naam Satya' journey.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-okays-ordinance-against-love-jihad-violators-face-up-to-10-yrs-in-jail-919457.html

In a tweet in Hindi, the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister also said the BJP government should ensure that the coronavirus vaccination does not become "a victim of corruption". "The government should not play with the lives of the people and increase the testing of Corona and bring out the true figures. The BJP government in UP should promise free vaccination in the interest of the state and immediately get ready in advance by making a task force," Yadav said in a tweet. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had on Monday directed officials to make preparations in advance for the administration of the Covid-19 vaccine to people. It is expected that the vaccine will be available in India early next year. सरकार जनता के जीवन से न खेले और कोरोना की जाँच बढ़ाए व सच्चे आँकड़े सामने लाए. उप्र की भाजपा सरकार प्रदेश हित में मुफ़्त टीकाकरण का वादा करे व एक टॉस्क फ़ोर्स बनाकर तुरंत अग्रिम तैयारी में जुट जाए. भाजपा सरकार सुनिश्चित करे कि कोरोना का टीकाकरण भ्रष्टाचार का शिकार नहीं होगा. "All preparations for the vaccination should be done in advance. Covid-19 vaccination work should be conducted with inter-departmental coordination. A strong arrangement of the cold chain for vaccine preservation should be ensured in all districts by December 15," the chief minister had said. Presently, there are 23,928 active cases in the state while 4,99,507 people have been treated and discharged. The death toll from the pandemic stood at 7,582 on Monday, according to official figures.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bjp-govt-should-promise-free-covid-19-vaccination-in-uttar-pradesh-akhilesh-yadav-919461.html

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted before a bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde that he had made a statement before the apex court on September 14 that authorities are going to take a decision on the issue and till then no coercive action would be taken against these slum dwellers. “The deliberations are going on. We are not taking any coercive steps,” Mehta said. The bench, while taking note of Mehta's submission, said it would hear the matter after four weeks. The court on August 31 had directed the removal of around 48,000 slum dwellings along the railway tracks in Delhi within three months and said there shall not be any kind of political interference in execution of the plan. On September 14, Mehta had told the top court that Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and the Delhi Government are going to take a decision on the issue and till then they will not take any coercive action against the slum dwellers residing along the around 140 km railway tracks in the national capital. Senior Congress leader Ajay Maken approached the court seeking rehabilitation of these slum dwellers prior to their removal.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/no-coercive-action-will-be-taken-against-slum-dwellers-in-delhi-centre-to-sc-919494.html
24-11-2020||North and Central||Haryana announces new limits on social gathering sizes due to rise in Covid-19 cases||Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday said the Haryana government has decided to limit the number of people allowed at social gatherings like marriages, religious or political functions with a view to contain the recent surge in Covid-19 cases, especially in some NCR districts. In the six National Capital Region (NCR) districts of Gurugram, Faridabad, Rewari, Rohtak, Hisar and Sonipat, the government has decided to limit the number of persons allowed at social gatherings to a maximum 50 for such events held indoor and 100 for outdoor. However, in the remaining districts of the state, the gathering has been limited to 100 people for indoor functions and 200 for outdoor ones. "These orders will be effective from November 26," Khattar informed this during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's interaction via video conference with chief ministers of states that are witnessing a surge in coronavirus cases, a state government statement said here. Haryana's Health Minister Anil Vij was also present during the video conference. Speaking to reporters later, Khattar ruled out the possibility of imposing a night curfew to help check the spread of the virus in the state. "During night time, especially in winters in Haryana, there is not much movement of people and imposing a night curfew is not going to serve much purpose," he said. During the video conference, Khattar said the situation of Covid-19 in Haryana remained satisfactory in the "first and second phase". "However, in the third wave of Covid-19 (in November), a spurt in the number of cases has been registered in the past few days, especially in the districts adjoining the NCR," he said. He said that keeping in view heavy movement of people in the NCR, the state government has ramped up Covid-19 testing in the region so that people found positive could be isolated to keep a check on the further spread of the infection. Haryana over the past several days has been recording a daily spike of over 2,000 cases, with NCR districts like Gurugram and Faridabad being the worst-hit. Referring to various steps being taken by the state government to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, Khattar said, "Testing in Haryana has reached 1.24 lakh per million which is much more than the national average of 80,000 per million". He said the state is conducting 32,000 tests per day, which would be further increased in the coming days. Apart from this, special emphasis is being given on the contact-tracing of Covid-19 cases, he said. The chief minister said the people in the state are being encouraged to wear face masks and maintain social distancing. In his interaction with reporters, Khattar said one crore masks would soon be distributed to the people. Police and Urban Local Bodies Department have been directed to strictly enforce mask-wearing and issue challans to the offenders. A fine of Rs 500 will be imposed on those who are found without masks, he added. To a question, he said while Rs 24-25 crore has been collected as fines so far for violations such as not wearing masks, the intent behind the penalties is that these should act as a deterrent so that people get into the habit of following all guidelines laid down by the government to check the spread of Covid-19. He said the state government is "fully geared up" to deal with the present Covid-19 situation and has further strengthened its hospital infrastructure. An arrangement of 57,000 beds has been made in different hospitals of the state which is sufficient keeping in view the number of cases, the chief minister said. "Also, sufficient number of oxygen cylinders, ventilators, ICU beds are available in the state," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/haryana-announces-new-limits-on-social-gathering-sizes-due-to-rise-in-covid-19-cases-919500.html
24-11-2020||North and Central||Punjab CM Amarinder Singh sets up a lunch meeting with Navjot Singh Sidhu tomorrow||Seeking to sink differences, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has invited bete-noire Navjot Singh Sidhu for talks on Wednesday. Sidhu, who quit the BJP to join the Congress ahead of the Punjab assembly elections in 2017, has had a testy relationship with Amarinder, mostly on account of the cricketer-turned-politician’s political ambitions and an independent streak which has led to friction. “Punjab CM Amarinder Singh has invited Navjot Singh Sidhu for lunch tomorrow (November 25). He & Sidhu are expected to discuss state & national politics over the luncheon meeting,” Raveen Thukral, media advisor to the Punjab Chief Minister said on Twitter. The rift between the two leaders grew after the Congress’ lower than expected performance in the Lok Sabha elections in Punjab, with Amarinder blaming Sidhu for the loss of Congress candidates in Bhatinda and Gurdaspur to Harsimrat Kaur of Akali Dal and Sunny Deol of the BJP respectively. Amarinder had also disapproved of Sidhu's visit to Pakistan to take part in the inauguration of Prime Minister Imran Khan and the much-talked-about hug with Pakistan Army Chief Qamar Bajwa. Efforts to sink differences with Sidhu began after former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat was made AICC General Secretary in-charge of Punjab. Rawat had ensured Sidhu’s presence at the tractor rally led by Rahul Gandhi organised by the Congress in October to oppose farm sector reforms.  However, even in Rahul’s presence, Sidhu had targeted the Amarinder government, asking it to ensure that farmers get minimum support price for their produce if the Centre failed to do so.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-sets-up-a-lunch-meeting-with-navjot-singh-sidhu-tomorrow-919533.html

Universities and schools across the country were closed on March 16, when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. "Until we get some vaccine, schools (in Delhi) are not likely to open,” Sisodia, who is also Delhi's Education Minister, told reporters. He had announced on October 30 that schools will remain closed until further orders, saying parents were not in favour of sending their ward to schools yet. "We keep getting feedback from parents that they are really concerned about whether it is safe to reopen schools. It is not. Wherever schools have reopened, Covid-19 cases among children have risen. So we have decided that as of now schools in the national capital will not reopen. They will continue to be closed till further orders," Sisodia had said then. A nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25. While several restrictions have been eased in different 'unlock' phases, educational institutions continue to remain closed. According to 'Unlock 5' guidelines, states can take a call on reopening schools in phases. Several states also began the process of reopening schools. While some of them announced closure again due to rise in coronavirus cases. Earlier, schools were allowed to call students from Class 9 to 12 to school on voluntary basis from September 21. However, the Delhi government decided against it. Delhi recorded 4,454 fresh Covid-19 cases on Monday and a positivity rate of 11.94 per cent while 121 more fatalities pushed the death toll to 8,512, authorities said. These relatively low number of fresh cases came out of the 37,307 tests conducted on Sunday, including 18,046 RT-PCR tests, according to the latest bulletin issued by the Delhi health department. On last Friday, authorities had said that 23,507 RT-PCR tests, the highest till date, were conducted a day before. The highest single-day spike till date here -- 8,593 cases -- was recorded on November 11 when 85 fatalities were recorded. As many as 121 fatalities were recorded on Monday, same as the previous day. This is the sixth time in the last 12 days that the daily number of deaths has crossed the 100-mark.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-schools-unlikely-to-reopen-until-vaccine-against-covid-19-available-says-manish-sisodia-919540.html
24-11-2020||North and Central||Violence against girls and women in Uttar Pradesh rose from 23.5% in 2015-16 to 51% in 2018-19: Study||Violence against girls and women in the country's most populous state Uttar Pradesh rose from 23.5 per cent in 2015-16 to 51 per cent in 2018-19 while the sexual violence increased from 30 per cent to 48 per cent in the same period, according to a new study based on a survey of 10,100 adolescents. The results of the findings were released on the eve of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. When asked why UP was chosen for the study, the Population Council said it is because it is the most populous state in the country. The UDAYA (Understanding the lives of adolescents and young adults) study by NGO Population Council was carried out on 10,100 adolescents in Uttar Pradesh in 2015-16. The same set of adolescents were re-interviewed in 2018-19. According to the study, the number of married girls who reported ever experiencing emotional, physical or sexual violence almost doubled over the two survey waves. "In 2015-16, physical violence with married girls (15-19 years) was recorded at 23.5 per cent which more than doubled and shot up to 51 per cent in 2018-19. In 2015-16 sexual violence was recorded at 30 per cent, which increased up to 48 per cent. Emotional violence in 2015-16 was recorded at 19 per cent, which increased to 35 per cent," the study said. The study also captures mobile-phone/internet based harassment. It clearly shows an increasing trend in the survey years from 2015-16 to 2018-19. Married girl respondents in UP aged between 15-19 in 2015-16 experienced 3 per cent internet based harassment, which increased to 4.8 per cent in 2018-19. However, the study also observed that gender discriminatory practices among adolescent girls have reduced over time. Girls aged between 15-19 years in 2015-16 was 23 per cent improved to 18 per cent in 2018-19.   Besides Uttar Pradesh, the study has been conducted also in Bihar. UP and Bihar comprise 25 per cent of the country's adolescents population. Both states together constitute almost one-fourth of adolescent population. Also, the vulnerabilities such as early age at marriage, sexual and reproductive health risks are high in both the states The Population Council said it is planning to extend its study to other states too.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/violence-against-girls-and-women-in-uttar-pradesh-rose-from-235-in-2015-16-to-51-in-2018-19-study-919554.html

24-11-2020||Opinion||Not even one MLA is unhappy with B S Yediyurappa: Nalin Kumar Kateel||A three-time Lok Sabha member with roots in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Nalin Kumar Kateel was appointed BJP’s Karnataka president in August 2019. A firebrand speaker, Kateel’s appointment was widely seen as the party’s attempt to push the Hindutva agenda in the state. Kateel speaks to DH’s Akram Mohammed on the goings-on in the ruling party, amid rumours that the CM will be changed. Excerpts:  You’ve been state party president for over a year now. What has changed in the party so far?  The state government has done tremendous work under BS Yediyurappa’s leadership. My role is only to strengthen the party organisation. In the past one year, the mandal committees, zilla committees, shakthi kendras, maha shakthi kendras and booth-level organisations have been very successful. Currently, we’re implementing two new initiatives: Pancharatna and Page Pramukh. Pancharatna is a team formed with an eye on the upcoming panchayat elections with representation from women, SC/ST and OBC to work at the booth-level. The Page Pramukh idea from Gujarat is where one party worker is made in-charge of about 30 voters at the booth-level. The Page Pramukh’s role is not restricted to elections. This worker will be in touch with voters throughout.  The party has been stressing on cultivating leaders. How is that coming along? As per the high command’s direction, the state BJP has ensured that all district committee presidents are below 50 years of age, while mandal committee presidents are below 40, and district Yuva Morcha presidents will be under 30. No other political party has done this.  But the party still finds itself weak in the Old Mysuru region and parts of Kalyana Karnataka. In Mandya, Chikkaballapur and Tumakuru, we’ve already won seats. We also secured a maiden win in Sira constituency recently. We’re setting targets in regions where we’re weak. We’ve started organising in the Old Mysuru region, keeping the next Assembly elections in mind. Our target is to win 150 seats in the next election, which we can achieve by growing in the Old Mysuru and Kalyana Karnataka regions. In other parts of the state, we have significant support. Currently, we’re concentrating on Maski and Basavakalyana constituencies where by-polls are due. When you were appointed state president, there were concerns about your image -- that you will not find acceptance in North Karnataka.  The criticism came because my responsibilities had been earlier concentrated in the coastal region. In the past year, I’ve travelled across the state eight times and party workers have accepted me in all districts. What’s required first for a party president is acceptance from the party cadre; it is not necessary for me to reach the voters directly. I’m not here to be a mass leader. Is there a disconnect between the party and the government? There are murmurs that the party’s policies aren’t getting implemented.  Every fortnight, we have an office-bearers’ meeting, and the core committee meets monthly. We also have regular discussions with the CM. The party brings its policy to the government’s attention, while publicising government's policies to the people. The government and the party are working together. There’s no confusion. Even during the Covid-19 pandemic and floods, the party and the government worked hand-in-hand to respond to people's woes.  Seemingly, there is factionalism within the party. There’s also disgruntlement.  Who said there are differences among party leaders or that there are factions? People can say anything, and it’s not our responsibility to clarify. Has anyone from the party, ministers or the CM said that there are differences or factions? MLAs such as Basangouda Patil Yatnal have been vocal against the government and its functioning. His grievance was natural. It had to do with funds for his constituency. He has talked about it in public a few times. But after Yatnal spoke to me, he has not made any public remarks. Who is criticising (the government) now? All that has stopped after the party spoke to MLAs. Rumours that the CM will be changed continue. Why? Nobody has talked about it and the question does not arise at all. No discussion on changing the CM has taken place. The question should come up at the legislature party meeting. Has it? Have ministers talked about change? Has the high command thought about it? The answer is no. We can't respond to the thousands of street theories. Not even one party MLA has complained of being unhappy with Yediyurappa. The Panchamasalis, a major sub-caste of the dominant Lingayat community, are unhappy that they aren’t well represented in the Cabinet.  When a government is formed, there are several challenges like these. It’s difficult to satisfy everyone in a state that has six crore people and hundreds of communities. Some people express dissatisfaction, but then everyone will get an opportunity at the right time. How do you see Congress as an opponent?   Congress is a sinking ship. Their national president and state president are out on bail. Their party workers are in dire straits. People have abandoned the party. And what about JD(S)? They seem to be going soft on the BJP government.  We don't have any relationship with JD(S). Ours is a national party and we’re in power both in the state and at the Centre. We’re winning all elections and have enough MLAs. Such alliances are not required. However, there is nothing wrong with Yediyurappa holding talks with former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy regarding development.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/not-even-one-mla-is-unhappy-with-b-s-yediyurappa-nalin-kumar-kateel-919208.html
24-11-2020||Opinion||India must employ more women to drive economic recovery||The lack of employability in the formal sector is a harsh reality for the youth of the country. The Economic Survey of 2019 shows that 93 per cent of India’s workforce operates in the informal sector, with uncertain income, lack of social security, and inadequate savings.  Women and pandemic-time unemployment As it is well known, the sudden and stringent lockdowns forced Indian startups and MSMEs to let go of their workforce all of a sudden. In a country which continually struggles to maintain the Labour Force Participation Rates, the Covid-19 pandemic has not only reduced the number of employed women but also made their chances of being re-hired seem bleak.  Since May this year, the government has introduced relief packages to get the economy and livelihoods of people back on track. The Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana, launched under the Aatmanirbhar 3.0 stimulus package, too has failed to address the concerns of about a half of India’s employable demography.   Providing an equal playing field As India chases its $5 trillion-economy goal, the need is to strengthen the country’s economic viability, while ensuring greater gender equality. To achieve this, however, the productive workforce must be gender-inclusive. For higher productivity and income, it is essential to promote skill development among women in the formal sector. Women must monetise their skills to create unconventional job opportunities through compulsory vocational training programmes.  To strengthen the ‘Make in India’ vision, empowering women from the grassroots will give the required boost to small-scale industries. Traditionally, women are informally engaged in agricultural activities associated with processing, preservation, and packaging of farm produce. Working in the unorganised sector, Indian women continue to make significant contributions as micro-entrepreneurs.  In rural areas, women play a substantial role in decentralising distribution channels, marketing the government’s programmes and policies. Encouraging women to become job creators will provide a long-term, sustainable solution. The availability of data that shows the success rate of women entrepreneurs can be a crucial step in boosting the morale of rural women.  The country must think of ways to promote the availability and opportunities for women to have equal claims over seed capital to start their own businesses. To streamline the government’s efforts, it is necessary to provide the female workforce with an equal playing field. The need is for lucrative schemes which are predominantly for women so that even when they choose an alternative source of livelihood, they have a formal structure in place to support them. Applications like 'Aarogya Sakhi', to train women health entrepreneurs, and 'Internet Saathi', for promoting digital literacy among women from the remotest areas, are empowering tools for the ‘Make in India’ initiative. Though such platforms provide an opportunity to train micro-entrepreneurs, the question of accessibility continues to linger.  As work from home becomes the new normal, technology access is a crucial antidote for India’s working women. In the post-Covid-19 recovery phase, the ‘Make in India’ dream can become a reality only if women are promoted as key drivers of growth.

24-11-2020||Panorama||Antibodies good. Machine-made molecules better?||Millions of years of evolution have honed these proteins into the disease-fighting weapons they are today. But in a span of just months, a combination of human and machine intelligence may have beaten Mother Nature at her own game. Using computational tools, a team of researchers at the University of Washington designed and built from scratch a molecule that, when pitted against the coronavirus in the lab, can attack and sequester it at least as well as an antibody does. When spritzed up the noses of mice and hamsters, it also appears to protect animals from becoming seriously sick. This molecule, called a minibinder for its ability to glom onto the coronavirus, is petite and stable enough to be shipped en masse in a freeze-dried state. Bacteria can also be engineered to churn out these minibinders, potentially making them not only effective but also cheap and convenient. The team’s product is still in the very early stages of development, and will not be on the market any time soon. But so far “it’s looking very promising,” said Lauren Carter, one of the researchers behind the project, which is led by biochemist David Baker. Eventually, healthy people might be able to self-administer the minibinders as a nasal spray, and potentially keep any inbound coronavirus particles at bay. “The most elegant application could be something you keep on your bedside table,” Carter said. “That’s kind of the dream.” Minibinders are not antibodies, but they thwart the virus in broadly similar ways. The coronavirus enters a cell using a kind of lock-and-key interaction, fitting a protein called a spike — the key — into a molecular lock called ACE-2, which adorns the outsides of certain human cells. Antibodies made by the human immune system can interfere with this process . Many scientists hope that mass-produced mimics of these antibodies might help treat people with COVID-19 or prevent them from falling ill after becoming infected. But a lot of antibodies are needed to rein in the coronavirus, especially if an infection is underway. Antibodies are also onerous to produce and deliver to people. To develop a less finicky alternative, members of the Baker lab, led by biochemist Longxing Cao, took a computational approach. The researchers modeled how millions of hypothetical, lab-designed proteins would interact with the spike. After sequentially weeding out poor performers, the team selected the best among the bunch and synthesized them in the lab. They spent weeks toggling between the computer and the bench, tinkering with designs to match simulation and reality as closely as they could. The result was a completely homemade minibinder that readily glued itself to the virus, the team reported in Science last month. “This goes a step further than just building off natural proteins,” said Asher Williams, a chemical engineer at Cornell University who was not involved in the research. If adapted for other purposes, Williams added, “this would be a big win for bioinformatics.” The team is now fiddling with deep-learning algorithms that could teach the lab’s computers to streamline the iterative trial-and-error process of protein design, yielding products in weeks instead of months, Baker said. But the novelty of the minibinder approach could also be a drawback. It’s possible, for instance, that the coronavirus could mutate and become resistant to the DIY molecule. Daniel-Adriano Silva, a biochemist at Seattle-based biopharmaceutical company Neoleukin, who previously trained with Baker at the University of Washington, may have come up with another strategy that could solve the resistance problem. His team has also designed a protein that can stop the virus from invading cells, but their DIY molecule is slightly more familiar. It is a smaller, sturdier version of the human protein ACE-2 — one that has a far stronger grip on the virus, so the molecule could potentially serve as a decoy that lures the pathogen away from vulnerable cells. Developing resistance would be futile, said Christopher Barnes, a structural biologist at the California Institute of Technology who partnered with Neoleukin on their project. A coronavirus strain that could no longer be bound by the decoy would probably also lose its ability to bind to the real thing, the human version of ACE-2. “That is a big fitness cost to the virus,” Barnes said. Minibinders and ACE-2 decoys are both easy to make, and are likely to cost just pennies on the dollar compared to synthetic antibodies, which can carry price tags in the high thousands of dollars, Carter said. And whereas antibodies must be kept cold to preserve longevity, the DIY proteins can be engineered to do just fine at room temperature, or in even more extreme conditions. The University of Washington minibinder “can be boiled and it’s still OK,” Cao said. That durability makes these molecules easy to transport, and easy to administer in a variety of ways, perhaps by injecting them into the bloodstream as a treatment for an ongoing infection. The two designer molecules also both engage the virus in a super-tight squeeze, allowing less to do more. “If you have something that binds this well, you don’t have to use as much,” said Attabey Rodríguez Benítez, a biochemist at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the research. “That means you’re getting more bang for your buck.” Both research groups are exploring their products as potential tools not only to combat infection but also to prevent it outright, somewhat like a short-lived vaccine. In a series of experiments described in their paper, the Neoleukin team misted their ACE-2 decoy into the noses of hamsters, then exposed the animals to the coronavirus. The untreated hamsters fell dangerously ill, but the hamsters that received the nasal spray fared far better. Carter and her colleagues are currently running similar experiments with their minibinder, and seeing comparable results. These findings might not translate into humans, the researchers cautioned. And neither team has yet worked out a perfect way to administer their products into animals or people. Down the line, there may yet be opportunities for the two types of designer proteins to work together — if not in the same product, then at least in the same war, as the pandemic rages on. “It’s very complementary,” Carter said. If all goes well, molecules like these could join the growing arsenal of public health measures and drugs already in place to fight the virus, she said: “This is another tool you could have.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/antibodies-good-machine-made-molecules-better-919275.html

When the cyclone makes its landfall around Puducherry, it is likely to pack winds with 100-110 km per hour speed. As a precautionary measure, the Union Territory of Puducherry announced implementation of Section 144 from 9 pm on Tuesday to 6 am on Thursday during which shops and commercial establishments will remain closed. Chennai and its neighbouring areas are experiencing heavy rainfall since Monday night with the metropolis recording 42.31 mm of rainfall in the last 24 hours ending 8 am on Tuesday. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall in Chennai, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, and Chengalpattu districts for the next 24 hours and warned of flooding, disruption of electricity and water services, possible damage to roads, and some areas getting inundated. In its latest bulletin released at 11.30 am on Tuesday, the IMD said the cyclonic storm over south-west Bay of Bengal remained practically stationary during past three hours and lay centred at 8.30 am about 410 km east-south-east of Puducherry and 450 km south-east of Chennai. “It is very likely to intensify further into a severe cyclonic storm during the next 24 hours. It is very likely to move west-north-westwards for the next 12 hours and then north-westwards. It is very likely to cross Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts between Karaikal and Mamallapuram around Puducherry on November 25 evening as a severe cyclonic storm,” the IMD bulletin said. It also said fairly widespread to widespread rainfall/thunderstorm will occur over coastal and north interior Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal till November 26. Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry – Edappadi K Palaniswami, and V Narayanasamy – on Tuesday morning and assured all possible help from the Centre. With the IMD predicting that the Cyclone may make its landfall near Puducherry, the governments of Tamil Nadu and the Union Territory have moved swiftly to take enough precautionary measures. Tamil Nadu suspended public transport in Pudukkottai, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Cuddalore, Villupuram, and Chengalpattu districts from 1 pm on Tuesday till further orders. Tamil Nadu Revenue Minister R B Udhayakumar said the government has set up control rooms in all 36 revenue districts in the state, while making it clear that people living in low-lying areas vulnerable to flooding and cyclones will be moved to safety. Narayanasamy said the Puducherry government has begun evacuating people living in low-lying areas to safety. Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) has announced that it will suspend power supply when the cyclone makes its landfall on Wednesday, even as it contended that it has kept electric poles ready in case some are uprooted due to the wind speed. Southern Railway fully cancelled two trains, and partially cancelled nine trains on November 24 and 25. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has rushed 12 teams across Tamil Nadu, and Puducherry and pre-positioned them as part of its precautionary measures, while three teams are kept on stand-by at its base in Arakkonam near Chennai. After holding a review meeting on Monday, Palaniswami ordered Collectors of the aforementioned seven districts to ensure that the relief centres are equipped with facilities to accommodate people who are evacuated from their homes. He also asked people not to step out of their homes on November 24 and 25 due to Cyclone Nivar.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cyclonic-storm-nivar-intensifies-brings-heavy-rainfall-919300.html

Meanwhile, another witness in the case has also alleged threat claims by the accused. Pradeep Kottathala, who has been serving with Kumar as his office secretary, was held by police from the MLA's office at Pathanapuram in the suburbs of Kollam district. He allegedly threatened Kasargod native Vipinlal who is an approver in the case. A local court in Kasargod denied anticipatory bail to him. Kumar, who is with the ruling left-front in Kerala, said that Pradeep was expelled from his office. He declined to make any further comments. Kumar and actor Dileep, who is an accused in the actress assault case, are close to each other and hence police suspect that Pradeep could have threatened the approver at the behest of Dileep. Vipinlal was initially an accused in the actor assault case as he was found to have links with the key accused in the case including 'Pulsar' Suni. Vipinlal said in his complaint to police recently that Pradeep threatened him over the phone and through letters over statements given against the accused. Pradeep also allegedly rang up Vipinlal's mother by posing as an advocate's staff and threatened her. The police registered a case at Kasargod and got evidence, especially mobile phone tower locations, said sources. The actress was abducted and sexually assaulted by a gang at the behest of Dileep in February 2017. Dileep was arrested in this connection in July 2017 and was granted bail in October. Thrissur native Jinson, who is another witness in the case, also alleged threats from accused against giving statements. The fresh developments came close on the heels of Kerala High Court rejecting pleas of the assault victim and the prosecution for changing the trial court alleging unfair trial. Many key witnesses in the case had already turned hostile. The special prosecutor of the case has also tendered resignation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-mlas-aide-threatens-actor-assault-case-approver-held-919333.html

This never-ending enthusiasm had helped 130-cm-long Keralite Akash Madhavan win medals in Dwarf Olympics multiple times and now take an unexpected plunge into electoral battle. Utilising yet another opportunity to demonstrate committed enthusiasm to win over physical challenges, Madhavan is contesting in the December local body polls from northern Malappuram district of Kerala. A resident of nearby Melattur, Akash Madhavan is contesting from division 15 of Melattur village panchayat as a BJP candidate. Setting yet another record, Madhavan is the shortest man contesting in the civic elections in the southern state. He had won silver medal in shot-put and bronze in discus-throw at the Dwarf Olympics held in Michigan, US in 2013 while a bronze medal in Javelin throw in the Canada Dwarf Olympics in 2017. He also won gold in badminton doubles in the National Badminton Championship. Madhavan said it was his physical education teacher of Valluvanad Vidya Bhavan HSS in Perintalmanna who encouraged him to venture out to athletics. "Haridas sir instilled the spirit to compete and succeed in sports. The motivation and support from friends and relatives helped me come out of my shell and thrive in life," he said. "Now, I am contesting the local polls with the same level of enthusiasm and confidence," he added. Son of Edathalamadathil Madhavan and Geetha, Akash Madhavan is an automobile engineering graduate. He now owns an automobile shop in the district and is also a distributor of a pharma company. A known face in his native place and familiar with every nook and corner of the ward, Akash said he was confident of making it to the panchayat council. The three-tier local body polls are scheduled to be held in December in the southern state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/keralas-shortest-candidate-in-lsg-polls-akash-madhavan-is-an-olympic-medallist-919338.html

Sources said the sleuths from the Customs (Preventive) Commissionerate visited the jail where Sivasankar is presently lodged here after being arrested by the Enforcement Directorate probing the money trail in the gold smuggling case, this morning and recorded his arrest. They said the central agency will move an application in the court seeking his custody. The move comes a day after a special court for PMLA cases here granted permission to the Customs to arrest Sivasankar, who is currently in judicial custody, in connection with the sensational case. The court for Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) had allowed the prayer by the Customs, which claimed it has got direct incriminating material against Sivasankar, former principal secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, over his "involvement" in the sensational smuggling of gold using the diplomatic channel. The Customs said it has arrested around 15 people, including prime accused Swapna Suresh, Sarith PS and Sandeep Nair, in connection with the seizure of 30 kg smuggled gold illicitly imported as diplomatic baggage of UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. The agency said it has now come to light that Sivasankar, who has been arrayed as fifth accused in the case registered by the ED, is also involved in the issue. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), the ED and the Customs are conducting separate investigations into the racket that was busted with the seizure of gold on July 5. The IAS officer was suspended after his links to Suresh, a former employee of the consulate, surfaced.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/customs-arrest-sivasankar-in-kerala-gold-smuggling-case-919346.html

The transsexual, who did not want her name to be revealed, hopes to move the Medical Council of India for making appropriate changes in the records, and open the clinic to resume medical practice soon. This young doctor who graduated from the Madurai Government Medical College in 2018, was ostracized by her family for undergoing sex transformation to became a woman. Her profession almost came to an end when she was sacked from a hospital, where she was working for a year, after the sex-change surgery. "At first I didn't believe that she was a doctor. She broke down and insisted that she possessed a medical degree but it was on her earlier name," said Thilagar Thidal police inspector G Kavitha, who rounded up a group of transgenders for reportedly begging and troubling traders here, recently. The police, after verifying the documents, got in touch with the doctors from Madurai Medical College and corroborated the fact that the transsexual doctor, was a male in college. Only recently she landed in the midst of transgenders to beg as she had no means to sustain herself, after being sacked from a hospital here. The surprised inspector then took up the case of the transsexual doctor with her superiors, to extend all possible help. For her part, Kavitha provided her a stethoscope and a doctors coat. "I don't see any problem in changing her records with the MCI. Her rights can't be denied. But first she has to notify the name change in the gazette which will serve as a government order," said Kalki Subramaniam, a celebrated Indian transgender activist, artist, poet, actor and inspirational speaker. Speaking to PTI on Tuesday, Kalki, founder of Sahodari Foundation, an organisation which works for Indian transgender, said, "it is nothing but human rights violation to deny her job based on her gender." The hospital cannot sack a person based on gender and may have to reinstate if the said doctor gets a court ruling in her favour, Kalki remarked. Recalling the 2014 Supreme Court order, Kalki said the apex court verdict recognising the transgender community as a third gender along with male and female, is clearly in favour of the doctor too. The apex court had also affirmed that the fundamental rights granted under the Constitution of India will be equally applicable to them and gave them the right to self-identification of their gender as male, female or third gender.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cops-rescue-transsexual-doctor-begging-in-tamil-nadu-help-realise-her-dream-919380.html

The Congress also promised to give Rs 25 lakh ex gratia to the kin of those who lost their lives in the recent heavy rains, besides Rs five lakh to every damaged house and Rs 2.5 lakh to partially damaged ones. Similarly, every flood-affected family would be given Rs 50,000, the party said in its manifesto, released by Manickam Tagore, AICC incharge of Telangana. Polls for GHMC will be held on December 1 and counting of votes will be taken up on December 4. Pure Drinking will be provided free of cost by setting up RO (Reverse Osmosis) water vending machines in slums and double bedroom housing complexes. The party promised to bring Covid-19 treatment under 'Aarogyasri', a government health insurance scheme and free local transportation for women, students, divyangans (differently-abled) and senior citizens in Metro rail, MMTS (Multi Modal Transport System) and RTC Buses. It also promised complete waiver of property tax and electricity bills to shops belonging to barbers, washermen, carpenters and goldsmiths and added that permission would be given free of cost by GHMC for these communities. TPCC President Uttam Kumar Reddy, who was also present at the function, told reporters that nobody in Telangana believes that TRS and AIMIM do not have any understanding. "When AIMIM is going all out to Bihar, UP, Maharashtra and Karnataka and contesting elections, why can't it contest in all 150 seats of GHMC?. Why is it contesting lesser seats than it did during the last GHMC polls? People should understand the inner meaning of it," he said. AICC spokesperson Shavan Dasoju said GHMC generates around Rs one lakh crore per annum and the KCR government in return "offers peanuts to the city." Shortly before the manifesto was released, Reddy alleged that the K Chandrashekhar Rao-led TRS Government failed to fulfil earlier poll promises. "KCR says his manifestos are religious scriptures. (But) There are utter lies in the manifestos...TRS party and yesterday's manifesto should be dumped in the junkyard," Reddy said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/poll-race-congress-promises-30000-litres-free-drinking-water-in-hyderabad-919417.html

With the annual pilgrimage season progressing at the Lord Ayyappa temple here, a high level committee, which reviewed the arrangements made for devotees, took a decision in this regard on Monday. The meeting, led by Additional District Magistrate Arun K Vijayan and Police Special Officer B Krishnakumar, evaluated that the pilgrimage was progressing well adhering to Covid-19 protocols and the hill temple was fully prepared for more devotees arriving here in the coming days. Among many significant decisions taken, the high level committee resolved to make stringent the Covid-19 protocols at Sannidhanam (temple complex) and premises of the shrine. The Covid-19 protocol committee would be expanded further, Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) officials said after the meeting. Besides pilgrims, the officials on duty also should follow the Covid-19 protocols strictly. Social distancing should be followed at the Sannidhanam and nadappanthal, the rest area, they said. "Employees of temporary shops, operating in Sabarimala, should produce Covid-19 negative test result. The certificates of disinfection of shops are also made mandatory," they said adding it was also decided to carry out sanitisation at hourly intervals in the area. Directions were given to forests officials to take adequate precautionary measures to reduce the increasing menace of wild boars. In the wake of viral infection reported at the temple complex when a temporary TDB staff had turned Covid-19 positive recently, adequate safety measures had been taken and there was nothing to be worried now, they said. The annualtwo- month-long Mandala-Makaravilakku season at Sabarimala began on November 16, adhering to strict Covid- 19 guidelines. It is the first annual pilgrimage season at the hill temple after the coronavirus outbreak.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/after-devotees-covid-19-negative-report-mandatory-for-shop-employees-in-sabarimala-919421.html

The government gave the assurance while a division bench, comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly was considering a batch of petitions, challenging the constitutional validity of an amendment to the Police Act brought by the state's ruling CPI(M)-led LDF government. "No coercive action will be taken on the basis of the newly inserted Section 118A in the Kerala Police Act, 2011, which has been put on hold," the Additional Advocate General informed the court. When the court pointed out that the ordinance has been issued, the government assured that no FIRs would be launched on the basis of the newly incorporated amendment. The court recorded the government submission and adjourned the matter for Wednesday for consideration. The amendment made it mandatory for providing for up to five years jail term to those making defamatory social media posts. BJP Kerala state unit chief K Surendran and RSP leader Shibu Baby John on Monday filed separate pleas in the High Court, challenging the constitutional validity of the amendment In his plea, Surendran sought to declare the newly inserted Section 118A as unconstitutional, void and inoperative and to strike down the same. He submitted that the new provisions "curtails the freedom of speech and expression conferred under the Constitution of India". Noting that even positive criticism or opinion of expression could be interpreted to be an offence under the provision, he alleged that "this is against the basic principle of the criminal justice system. In their Public Interest Litigations, RSP leaders Shibu Baby John, N K Premachandran and A A Azeez sought to declare Section 118A as unconstitutional since it is "violative of Articles 14, 19 (1) (a) and 21 of the Constitution of India." They submitted that Section 118A suffers from inherent and incurable vagueness. Noting that expressions like "humiliating", "threatening" and "abusing" are not defined, they submitted that leaving such expressions to the subjective interpretation of individuals meant that even diligent and conscientious citizens cannot know with certainty whether their acts of expressions could run afoul of Section 118A. They submitted that offences under the section have been made cognizable. So the subjective personal views and unguided interpretation by individual police officials, who are not trained to exercise judicial functions on whether a particular act constitutes an offence under Section 118A or not would decide whether serious consequences such as arrest follow. Besides Surendran and Shibu Baby John, the court also received a batch of petitions challenging the controversial amendment to the Police Act.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/no-firs-to-be-launched-on-basis-of-amendment-brought-to-police-act-kerala-govt-to-hc-919422.html

Stalin submitted a memorandum to Purohit, who is sitting on the recommendation by the state government date September 9, 2018, allowing the release of seven persons whose death sentences were commuted to life term. The government has been pushing for the release of Nalini, her husband Murugan, Santhan, A G Perarivalan, Jayakumar, Robert Payas and P Ravichandran.  “It is clearly spelt out in the Article 161 of the Constitution of India that the Governor of a State has the power to suspend, remit or commute any sentence of a person convicted of an offence under any law to which the power of the State extends. Though the Cabinet has recommended for release, Your Excellency has been keeping it pending for more than two years, which has been causing grave and irreparable hardship and injustice to the suffering convicts,” Stalin said. The Leader of Opposition also told the governor that the CBI had informed the Supreme Court on November 20 that the relief prayed for by Perarivalan is an issue between him and the Governor of Tamil Nadu. “That in so far as relief is concerned in the present matter CBI has no role,” the DMK chief said. “In view of the above affidavit filed by the CBI, there is absolutely no impediment for your Excellency to accept the recommendation of the State Cabinet under Art 163. The fact that the recommendation of the State Cabinet has been kept pending for over two years by your office reflects poorly on the State administration and gives an impression that the State is not run in accordance with the law,” he said. Political parties in Tamil Nadu have been demanding the release of the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case for the past few years. However, the Centre argues that the powers to order their release rests only with it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dmk-delegation-meets-governor-demands-release-of-rajiv-gandhi-assassination-case-convicts-919431.html

Cyclone Nivar, which at 8.30 pm on Tuesday lay 350 km east-south-east of Puducherry and 410 km east-south-east of Chennai, is expected to result in severe damages across Northern Tamil Nadu while making landfall around Puducherry. “It is very likely to intensify further into a severe cyclonic storm during the next six hours and into a very severe cyclonic storm during subsequent 12 hours. It is very likely to cross Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts between Karaikal and Mamallapuram around Puducherry during November 25 late evening,” the IMD said in its bulletin released at 10 pm on Tuesday. The IMD also forecast heavy to very heavy rains for the next two days in Chennai, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, and Chengalpattu districts and warned of flooding, disruption of electricity and water services, possible damage to roads, and some areas getting inundated. Rains will continue across coastal Tamil Nadu. Rains that began on Monday night in and around Chennai intensified on Tuesday afternoon, leading to waterlogging in arterial roads and inundation of low-lying areas. As a precautionary measure, the governments of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry announced public holiday on Wednesday to ensure that people stay indoors, while Southern Railways cancelled all trains originating from Chennai to the Cauvery delta region and southern districts and vice-versa. Tamil Nadu and Puducherry governments also mounted massive efforts to minimise damage due to Cyclone Nivar by keeping ready 3,344 and 80 relief centres respectively. Public transport remains suspended in Pudukkottai, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Cuddalore, Villupuram, and Chengalpattu districts, and in Puducherry, and Karaikal till further orders, while sub-urban trains in Chennai will not run beyond 10 am on Wednesday. The Union Territory of Puducherry, whose capital is expected to be the landfall area, will go under curfew from 9 pm on Tuesday to 6 am on Thursday during which shops and commercial establishments will remain closed. Apart from the state governments' response teams, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has pre-positioned 12 teams in Tamil Nadu and three in Puducherry, while the Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard are also on standby to assist Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in relief operations. With power supply likely to be snapped during the landfall time, the government asked hospitals to ensure that their generators are in working condition and that they have enough fuel in reserve. Tamil Nadu government has kept 465 ambulances ready in the seven districts while setting up control rooms set up in all 36 revenue districts.

24-11-2020||South||Customs arrest Sivasankar in Kerala-UAE gold smuggling case||The Customs on Tuesday formally arrested suspended IAS officer M Sivasankar in connection with the sensational gold smuggling case. A day after a special court for PMLA cases granted it permission to arrest Sivasankar, who is currently in judicial custody, a team of officials from the Customs (Preventive) Commissionerate reached the jail where he is lodged and recorded his arrest, sources said. Sivasankar, former principal secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, is presently lodged in a jail here after being arrested by the Enforcement Directorate probing the money trail in the gold smuggling case. Soon after recording his arrest, the Customs filed a plea before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (Economic Offences), Ernakulam, seeking departmental custody of Sivasankar, who was the former principal secretary to Kerala Chief Minister. In the remand report filed in the court, the Customs claimed that the key accused in the gold smuggling case, Swapna Suresh, has revealed that Sivasankar was in the know and has also abetted the smuggling activities. The Customs said Suresh made this claim during her interrogation at the Attakkulangara Vanitha jail in Thiruvananthapuram, on November 18. In an affidavit filed in the court seeking 10-day custody of Sivasankar, the Customs said further investigation is warranted to identify whether any more persons are involved in the smuggling of huge quantities of gold into India, which is a grave threat to the economy and national security. It said interrogation of Sivasankar is required to acquire clarity as to the modus operandi and details of the accomplices behind the smuggling activity, without delay. Seeking the 10-day custody of Sivasankar, the Customs said it has become most essential for further progress of the investigation. On Monday, the Customs, in its prayer before the Special Court for PMLA cases seeking permission to arrest Sivasankar, had submitted that during the course of the investigation, it was able to get direct incriminating material against the officer of his involvement in the gold smuggling. The Customs said it has arrested around 15 people, including prime accused Swapna Suresh, Sarith PS and Sandeep Nair, in connection with the seizure of 30 kg smuggled gold illicitly imported as diplomatic baggage of UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. The agency has claimed that it has now come to light that Sivasankar, who has been arrayed as fifth accused in the case registered by the ED, is also involved in the issue. The move by the Customs came days after Sivasankar moved the Kerala High Court seeking bail in the ED case after the Special Court for PMLA cases here rejected his application for regular bail on November 17. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), the ED and the Customs are conducting separate investigations into the racket that was busted with the seizure of gold on July 5.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/customs-arrest-sivasankar-in-kerala-uae-gold-smuggling-case-919451.html

Surya, the Bangalore South MP, is campaigning in Hyderabad for the Telangana BJP candidates in the GHMC election fray. He took part in road shows in few areas of Hyderabad on Monday. The BJP leader alleged that the gates of the prominent university were closed at Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao's behest. Amid a melee, the barbed wires and barricades were removed by the BJP activists, who then along with Surya marched to the iconic Arts College building. He then addressed the party supporters assembled there. “We wanted to pay respects to the Telangana movement's martyrs at the Osmania University. But KCR has closed its gates. BJYM reopened it and marched inside to salute Telangana's heroes,” Surya said. However, DCP East Zone M Ramesh claimed that “the police has not stopped anyone at the OU gate.” “Their programme went on smoothly and the law and order situation is peaceful,” the IPS officer said. Surya lashed out at the TRS establishment stating that “Telangana is not a private jagir (estate) of the KCR family.” While KCR was the leading political face of the Telangana agitation, the OU campus, in the heart of Hyderabad, was the epicenter of the students' movement for statehood. Surya accused that KCR had promised to make the state a Bangaru (golden) Telangana but that “only the TRS party men have amassed wealth. The youth have been shortchanged.” “Telangana has become all about KC Rao, KT Rao, Harish Rao, Kavitha Rao. The common public get nothing,” the BJP MP said in reference to the CM's son, nephew and daughter who are in prominent positions in the government and the party.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tejasvi-surya-accuses-kcr-of-obstructing-him-from-paying-homage-to-telangana-martyrs-at-osmania-university-919460.html

Rains that began on Monday night intensified on Tuesday afternoon in majority of the areas in the city leading to uprooting of trees and waterlogging in major roads, including the arterial Anna Salai. Electric poles were also uprooted in some areas as heavy winds accompanied the rains. The Met Department has forecast heavy to very heavy rains in Chennai and its neighbouring district for the next two days due to Cyclone Nivar. It has also warned people that electricity and water supply may be disrupted due to the cyclone. Waterlogging on major roads led to traffic jams across the city with people waiting on the roads for hours together to reach their homes from workplace. Waterlogging was reported from Mambalam, Vadapalani, Kodambakkam, Otteri, Kolathur, Purasawakkam, Anna Nagar, Velachery, Adambakkam, and several other areas. In areas like Velachery, people complained of severe waterlogging and they were forced to remain indoors. People in some areas complained that the government has not taken enough measures to ensure flooding in areas vulnerable to waterlogging. Complaints of severe waterlogging was reported from the IT corridor, which houses offices of most of the software firms in the city, with people posting pictures on social media. The Greater Chennai Corporation's (GCC) claims of being well prepared for the monsoon also came under scrutiny with waterlogging being reported from several areas. High tide was reported from Kasimedu fishing harbour, while people living near the coast and low-lying areas were moved to government-run shelters where they are being accommodated with enough physical distancing measures in place. The government said it has deployed teams to drain out water from waterlogged areas and asked people not to be scared. Tuesday's rains brought back the scary memories of 2015 floods during which majority of the areas went under water.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cyclone-nivar-heavy-rains-lead-to-waterlogging-across-chennai-919478.html

The Kerala High Court had last month dismissed all petitions, including one by the state government, challenging the Centre’s decision to hand over Adani group the operations of the international airport, which was one of the six for which the Adani group won a lease. In its plea, the state government sought stay on the High Court order. The state government, in its plea, said the High Court failed to appreciate that the process of tender was vitiated for many reasons and one of the pre-qualification conditions was that the tenderer should have previous experience in airport management. “Instead, the previous practice of providing previous experience in Airport management as a prequalification was deliberately deleted from the RFP related to Thiruvananthapuram Airport. This is done with a deliberate attempt to avoid the state government, which is having previous experience," it said. The airport has around 335 acres of land including the land given by the state government. From 2000 onwards, the state acquired land and gave it free of cost to AAI (Airport Authority of India) on the expectation that the value of land would be converted into equity of the state government in the event of airport being structured into a company or an SPV set up to manage the airport, it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-moves-sc-against-leasing-thiruvananthapuram-airport-to-adani-group-919480.html

The official machinery has been put on high alert in Tamil Nadu and the neighbouring union territory of Puducherry and extensive precautionary measures, including the evacuation of people from vulnerable areas, taken, the governments said. The cyclone christened 'Nivar' was very likely to cross the coast between Karaikal in Puducherry and Mamallapuram, over 50 km from here, on Wednesday late evening as a severe cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 100-110 km per hour gusting to 120 kmph, the Met department said on Tuesday. It said rainfall is very likely at most places in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal, near Nagapattinam, on Wednesday with heavy to very heavy showers at a few places and extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places under the influence of the cyclone, the first one to form since the onset of the northeast monsoon on October 28. Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry K Palaniswami and V Narayanasamy respectively on the situation arising out of the cyclone and assured them of all possible support from the Centre. While intermittent rains lashed several parts of the state and the UT on Tuesday, multiple state and central agencies, including the Coast Guard, the National Disaster Response Force, the Fire and Rescue Services, have deployed their assets and personnel to tackle the cyclone's fury. A holiday has been declared in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry for Wednesday in view of the cyclone's expected landfall while transport services have been suspended. "It is a holiday tomorrow in Tamil Nadu. It is a general holiday. However, those involved in essential services will be working," Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami told reporters and appealed to the people to stay indoors. In Puducherry, Industries and Revenue Minister M O H F Shah Jahan said Wednesday would be a holiday for government offices and all necessary steps had been taken to ensure people's safety. All shops and establishments, barring those selling essentials such as medicine and milk, would be closed from Tuesday till 6 a.m. on Thursday, he said. Fishermen who put out to sea from Karaikal in 30 boats were not accessible and efforts in association with the Coast Guard were on to bring them back, the Minister told reporters. The cyclone protection machinery at the Madras Atomic Power Station (MAPS) in Kalpakkam, about 20 kms from Mamallapuram, has been 'activated' and the authorities were on high alert and closely monitoring the weather to take necessary actions when required, a top official said. "All the plant systems are operating normal and expected to successfully withstand the impact of cyclone Nivar, when it crosses the coast," Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR) Station Director M Srinivas said in a release. Palaniswami said as many as 4,133 vulnerable locations have been identified in the state and district collectors advised to take measures to ensure people's safety. There are 3,146 cyclone shelters and people accommodated there would be provided with all necessary items, including milk for children, he said. Tamil Nadu government said Palaniswami apprised the Prime Minister about the precautionary measures in place and Modi assured Centre's help and cooperation. Authorities said the reservoirs here, including Chembarambakkam, were under a 'constant watch' and people in low lying areas were being brought to safe shelters. A Met department bulletin said the deep depression over southwest Bay of Bengal moved west-northwestwards and intensified into a cyclonic storm 'Nivar' and lay about 380 km off Puducherry and 430 km from Chennai as of 2.30 pm on Tuesday. The cyclonic storm is very likely to intensify further into a severe cyclonic storm during the next 24 hours. It is very likely to move west-northwestwards for next 12 hours and then move northwestwards before making landfall. Gale wind - speed reaching 65-75 kmph and gusting to 85 kmph is prevailing over southwest Bay of Bengal. Sea condition is rough to very rough along the coasts and tidal wave of about one meter height is very likely to inundate the low lying areas of north coastal districts of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, it said. With the suspension of bus services in Pudukottai, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Cuddalore, Villupuram and Chengelpet from Tuesday afternoon, the roads were deserted in the regions and only a minimum number of buses could be seen on the city roads. Southern Railway announced cancellation of 12 trains, including the ChennaiMadurai Special, and running of suburban trains is conditional upon "prevailing weather." The Tamil Nadu government said people may contact the emergency call centres at 044-28888105 and 7338895011. In Puducherry, the control rooms with phone numbers 1070 and 1077 were in place in addition to emergency response teams. Fire and Rescue Services department has deployed its personnel in a string of locations including Mamallapuram with necessary equipment and inflatable boats. The Defence public relations unit here on its twitter handle said the Coast Guard in coordination with state and district administrations has ensured safe return of fishing boats. Four Offshore Patrol Vessels have been deployed by the Coast Guard for disaster relief and two helicopters are on standby for post landfall rescue and relief. As many as three Dornier aircraft are on standby at Visakhapatnam and 15 disaster relief teams are ready to assist the state governments. Preparatory activities to combat the effects of the cyclone has been carried out and five flood relief teams and one diving team is ready for deployment at Chennai, it said.

On Tuesday, Rao participated in the video conference Prime Minister Modi held with the chief ministers to discuss a roadmap for a possible vaccine distribution eventually. CM Rao stated that people are eagerly waiting and that his government is readying an action plan to distribute, administer the vaccine on a priority basis. “However, one has to examine if the vaccine has any side effects? There are different weather and climatic conditions in the country and the Covid-19 virus also did not affect the country in a uniform manner,” the CM told Modi. According to a CMO release, Rao has expressed concern that “the vaccine too may give different side effects in different regions.” “Hence, initially send a batch of vaccine doses to the states, to be applied on some people. Let us assess the situation and then (based on favorable results) administer it on the rest,” the CM said adding that “a scientifically approved vaccine is the need of the hour.” A senior health official refused to comment on the CM's views expressed before the PM. The PM's meeting with CMs was held in the wake of reports that the Oxford-AstraZeneca, Russia's Sputnik-V, Pfizer and Moderna vaccines under trial have shown a very high success rate against Covid-19. India's indigenously developed vaccine candidate Covaxin is also said to be showing positive results. After the conference, Rao instructed officials to prepare an action plan to administer the achievable vaccine in the state and create the required infrastructure facilities like the cold chain for vaccine transport, storage. The vaccine should be given first to the Covid-19 warriors and front line workers like the Police, people above 60 years of age, and those suffering from acute diseases. A list of such individuals should be prepared, the CM directed. Rao said that committees should be formed at the state, district, and mandal level to conduct the vaccination programme.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kcr-wants-local-reassessment-of-centre-approved-covid-19-vaccine-before-mass-administration-919496.html

The administration has taken necessary precautions to release the water in phases and avert flooding, as in 2015, in the event of an upsurge in the storage levels, a senior PWD department official said. The combined storage level in the reservoirs at Poondi, Cholavaram, Red Hills and Chembarambakkam stood at 64.15 per cent or 8.156 TMC ft against the full capacity of 12.713 TMC ft, which is slightly higher compared to the quantum two days ago. Chembarambakkam which has nearly 80 per cent water (21.22 feet against its full level capacity of 24 feet) has become a cause for concern for residents, reminding them of the 2015 deluge. "Even if rains were to lash the metro, owing to the approaching cyclone, causing the water to rise sharply, there should not be any threat," a senior PWD official claimed. When the issue was taken up with Commissioner of Revenue Administration, K Phanindra Reddy, he said the inflow into Chembarambakkam lake would be around 6,500 cusecs only when there are heavy rains and this can be easily diverted to Adyar river, which has a capacity to carry 60,000 cusecs water. "People need not harbour fears about flooding," he said. Further, necessary precautions have been taken to release the water in phases and not cause flooding, as in 2015, he told reporters here. Reddy said people would be intimated in advance about the release of water from Chembarambakkam lake if the government decides to do so.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-govt-pulling-out-all-stops-to-ensure-no-repeat-of-2015-floods-in-chennai-919498.html

Karti said the “bold move” will enthuse Congress cadre and the alliance which would have a ripple effect for the upcoming Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu. “We need a bold move. Something which will fire up the imagination of the Congress worker. Priyanka Gandhi must contest the Kanyakumari Parliamentary seat election which is likely to be announced shortly. It will be an overwhelming victory for her/party/alliance,” he tweeted on Tuesday evening. He further added that her contesting from Kanyakumari will enthuse the cadre and the DMK-led alliance. “It will have a ripple effect for the upcoming assembly polls. It is a sure shot win and her presence in parliament will be a boost for the Congress. This will in no way hamper her Uttar Pradesh duties,” he wrote. Bypolls to Kanyakumari have been necessitated due to the death of incumbent H Vasanthakumar in August. The comments by Karti come weeks after the RJD-Congress alliance in Bihar lost the assembly polls. After the loss, there have been statements by Congress leaders asking the party leadership to take steps to rejuvenate the cadre by putting up a strong opposition against the Narendra Modi government. However, his comments did not go well with many party functionaries. Mohan Kumaramangalam, Working President of Tamil Nadu Congress, said Priyanka Gandhi should contest from a seat in Uttar Pradesh. “Couldn't disagree more. In my honest opinion, Priyanka Gandhi, when she does contest, should do so from any seat in Uttar Pradesh or from any place in the Hindi heartland. That would fire up the Congress worker in the place that needs it the most,” he wrote on Twitter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/priyanka-gandhi-should-contest-kanyakumari-bypolls-karti-chidambaram-919501.html

A popular South Indian actress was allegedly abducted and sexually assaulted by a gang at the behest of actor Dileep in February 2017. Dileep, who is also an accused in the case, was arrested in this connection in July 2017 and was granted bail in October. Pradeep Kottathala, who has been serving with Kumar as his office secretary, was held by police from the MLA's office at Pathanapuram in the suburbs of Kollam district. He allegedly threatened Kasargod native Vipinlal who is an approver in the case. A local court in Kasargod rejected anticipatory bail for him. Kumar, who is with the ruling Left Front in Kerala, said that Pradeep was expelled from his office. He declined to make any further comments. Kumar and actor Dileep, who is an accused in the actress assault case, are close to each other and hence police suspect that Pradeep could have threatened the approver at the behest of Dileep. Vipinlal was initially made an accused in the actor assault case as he was found to have links with the key accused in the case including 'Pulsar' Suni. Vipinlal said in his complaint to police recently that Pradeep threatened him over phone and through letters against given statements against the accused. Pradeep also allegedly rang up Vipinlal's mother by posing as an advocate's staff and threatened. The police registered a case at Kasargod and got evidence, especially mobile phone tower locations, said sources. Thrissur native Jinson, who is another witness in the case, also alleged of threats from accused against giving statements. He said in a complaint to the police that a person contacted him over phone twice and offered around five cents land and Rs. 25 lakh in cash. Jinson was also a coprisoner when the actor assault case accused were in the prison under remand. The fresh developments came close on the heels of Kerala High Court rejecting pleas of the assault victim actress as well as the prosecution for changing the trial court alleging unfair trial. Many key witnesses in the case have already turned hostile, and the special prosecutor of the case has also tendered resignation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-mlas-staff-held-for-threatening-actress-assault-case-approver-919515.html

Popular actor-turned-politician Rajya Sabha MP Suresh Gopi has even offered a home for her after coming across her plight. Munmi is contesting at Vikas Nagar ward (ward no. 11) of Iritti municipality in the suburbs of Kannur district for the local body polls next month. She is now actively involved in a campaign using her Malayalam with Assamese slang. Munmi's husband K N Shaji has been an active RSS-BJP worker of the locality and this indeed paved way for Munmi's entry to electoral politics. Iritti native Shaji, who is a construction worker, got in touch with Munmi in 2013 after he wrongly dialled the number when trying to contact a construction worker from Assam who used to work in Kerala. That wrong number subsequently developed into a love affair and it resulted in the two getting married with the blessings of their families. Now she has learnt to speak Malayalam and also knows to cook dishes from Kerala cuisine. The family comprising Shaji, Munmi and their two children Sadhika and Hrithika are now staying in a one-room rented house at Iritti. Suresh Gopi came across Munmi and her poor living condition through media reports and subsequently he offered to pay for her house. BJP local leader Suresh told DH that Munmi was quite close with the party ever since she reached Kerala and hence she opted to contest local body polls from the ward which is currently held by the Indian Union Muslim League. She is receiving a good acceptance among the local people as she was quite familiar to them, he said. Kerala has a considerable population of migrant workers, many of whom are from Assam also. Many migrant workers have also settled in Kerala with families.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/assam-woman-contesting-election-in-kerala-gets-offer-of-a-house-from-actor-turned-mp-suresh-gopi-919516.html

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that a recommendation to withdraw the ordinance would be sent to the Governor soon. He said that the decision to introduce the ordinance was taken with good intention considering demands from various quarters for stern steps against misuse of social media. But concerns were raised even by those supporting the left-front that it could be misused. Hence the government swiftly decided to withdraw it. Any further steps in this regard would be taken only thorough discussion in the assembly, said Vijayan. Even as the Chief Minister on Monday stated that the ordinance that came into effect on Sunday would not be implemented in view of the widespread concerns, there were still concerns that the ordinance was formally in effect. Hence the opposition Congress demanded the government to repeal it. Subsequently the cabinet that met on Tuesday decided to repeal the ordinance. The chief minister said that misuse of social media to defame individuals was quite rampant and it had even led to many ending life by suicide. The government had also held with various sections of the society and the general opinion was to have an effective law to curb social media misuse. But once the ordinance was issued even a section of media that earlier highlighted the requirement of stern measures to curb social media misuse flayed it, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-to-repeal-controversial-police-act-ordinance-919522.html

He was speaking at a press conference organised by Rama Sena. He said, “In the name of Kannada, a few miscreants have called for the Bandh on December 5, opposing the setting up of Maratha Development Corporation. Many people under the banner of different organisations are engaged in rowdyism. There is a need to teach lessons to those who try to forcefully impose bandh.” The seer said that it was the duty of government to provide facilities for the development of various communities. “Why should six crore people of Karnataka listen to 20 pro-Kannada people? Asking to throw stones is not provocation. It is a countermeasure for self-protection,” he added.

Patil, who was in Goa to meet Union Minister of State for AYUSH Shripad Naik over a matter related to the Union AYUSH Ministry, also said that instead of a combative role, the Opposition should play a consultative role while dealing with an issue as sensitive as the one involving sharing of the Mahadayi (also known as Mhadei in Goa) river.

Both of them should sit together and discuss while protecting the interests of people from both states,"(sic) Patil told reporters in Panaji. He also said that the Centre could also be consulted on the issue by Goa and Karnataka if the need arose. Patil, who is a former political secretary to Yeddyurappa, also said that discussion would be a worthwhile option, because the BJP is in power in both the states. "We have a government in both the states. The people from both the states are also our own," Patil said. He also urged the opposition to not politicise the sensitive issue. "I request the Opposition (in Goa) to politicise the issue. When it comes to any issue which is related to the people and society, the opposition should not be combative but should approach it in consultative mode,"(sic) Patil said. Goa has also opposed the diversion of water from the Mahadayi river basin through the Kalasa-Bhandura project claiming it would cause “ecological devastation” in Goa. Last month, the Goa government had filed a contempt petition in the Supreme Court against Karnataka for illegal diversion of water from the Mahadayi river. Both the states have already filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court against the award given by a central government tribunal which allowed Karnataka to divert 13.42 TMC water from the river basin.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-goa-cms-should-meet-and-resolve-mahadayi-issue-shankargouda-patil-919441.html

The Health Care Workers' data has already been compiled for all the government facilities. At least 80 per cent of the private health facilities have also shared their data. Compilation of data for the remaining 20 per cent private facilities is likely to be completed in a week, the minister added. On the storage facilities in the state, the Minister said Karnataka has around 2,855 cold chain points for storage and distribution of vaccines.

Taking part in the Primary and Secondary Education department’s school adoption programme in Vidhana Soudha, CM Yediyurappa said, “We must also invite the parents of school kids and interact with them about good parenting so that the students in future would become productive to the society. Then only the purpose of adoption is achieved.” Appreciating the efforts of Prof MR Doreswamy, advisor to the government on education reforms, who popularised the project, Yediyurappa said, “This is a society oriented programme and uniqueness of the programme is that every elected representative has come forward to adopt the schools. In fact, many have already adopted schools across the state. Many others have also been inspired by their gesture.” The state government had also made it mandatory for MLAs to adopt at least three schools in the state budget. Following the announcement, MLAs, government and private universities and higher education institutes had adopted schools across Karnataka for developing basic infrastructure. CM BSY himself had adopted 10 government schools in his constituency and Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol also adopted five government schools in Mudhol taluk of Bagalkot district. Further, Social Welfare minister B Sriramulu and Primary and Secondary Education minister S Suresh Kumar, MLC Srikanthaiah also adopted five schools each and all of them were handed over adoption letters by the Chief Minister during the event. Primary and Secondary Education minister S Suresh Kumar said, “Many people have been saying that we must develop our schools on the lines of the Delhi government. But the situation in Delhi is different from that of ours. Delhi has 4,000 schools and they need not worry about spending on irrigation like we do. However, we will bring the best of the features that have been implemented in Delhi schools to Karnataka soon.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/adopt-discuss-and-develop-schools-bs-yediyurappa-to-philanthropists-919407.html

Bommai said this after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a video conference with Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa to chalk out India's vaccination strategy. According to Bommai, the government is planning to emulate arrangements made during elections to administer the vaccine to the general population. “PM Modi has directed that arrangements for vaccination centres will be similar to preparations at the booth-level for elections. These centres should be formed and workers should be trained for the exercise," Bommai said. A digital platform will be developed to collate inoculation data, as people who are vaccinated might require two or three doses to achieve resistance to the Covid-19 virus, the minister said. According to a statement from Health Minister K Sudhakar, the government has identified 29,451 vaccination sites and 10,008 vaccinators as per the Universal Immunization Programme norms. Karnataka has around 2,855 cold chain points for vaccine storage and distribution, Sudhakar said. “With a view to have a better supply chain network and distribution of vaccines in a timely manner, three new regional vaccine stores – Bengaluru Urban, Shivamogga and Ballari - have been proposed.

The vaccine will be distributed on priority to 30 crore people in the country, which will include one crore health workers, two crore Corona warriors, 26 crore citizens aged above 50 and the remaining for those with comorbidities, Bommai pointed out. As many as 50 vaccines are undergoing clinical research throughout the world. Of them, some 25 vaccines are in an advanced trial stage and five are undergoing trials in India. Companies such as Bharat Biotech, Dr Reddy's Lab, PharmaGenica are ready to manufacture different vaccine candidates when they are cleared by regulatory bodies, Bommai said. Since the exact date for vaccination is still unclear, people should be wary of the disease as the battle against Covid-19 will continue, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/cm-b-s-yediyurappa-led-panel-to-monitor-covid-19-vaccination-in-karnataka-919414.html

"Three days ago we questioned Hemant Nimbalkar," the sources told PTI, but did not elaborate. Nimbalkar and another IPS officer Ajay Hilori were booked by the investigation agency in February after the state government gave its nod to prosecute them. They are charged with covering up the scam and shielding the Ponzi scheme operators. Recently Nimbalkar was summoned again after the CBI took custody of Ponzi scheme operator, Mohammed Mansoor Khan, on November 21, they added. A day after questioning Nimbalkar and Khan, former Congress Minister R Roshan Baig was grilled and arrested, the sources said. The premier investigation agency arrested Baig on Sunday after day-long interrogation in the Rs 4,000 crore multi-crore I-Monetary Advisory (IMA) ponzi scam, in which over a lakh investors have been duped. The scam came to light in June last year when the Ponzi scheme operator Mohammed Mansoor Khan fled the country accusing Baig and some government officers of cheating him. He had alleged that Baig had taken Rs 400 crore from him, a charge rejected by the latter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/cbi-questions-ips-officer-hemant-nimbalkar-in-connection-with-ima-scam-919456.html

The court has asked the political parties to file responses as to whether they will issue strict instructions to party workers to follow the rules. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Abhay S Oka said that the Covid rules on wearing masks and social distancing were being breached more in large political rallies.  The court observed that the state government had not taken any action in such instances and in some cases the authorities took some action belatedly. “Prima Facie it is the responsibility of political parties to ensure strict implementation of rules regarding wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. Time has come when political parties issue strict instructions to its workers about these rules,” the bench said. Meanwhile, the petitioners pointed out that a political party - Kannada Chalavali Vatal Paksha - has called for a state bandh on December 5 and there was a likelihood of breach of rules. The court directed the petitioners to implead BJP, CPI (M), Indian National Congress, JD (S) and Kannada Chalavali Vatal Paksha as respondents. The court called upon the added respondents to submit whether they were willing to issue instructions to their party workers to strictly abide by the rules of wearing masks and social distancing. The court also directed Kannada Chalavali Vatal Paksha to submit a similar response in view of the bandh called for. The court also observed that the statement of objection filed by the state government was silent about the recovery of the fine amount. In view of the admitted fact that there are large scale violations, the court directed the state government to file supplementary statements of objections detailing the fine amount recovered.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/breach-of-covid-19-rules-karnataka-hc-asks-political-parties-to-file-response-919507.html

"The state government plans to enact a more stringent form of the law," he said. The Karnataka Prevention of Cow Slaughter and Cattle Preservation Act, 1964, which is in force now, permits slaughter of bulls, bullocks and buffaloes if they are above 12 years or if they are unfit for breeding or giving milk. If the new Bill is enacted, there will be complete prohibition on cow slaughter, sale and use of beef, transportation of animals for slaughter in other states and trading animals for the purpose. Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and others have this law, Chauhan said. In fact, the BJP had introduced this Bill in 2010 during B S Yediyurappa's earlier stint as the chief minister. While the 2010 Bill failed to get the Presidential nod, the government changed hands and in 2013, the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government withdrew the Bill and retained the 1964 Act. The Karnataka Animal Welfare Board is empowered to prevent any form of animal right violations. Measures are in place to prevent cattle slaughter and illegal trade of animals, Chauhan added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/anti-cow-slaughter-bill-to-be-introduced-in-winter-session-prabhu-chauhan-919511.html

The state BJP has demanded a high-level probe into the incident, however, according to the Mumbai Police, a majority of these girls have been traced. NCW Chairperson Rekha Sharma has written to Chief Secretary Sanjay Kumar and Director General of Police Subodh Jaiswal seeking an immediate intervention into the matter. “The commission has viewed the reports seriously and has taken suo moto cognizance into the matter. The commission has sought an action taken report from the authorities into the matter,” the NCW said in a press statement. The NCW also asked the authorities to check whether there is any element of human trafficking involved in these cases. BJP’s national executive member and former Mumbai MP Dr Kirit Somaiya, who has raised the issue, said that 14 young women and eight minors have been missing from areas under the jurisdiction of Govandi police station. He has urged that areas falling under Mankhurd, Deonar and Shivajinagar must also be included in the probe as girls are missing from these areas as well. “It's shocking that 21 young girls went 'gayab' (missing) in the last few months, from the Govandi police station area of Mumbai? Why? Who took them away? Who cheated them? We demand a high-level inquiry," he tweeted and tagged Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis.

The progressive total of Covid-19 cases in MMR stands at 6,19,025 of which Mumbai accounts for 2,76,514 cases. Similarly, in MMR, a total of 18,519 people have died of Covid-19 and Mumbai alone accounts for 10,689 deaths. The Mumbai-MMR comprises five districts – Mumbai City and Mumbai Suburban and large parts of the three neighbouring districts of Thane, Palghar and Raigad. Spread over 6,355 sq km, it has nine municipal corporations, nine municipal councils and over a 1,000 villages where more than two crore people live – making it one of the most populous and fastest-growing areas of the world. Since it is the financial and business capital of the country, at this stage, curbs within MMR may not be a good idea. In MMR, the areas of concern come under the nine municipal corporations - Greater Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan-Dombivali, Navi Mumbai, Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Vasai-Virar and Mira-Bhayandar. Besides, Mumbai has over 2.7 lakh Covid-19 cases, three adjoining corporations - Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli and Navi Mumbai - have over 50,000 cases each. “There cannot be any let up at this stage. The Mumbai-MMR is an area of concern as the workforce in Mumbai comes from the rest of MMR. There is high road traffic movement and as time passes more people are being allowed in local trains,” said Dr Suhas Pingle, Chairman, Action Committee, Indian Medical Association-Maharashtra.   It needs to be noted that Mumbai-MMR along with neighbouring districts of Pune and Nashik form the Golden Triangle and is the biggest industrial belt of the country – with massive traffic movement of goods and people. In Pune district, the total Covid-19 cases stand at 3,46,961 and deaths 7,291. In the Nashik district, the total cases now stands at 1,02,698 and deaths 1,681. The active cases in Mumbai-Nashik-Pune stand at 50,952 – and the health authorities are trying to bring this down further. According to Dr IS Gilada, an infectious diseases specialist and leading HIV/AIDS consultant, we need to enhance the rapid antibody tests, to understand the bigger picture. “This is a truly point-of-care (PoC) test, done on a drop of blood with a finger prick, can be done by anyone, and anywhere with result in just 10 to15 minutes. We can test more people and get a fair idea,” he said.  Warning of a second wave, that he feels could be like a tsunami, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has appealed people to compulsorily wear masks properly, maintain physical distancing, stress on sanitisation and avoid crowding.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/mumbai-s-covid-19-curve-may-be-flattening-but-pandemic-rages-in-rest-of-mmr-919297.html

As part of the facility started recently, the luggage is passed through a machine or chamber, in which the ultraviolet (UV) light is beamed from all directions, to make the outer surface of the luggage free of all types of viruses, bacteria and germs, they said. After the sanitisation process in the specially designed chamber, the luggage is handed over to passengers with a sticker certifying it 'disinfected'. Thereafter, passengers can also get their luggage properly wrapped, if they wish so, by paying the fixed charges, the officials said. "The UV light-based sanitisation facility is provided at an affordable rate and charges are determined on the basis of size of the baggage," Central Railway's Chief Public Relations Officer Shivaji Sutar said. For luggages weighing 10 kg, 25 kg and more than 25 kg, the sanitisation charges are Rs 10, Rs 15 and Rs 20, while wrapping charges are Rs 60, Rs 70 and Rs 80, respectively, Sutar said. Passengers can avail this facility at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and the Lokmanya Tilak Terminus in Mumbai as well as Kalyan station in neighbouring Thane district, another official said. The Central Railway (CR) also has plans to make this facility available at Dadar in Mumbai and at Thane and Panvel stations, he said. The initiative is part of the Non-Fare Revenue Ideas Scheme, under which the Railways has signed an agreement with private enterprises to provide this facility, the official said.

24-11-2020||West||Enforcement Directorate raids Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik's residence, office||In a rude shock to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, the Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday raided the residence and offices of one of his close aides and senior Shiv Sena leader Pratap Sarnaik. A vocal leader and a grassroots worker, Sarnaik had demanded action against Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut and Republic Media Network’s Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami. The ruling MVA has alleged that the BJP-led Centre was misusing agencies like CBI and ED to cow down political opponents. The development comes days ahead of the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress dispensation’s first anniversary. Sarnaik (56) is a three-time MLA from Ovala-Majiwada constituency in Thane district. Sarnaik is Chairman of Vihang Group of Companies, which has interests in real estate and founder, and President of Sanskruti Yuva Pratishthan, a social platform. His wife Parisha Sarnaik is a corporator in Thane Municipal Corporation. Their sons Vihang and Purvesh are actively involved in Yuva Sena, the students’ wing of Shiv Sena. The ED has taken his elder son Vihang to its Mumbai headquarters in Ballard Estate. He is being questioned by ED sleuths. The details of the raid and vis-à-vis the cases are not yet known, however, sources said that these are related to financial transactions. Nearly 10 places in Mumbai and Thane associated with Sarnaiks and Topsgrup were raided during the day. It may be recalled that Sarnaik had been critical of actor Kangana Ranaut and TV journalist Arnab Goswami. He demanded action against Ranaut when she equated Mumbai with Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. Besides that, he had demanded reopening of the Anvay Naik abetment to suicide case in which Republic Media Network’s Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami was arrested. He also mooted the breach of privilege against Goswami and also demanded his arrest in the wake of the TRP scam. Sarnaik was responsible for ensuring that Independent MLA from Mira Bhayander Geeta Jain, a BJP rebel, joined the Shiv Sena last month. The MVA government has attacked the BJP-led NDA dispensation over the issue. NCP supremo Sharad Pawar slammed the Centre for targeting political opponents. “Instead of answering questions of people, government agencies (like CBI and ED) are being used against political opponents. This is not good. Our government has completed a year so they know now that they can't come to power here. So they are using power they have in the Centre,” he said. Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said that the raids are being used for political purposes. “We know that the CBI and the ED are being misused….you will now bow down,” he said, adding that the government is stable and will last its full five years. “One year has passed and four years will also go….we will ensure that BJP is out in Maharashtra for 24 hours,” he said. “The government is using the agencies for political purposes,” said state Congress President and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat. “The BJP is targeting political opponents. Have you heard about any raids on people associated with BJP?” he wanted to know. Leader of Opposition and former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, said he wasn’t aware of the details and would not comment. “No one should be scared of any such action if they have done no wrong. However, the ED does not initiate any action unless it has solid evidence,” he said in Solapur.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/enforcement-directorate-raids-shiv-sena-mla-pratap-sarnaiks-residence-office-919319.html

However, the three-party alliance involving Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress has dismissed the statements of top BJP leaders as a dream of the BJP and asserted that the MVA government will last its full term Thackeray, the Shiv Sena President, assumed the office of Maharashtra Chief Minister on November 28 last year after breaking ties with BJP, its saffron ally of three decades, and joining hands with the Congress-NCP combine. Senior BJP leader and Union Minister of State Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Raosaheb Patil-Danve said the BJP government will be formed in the state in the next two to three months. The statement comes in the backdrop of elections for six seats to the Maharashtra Legislative Council that is scheduled for December 1. "I will tell you clearly. In the coming two to three months, our government is being formed in Maharashtra and you should remember that," Danve said. "I will not tell you how we will form the government. I will tell them (MVA) after it happens. We are only waiting for existing elections to get over," he added. Similar indications also came from Leader of Opposition in Assembly Devendra Fadnavis and his counterpart in Council Pravin Darekar. “Let the results come…you will see that the government will collapse,” said Darekar. Asked about Danve’s statement, Fadnavis, a former Chief Minister, said: “This is an unnatural alliance of the three parties… I am not giving dates… We are playing the role of an effective Opposition, but let me assure you the moment the government collapses, an effective and alternative government would be in place.” MVA leaders, however, dismissed the treats. “They are daydreaming… The government will last its full term,” said Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab, who is a close Thackeray aide. Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said: “We will complete the full five-year term and send the BJP home in Maharashtra for 25 years.

24-11-2020||West||Pune doctor appointed Vice Chairman of international geriatric study group||Dr Yogesh Bendale, Chairman and MD of Rasayu Group, has been appointed as the Vice Chairman of geriatrics study group by Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer, Canada (MASCC). Dr Bendale is the first Indian to be appointed to that particular post at MASCC, which is an international multidisciplinary organisation with members from more than 70 countries providing research guidelines for cancer research. The organisation is involved in research and education in all aspects of supportive care for people with cancer. Geriatric cancer patients belong to the older age group due to which they have their own challenges in overall oncology research. Most of these patients suffer from other comorbid conditions like diabetes, cardiac diseases etc that adds limitations to the available therapies. Hence the importance of this study group is well identified and potentially addressed by MASCC. The geriatric study group aims at promoting the inclusion of Geriatric Oncology focus within MASCC and enhancing best practices in cancer supportive clinical care. According to a press statement, Dr Bendale’s knowledge and expertise as a leading researcher and specialist will be helpful in exploring new dimensions in elderly cancer care. Dr Bendale with his vision and passion for Ayurveda and Indian knowledge tradition has founded Rasayu Group, which encompasses multiple segments right from cancer care, women's health care, critical illness care, pharmaceutical manufacturing and research.  He holds more than 40 international patents including those for treatments on cancer and critical illnesses. He frequently travels to Europe, USA and Gulf Countries to propagate Ayurveda. He has also pioneered ‘Rasayana Therapy’ for cancer and other chronic and critical diseases, which is benefiting patients in India and abroad.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/pune-doctor-appointed-vice-chairman-of-international-geriatric-study-group-919354.html
24-11-2020||West||Mumbai Police file charge sheet in fake TRP scam||The Mumbai Police on Tuesday filed a charge sheet in a court here in the alleged TRP (Television Rating Points) rigging scam. The charge sheet was submitted before a magistrate's court by the police's Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU), which is conducting a probe into the case, an official said. The crime branch has so far arrested 12 persons, including Republic TV's distribution head and owners of two other channels, in connection with the case, he said. The fake TRP scam came to light last month when ratings agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a complaint through Hansa Research Group, alleging that certain television channels were rigging TRP numbers. Hansa had been tasked with installing barometers, which record viewership data (which channel has been watched and for how long) at sample households. TRP is important as advertising revenue of channels depends on it. Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh last month claimed thatRepublic TVand two Marathi channels Box Cinema and Fakt Marathi- were involved in manipulating TRPs. Republic TV and other accused have denied wrongdoing and manipulation of the TRP system. Earlier, Republic TV's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and two Chief Operating Officers (COO) and Chief Finance Officer (CFO) were summoned by the police for questioning in the fake TRP racket case. The statements of Republic TV's executive editor Niranjan Narayanswamy and senior executive editor Abhishek Kapoor were also recorded by the police. The Maharashtra government last month withdrew its "general consent" given to the Central Bureau of Investigation to probe cases in the state, in the wake of the CBI taking over a case registered by Uttar Pradesh Police against "unknown" channels and persons over alleged fudging of TRP. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) recently filed a money laundering complaint in the alleged TRP rigging scam being investigated by the Mumbai Police. The central probe agency has filed an enforcement case information report (ECIR) that is equivalent to a police FIR under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, official sources said last week. The ED complaint was filed after studying a Mumbai Police FIR that was registered in October and it had named the Republic TV channel, two Marathi channels and few other individuals.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/mumbai-police-file-charge-sheet-in-fake-trp-scam-919356.html

Talking to reporters here, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, without naming the BJP, said it should forget the dream of coming to power in Maharashtra for the next 25 years, "no matter how much pressure it exerts or spreads terror through agencies". "If you have begun today, we know how to end it," the Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson said. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) raided premises linked to Shiv Sena MLA Sarnaik in Maharashtra on Tuesday in connection with a money-laundering case. "This action is definitely a political vendetta. The ED or other agencies should not work as if a branch of a political party," Raut said. He said that Sarnaik's properties were raided while the latter was not at home, and added that no matter how many notices are issued, only truth shall prevail in Maharashtra. Raut also said there is no ban on probes by an agency and it can take action if there is evidence. "But, you want to mentally harass the people related to the (state) government. These actions will backfire on you. And I think that time is nearing," he said. The Shiv Sena, which was earlier a long-term ally of the BJP but snapped ties with it last year over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post, is in power in Maharashtra along with the NCP and Congress. "Be it the CBI or ED, our government, MLAs and leaders will not surrender to anyone no matter what. We will keep fighting," Raut said. Those who are trying to use pressure of agencies or want to demoralise MLAs, should keep in mind that "this is Maharashtra of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj", he said. The Shiv Sena will not be scared if the ED sets up office outside the residences of each of the partys MLAs, MPs and leaders, the Rajya Sabha member said. Raut said he can send to the ED a list of 100 people of "a party whose orders the agency is taking" about their businesses and how their money-laundering is going on. The Shiv Sena wont care if the central probe agencies, judiciary and law are going to behave as if "slaves or servants" of those in power. "No matter how many notices you send, raids you conduct, create fake documents and evidence, but in Maharashtra and in the case of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), only truth shall prevail. "The motto of 'Satyamev Jayate' can win only in Maharashtra," the Shiv Sena leader said. Asked about the ED's notice to NCP chief Sharad Pawar last year, Raut said let them make arrests if they want.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/eds-raid-on-sena-mla-political-vendetta-sanjay-raut-919370.html

According to an official statement, Thackeray made the remarks during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting via video conferencing with chief ministers of eight states which have reported higher number of Covid-19 cases. "A task force has been set up to manage the distribution and vaccination in Maharashtra and the government is in constant touch with Adar Poonawalla of the Serum Institute of India to track development of the coronavirus vaccine," the statement said quoting Thackeray. Poonawalla is the CEO of the Serum Institute of India, which has partnered with AstraZeneca for manufacturing the Oxford vaccine for Covid-19. The Chief Ministers Office (CMO) later tweeted that Thackeray also informed PM Modi about various steps the Maharashtra government has taken to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus in the state. Till Monday, Maharashtra reported 17,84,361 Covid-19 cases and 46,653 deaths due to the disease, as per the state health department. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday interacted with chief ministers of states that are witnessing a surge in coronavirus cases to review the Covid-19 situation. The central government has also been putting in place measures for quick and effective distribution of coronavirus vaccine when it becomes available. Five vaccine candidates are in advanced stages of development in India, out of which four are in Phase II/III and one is in Phase-I/II trials.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/task-force-set-up-in-maharashtra-to-manage-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-cm-uddhav-thackeray-919374.html

A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik was hearing two petitions filed by Lawyers Collective and Grover, seeking to quash the 2019 complaint filed by the ED under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) for alleged violation of provisions of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA). "The current proceedings instituted by the ED is a speculative roving and fishing inquiry," the petitions filed through advocate Rahul Kamerkar stated. Grover in his petition also challenged the summons issued against him by the ED earlier this month, asking him to appear before it on November 26. Through the summons, the ED had asked Grover to produce records of foreign contributions received by the NGO. When the petitions came up for hearing on Tuesday, Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh sought time to respond to the pleas. Senior counsel Amit Desai and Aspi Chinoy said the summons issued to Grover should be suspended pending hearing of the petitions. To this, Justice Shinde said, "The Covid-19 cases are increasing everywhere. Even our state (Maharashtra) has now put certain restrictions on travel. In such a situation, your authority (ED) in Delhi can defer the summons issued and ask them (Grover) to come on a later date." "We need to respect humanity. Please bear in mind the current scenario and consider this suggestion," the court said. The bench asked Singh to take instructions from the ED on deferring of the summons and posted the pleas for further hearing on Wednesday. As per the plea, in November 2016, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs cancelled the group's FCRA registration claiming irregularities. In June 2019, the CBI had registered FIR against the group for alleged violation of FCRA provisions and on corruption charges. Thereafter, the ED registered a complaint against Lawyers Collective and Grover under the PMLA. The petition claimed that Lawyers Collective was a group founded in 1981 by lawyers to raise social causes. The plea sought quashing of the ED complaint and said there is no material to show charges of money laundering. "There is no allegation of any proceeds of crime having been generated," the petition stated. "Lawyers Collective's accounts were duly audited in accordance with law, the foreign contributions were declared under all applicable laws, the administrative purposes funded through such contributions were also disclosed and due taxes were also paid," the petition said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/covid-19-ed-can-summon-anand-grover-on-later-date-says-hc-919378.html
24-11-2020||West||Devendra Fadnavis dubs Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra govt as 'unnatural alliance'||Terming the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in Maharashtra as an "unnatural alliance", BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday said the day this tie-up breaks, his party will give a strong government to the state. Till that time, the BJP will work honestly as a strong opposition and it is not eyeing any shift in power in the state, Fadnavis said at a press conference in Solapur. Such governments (like MVA which comprises the Shiv Sena, NCP, and Congress) have not lasted long in the country or state and this government is no exception, the leader of opposition in the state Assembly said. "The day this unnatural alliance breaks, we will give a strong government to this state, but till that time, we will remain in the opposition," he said.Asked if the BJP is eyeing a shift in power in Maharashtra after a win in the Bihar Assembly polls, Fadnavis denied it, saying, "We are in the opposition (in Maharashtra), and we are playing the role of a strong opposition honestly." On the Uddhav Thackeray-led government's intention to inquire into the outstanding power bills during the previous BJP-led dispensation, Fadnavis said that if the state government starts an inquiry, it "will fall on its face". "My point is why to inquire about our five years, why not last 20 years (five of BJP and 15 of Congress-NCP rule), because it was not our government which gave birth to the power utility company. Whatever legacy they have given us, we took it ahead," he said. Fadnavis claimed the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is adding the outstanding bills of 15 years (of Congress-NCP rule) to the figures of the last BJP-led regime. "Yes, we had some outstanding bills, but it was because we took a decision not to cut electricity connections of farmers," he said.On the contrary, the present state government has an attitude of a "money lender" and is resorting to tactics of forcible recovery of power bills, he alleged. He also criticised the state government for not providing relief to consumers who complained of receiving inflated power bills during the lockdown. The BJP leader claimed the MVA government is so "incompetent" that if there is no strong opposition, it will exploit the common man. Asked about the Enforcement Directorate's raid on Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik's premises in Maharashtra in a money laundering case, Fadnavis said the probe agency must be having some complaints or material."The ED will not raid without any ground. I cannot comment on it as I do not have any information about it. "But I would like to say that if anyone has not done anything wrong, there is no need to be scared, and if there is a wrongdoing, any agency can initiate action," he said. Former BJP leader Eknath Khadse, who joined the NCP, last month, recently said he will not be cowed down by threats of probe agencies. "If you have ED, I have the CD," Khadse said. When asked about it, Fadnavis said, "Why to wait for the EDs action. If he has a CD with him, he should release it immediately." Leader of opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Council Pravin Darekar said if the Shiv Sena can take action against actress Kangana Ranaut when she was not in her office, the party should not complain about the ED's action against Sarnaik, who is abroad."The ED takes its course of action (irrespective of the person)," Darekar said. BJP MP Narayan Rane also hit out that Sarnaik, saying "he is not a saint"."You should gather information about Sarnaik before calling it (ED's action) vendetta politics," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/devendra-fadnavis-dubs-uddhav-thackeray-led-maharashtra-govt-as-unnatural-alliance-919382.html

Rupani also informed about various initiatives to curb the coronavirus transmission during a meeting of chief ministers of eight states, which have reported higher number of Covid-19 cases, addressed by the PM via video conferencing, an official release said. The CM said the government has intensified testing to identify coronavirus positive patients and also imposed a night curfew in Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Vadodara and Surat. "The CM has assured the PM that the situation is under control and enough number of beds are available in the state for coronavirus patients," the release said. Gujarat's Covid-19 caseload stood at 1,98,899 as on November 23 while the cumulative death toll was 3,876, as per the state health department. The CM said the night curfew in the four cities will remain in effect until the situation comes under control, it said. In his presentation to the PM, Rupani said 45,000 or 82 per cent of about 55,000 isolation beds available for Covid-19 patients in the state, are vacant, as per the release. In fresh curbs to contain the spread of the virus, the CM said only 100 guests are now allowed to attend a marriage function, while the number of attendees has been capped at 50 for a funeral. For early detection of cases, both RT-PCR and antigen testing has been ramped up across the state, Rupani said, adding that around 70,000 tests were conducted on Monday. The capacity of laboratories to conduct RT-PCR tests has been increased three-fold to cover a large population, the CM is quoted as telling the PM. Rupani also apprised the prime minister about various other measures such as treatment of home isolated patients; deployment of Sanjeevani and Dhanvantri 'Raths' (vans) for conducting tests and providing treatment at doorstep, and deployment of additional doctors and surveillance teams, the release added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/covid-19-situation-under-control-in-gujarat-cm-vijay-rupani-tells-pm-modi-919402.html

The FIR was registered pursuant to orders passed by the Bandra magistrate's court here directing the police to carry out an inquiry against Ranaut and her sister following a complaint lodged against them for allegedly "trying to create hatred and communal tension" through their social media posts. A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik was hearing a petition filed by Ranaut and her sister, seeking to quash the FIR and the October 17 order passed by the magistrate. The court said three summonses were issued by the police and the same need to be honoured. Ranaut and Chandel's advocate Rizwan Siddiquee then assured the court that the sisters shall appear before the Bandra police in Mumbai on January 8 from 12 pm to 2 pm for recording of their statements. The high court accepted the statement. "We are of the prima facie opinion that interim protection till the matter is heard at length deserves to be granted. The police shall not take any coercive action including arrest against the applicants (Ranaut and Chandel)," the court said. The court also asked why sedition charges were invoked in the case. "Why is the sedition section invoked? Why are we treating citizens of our country like this?" Justice Shinde said. The HC said it would consider this issue at length on the next date. The court posted the plea for further hearing on January 11. The police have filed the FIR against Ranaut and her sister under IPC sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race), 295-A (deliberate acts hurting religious sentiments) and 124-A (sedition), 34 (common intention).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/sedition-case-hc-grants-kangana-ranaut-interim-protection-from-arrest-919413.html

The Congress leader also demanded an "all party meeting" to assess the rising crisis in the state. In a series of tweets, the Congress leader said that "three months back, Gujarat was reporting 1,450 cases per day which has again reached the same figure but the government didn't bring curfew or lockdown back then. So, why have you imposed night curfew now? What is wrong, the figures or the government?". तीन महीने पहले गुजरात में हर दिन कोरोना के मरीज़ों की संख्या १४५० आती थी और आज भी १४५० ही मरीज़ों के आँकड़े जनता के सामने रखे जाते है तो फिर तीन महीने पहलें कर्फ़्यू या लॉकडाउन क्यू नहीं किया अभी ऐसा क्या है की कर्फ़्यू और रात्रि लॉकडाउन किया गया हैं। आँकड़े ग़लत है या फिर सरकार। In another tweet, he questioned, "There is a pattern in the figure...initially there were 400 to 500 cases, then for three months 900 to 950 cases were reported and for last several days number of infected patients are reported to be 1,400 to 1450. The government has done something wrong." गुजरात में कोरोना महामारी की शुरुआत के तीन महीने हर दिन ४००/४५० के बीच मरीज़ों की संख्या बताई जाती थी, फिर तीन महीने ९००/९५० के बीच मरीज़ों की संख्या बताई गई और अभी पिछले तीन महीने से हर दिन १४००/१४५० के बीच मरीज़ों की संख्या बताई जा रही हैं। सरकार ने कुछ तो गड़बड़ किया हैं। Hardik also alleged that "Gujarat is the worst affected state in the country. The figure of Covid-19 infection is rising but BJP government is not working properly." On the other hand, in a video message, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani claimed that the infection has increased but the government also took measures to control it. He said that government has taken various efforts including bringing complete curfew in Ahmedabad and then night curfew. Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases crossed two lakh in the state on Tuesday with detection of 1,510 new cases in the past 24 hours.
