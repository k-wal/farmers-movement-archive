Goswami was arrested on the charge of abetment to suicide in a case dating back to 2018. It relates to the death by suicide of a businessman and his mother to whom Republic TV owed a large sum of money that it allegedly did not pay. The businessman left behind a suicide note and his family is pursuing the case. Republic TV has denied the charges and said that the case is part of a political campaign against the channel and Goswami by the Maharashtra government. It has dubbed it as a slanderous and malicious attempt to run it down and punish it for its criticism of the state government. Republic TV’s style of journalism is gross, biased and violative of journalism’s best canons and purpose. He has unleashed a relentless campaign against the Maharashtra government on many issues, including the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Many of his charges were wild and baseless, just like many other charges he levels against leaders of opposition parties and anybody who is against the Narendra Modi government. He had also called for the summary arrest of many people though there was no credible charge of any kind against them. He had turned the studio into a courtroom where the most ridiculous trials were conducted, and judgements passed. The Maharashtra government certainly has an axe to grind against Goswami. But even so, journalists and media organisations should not be harassed and persecuted for their comments and views, however unpleasant and biased they are. Governments should not act with rancour and vindictiveness against their critics, even unreasonable ones. Even when citizens abuse their freedom and their rights, governments should not abuse their powers. Such blatant abuse of powers has been seen in recent years when critics, or even those merely seen to be not on the side of the central government, have been harassed and hounded and implicated in cases. Sedition charges are routinely used against critics and protesters; central government and BJP leaders unleash vitriol against those they consider as enemies and central agencies then proceed to file charges, raid and arrest them under draconian laws like the UAPA. It is therefore ironic that leaders of the central government, right from Union Home Minister Amit Shah to lower-level functionaries, are now crying “Emergency” and “fascism” over Goswami’s arrest. The arrest is still wrong and, unfortunately, it will impart a sense of martyrdom to the poor brand of journalism practised by Republic TV and Goswami.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/arnab-goswami-s-arrest-is-wrong-911441.html
05-11-2020||In Perspective||Reclaiming Bengaluru for walking||For decades, it seems, Pamuk has wandered the backstreets of his city in sweet tristesse, lovingly storing in his mind every last minutia of what he sees and hears and smells, and relating it all to what he imagines.” So starts Jan Morris’ review of Orhan Pamuk’s Istanbul. Pamuk and Morris provide us with a tender, partly sentimental way of looking at cities; of cities as living organisms, with loving descriptions of shops, markets, dogs, traffic policemen and trains, noises and smells and fountains and temples. They gave me a love of walking the city to see its people and history through its streets. Walking across Frazer Town, Jayanagar, Brigade road and Richmond Town, each neighbourhood is a different experience, with different histories, stories and narratives. In this time of viruses, isolation and quarantine, more people are walking. For the privileged few that remained in the city after the March 2020 exodus of migrants, job losses, income losses and rising fuel costs have meant that vehicles stay parked and walking is the primary mode of movement. It has become necessary to step out of the house and access the city through a short walk to the local grocery stores, pharmacy, etc. This walk in Indian cities is usually extremely uncomfortable. The possibility of being run over by vehicles, navigating gobs of paan spit, the lack of designated sidewalks (uneven and filthy when available) and moon craters as roads, careening cars and autorickshaws and the cacophony of noise, are constants. With the current redevelopment of Bengaluru with highways and flyovers, the annihilation of thousands of trees, and the dramatic reconfiguration of the city, I wonder if the city will ever be walkable again. In Bengaluru, we appear to be reproducing the history of the Western city, albeit 150 years later. We are building large stretches of roadways, with flyovers and underpasses all designed for the car. Efficiency and speed (of vehicular traffic) became synonymous with modernity and cities in the West found themselves investing in highways and highspeed roads replacing boulevards and sidewalks. Baron Hausmann in Paris and later Robert Moses in New York epitomised this need for efficiency and sanitization of the city. Napoleon thought that “Paris was overcrowded, dingy, dirty and riddled with disease” and wanted it more like London “with its grand parks and gardens, its tree-lined avenues and modern sewage system.” Through Hausmann and the wealthy, he was prepared “to ride roughshod over the opinions of others and make absolutely no concessions to democracy.” Since the 1950s, voices like Jane Jacobs have advocated reclaiming the city for the common man. Jacob writes about walkability, street life, diversity, mixed-use as cornerstones of great cities; that a neighbourhood must serve more than one function; blocks must be short, to maximise the experience of variety; the neighbourhood must include old buildings and new, to keep affordability and help keep change gradual; and there must be a sufficient density of people for a social scene. In the last century, city planners and policymakers have been reversing large-scale infrastructure development across the Western ‘developed’ city. Cities are returning streets as public spaces for people (Highline in New York, revitalizing a defunct railway line into a people-oriented green elevated walking path; revitalization of the Seine River waterfront in Paris). In Bengaluru, the metro rail alignment has displaced entire communities, the widening of ‘spoke’ roads entering the city has destroyed thousands of trees, devastated wildlife corridors and destroyed village communities along the route. Some may say this was all necessary. However, the lack of foresight and public participation in the development planning process of the city is problematic. With Covid-19 and the migration of people, it is critical to question the pre-pandemic development of the city. While public infrastructure is important, public participation broader than elitist engagement is critical. The BBMP is facing significant questions that it has previously ignored. It is, per force, deregulating its public health engagement with the city by reconnecting with ward committees (a 74th Amendment requirement, but largely ignored) to handle the spread of the virus in the city. This is a positive step, and hopefully will empower ward committees to engage more in urban issues like infrastructure development, heritage conservation, transportation management and real estate development. The BDA, the planning authority, is being questioned for its lack of engagement with the pandemic. The mayor’s office needs to be strengthened to facilitate more public participation. Perhaps, the Covid-19 crisis will create conditions to facilitate the changes needed in Bengaluru. Structural changes will not occur overnight. However, the pandemic gives us a chance for more robust participatory processes. Hopefully, people will want to retain the character of neighbourhoods like Frazer Town and Jayanagar, whilst improving living conditions and infrastructure, and force the government to listen to their voices and engage with the city in a more humane manner. Perhaps, in the future, we will be able to rediscover history and find joy in walking across a city that encourages our common humanity and social connection.

Amidst Covid-19 crisis, the BJP leaders as well as workers have started to strengthen the party from the grassroots level.     The BJP has taken the election in Mysuru district as an issue of pride and launched a campaign on Thursday. The leaders, led by District In-charge Minister S T Somashekar and BJP district (rural) president Mangala Somashekar, held a meeting of party workers at Shambudevanahalli and Mudukanapur, under T Narasipur Assembly segment on Thursday.

The state government has appointed administrators for the local bodies, for day to day functioning. However, as per the rules, elections have to be held within six months of appointing administrators. With an amendment to Section 5 of Karnataka Gram Swaraj and Panchayat Raj Act, the reservation rota is reduced to five years, from the earlier tenure of 10 years, said Somashekar. “Gram Panchayat elections are the polls of the party workers. It is the responsibility of the leaders, to ensure the victory of the workers. It is a chance for the leaders, to pay back the workers, who strive for the victory of leaders in bigger elections," he said. "The elections will be declared soon. A case is pending before the Karnataka High Court and the elections are likely to be declared soon after the court order is passed. The party leaders as well as workers need to be prepared for the election,” he said. Mangala Somashekar said the BJP should win a majority of the seats in Gram Panchayat elections. "Victory of the BJP workers in GP polls will help the BJP to win the next Assembly election," she said. Former MLA C Ramesh said, "Minister Somashekar is working to strengthen the party in the grassroots level, by visiting all taluks of Mysuru district." BJP leader Mahadevaiah said, "The party workers should work from the grassroots level. We can win Zilla Panchayat and Taluk Panchayat polls, if we win Gram Panchayat polls,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/bjp-is-preparing-for-gp-polls-911799.html

05-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Boy from Belagavi bylanes made it big in US biz, politics||Shri Thanedar, the Indian-born American entrepreneur and Democrat millionaire who has been elected to the House of Representatives in Michigan with 93% votes, has a Belagavi connection.  Thanedar, 65, scientist and businessman, raised a record-breaking $4,38,620, primarily from his own wealth in the state House primary against six other opponents. His campaign two years ago featured a heavy dose of ‘Shri for We’ television ads. He won from the 3rd District of Michigan with 93% of the total votes. He ran for governor two years ago.  He migrated to the United States from Belagavi in 1979 to obtain his PhD in polymer chemistry from the University of Akron (1982), after receiving a Masters Degree at the University of Bombay (1977). Thanedar worked as a post-doctoral scholar at the University of Michigan (1982-1984), then as a polymer synthesis chemist and project leader at the Petrolite Corporation in St Louis, Missouri (1984-1990). In 1990, Shri worked at and then purchased a three-employee service company called Chemir. Under Shri’s ownership, the company went from $1,50,000 in annual sales and three employees to $63 million in annual sales and over 400 employees, a trend that has followed him throughout his career. During his professional career, Shri purchased or sold eight different businesses. He is skilled in turning around troubled companies. Shri’s story began at Mirapur Galli, Shahpur suburb in Belagavi. Growing up as one of six children in a low-income family, he was taught about the importance of education and the need for financial independence. He was enrolled in the local public school system and excelled due, in large part, to the wisdom instilled in him by his mother Sulochana.  He had scored a meagre 55% marks in his SSLC from Chintamanrao High School and got a job at the age of 18 in a bank in Vijayapura. Thanedar wanted to do his degree. But the principal of the Dharwad college whom he approached did not allow him to do so. He had to go up to the vice-chancellor for the same and at last, he got permission. But the bank denied him leave for his exams for 15 days. He decided to leave Vijayapura and came to Dharwad for his exams. He slept for only one hour for eight days to prepare for his exams. Even before his exams got over, Thanedar got to know that he had been fired from his bank job.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/boy-from-belagavi-bylanes-made-it-big-in-us-biz-politics-911818.html

Shringla, who is on a seven-day trip to Europe to review bilateral relations and discuss matters of mutual interest with key European nations, was responding to a question on the recent border tensions with China in eastern Ladakh during an interview to a German news channel. "It has contributed to deterioration in terms of the ties between our two countries because of the unusual step of China to seek to unilaterally alter the status quo," Shringla told DW News. "You have to keep in mind that there is no common perception on the border but yet if you seek to change where the current line where troops are then of course it does impact on the larger relationship. We are concerned that China has taken this step,” he added. The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated following at least three attempts by Chinese soldiers to "intimidate" Indian troops along the northern and southern bank of Pangong lake area between August 29 and September 8 where even shots were fired in the air for the first time at the LAC in 45 years. "We are very, very clear that we will stand firm and resolute in our resolve not to allow our territorial integrity or sovereignty to be compromised," Shringla said. "We have not allowed any of this to take place. Our troops have stood resolute,” he said. “We will not compromise on our territorial integrity.” Responding to a question on the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad - comprising Japan, India, Australia and the US, Shringla said that it is a grouping of countries which have the same vision of a free, open and transparent Indo-Pacific region and international rules-based order, international freedom navigation in global commerce and also issues such as open connectivity, respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states. The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarising its man-made islands in the past few years. Beijing claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. But Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims. In the East China Sea, China has territorial disputes with Japan. The Quad works to bolster the capacities and the abilities of the countries in the Indo Pacific within a manner that’s both constructive and cooperative, Shringla added. Asked about Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s recent comments on India, Shringla said that it was an "attempt to distract international and domestic attention from its own problems." "I can only say that is ripe coming from the prime minister of a country that does not recognise the state of Israel, that until now does not acknowledge that the Holocaust took place, that has provided a safe sanctuary for Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar of the Taliban years after 9/11,” he said. “Considering his situation and Pakistan's own approach towards radicalism, terrorism and issues that are important to the international community, he (Khan) really shouldn't be making such irresponsible statements,” he added. On a question about the recent developments in Hong Kong, Shringla said, “We don't comment on what becomes the internal affairs of states. We have said that there is a large community of Indian origin, there is a large Indian community in Hong Kong, so we are watching the situation with some level of attention and concern and we will continue to do so.” Shringla travelled to Germany from France early this week on the second leg of his three-nation European tour that also includes the UK.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-will-not-compromise-on-its-territorial-integrity-harsh-vardhan-shringla-911421.html

The court gave the ruling late in the night. Goswami has filed for bail and the court has asked the investigation officer to file a reply, the journalist's lawyer Gaurav Parkar said. In the Alibaug court, police had sought a 14-day remand of Goswami, he said. Goswami (47), was picked up by a team of Raigad police from his Mumbai home earlier in the day. He was seen being pushed into the police van and claimed he was assaulted by police before being taken away. "Police arrested Goswami under sections 306 (abetment of suicide), and 34 (acts are done by persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code," a police official said. Soon after the vehicle carrying Goswami reached Alibaug, just over 90 km from Mumbai, he was produced in a local court, which directed police to take him to the civil hospital there for a medical check-up, after his lawyer alleged the senior journalist was assaulted by police. "Goswami was produced before a magistrate court in Alibaug where he complained of physical assault at the hands of the police team that barged into his house this morning, Parkar said. The magistrate took note of the allegations and directed the police to take Goswami to the civil hospital for a medical check-up. After the medical check-up, Goswami was brought back to the court for a hearing on his remand. The architect and his mother committed suicide in 2018 over alleged non-payment of dues by Republic TV, police said. In May this year, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh announced he has ordered a fresh probe in the case after a complaint by Adnya Naik, daughter of the architect Anvay Naik.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/arnab-goswami-remanded-to-judicial-custody-till-november-18-911427.html

The move by the DMA, headed by Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, is part of a series of reforms aimed at ensuring efficient use of resources and manpower, the officials said. As per the proposal, the retirement age of Colonels and equivalent rank in the Indian Army is sought to be increased to 57 years from the existing 54 years, the officials said. Similarly, the retirement age of Brigadiers in the Indian Army is proposed to be increased to 58 years from the existing 56 years, and in the case of Major Generals, it is proposed at 59 years as against 58 years at present. The same age bracket for retirement is proposed to be applied in equivalent ranks in the Indian Air Force and the Navy, the officials said. As per the proposal, the retirement age for personnel in logistics, medical, technical some other branches will be 57 years. According to the proposed pension disbursal plan, only those personnel completing over 35 years of service will be eligible for a full pension which comes to around 50 percent of the last drawn salary. Under the proposed slab, an officer with 20 to 25 years of service will get 50 percent of entitled pension while those having 26 to 30 years of service will receive 60 percent of entitled pension. The DMA has proposed that personnel with 31 to 35 years of service will get 75 percent of the entitled pension. A note issued by the DMA last month asked the forces to process the draft GSL (Government Sanction Letter) for the perusal of the Secretary of the DMA by November 10. Chief of Defence Staff Gen Rawat is also secretary of the DMA. The consistent rise in budget outlay for pensions of armed forces personnel has been an issue for the defence planners. A study was instituted earlier this year to analyse the feasibility of extending the retirement age of military personnel. The size of defence budget for 2020-21 was Rs 4.71 lakh crore out of which Rs 1.33 lakh crore was set aside for payment of pensions.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dma-proposes-increase-in-retirement-age-of-military-officers-cut-in-pension-911433.html
05-11-2020||National||India condemns Pakistan’s collusion in fostering radicalism, rabble-rousing||ndia on Wednesday reiterated its support for Europe and the international community against terrorism and blasted Pakistan for “clear collusion” in fostering a level of radicalism and rabble-rousing. Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, who is in London on the last leg of his three-nation European tour which included France and Germany, praised UK Home Secretary Priti Patel for her foresight in pre-emptively taking precautions and raising the UK’s terrorism alert level to “severe” in the wake of the attacks in France and Austria, as radicalism and terrorism knows no "borders or limits". “We are fully with Europe at this time of crisis. We believe the international community has to work together to address issues of radicalism and terrorism. Much of it comes from our own region,” said Shringla, in reference to cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan. “We also don’t believe that these are lone wolf attacks. There are organisations, groups and even countries that support this effort. We have seen the statement by Imran Khan, in which he says we have to teach the Western nations on how to deal with its minorities. This is rich coming from a theological state that has systematically eliminated its minorities over time,” he said. “So, this is something that has a clear collusion between countries like Pakistan, even Turkey, in fostering a level of radicalism, cynically manipulating public perception and outlook to create a sense of insecurity and basically indulge in rabble-rousing that could be to the detriment of countries like ours – democratic, secular, heterogeneous societies that have every respect for the interests of minorities. And, the countries that actually persecute their minorities are those that are today trying to tell us what to do,” he added. During an interaction with representatives of Indian and British media organisations, Shringla was also asked about the wider situation in its neighbourhood, including elections in Gilgit-Baltistan later this month and the situation in Afghanistan. He expressed India’s deep concern over the Afghan Taliban “systematically assassinating” moderate figures and leaders, backed up by “certain intelligence agencies” and condemned Pakistan’s “cynical use” of the country for its own ends. He said: “There are un-administered zones in Afghanistan now that have the presence of, not just Al Qaeda and Daesh, but also Hizbul Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Taiba – these are groups that normally operate in India but clearly they are being pushed into Afghanistan in order to say that they don’t exist in Pakistan. “This is Pakistan’s cynical use of Afghanistan for what they call strategic depth. We don’t believe that it is anyone’s interest to lose the gains of the last 19 years; gains in terms of the Afghan Constitution, the Afghan national security and defence forces, rights of women and minorities, everything that all of us have lost blood for," he said. “We have invested over USD 3 billion in stabilising Afghanistan and bringing peace and development and at this point of time, we see it all going downhill. Afghanistan is a matter of great concern,” he added. The Gilgit-Baltistan election he dismissed as Pakistan's attempt to “whitewash”, a move against which India has recorded a formal protest.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-condemns-pakistan-s-collusion-in-fostering-radicalism-rabble-rousing-911443.html

Madan Ghorai was arrested in Patashpur in Purba Medinipur district on September 26 in connection with a kidnapping case. He died on October 13. Accompanied by state BJP president Dilip Ghosh and senior BJP leaders, the family members of Ghorai met Shah at the Kolkata airport. They complained about the threats they were receiving and the apathy of the state government towards the family after they demanded a second autopsy of Ghorai, the BJP said. "Met with the family of our martyred Booth Vice President Madan Ghorai in Kolkata. I bow to his braveheart family. @BJP4India will always remain indebted to our karyakartas who have given their supreme sacrifice while fighting against atrocities and injustice in West Bengal," Shah said in a tweet after meeting the family. The Calcutta High Court had on Tuesday ordered that the second postmortem of Ghorai be conducted after he allegedly died in judicial custody "due to torture", as claimed by his brother. The bench directed that the postmortem be conducted by November 5 and its report be submitted to it on November 10. Ghorai was brought to a state-run hospital in Kolkata from a correctional home in Purba Medinipur district. The victim's elder brother had moved the high court for a second autopsy claiming that the first one was not properly conducted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/amit-shah-meets-family-members-of-bengal-bjp-worker-killed-in-judicial-custody-911445.html

According to data from the national transporter, over 2,225 freight rakes carrying vital commodities could not be operated till date due to the blockades caused by the protestors. Around 1,350 trains have been forced to be cancelled or diverted, it said. "Losses already expected to have crossed Rs 1,200 crore as agitators continued dharna at platforms/near railway track. Train movement had to be suspended due to operational and safety considerations as agitators have suddenly stopped some train movement and sporadic blockades continued at various places especially around Jandiala, Nabha, Talwandi Sabo and Bathinda," an official said. "Due to the continued blockages at sections of tracks in Punjab, there has been a major adverse impact on freight movement and on availability of vital commodities for farm, industrial and infrastructure sector as well," the official said. Later in a statement, the Railways said outward loading too has been affected from the Punjab area. Movement of foodgrain, container, automobile, cement, pet coke, fertilizer have also taken a hit, the statement said, adding the average loss of loading per day in Punjab was 40 rakes per day. "Running trains with protestors sitting on the tracks or close to it is a dangerous situation. Trains drivers find it extremely hazardous to run in such situations," it said. Earlier, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal had written to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh seeking assurance about safety of tracks and running staff to resume operations. The Punjab chief minister is scheduled to lead a 'dharna' of Congress MLAs at Rajghat in the national capital on Wednesday following President Ram Nath Kovind's refusal to meet a delegation led by him over the Centre's farm laws issue. The Punjab Chief Minister's Office had on October 21 sought an appointment for Singh and his delegation with the President to urge him to grant his assent to the state's farm bills passed last month by the assembly in a bid to negate the Centre's farm legislations. The farmers' agitation in Punjab began around September 24 when they started blocking railway tracks and stations demanding repeal of the three agriculture related bills. Farmers in Punjab have expressed apprehension that the Central farm reform laws would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/punjab-farm-protests-railways-incur-loss-to-the-tune-of-rs-1200-crore-911447.html

"The Trust invites pro bono suggestions that may be included in the masterplan, which is under preparation for the 70-acre Ram Mandir complex," it said in an advertisement issued in major national dailies. The Ram Mandir Trust has hired the leading construction company Larsen and Turbo for the construction of the Ram Mandir. Later, the Trust had also involved the experts and engineers of Tata Consulting and Engineering firm in the construction of the temple. The Trust has also sought expert suggestions from IIT-Roorkee and IIT-Madras regarding the Foundation of the temple. According to Trust members, they want to build such a grand and strong temple that it must last for at least 1,000 years and must resist all natural calamities. Dr Anil Mishra, a Trustee of the Ram Mandir Trust, told PTI, “The Ram Janambhoomi Tèerth Ksetra Trust has invited ideas from worldwide experts for their incorporation in the upcoming Ram temple’s masterplan. The suggestions should address the major elements of the project namely religious Yatra, rituals, culture and science, he added. Experts, architects and designers may submit their suggestion by 25 November on Trust’s emails – aida.rjbayodhya@gmail.com and design@tce.co.in," he said. During the three-day Deepotsav celebration, the general public will be kept out of the venue and only leading Hindu seers will be invited to participate in it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ram-mandir-trust-invites-designing-ideas-from-professionals-911498.html

Police had sought Goswami's custody for 14 days, but the court held that custodial interrogation was not required. On Wednesday night, Goswami was taken for medical examination at a state-run hospital in the coastal town, the official said. After the medical exam, he was taken to Alibaug Nagar Parishad School, which is designated as a Covid-19 centre of the Alibaug prison, and he spent the night there, the official said. Goswami and the two others were booked under section 306 (abetment of suicide) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC in connection with the suicide of architect-interior designer Anvay Naik and Naik's mother over alleged non-payment of dues by Republic TV. The other two arrested accused in the case, Feroze Mohammed Shaikh and Nitesh Sarda, were also produced in the Alibaug court on Wednesday and remanded to judicial custody till November 18. Naik, in his purported suicide note, had mentioned the names of Goswami, Shaikh and Sarda, police said, adding the note was sent to handwriting experts in Pune and a report is awaited. Hearing on Goswami's bail application will be on Thursday at Alibaug court, an official said. Goswami had on November 2 filed a petition in the Bombay High Court seeking to quash the FIR in the case. It will be heard by a division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik on Thursday. A team of Raigad police picked up Goswami (47) from his Lower Parel house in Mumbai on Wednesday morning. He was seen being pushed into the police van, and claimed that he was assaulted by police before being taken away. Goswami was produced in a court in Alibaug, around 90 km from Mumbai, and was remanded to judicial custody till November 18. The court ruling came shortly after 11 pm. Mumbai police have registered an FIR against Goswami, his wife, son and two others for "obstructing, assaulting, verbally abusing and intimidating" a police officer on duty and for tearing up "government papers" (arrest intimation) at his house, the official said. The FIR was registered at the N M Joshi Marg police station on Wednesday under sections 353, 504, 506 of IPC and section 3 of the Damage of Public Property Act, the official said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/arnab-goswami-spends-night-at-designated-covid-19-centre-for-alibaug-prison-911518.html
05-11-2020||National||BJP leader asks Attorney General to reconsider decision denying consent for contempt against Andhra CM Jaganmohan Reddy||BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay on Thursday asked Attorney General K K Venugopal to reconsider his decision declining consent to initiate criminal contempt against Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy and state advisor Ajeya Kallam over the allegations against judges. In response to a request for consent, Venugopal on Monday said it would not be appropriate for him to deal with the matter as the CJI (since Reddy's letter was addressed to him) had been seized of the matter, though he agreed that the timing of the letter was "suspect" and conduct of the persons was "contumacious". In a fresh letter, Upadhyay said, "The letter of Reddy to the Chief Justice was dated 6.10.2020 but sent to the CJI on 08.10.2020. This was a private missive with scurrilous contents. At this stage, it was left to the CJI alone to determine whether it constituted contempt. But, once Kallam on Reddy’s behalf called a press conference, read out a separate statement and released the letter to media and public on 10.10.2020, it ceased to be a private matter, and there was also an additional actor and an additional statement made." He said the Chief Justice of India was seized of a complaint by Reddy against the judiciary, not a complaint of contempt against him and his Advisor.  "It is unclear how the fact that Reddy’s complaint pending with the Chief Justice can preclude my right to initiate criminal contempt against him and Kallam. Even if such were the case, consent could be granted by you, and my petition would be tagged for hearing," he asserted. Referring to Section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, he said the import of the provision was only to have the judgment of the highest law officer precede a motion being made by any person to initiate criminal contempt proceedings through the application of mind to the content of the alleged contempt.  "Once a conclusion is drawn that the contempt is prima facie made out, it would be necessary for the consent to follow," he maintained. Under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, consent from the Attorney General or Solicitor General was required for initiating criminal contempt proceedings against anyone. Notably, the A-G had said "objectionable statements" were made in the October 6 letter of the CM to the CJI.  He had said the timing of the letter as well as the press conference was suspect in the background of an order passed by Justice N V Ramana on September 16 directing pending prosecution of elected representatives to be taken up and disposed of expeditiously. He also cited Upadhyay's letter to point out there were 31 criminal cases pending against the Chief Minister but he preferred to decline his nod for initiating the contempt proceedings.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-leader-asks-attorney-general-to-reconsider-decision-denying-consent-for-contempt-against-andhra-cm-jaganmohan-reddy-911540.html
05-11-2020||National||India sees spike of over 50,000 Covid-19 cases after 10 days; 704 deaths in 24 hours||After 12 days, India’s fresh Covid-19 count crossed the 50,000-mark once again on Thursday riding high on the recent surges seen in Kerala and Delhi. According to the official records maintained by the Union Health Ministry, there were 50,210 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours taking the tally to 83.64 lakh. The death toll stands at 124,315 including 704 new fatalities. It was on October 25 when the 50,000 barrier was reached last time. The majority of the new cases came from Kerala (8,516), which was witnessing a steady rise since the last month in the wake of the Onam festivities, and Delhi (6,842) that saw a new spike this week. While the health ministry data reflects the total cases recorded on Wednesday, the national capital maintained the same high growth on Thursday. At a review meeting with Delhi officials, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan expressed concern over the surge in the number of cases and the high positivity rate in the North, Central, North East, East, North West, and South East districts of Delhi. A major point of worry is a highly skewed RAT (rapid antigen test) to RT-PCR (gold standard test) ratio - 77% of the tests are RAT based while RT-PCR comprises only 23% of the total tests. While experts suggest using RAT for community surveillance because it misses nearly 50% of cases. In September, the Union Health Ministry had stated that nearly 56% of tests at the all India level are RT PCR while the rest is RAT. But it also pointed out the slippage by the states as many of them don’t follow the Indian Council of Medical Research protocol that calls for mandatory RT-PCR tests for each RAT negative. Noting that false-negative results might give way to complacency among the Covid-19 infected, Vardhan on Thursday pressed for mandatory testing of all RAT negative persons if they develop symptoms of influenza-like illness or severe acute respiratory infection.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-sees-spike-of-over-50000-covid-19-cases-after-10-days-704-deaths-in-24-hours-911544.html

In last month’s notification, the Maharashtra government had excluded all the private doctors for registration of priority list of vaccination. The IMA-Maharashtra had raised the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Health Minister Dr Harsha Vardhan, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and state Public Health Minister Rajesh Tope. “As a response to the unrest amongst the 2,50,000 doctors in Maharashtra, the state government has informed that all the doctors in the state will be included in the proposed Covid-19 vaccine database,” Dr Bhondwe said. According to him, the Covid-19 vaccine will be available to all citizens of India in the next three months. “The Government of India decided that the vaccine should first be given to all the doctors in the country, who treated the Covid-19 patients regardless of their own lives in the Coronavirus epidemic. It was also decided that the priority will be given to all medical professionals and healthcare workers. The Central government finalised to set up a database for this purpose and published a booklet of guidelines in this regard. This mentions the kind of doctors who will get the vaccination. This includes all government and private hospitals, government doctors, as well as all health workers in private clinics, day OPDs, polyclinics. The central government has planned to vaccinate all these health workers on a priority basis,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/private-doctors-on-maharashtras-covid-19-vaccine-priority-list-911545.html

A bench presided over by Justice Ashok Bhushan directed the Union government to issue necessary directions within a month without waiting for the 29th day of the month. The court passed its directions in a judgement delivered on a PIL by Gursimran Singh Narula, a final year student from Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law, IIT Kharagpur. In September, the Centre had told the court that it has not issued any guidelines for using and installing disinfection tunnels in an effort to contain Covid-19 pandemic. It had agreed that a direction could be issued to ban it. Spraying disinfectants, even outdoors, can be harmful to human health, it maintained. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that using disinfection tunnel was clinically and psychologically harmful.  The bench, also comprising Justices R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah, had then asked the law officer if it was bad then why the Centre had not banned it. To this, Mehta said appropriate directions and circular would be issued in this regard. In an affidavit, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said on June 9 that an expert committee meeting under the chairmanship of Directorate General of Health Services was held to review the use of disinfectant tunnels, use of various chemicals, spraying and its efficacy.  "It was reiterated that spraying of the individuals with the disinfectants, such as tunnels, cabinets and chambers etc is not recommended as it would not diminish the infected person's ability to spread the virus through droplets or contacts," it said. It is also not recommended in healthcare and non-healthcare settings. "If disinfectant was to be applied in indoor spaces, this should be done with a cloth or wipe that has been soaked in disinfectant," it said. The Union government said spraying and fumigation of outdoor spaces such as streets and marketplaces are also not recommended to kill Covid-19 virus or other pathogens because disinfectant is inactivated by dirt and debris.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-directs-centre-to-ban-covid-19-disinfection-tunnels-911559.html

SC asks Centre||The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Centre why no nationwide guidelines were put in place to do away with practice of pasting posters outside homes of Covid-19 patients. A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah asked advocate Kush Kalra, who filed the PIL for banning the practice which was in violation of rights to privacy and to live with dignity, to furnish a copy of petition with Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to enable him respond to it. The court pointed out the Delhi government already told the High Court that will not be putting posters outside Covid-19 patients' homes Kalra asked the court to quash the decision taken by various States and UTs and its authorities set up under the National Disaster Management Act, 2005 and the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 to affix posters outside residences of persons who are Covid-19 positive and are required to stay in home isolation. He also sought a direction that the names of Covid-19 patients were not circulated in WhatsApp group of Residents Welfare Associations. The petitioner claimed that the Covid-19 patients ought to be given privacy to cope with and recover from the illness in peace away from the prying eyes. He said the practice of pasting a notice outside the house of infected persons made them unnecessarily centre of attention. He also claimed it also desisted the general public from going for test to ascertain the affliction of the disease.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/why-no-nationwide-guidelines-against-affixing-posters-outside-houses-of-covid-19-patients-sc-asks-centre-911570.html

A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah posted the batch of pleas for hearing on November 18. Senior advocate Rajiv Dutta, appearing for lead-petitioner, Gajendra Sharma, submitted that he was extremely grateful to the Centre and the RBI for helping the borrowers. He said the individual borrowers were satisfied with government's pay-back scheme rolled out from November 5. He asked the court to dispose of his petition in wake of the affidavits by the RBI. Last month, the RBI informed the court that the Union government has come out with a scheme for grant of ex-gratia payment of difference between compound interest and simple interest for six months period of moratorium, to the borrowers in specified loan accounts. Under the scheme, borrowers of MEME, education, housing, consumer durables, credit card dues, automobile loans, personal loan to professionals, consumptions loans, with outstanding amount not exceeding Rs 2 crore, would be granted relief. The scheme would apply for the six-month period from March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020. On Thursday, the court was informed that Solicitor General Tushar Mehta was putting forth arguments in the central vista matter. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, however, asked the court to hear him relief for power producers. Senior advocate V Giri, appearing for the RBI sought lifting restriction on classifying loans as Non Performing Assets. The court allowed the parties to circulate short notes on the submissions before the next date of hearing.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-to-consider-matter-on-loan-moratorium-on-nov-18-911574.html
05-11-2020||National||India slams Pakistan's decision to transfer management of Kartarpur Sahib gurudwara to trust||India on Thursday called as "highly condemnable" Pakistan's decision to transfer the management of the Kartarpur Sahib gurudwara from a Sikh body to a separate trust, saying it runs against the religious sentiments of the Sikh community. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said India received representations from the Sikh community expressing grave concern over the decision to transfer the management and maintenance of the gurudwara from the Pakistan Sikh Gurudwara Prabhandhak Committee to the administrative control of the Evacuee Trust Property Board, a non-Sikh body. In November last year, the two countries threw open a corridor linking Dera Baba Sahib in Gurdaspur in India with Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan, in a historic people-to-people initiative. "We have seen reports about Pakistan transferring the management and maintenance of the Holy Gurudwara Kartarpur Sahib away from the Pakistan Sikh Gurudwara Prabhandhak Committee, a body run by the minority Sikh Community, to the administrative control of the Evacuee Trust Property Board, a non-Sikh body," the MEA said. "This unilateral decision by Pakistan is highly condemnable and runs against the spirit of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor as also the religious sentiments of the Sikh community at large," it said. The MEA said, the Sikh community, in its representations to India, expressed grave concern over the decision by Pakistan "targeting the rights" of the minority Sikh community in that country. "Such actions only expose the reality of the Pakistani government and its leadership’s tall claims of preserving and protecting the rights and welfare of the religious minority communities," the MEA said. "Pakistan is called upon to reverse its arbitrary decision to deprive the Sikh minority community its right to manage affairs of the Holy Gurudwara Kartarpur Sahib," it said. Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara is located in Pakistan's Narowal district across the river Ravi, about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine. It is the final resting place of Sikh faith's founder Guru Nanak Dev, who had spent the last 18 years of his life in Kartarpur. The Kartarpur corridor was thrown open in the midst of heightened tension between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue. The relations between the two countries nosedived after India scrapped Jammu and Kashmir's special status on August 5, 2019, and bifurcated it into two union territories.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-slams-pakistans-decision-to-transfer-management-of-kartarpur-sahib-gurudwara-to-trust-911578.html

A bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Milind Jadhav also asked the I&B Ministry to consider Gokhale's petition as a representation and place the inquiry report before the high court within three months. It disposed of Gokhale's plea, but granted him the liberty to approach the HC again if the inquiry was not initiated by the ministry. The HC also directed the ministry to pay Rs 25,000 to Gokhale as litigation expenses. Gokhale had also sought Rs 50 lakh as damages from the ministry. The HC, however, left the issue of damages to the civil court. The bench was hearing a plea filed by Gokhale seeking that his personal details be removed from the ministry's official website. He also sought in his plea before the Bombay HC that he be paid a compensation of Rs 50 lakh for the trauma he had to undergo after the ministry made his address and phone number public. As per Gokhale's plea, his details were displayed on the website in November 2019 and removed in September this year, after he wrote a letter to the ministry. The ministry's counsel, Rui Rodrigues, told the HC earlier that though the Department of Personnel and Training issued two communications in 2016, asking all government departments to refrain from displaying personal details of RTI applicants, the I&B Ministry had not received such communications at the time it made Gokhale's details public. On Thursday, Rodrigues informed the bench that the I&B Ministry had already initiated "disciplinary action". The bench noted that such action was initiated "on November 3, after the court reserved its order (on the plea)". During the previous hearing, the bench pulled up the I&B Ministry and asked why no one had looked into the issue of disclosure of details of applicants, besides Gokhale, in nearly 4,474 RTI applications since 2016. "The papers of this petition be placed before Secretary, Ministry I&B to conduct an inquiry into this issue of disclosing personal details of RTI applicants," the high court said in its order. "Inquiry should complete within three months, failing which petitioner has liberty to approach this court again," the court said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hc-asks-ib-ministry-to-probe-display-of-activists-details-on-website-911583.html

Commissioner of School Education V Chinna Veerabhadrudu said the figure is not alarming when compared to the number of students attending the schools, though every care is being taken to ensure Covid-19 safety protocols are in place in every institution. "Yesterday (November 4) around four lakh students attended schools. There were 262 positive cases. It is not even 0.1 per cent. It is not correct to say that they were affected due to their attendance to schools. We ensure that each school room has only 15 or 16 students," the official told PTI, adding "It is not alarming. As per the statistics provided by the department, there are 9.75 lakh students registered for Class 9 and 10 in the state out of which 3.93 lakh attended, out of 1.11 lakh teachers, over 99,000 thousand attended the educational institutions on Wednesday. Out of 1.11 lakh teachers, about 160 teachers tested positive, he added. "Lives of both students and teachers are important for us," he said. According to him, the attendance of students to schools was hovering about 40 per cent as parents are still apprehensive of the killer virus despite tight measures being taken by the government. Veerabhadrudu said poor students who could not afford online classes are the most affected ones if the schools were not open and it is quandary for girl students in tribal and rural areas as parents may indulge in child marriages if the teenagers stop going to schools. All government schools and colleges reopened from November 2 for classes 9, 10 and intermediate. Classes 9 and 10 and Intermediate first and second year would function on alternate days only for half-a-day. Classes 6, 7 and 8 would begin on November 23 while classes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 would start from December 14, an official statement said earlier. All the educational institutions have remained closed since March when the national lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 was announced.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/262-andhra-pradesh-students-test-covid-19-positive-after-schools-reopen-911605.html
05-11-2020||National||Delhi police busts massive job racket that duped 27,000 people||A youth's insistence on not losing Rs 500 to fraudsters has led the Delhi Police to unearth one of the "biggest fake job rackets" that allegedly duped over 27,000 people by offering government jobs through a fake website. The gang had sent around 15 lakh text messages with web links to fake jobs to targeted sections and is said to have collected Rs 1.09 crore in two months out of which they had withdrawn Rs 49 lakh. Five men, including the 50-year-old "mastermind" who runs an online examination centre from where he collected data of potential victims, were arrested by Delhi Police's Cyber Cell, Deputy Commissioner of Police Anyesh Roy told reporters. The arrested were identified as mastermind Ramdhari, account holder Surender Singh (50), web designers Sandeep (32) and Joginder Singh (35) and Amandeep Khatkari (27), who used to withdraw money collected from aspirants. Ramdhari's associate Vishnu Sharma is absconding. The gang was operating from Haryana's Hisar and had created a fake website in August this year of a fictitious entity -- Swasthya Avm Jan Kalyan Sansthan (SAJKS) -- under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The fake website was so convincing that some mainstream media reported the news of 13,000 job openings and this led to even more persons falling prey to the fraud, Roy said. Roy said the details in the websites were designed so that even an experienced person could not find it was fake. It had a graded registration fee for general and reservation category applicants. The gang allegedly used the data of aspirants appearing for online exams conducted by the government at the centre run by Ramdhari and Vishnu. Using this data, 15 lakh text messages were sent and around 27,000 people had registered with it. Roy said the data collected by the gang using the online exam centre could have been misused and they were investigating this aspect. The Cyber Cell jumped into action after one of the youths who submitted Rs 500 for a job found out that the website on which he registered was fake and there were no such job vacancies in the government. He filed a complaint following which the police took over the investigations. During investigations, the digital footprint of the website was captured and the money trail through a payment gateway was tracked. The gang was allegedly using multiple bogus accounts and digital identities to cover their track, Roy said. Police also found that Khatkari was withdrawing money through an ATM from the bank account linked to the website to distribute among the gang members and he was first caught, following which others landed in the net. In an advisory, Delhi Police urged people to apply due caution while applying for jobs through online portals and forums such as social media, instant messaging Apps and emails. "Genuineness of the website/company and its representatives should be checked from credible sources before applying for a job, or before accepting an invite for an interview, etc. Transfer of money for registration, etc., and other actions such as sending private/confidential details, should be done only after thorough check of the website/company’s credentials," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-police-busts-massive-job-racket-that-duped-27000-people-911640.html

"The vaccine has shown good efficacy," senior ICMR scientist Rajni Kant, who is also a member of its Covid-19 task force, said at the research body's New Delhi headquarters on Thursday. "It is expected that by the beginning of next year, February or March, something would be available." Bharat Biotech could not immediately be contacted. A launch in February would make Covaxin the first India-made vaccine to be rolled out. India's cases of coronavirus infections rose by 50,201 cases on Thursday to 8.36 million, second only to the United States. Deaths rose by 704, with the total now at 124,315. The daily rise in infections and deaths has slowed since a peak in mid-September. Kant, who is the head of ICMR's research management, policy, planning and coordination cell, said it was up to the health ministry to decide if Covaxin shots can be given to people even before the third-stage trials are over. "It has shown safety and efficacy in the phase 1 and 2 trials and in the animal studies - so it is safe but you can't be 100% sure unless the phase 3 trials are over," Kant said. "There may be some risk, if you are ready to take the risk, you can take the vaccine. If necessary, the government can think of giving the vaccine in an emergency situation." Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said in September the government was considering granting an emergency authorisation for a Covid-19 vaccine, particularly for the elderly and people in high-risk workplaces. Several leading vaccine candidates are already in final-stage testing. An experimental vaccine developed by Britain's AstraZeneca is among the most advanced ones, and Britain expects to roll it out in late December or early 2021. AstraZeneca has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world, including with the Serum Institute of India. Other late-stage vaccines are developed by Moderna Inc , Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE, and Johnson & Johnson.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-coronavirus-vaccine-covaxin-could-be-launched-as-early-as-february-2021-says-icmr-scientist-911642.html

After meeting a delegation of BJP leaders, Goyal tweeted that "The Railways is ready to begin operations in Punjab provided the state government gives us an assurance of safety of trains and clears tracks of protesters." The delegation included Union Civil Aviation Minister and BJP leader Hardeep Singh Puri, party national general secretary Tarun Chug, spokesperson R P Singh and Punjab unit president Ashwani Sharma met the Railway Minister and sought his intervention to resume railway services. In a letter to the railway minister, Sharma alleged the state is literally "under siege" of the Congress government which is playing politics over the issue. "We request immediate redressal by your office to take a undertaking from the state government for security and protection to start goods and passenger trains with immediate effect. The common man is reeling under great economic stress," he said. "The industry and commerce in the state have virtually shut down and the repercussions of this economic hit will break the backbone of the economy in the already depressed economic status of the state. Punjab's industry and commerce plays a pivotal role by providing jobs to a large segment of society," he said. He also said that fertiliser and pesticides shortage is becoming a huge problem for the agriculture sector. "This letter is to bring to your notice the dire circumstances being forced on Punjabis as the Congress government (in the state) is busy sponsoring the agitation in the name of farmers.... The Union minister is aware that it's the festive season and people of the state cannot travel due to non-plying of trains. It is pertinent to note that the national security has to be considered as the supplies to Jammu and Kashmir is not reaching due to the apathy of the state government," he said in his letter. Sharma also requested that the Punjab Chief Minister be immediately asked to give assurance that the railway blockades will be cleared and goods and passenger trains start with immediate effect. Train services have remained suspended for over a month in the state due to agitation by farmer groups against three farm sector laws passed by Parliament recently. The national transporter has said that it has already suffered losses due to this to the tune of Rs 1,200 crore as protesters blocked railway tracks and occupied stations. The three farm laws -- the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 -- were enacted recently. Farmers' bodies protesting against the laws have expressed apprehension that these would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporate entities. They demand that the laws be withdrawn. The Centre has asserted that these new laws will be beneficial for farmers and will increase their income.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/piyush-goyal-seeks-security-to-railway-properties-in-punjab-before-resuming-trains-911665.html

The release of the data, which comes amid an unprecedented impact on the economy when the gross domestic product (GDP) is set to contract by 10 per cent, did not spell out the revenues realised by the channels. The body attributed the strong surge in advertising to the ongoing festivities and big-ticket properties like the IPL for the volume growth. It said 38.7 million seconds of ad volumes was telecast on TV channels during the week, surpassing the previous high attained in 2015. In the immediate preceding week, the number stood at 37.9 million seconds, while comparing it on a weekly basis, it is higher than the 36.6 million seconds attained during the 43rd week of 2018, the body said. American e-commerce giant Amazom was the biggest brand that advertised during the week, followed by Dettol liquid and Surf Excel, the body said. From a companies perspective, FMCG major Hindustan Unilever led the pack, followed by Reckitt Benckiser and tobacco major ITC, the body said on its website.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-tv-channels-witness-highest-ever-ad-volumes-in-week-to-oct-30-barc-911688.html

Chief Judicial Magistrate Sunaina Pingle after perusal of the case diary and other relevant documents on Wednesday noted that the prosecution failed to prima facie establish a link between the deceased and the accused persons. The magistrate in a late Wednesday night order remanded Goswami and two other accused in judicial custody till November 18 in the case of suicide of interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother over alleged non-payment of dues by companies of the accused persons. "Taking into consideration the reasons behind the arrest of the accused persons and the arguments put forth by the accused persons, the arrest appears to be prima facie illegal," the court said. The magistrate noted that the chain of circumstances, the reason behind the deaths of Anvay Naik and his mother Kumodini Naik and its connection with the accused persons are not established by the prosecution. "There is no cogent evidence submitted that warrants this court to remand the arrested accused to police custody," the court said. A team of Raigad police picked up Goswami (47) from his residence at Lower Parel in Mumbai on Wednesday morning. Goswami and the two other accused -Feroze Shaikh and Nitesh Sarda - were later produced before magistrate Pingle in Raigad's Alibaug town, around 90 km from Mumbai, and were remanded in judicial custody till November 18. The court ruling came shortly after 11 pm. The magistrate in the order noted that if the police case is to be accepted that Anvay Naik took the drastic step of committing suicide due to non-payment of dues by Goswami and the two other accused, then the question arises as to why his (Anvay Naik's) mother Kumodini Naik committed suicide. "Did she (Kumodini) die by suicide? There is no clear answer to this by the prosecution. The police have been unable to establish a link between the deaths of Kumodini Naik and Anvay Naik and the three arrested accused," the court said. While refusing to remand the three accused in police custody, the court also noted that the police have not been able to specifically point out the so-called lacunae in the probe done by the previous police team in 2018 in the case. The magistrate in the order also said the case was investigated by the police in 2018 and an 'A' summary report seeking closure of the case was submitted before the court concerned in 2019. "The said closure report was accepted by the magistrate in 2019. Since then neither the prosecution nor the complainant challenged the closure report in the sessions court or High Court," the court said. The court further said the Alibaug police did not seek the magistrate's permission before reopening the case. "The investigating officer on October 15, 2020 only submitted a report to the magistrate informing that certain fresh material has come to the fore in the case. There is no record to show that the magistrate permitted reopening of the case," the court said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/arnab-goswamis-arrest-appears-to-be-prima-facie-illegal-court-911692.html

Shah, who is on a two-day visit to West Bengal before the 2021 state poll, said earlier in the day that he can sense massive public anger against the Mamata Banerjee government and the death knell of her regime has been sounded. Shah urged the people to give BJP a chance to form the next government in the state to fulfil their dream of "Sonar Bangla" (golden Bengal). "Union Home Minister Amit Shah is behaving like a BJP activist. He and his party should stop daydreaming about coming to power in West Bengal. Instead, he should concentrate on uniting his party in the state, which is a divided house," senior TMC leader and MP Sougato Roy said. "The people of Bengal are firmly behind Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee", he added. Echoing him, state minister Firhad Hakim mocked Shah's scheduled lunch at the house of a tribal family as nothing but a "poll gimmick" and a desperate attempt to divert attention from atrocities on tribals across the country. "Across the country in BJP ruled states, the tribals and the Dalits are being tortured. There are reports every day of atrocities against the backward communities by the BJP ruled state governments. "We have heard that Amit Shah is planning to have lunch with a tribal family in West Bengal. This is nothing but a poll gimmick ahead of the assembly election," Hakim said adding that tribals, dalits and the Matuas in the state are with the TMC. Accompanied by state BJP president Dilip Ghosh, party national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and its national vice-president Mukul Roy, Shah is on a day-long visit to the Bankura district. He is scheduled to hold organisational meetings in the district and also meet representatives of various communities and social groups. Shah is slated to have lunch at the house of a tribal family in the district.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/amit-shah-daydreaming-of-bjp-capturing-power-his-tribal-outreach-a-poll-gimmick-tmc-911696.html

The UGC has suggested a six-day schedule and directives to ensure that at any given time not more than 50% of the total students should be present at the college or the university. The guidelines also state that cultural activities and meetings may be avoided on campuses, but sports may be allowed in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Home Ministry. “Universities and colleges may plan opening the campuses in phases, with such activities where they can easily adhere to social distancing, use of face masks and other protective measures. This may include administrative offices, research laboratories and libraries etc,” the guidelines stated. It added that thereafter, students of all research programmes and post-graduate students in science & technology programmes may join as the number of such students was comparatively less and norms of physical distancing and preventive measures can be easily enforced. In hostels, sharing of rooms would not be permitted and symptomatic students will not be allowed to stay under any circumstances. The decision for reopening campuses of central universities and other centrally funded higher education institutions has been left to the respective Vice Chancellors and heads of institutions. However, for state universities and colleges, the respective state governments will have to take a call, the guidelines said. The guidelines also make it clear that the universities and colleges shall only be allowed to open if they are outside the containment zones. Students and staff living in containment zones will not be allowed to attend the colleges and they would also be advised against visiting such areas. The guidelines also encourage faculty, staff and students of the universities and colleges to download ‘Aarogya Setu App’. The Culture Ministry also issued guidelines for reopening of museums and art galleries from November 10. The standard operating procedures for museums include a ban on use of audio guides, unless they can be disinfected after every use. Visitors will be encouraged to keep their belongings in cars to avoid baggage checks at the entrance, while use of lifts would preferably be reserved for the elderly and physically challenged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/no-cultural-activities-meetings-at-universities-colleges-ugc-guidelines-911698.html

This is one of the highest numbers of homegrown pups of this breed that the force has received, they added. Since their introduction in India about a decade ago, 'Belgian Malinois' dogs have been extensively used by central security forces and police units in anti-Naxal operations and counter-terrorist tasks. These dogs first shot to international fame after they assisted US Navy SEALs in the 2011 operation that killed Osama bin Laden in his safe haven in Pakistan and were then famously called the 'Osama Hunters'. The parents of these pups born at the forces' National Training Centre for Dogs (NTCD) in Panchkula's Bhanu area are serving in the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP). Five-year-old sister dogs Olga and Oleshya are their mothers, and their father is Gala, who was recently deployed for security duties in Himachal Pradesh when Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Atal Tunnel at Rohtang, an ITBP officer said. Olga gave birth to nine pups, while Oleshya had eight between September 30 and October 4, he said. The two female dogs have served with ITBP units deployed for anti-Naxal operations in Chhattisgarh and have sniffed out numerous improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and saved lives of troops on patrol. These pups will be trained in infantry patrol and anti-terrorist roles, the officer said. He added that the ITBP may also hand over these trained four-legged soldiers to its various sister security forces as responsibilities in the internal security domain are growing. "These pups are genetically top class and from a very robust bloodline, imbibing the best genetic vigour from their mothers, who are fearless, agile and have superb olfactory capacity," ITBP Deputy Inspector General (Veterinary) Sudhakar Natarajan said. The ITBP, with about 90,000 personnel, is tasked with guarding the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control with China, apart from rendering a variety of internal security duties in the hinterland like anti-Maoist operations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indo-tibetan-border-police-gets-17-osama-hunter-pups-in-canine-squad-911702.html

Senior advocate Raj Panjawani and advocate Shibhani Ghosh, who have been appointed by the tribunal as amicus curiae in a case related to the ban on firecrackers, told a bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel that particulate air pollution contributed 15 per cent to Covid-19 mortality worldwide. The NGT was hearing a plea seeking a ban on firecrackers in the National Capital Region due to increased pollution and the rising number of Covid-19 cases. The NGT had already issued notice to the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and 18 state governments including Karnataka seeking their response on whether the use of firecrackers is banned from November 7 to 30 in the interest of public health and environment.  The Tribunal noted the Central Pollution Control Board report which said that 122 cities in the country air quality poor as of mid-August. After hearing, the NGT reserved the order and said it will pronounce on November 9. During arguments, amicus curiae referred to a study by Andrea Pozzer and others -- ''Regional and global contributions of air pollution to the risk of death from Covid-19'' -- and sought suspension of all licences issued by any authority for the sale of all kinds of firecrackers. If any person is found selling any kind of firecrackers would impliedly be an abettor to environmental pollution and liable for environmental damage of Rs 1 lakh. In the case of individuals found using or allowing the use of any kind of firecracker, the Hon'ble Tribunal may consider imposing a fine of not less than Rs 10,000, the amicus said. Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for Indian Fireworks Manufacturers'' Association, opposed the submission of a blanket ban on firecrackers and said that there is no definite finding and the apex court is already seized of the matter. Advocate Balendu Shekhar, appearing for the Environment Ministry, told the NGT that there is no conclusive finding on the relation of air pollution with Covid-19 mortality and they have written to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Earth Sciences seeking their opinion on the issue. Indian Social Responsibility Network filed a plea seeking action against pollution by use of firecrackers in NCR during the time air quality is unsatisfactory with the potential of severity of Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/air-pollution-increases-risk-of-mortality-from-covid-19-ngt-informed-911731.html

Just because some steel companies in Karnataka stand to benefit from coal transportation, does not mean people in the state should suffer," state Congress president Girish Chodankar has maintained.  Over 50,000 trees in and around Mollem have been slotted for felling for three central government projects. The projects have already been cleared by the National Wildlife Board for Wildlife in April this year. Activists and the Opposition parties fear that the projects are aimed at facilitating increased transportation of coal from Goa’s Mormugao Port Trust to the steel mills in Karnataka’s Bellary district and nearby areas.  Goa's Environment Minister Nilesh Cabral however said that the three projects had nothing to do with coal transportation and has given an assurance that the existing quantum of coal imports into Goa will not increase from the present 10-12 million tons, even after completion of the projects.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south-western-railway-postpones-controversial-project-in-goa-911742.html

The ministry had said last week that the Indian airlines can operate maximum 60 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic passenger flights till February 24 next year due to the prevailing coronavirus situation. In a press release on Thursday, the ministry said, "MOCA is monitoring traffic everyday, and it is expected that the traffic would further pickup because of the festival season and as passenger traffic increases, the upper cap would be revised to 70-75 per cent of normal capacity in the coming days." The MOCA said 2.05 lakh passengers travelled in domestic flights on November 1. The ministry had informed the airlines about the aforementioned 60 per cent limit through an official order on September 2 but it had not told them the period for which the cap would remain in place. Last Thursday, the ministry issued a new order clarifying that the September 2 order "shall remain in force until 2359 hrs on February 24, 2021 or until further orders" due to the "prevailing situation of Covid-19". The ministry had resumed domestic passenger services from May 25, after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. However, the airlines were allowed to operate not more than 33 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic flights. On June 26, this was increased to 45 per cent and on September 2, it was further increased to 60 per cent. Airlines are expecting that the government would further increase the cap on domestic flights so that they can soon reach their pre-Covid levels. For example, Vistara is expecting to operate 100 per cent of its pre-Covid domestic passenger flights by April next year, said its Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) Vinod Kannan on Wednesday. Currently, Vistara is operating around 55 per cent of its pre-Covid scheduled domestic passenger services. Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in the country since March 23 due to the pandemic. However, special international flights have been operating under the Vande Bharat Mission since May and under bilateral air bubble pacts signed with various countries since July.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/domestic-flights-cap-would-be-increased-to-70-75-of-pre-covid-levels-as-traffic-surges-govt-911762.html

Parliamentary panel on Data Protection Bill to Ola, Uber||Parliamentary panel on Thursday sought to know from the executives of cab aggregators Uber and Ola whether they have become transport companies with their own fleet and if surge pricing was determined by gender, time and battery power left in passenger's mobile. Cutting across party lines, members of the Joint Committee of Parliament on Data Protection Bill, 2019, questioned executives of both the companies about the fairness of algorithms, Chinese investment and flow of data, chairman of the panel Meenakshi Lekhi told PTI. "Members specifically asked about surge pricing and whether it is determined by gender, location, time and battery left in the mobile and is there any limit on surge pricing," she said adding the panel has sought written reply in an affidavit from both the cab aggregators. The companies were also asked about having their own cars run by drivers with fixed salary. Both acknowledged that besides being cab aggregators, they have their own cars as well, Lekhi said. She said, "Details have also been sought whether any preferential treatment is being given to their own cars by the companies as they will earn more by having more rides on these vehicles, and isn't it that both players have become a transport company rather than being a cab aggregator?" According to sources, at the meeting, Uber conveyed that they have around 4,000 cars. The cars will be handed over to drivers by the end of this year and Uber will remain only a cab aggregator, its executives informed the panel. Representatives of Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and Paytm have already deposed before the panel. While those of Ola, Uber and Airtel have been told to appear before the panel. The Personal Data Protection Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha by Union Minister of Electronics and Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad on December 11 last year. The bill seeks to provide protection to personal data of individuals as well as establishment of a data protection authority for the same. The proposed law seeks bar on storing and processing of personal data by entities without the explicit consent of an individual. The bill was later referred to the joint select committee of Parliament.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/is-surge-pricing-determined-by-gender-parliamentary-panel-on-data-protection-bill-to-ola-uber-911770.html

Gen Naravane was presented with a sword, insignia and a certificate of conferment order by the President during the ceremony at the President's official residence 'ShitalNiwas', according to a statement issued by the Nepal Army headquarters. Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, Indian Ambassador Vinay M Kwatra and other senior officials of both the countries attended the ceremony. The tradition, which started in 1950, reflects the strong ties between the two militaries. Gen K M Cariappa was the first Indian Army chief to be decorated with the title in 1950. In January last year, Nepali Army chief General Purna Chandra Thapa was also made the honorary General of the Indian Army by President Ram Nath Kovind at a ceremony in New Delhi. "This long-held tradition is emblematic of the close ties between the national armies of Nepal and India," the statement added. After the ceremony, Gen Naravane called on President Bhandari and conveyed his gratitude for the honour bestowed upon him. They also discussed measures to further enhance bilateral cooperation, the Indian Embassy said in a statement here. He was accompanied by Indian Ambassador Kwatra. Gen Naravane, who is currently in Kathmandu on a three-day visit, earlier in the day met his Nepalese counterpart Gen Thapa at the Chief of Army Staff’s office here and discussed measures to further bolster the existing bond of friendship and cooperation between the two armies. His visit is largely aimed at resetting the bilateral ties that came under severe strain following a bitter border row early this year. "They exchanged views on issues of bilateral interests and discussed measures to further strengthen the existing bond of friendship and cooperation between the two armies,” according to the Nepal Army headquarters’ press statement. He was also briefed about the history and current roles of the Nepali Army, according to the statement. He paid homage at the martyrs' memorial in the Army Pavilion and received a guard of honour in the Army Headquarters. He also planted a Pecan tree sapling in the Army Headquarter premise, keeping with the past tradition. India's decision to send the Army chief to Nepal to reset the ties is seen as part of a larger exercise by New Delhi to rejuvenate relations with Myanmar, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan in the wake of greater efforts by China to expand its influence in the region. Gen Naravane is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Oli, who is holding the defence portfolio, on Friday before wrapping up his visit.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/gen-mm-naravane-conferred-the-honorary-rank-of-general-of-nepali-army-by-president-bhandari-911783.html

The drill began on Tuesday and ended on Thursday and saw participation from three services components of the ANC, elements of Indian Army's Parachute Brigade, MARCOS (Marine Commando Force) and Special Forces, officials said. The exercise focussed on enhancing interoperability and synergy among the three services - Army, Navy and Air Force - to maximise combat potential, officials said. "The major training activities comprised combat free fall and para drop from   strategic lift aircraft C-130 by a company of Para Commandos from the mainland, action by MARCOS of Indian Navy and Special Heli Borne Operations (SHBO) by Indian Army Ghatak platoons," said an official. As part of the exercise, troops of the Army, Navy and Air Force of the ANC were mobilised for amphibious landing, in close coordination with the para drop (parachute drop) of Special Forces, the officials said. The exercise was conducted at Teressa island, which is located in the strategically important Nicobar group of islands, they stated. Ground based manoeuvres, tactics and procedures for joint operations in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were rehearsed, they added. In addition, search and rescue (SAR) and medical evacuation procedures were practised by participating troops, they mentioned. Lieutenant General Manoj Pande, Commander-in-Chief of the ANC, witnessed the exercise on the final day and addressed troops, complimenting them for achieving high standards of training and exhorting them to maintain the highest state of operational readiness at all times, according to the officials.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/andaman-and-nicobar-command-conducts-joint-services-exercise-911784.html

Connecting flights from international airlines to the mission flights have emerged as a problem, too. Here’s one recent instance: Stuck in Beijing, Manjunath Setty, a Bengalurean, endured weeks of waiting, unable to either attend his father’s funeral or comfort his family in person. Reason: Despite booking tickets, two reputed international airlines cited visa rules to refuse him boarding passes at the lastmoment. In a social media post, Setty narrated his ordeal: “Even as dad lost his battle with the coronavirus on Oct 1, I couldn’t even see him for the last time. And I’ve not been able to perform the last rites along with my brothers or comfort my mom or family back home, thanks to the two airlines.” He had traveled from Beijing to Shanghai only to be refused the boarding ticket by Hongkong Airlines on October 11 “because I was taking multiple flights to Singapore, and I had no visa to travel to Singapore”. Canceling the tickets, he booked again. “This time I booked a direct flight to Singapore on a Singapore Airlines flight for October 12. But they refused the boarding ticket because I wasn’t flying to India on a single carrier. I was to fly to Singapore on a Singapore Airlines flight and then take a Vande Bharat repatriation flight to Trichy. Still, they had a problem.” Setty showed them his father’s death certificate and all the onward flight tickets, but the airline concerned was not convinced. “They refused to issue the boarding pass and I had to cancel all the tickets once again,” he recalled. He had to wait another two weeks to finally make it to India. Since the launch of the Vande Bharat Mission on May 7, 2020, Air India has flown over one million passengers covering 74 destinations in 54 countries. In all, it operated about 7,800 flights under the mission and Air Transport Bubble arrangements combined. Air India says this is one of the biggest evacuation exercises by any civil airline in the world. A further 1,600 flights are planned till December 2020. The airline is set to launch flights to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia later this month under the Air Bubble system.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/air-india-crosses-1-million-vande-bharat-passengers-911805.html

Elections are scheduled to be held in 78 Assembly constituencies in the final phase on Saturday. At least 30 Assembly seats have a significant Muslim population which has traditionally favoured the RJD and Congress. Congress leaders believe that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s decision to dump the RJD-JD(U)-Congress Grand Alliance, which had come to power in 2015 and join hands with the BJP has rendered him unpopular in the region. Congress leaders believe that Owaisi’s oratory and mass appeal could dent its prospects and end up benefiting the BJP which is yearning to turn up a better count in the results that are scheduled to be announced on Tuesday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-targets-aimims-owaisi-as-seemanchal-votes-on-nov-6-911827.html

The Chinese embassy in New Delhi on Thursday said that China has decided to temporarily suspend the entry into the country by foreign nationals from India holding valid visas or residence permits in view of the coronavirus pandemic. The embassy said the "suspension" is a temporary measure that China has to adopt to deal with the current pandemic. "China will make further adjustment and announcement in accordance with the ongoing pandemic situation in a timely manner," it said. The notice affected the plans by about 2,000 Indian professionals and their families who have been trying hard to return to back to their work and businesses. Their hopes were brightened recently when China lifted the ban on the visas and resident permits which encouraged many of them to finalise plans to return. India announced early this week plans to operate Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) flights to China from Delhi on November 13, 20, 27 and December 4 to facilitate their return. Officials here said the flights now stand cancelled as a result of China’s move to suspend visas. Chinese embassies in the UK and the Philippines have made similar announcements. India has so far operated six VBM flights and the last one operated in Delhi-Wuhan sector. Twenty-three passengers on that flight tested positive including 19 of them for asymptomatic symptoms. Asked for the reason for the sudden action, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing here on Thursday that “the notices issued by the Chinese embassies in the relevant countries have made it clear that this is a temporary response necessitated by the current situation of COVID-19”. "Learning from other countries' practices and taking into consideration the evolving epidemic situation, we have adjusted measures concerning pertinent travellers to China," he said. "This is a reasonable and legitimate move consistent with international customary practices, and I believe it will be understood by all. The Chinese embassies in relevant countries will publish timely notices in accordance with the evolving situation," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/vande-bharat-mission-flights-to-china-cancelled-as-beijing-suspends-visas-for-indians-911836.html
05-11-2020||National||HC refuses to grant interim relief to Arnab Goswami in suicide abetment case; dist court says arrest 'prime facie illegal'||High-profile TV journalist Arnab Goswami will spend a second night in a makeshift prison at a school after the Bombay High Court on Thursday refused to grant interim relief in a 2018 suicide abetment case even as a district court while sending him to two-week judicial custody a day earlier observed his arrest "appears to be prima facie illegal". The plea by Goswami, 47, for interim bail was posted by the high court for hearing on Friday. Goswami was arrested on Wednesday morning by Raigad police from his residence at Lower Parel in Mumbai for allegedly abetting the suicide of architect and interior designer Anvay Naik, and was taken to the Alibaug police station in neighbouring Raigad district. Alibaug, a coastal town, is around 90 km from Mumbai. After being remanded in judicial custody late on Wednesday night, Goswami spent the night at the Alibaug Nagar Parishad School, which has been designated as a Covid-19 centre for the Alibaug prison, an official said. Two others were arrested along wih Arnab. The arrest triggered a political slugfest between the BJP on the one side and the Congress and the Shiv Sena on the other. The Sena is heading the coalition government in Maharashtra that included the Congress and the NCP. The Raigad Police, meaanwhile, filed a revision application before the Alibaug sessions court, challenging the order passed by the magistrate. It had sought police remand for 14 days. Alibaug Chief Judicial Magistrate Sunaina Pingle after perusal of the case diary and other relevant documents had noted that the prosecution failed to prima facie establish a link between the deceased and the accused persons, according to the detailed order made available to the lawyers in the case on Thursday. "Taking into consideration the reasons behind the arrest of the accused persons and the arguments put forth by the accused persons, the arrest appears to be prima facie illegal," the magistrate said while remanding them in judicial custody till November 18. Goswami moved the high court against the "illegal arrest", sought a stay to the investigation and a direction to the police to release him. He also sought that the FIR against him be quashed. A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik directed Goswami to make the complainant in the case, Akshata Naik, Anvay's wife, a respondent to his plea. "We have to hear all the parties concerned before considering the interim relief sought. We have to also hear the complainant as the family of the deceased has filed a petition here seeking transfer of the probe," the bench said. "The respondents (the Maharashtra government and the complainant) are entitled to respond....We will consider the interim relief sought tomorrow," it added. Senior counsel Aabad Ponda, appearing for Goswami, said a bail plea filed before the Alibaug magistrate's court has since been withdrawn. "The magistrate had not given clarity on when the bail plea would be heard and had also expressed difficultly in hearing the same as the case lies in the jurisdiction of the sessions court. "Hence, we are seeking for interim bail here in high court," Ponda said. Senior counsel Harish Salve, also appearing for Goswami, argued that no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution if he was released on bail. The court, however, said it cannot consider the issue of bail without giving the respondents a chance to argue. Ponda also argued that the police have resurrected a dead case in which a closure report had been filed and accepted by the Chief Judicial Magistrate at Alibaug in Raigad district by an order dated April 16, 2019. The petition also alleged that Goswami and his son were assaulted by the police team when it arrested the journalist in a "motivated, false and closed case". "This is another attempt of political witch-hunt and vendetta politics against the petitioner and his channel," it alleged. A case that was "decisively closed" was reopened for forcibly arresting the petitioner "in a prima facie act of revenge and vengeance for his news coverage", it said. It claimed that in May 2018, the police had recorded the statements of Goswami and two senior officials of Republic TV, and he had also provided documents to the police about the business transactions with Naik's company. Goswami's company ARG Outlier had paid over 90 per cent of the amount due to Naik's firm Concorde Designs as per the contract, it claimed. "In July 2019, the entire balance amount due was transferred to the bank account of Naik's company but the amount returned because the account was inoperative," it said. In the order, CJM Pingle also noted that the chain of circumstances, the reason behind the deaths of Anvay Naik and his mother Kumodini Naik and its connection with the accused persons are not established by the prosecution. "There is no cogent evidence submitted that warrants this court to remand the arrested accused to police custody," the magistrate had said, The magistrate had also noted that if the police case is to be accepted that Anvay Naik took the drastic step of committing suicide due to non-payment of dues by Goswami and the two other accused, then the question arises as to why his (Anvay Naik's) mother Kumodini Naik committed suicide. "Did she (Kumodini) die by suicide? There is no clear answer to this by the prosecution. The police have been unable to establish a link between the deaths of Kumodini Naik and Anvay Naik and the three arrested accused," the court said. While refusing to remand the three accused in police custody, the magistrate had also noted that the police have not been able to specifically point out the so-called lacunae in the probe done by the previous police team in 2018. The magistrate had also said the case was investigated by the police in 2018 and an 'A' summary report seeking closure of the case was submitted before the court concerned in 2019.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hc-refuses-to-grant-interim-relief-to-arnab-goswami-in-suicide-abetment-case-dist-court-says-arrest-prime-facie-illegal-911841.html
05-11-2020||National||US elections: Uncertainty in Washington worries India||Even as the Americans are anxiously waiting for the results of the presidential elections, the US Navy’s missile destroyer John S McCain is engaged in a drill with the warships of India, Australia and Japan in the Bay of Bengal. The Malabar 2020 exercise is being tacitly projected by India, Australia, Japan and the US as a sign of strategic convergence among the ‘Quad’ nations to contain China in the Indo-Pacific region. Though President Trump claimed support of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian-American community ahead of the elections, New Delhi is not concerned over the possibility of him leaving the White House and his rival Joe Biden taking over on January 20. What, however, the Modi government is a bit worried about is the possibility of the dispute over the election results resulting in impasse and uncertainty as well as lack of attention on external engagements, including ties with India. New Delhi has been pointing out ahead of the elections that India-America ties have been enjoying bipartisan support. Trump accused Biden of being soft on China. But Biden and his aides argued in favour of taking a tough stand on China, not only on trade issues but also on human rights violations in Tibet and Xinjiang as well as on crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. India, however, already took into account the possibility that the US rhetoric against China may not be as shrill post election, no matter if Trump gets a second term, or has to make way for Biden. That is why New Delhi was not keen to support the Trump administration’s proposal to give a formal structure to the ‘Quad’ and turn it into a Nato-like bloc. Some lawmakers of the Democratic Party criticised the Modi government last year and early this year on the alleged violation of human rights in J&K as well as on issues like the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens in northeastern states of Assam. New Delhi, however, is of the view that such criticism would not come in the way of strengthening India-US relations, even if a Democrat president takes the Oval Office in the White House for the next four years. The Indian embassy has already reached out to the key aides of Biden as well as his Indian-American running mate Kamala Harris.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/us-elections-uncertainty-in-washington-worries-india-911842.html

Shiv Sena criticises BJP's reaction on Arnab Goswami's arrest||The Shiv Sena on Thursday slammed the BJP for describing the arrest of Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami in an abetment to suicide case as "black day" and an "attack on the freedom of press". An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said it was surprising that central ministers along with state BJP leaders should say there was an "Emergency-like situation" in Maharashtra due to Goswami's arrest. Goswami was arrested by police on Wednesday from his residence in Mumbai for allegedly abetting the suicide of interior designer Anvay Naik. Goswami and two others were booked under Indian Penal Code sections 306 (abetment of suicide) and 34 (common intention) in connection with the suicide of Naik and the latter's mother over alleged non-payment of dues by the Republic TV. The editorial in Saamana alleged that the previous state government "covered up" Naik's suicide case to protect Goswami. It further claimed that a journalist was arrested in Gujarat for writing against the state government, while in Uttar Pradesh, journalists have been killed. "Nobody felt these incidents were reminders of the Emergency. In fact, the state BJP leaders should demand justice for Anvay Naik, a son of the soil," the editorial said. "An innocent man died by suicide along with his aged mother. The dead man's wife is demanding justice and the police are following the law," it said. "Where is the question of the fourth pillar (of democracy) being attacked? Those who are saying this are attempting to trample the first pillar," the editorial said. Everyone including prime ministers are equal before the law of the land, it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/how-is-democracy-being-attacked-shiv-sena-criticises-bjps-reaction-on-arnab-goswamis-arrest-911556.html

He also said that the BJP would form the government in the state with a two-thirds majority. “The way the Mamata Banerjee government is resorting to coercive measures, especially against BJP workers, I am sure that the death knell of her government has rung. There will be a BJP government in Bengal with a two-thirds majority,” Shah said. Speaking to journalists at Bankura district, ahead of an organisational meeting in Bankura Shah, he also said that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was making a big mistake if she thinks that she could stop BJP in Bengal by blocking Central schemes in the state. “I want to tell Mamata Didi that if you think that you can stop BJP by blocking these schemes, you are making a big mistake. If you let the annual grant of Rs 6,000 for the poor sent by the Narendra Modi government, the health benefits provided by the Centre and toilets reach the people, then they may consider supporting you a bit,” Shah said. Accusing the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government of not allowing the benefits of Central schemes reach the people of Bengal, Shah said that there was “massive public outrage” against the state government, and hope and respect for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “It shows that “parivartan” (change) in Bengal can only be ushered in under the leadership of Narendra Modi,” said Shah. “The facilities and aids provided by the Modi government for the poverty-stricken people of Bengal are not reaching them. For instance, neither the fund provided for tribals for building houses have reached them nor are farmers getting the Central aid of Rs 6000 annually. Poor families are also not getting the health insurance (under the Ayushman Bharat scheme) of Rs 5 lakh,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/amit-shah-sounds-poll-bugle-says-death-knell-for-mamatas-govt-has-rung-911569.html

A part of the Madhepura Lok Sabha seat, Bihariganj will go to polls in the third and last phase on November 7. Subhashini has chosen her father's tested turf of Madhepura to jump into the rough and tumble of politics. Sharad Yadav, a veteran socialist leader, has represented Madhepura in Parliament four times and has also lost from there many times, including in the last two Lok Sabha elections. Though a native of Madhya Pradesh, Yadav chose Madhepura Lok Sabha constituency to fight elections as a mark of respect to B P Mandal, the author of the Mandal Commission report who was born here. The Mandal Commission report, providing 27 per cent reservation in government jobs to Other Backward Classes, was implemented by the V P Singh government at the centre in which Yadav was a senior member. Yadav along with RJD president Lalu Prasad and incumbent Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had played an important role in the "Mandal movement" that paved the way for the implementation of the jobs quota recommendations in 1990. The 73-year-old Yadav is admitted to a hospital in Delhi for past many days and hence his daughter has taken up the task to carry forward his political legacy. Her election posters in the constituency introduce her as Subhashini ‘Sharad Yadav’. “This has been my father Sharad Yadav’s karmabhoomi and the kind of support and love that you have given him over the past 25-30 years, I too can feel the same here today,” she told an election at Bihariganj on Wednesday. “I am your candidate, your daughter. I have come here to serve you, to fulfil the dreams of my father,” she told the crowd. The rally was also addressed by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi who praised Sharad Yadav for his works and asked the crowd to vote for her. “I have not said this in any of my speeches in Bihar elections,” he told the crowd as he appealed them to vote for his “sister”. “I want a guarantee from you that you will make Sharad ji’s daughter win the election. I am not asking for myself, but for you and Sharad Yadav ji, who is your leader. ” Married to a Congress family of Haryana, Subhashini Raj Rao joined the grand old party on the eve of Bihar polls and was fielded by the party from Bihariganj assembly seat. Though Madhepura seat would have been an ideal launchpad for her, the Congress had to settle for Bihariganj as in the seat-sharing arrangement Madhepura went to the RJD, which has re-nominated its old hand Chandrasekhar. In her maiden electoral plunge, Subhashini is pitted against two times JD(U) MLA Niranjan Mehta, Lok Janshakti Party candidate Vijay Kumar Singh and Prabhash Kumar of Janadhikar Party (JAP), which is headed by former Madhepura MP and a prominent Yadav caste politician Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav. There are a total of 22 candidates on the seat and as per the voter list of 2019, there is 3,00,885 electorate in this constituency. Dinesh Chandra Yadav of the (JD-U) had won from Madhepura seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, defeating Sharad Yadav, who had contested from the RJD of Lalu Prasad. Though Yadavs form a bulk of the electors in the constituency, there is a significant presence of other backward castes such as Kushwahas and Extremely Backward Castes. Sitting MLA Niranjan Mehta, a Kushwaha by caste could lose a section of votes to fellow casteman and LJP nominee Vijay Kumar Singh. Subhasini's path also does not look very easy. JAP candidate Prabhash Kumar, a Yadav by caste who was once a favourite of Lalu Prasad and had served as the state general secretary of the RJD, left the party after the seat went to the Congress and joined Pappu Yadav-led outfit. As such, Subhasini might not get the full support of the dominant partner party, the RJD. Sources in the political circles say that local Grand Alliance coalition leaders and workers are not happy over an “outsider” being fielded as a "parachute candidate" The recent electoral history of the constituency is also not very encouraging for the grand old party. The Congress had not contested the last state polls since the seat had gone to the JD(U), which was then its ally alongside the RJD, but in 2010 elections, Congress nominee Ranjeet Ranjan, the wife of Pappu Yadav, had stood third. The LJP candidate's wife Renu Kushwaha had won the Bihariganj seat as a JD(U) candidate in 2010, bagging 79,062 votes while Ranjeet Ranjan had received 27,554. Prabhash Kumar, then in the RJD, had stood second with 29,065 cotes. Subhashini’s main JD(U) rival is relying on Nitish Kumar's development mantra and also highlighting the “poor” governance and law and order situation in the state under the RJD’s 15-year rule. Nitish Kumar, while campaigning for his party nominee recently, refrained from speaking anything against Sharad Yadav, his former party colleague, and Subhashini. Locals are divided in their appraisals of the government and the opposition. Tej Narain Yadav, Raj Kumar Yadav, Ram Chandra Sah and Sunil Kumar gave pass mark to the JD(U), happy with the development work carried out by the Nitish Kumar government. However, others highlighted joblessness and what they perceived as corruption under the NDA government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/for-subhashini-raj-rao-protecting-father-sharad-yadavs-turf-legacy-an-uphill-task-on-poll-debut-911626.html

She, however, did not take the name of the BJP-led central government while also alleging that its agencies are conducting raids in various parts of the state without informing the local authorities. The Trinamool Congress supremo asked the Centre not to cross the "Lakshman rekha" and maintain Constitutional obligations. "If police officers are not listening (to the central government), they are being threatened that they will be booked under IT or vigilance cases or their wives will be transferred. We have not seen such politics. "I am assuring the IAS and IPS officers in this state not to worry about this. As you are serving the state, the state government is also ready to provide you service," Banerjee told at an administrative review meeting at the state secretariat. She said that IPS officer Rajiv Kumar's wife was transferred to an interior area of Punjab, when he was the police commissioner of Kolkata. "There were several others who were transferred," she claimed and added that if required, she will highlight it nationally to let the country know about the Centre's "plan to torture her officers. The chief minister alleged that central government agencies are conducting raids in several places of the state without informing the local authorities, violating Constitutional obligations. "On a day when the home minister has gone to Bankura to attend an invitation, the CRPF is conducting raids in three districts without informing the local police. What a plan!" she said. Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who is on a two-day tour to the state, was in Bankura during the day to take stock of the party's organisation in the district. The assembly election is likely to be held in the state in April-May next year. Banerjee also slammed Shah for his "ukhad ke phenk do" (uproot and throw away) remark, asking the people of West Bengal to unseat the TMC from power. "I can understand what 'Ukhad ke phenk do' means. I have a good knowledge of Hindi. So, in response, if I say the same thing, will that be good? Let good sense prevail before Diwali," she said. Officers of the state are doing "good work during this Covid-19 pandemic", but the Centre has "severely criticised" West Bengal, though it is mum on Kerala, where 10,000 new cases of infection are reported every day, the chief minister claimed. Without naming the BJP, Banerjee said that one political party is organising rallies violating Covid-19 pandemic safety norms and without police permission, and the disease is spreading. "I will urge them not to spread the disease. We will get time to indulge in politics.

Shah, who visited Bankura during the day to take stock of the party organisation, asked BJP functionaries to take a vow to work hard so that achieves the target, the sources said. During a closed-door meeting with the party leaders, he said the state party unit has to put up an intense fight against the ruling TMC to come to power in Bengal. "Earlier in the day Amit Shahji had said the party would come to power with a two-thirds majority. During the closed-door meet he told us that Bengal assembly election is of immense importance to BJP and we need to ensure that the party comes to power with 200 seats in the 2021 assembly polls," a state BJP leader said. The BJP presently has eight MLAs in the state. It also has the support of eight TMC MLAs who switched to the saffron party after the 2019 general elections. Sources in the party said Shah asked the BJP workers to speak of the pro-people policies of the Centre and the misrule and anti-people policies of the Mamata Banerjee government in the state. "He asked us to tell the people of West Bengal how they are being deprived of the central schemes meant for them as the TMC government has not allowed them to be implemented in West Bengal. We have been told to tell the people about the misrule of the TMC regime in the state," another BJP leader said. Shah had told newsmen earlier in the day that he could "sense massive public anger" against the Mamata Banerjee government in West Bengal and the "death knell of her regime has been sounded." Exuding confidence on forming the next government with a two-third majority, Shah urged the people to give BJP a chance to form the next government in the state to fulfil their dream of "Sonar Bangla" (Golden Bengal). Shah, who had played a major role in expanding the party base during his tenure as BJP national president, had set a target of winning 22 seats out of the 42 Lok Sabha in the 2019 parliamentary polls. The party had bagged 18 seats, four less than ruling TMC, with a vote share of 40.5 per cent. Apart from holding an organisational meeting, he also met representatives of various communities and social groups at Bankura, which falls within the tribal Jangalmahal area. It is one of the districts where BJP made deep inroads in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and bagged both the parliamentary seats there. Shah is on a two-day tour to the state to take stock of BJP's preparedness ahead of 2021 assembly polls. Reacting to Shah setting the target of 200 seats in the assembly polls, TMC leader and MP Sougata Roy said "It is laughable that a party which does not have a face in Bengal to counter the popularity of Mamata Banerjee has set a target of 200 seats. It seems he is unaware of the ground realities and is daydreaming. The BJP will be defeated". The saffron party after having a limited presence in the politically polarised state for decades has emerged as the main rival of the TMC in the last few years. With the BJP's strength increasing in the state in the last few years, where it has never been in power, its leaders are upbeat that the party will end the TMC's 10-year-long rule in the assembly polls scheduled in April-May 2021.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/amit-shah-sets-target-of-200-seats-for-2021-west-bengal-polls-911789.html

A Varanasi resident Sudhir Singh has made the plea to unseat Ansari under the provisions of the Article 190 (4) of the Constitution. Singh has made the plea through his counsel Asok Pande. Mafia-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, who is an MLA from Mau Sadar, is presently lodged in a Punjab jail. Identifying himself as the president of Mafia Virodhi Manch, Singh, in his petition to the Assembly Speaker, cited Article 190 (4) of the Constitution which provides that “if a member of any House of a state legislature fails to attend the House proceedings for 60 days without its permission, the House may declare his seat vacant.” The petitioner said Mukhtar Ansari has neither attended nor participated in the sittings of the House, held from time to time since the present Assembly started its sittings in 2017." He has not even sought any permission to be absent from the House for such a long period, the petitioner said. Singh said he is accordingly approaching the UP Assembly speaker to seek Ansari's disqualification from being the member of the House as per the provisions of the Article 190 (4) of the Constitution. The petitioner also claimed that he is willing to contest the election from Mau Sadar assembly seat after it is declared vacant and fresh election is notified by the Election Commission.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/varanasi-resident-moves-up-assembly-to-unseat-mukhtar-ansari-on-absenteeism-911494.html
05-11-2020||North and Central||Haze chokes Delhi, pollution levels highest since November last year||A layer of haze lingered over the national capital and its suburbs on Thursday morning, with raging farm fires and a fall in the wind speed and temperatures pushing air quality to the worst levels in around a year. As the skies hung heavy and acrid over the region, people complained of itchy throat and watery eyes.  Experts said unfavourable meteorological conditions -- calm winds and low temperatures -- and smoke from farm fires in neighbouring states led to a dense layer of haze on Wednesday night as the air quality index entered the "severe" zone. PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 561 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 8 am -- the highest since November 15 last year, when it was 637 µg/m3, according to CPCB data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India. PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometres which is inhalable. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.  The levels of PM2, finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream, were 347 µg/m3. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.  On Wednesday evening, the noxious haze reduced visibility to merely 600 metres at the Safdarjung Observatory, smudging landmarks from view. It was 1,200 metres on Thursday morning. If this was not enough, a large number of people across Delhi-NCR burst firecrackers to mark the festival of Karwa Chauth. "People are bursting crackers and it is not even Diwali yet. The city has already become a gas chamber. This happens every year. For how long will this continue," asked Shiv Shrivastava, a resident of south Delhi. "I can feel the pollutants in my throat despite wearing a mask. My eyes are burning. It is going to make the pandemic worse. I am scared," said Piyush Vohra, a resident of Jangpura. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum wind speed was 5 kilometres per hour on Thursday morning and the minimum temperature 11.2 degrees Celsius. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. According to a doctor at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, intake of every 22 micrograms per cubic metre of polluted air is equivalent to smoking a cigarette. Ajit Jain, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, said air pollution was turning the pandemic catastrophic. IMD officials said sudden change in the wind pattern led to "subsidence" -- the downward movement of air over a large area when it cools and becomes heavier. "The wind speed slowed down suddenly after 10 am in the Delhi-NCR region. The temperatures have dipped alarmingly over the last few days," V K Soni, the head of IMD's environment monitoring research centre, said. The haze was primarily smoke from stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana. Unfavourable meteorological conditions trapped it in Delhi-NCR, he said. Delhi recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 461 at 8 am. It was 279 at 10 am on Wednesday.  All the 36 monitoring stations recorded the air quality in the ''severe'' category. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (431), Ghaziabad (484), Greater Noida (463), Gurugram (440) and Noida (461) also recorded ''severe'' levels of air pollution. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". Stubble burning accounted for 40 per cent of Delhi''s pollution on Sunday, the maximum so far this season. Last year, the farm fire contribution to Delhi's pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/haze-chokes-delhi-pollution-levels-highest-since-november-last-year-911520.html

05-11-2020||North and Central||Stubble burning contributes 42% to Delhi's pollution, season's highest||The share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution rose to 42 per cent on Thursday, the maximum so far this season, according to a central government air quality monitoring agency. Experts said raging farm fires and a fall in the wind speed and temperatures pushed air quality in Delhi-NCR to the worst levels in around a year on Thursday. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the farm fire count in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and neighbouring areas increased significantly and stood at 4,135 on Wednesday, the highest this season so far. SAFAR said the boundary layer wind direction is northwesterly – favourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires. "The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was estimated at 42 per cent for Thursday," it said. Stubble burning accounted for five per cent of Delhi's pollution on Wednesday, 10 per cent on Tuesday, 16 on Monday and 40 on Sunday. Last year, the stubble contribution to Delhi's pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data. NASA's satellite imagery showed a large, dense cluster of fire dots covering Punjab and parts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.  SAFAR predicted conducive conditions for dispersion of pollutants over the next two days. "Better dispersion condition and not so low daytime boundary layer height is predicted for the next two days which is likely to improve AQI unless more than estimated fire-related emission takes place," it said. PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 561 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 10 am -- the highest since November 15 last year, when it was 637 µg/m3, according to CPCB data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India. PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers and is inhalable.

05-11-2020||North and Central||Farmers in Punjab, Haryana block roads as part of nationwide protest against farm laws||Farmers in Punjab and Haryana on Thursday put up road blockades at many places as part of a nationwide 'chakka jam' agitation in protest against three central farm laws, and demanded that these be withdrawn. The call for the nationwide 'chakka jam' from 12 noon to 4 pm was given by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee. Protesting farmers owing allegiance to over 40 outfits blocked state and national highways at several places, causing inconvenience to commuters. Though police authorities diverted traffic at many places, commuters faced traffic snarls. Farmers slammed the BJP-led government at the Centre for bringing the "black laws" and expressed fear that these legislations would destroy the farming community and would only "benefit" big corporate houses. Punjab farmer organisations also lashed out at the Centre for suspending goods trains in the state that has affected supply of coal, fertiliser and other essential items. Farmers squatted on roads, including major highways and state highways, at around 200 places in Punjab and Haryana, All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee member Jagmohan Singh claimed. Police said the road blockades passed off peacefully. Movement of ambulances and vehicles carrying essential items, including LPG and petrol, was not disrupted. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said they have put up road blockades at 35 places, including Sangrur, Bathinda, Mansa, Barnala, Patiala, Ludhiana, in Punjab as part of the 'chakka jam' protest. Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said their members blocked roads at 45 places in 10 districts of Punjab. Earlier in the day, BKU (Charuni) president Gurnam Singh said they planned to hold protests at around 20 places in Haryana, including Karnal, Rohtak, Kaithal, Jind, Hisar and Fatehabad. A protesting farmer in Bathinda said the Narendra Modi government wanted to "defame and derail" farmers' protest by suspending goods trains in the state. The Railways has suspended the operation of freight trains in the wake of blockade of some rail tracks by farmers in protest against the three central farm laws. Protests were also held at the Sirsa-Mansa border road and the Jind-Sangrur, the Nilokheri, the Delhi-Barnala and the Narnaul-Kaithal highways in Haryana. The farmers' organisations are set to hold a joint meeting in Chandigarh on November 18 to chalk the course of action to move towards Delhi on November 26 and 27. The groups protesting against the three central farm laws have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporate entities. They demanded that these be withdrawn. The three farm laws -- the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 -- were enacted recently. The Centre has asserted that these new laws will be beneficial for farmers and will increase their income.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-in-punjab-haryana-block-roads-as-part-of-nationwide-protest-against-farm-laws-911582.html

In a letter to Goyal on behalf of the group, Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma alleged the state is literally "under siege" of the Congress government which is playing politics over the issue. "We request immediate redressal by your august office to take a undertaking from the state government for security and protection to start goods and passenger trains with immediate effect. The common man is reeling under great economic stress," he said. "The industry and commerce in the state have virtually shut down and the repercussions of this economic hit will break the backbone of the economy in the already depressed economic status of the state. Punjab's industry and commerce plays a pivotal role by providing jobs to a large segment of society," he said. He also said that fertiliser and pesticides shortage is becoming a huge problem for the agriculture sector. "This letter is to bring to your notice the dire circumstances being forced on Punjabis as the Congress government (in the state) is busy sponsoring the agitation in the name of farmers... The Union minister is aware that it's festive season and people of the state cannot travel due to non-plying of trains. It is pertinent to note that the national security has to be considered as the supplies to Jammu and Kashmir is not reaching due to the apathy of the state government,” he said in his letter. Sharma also requested that the Punjab Chief Minister be immediately asked to give assurance that the railway blockades will be cleared and goods and passenger trains start with immediate effect. Train services have remained suspended for over a month in the state due to agitation by farmer groups against three farm-related laws passed by Parliament recently. The national transporter has said that it has already suffered losses due to this is to the tune of Rs 1,200 crore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/punjab-bjp-delegation-seeks-railway-ministers-intervention-to-resume-train-services-in-state-911596.html

As per an order issued by J&K government, the transit accommodation comprising 1680 units shall come at an estimated cost of Rs 201.6 crore at Marhama-Bijbehara (Anantnag), Wandhama-Lar (Ganderbal), Fatehpora (Baramulla), Allowpora-Keegam (Shopian), Odina-Sumbal (Bandipora) and Khullangam Bagh (Kupwara). The highest of these units – at 480 – would come up in Bandipora, followed by 336 in Baramulla, 288 in Kupwara and 192 each in rest of the three districts. The government has also constituted a committee to resolve all matters pertaining to the identification and transfer of land to the department of Relief, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction by November 15. More than 255 Kashmiri Pandits have joined government service in J&K since a special package was announced for the displaced community by the Centre in November 2015. Under the package additional 3000 government jobs and construction of transit accommodations in Kashmir for the Kashmiri migrants have to be provided. On September 24, J&K Administrative Council headed by the lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha had approved re-allocation of nearly 2,000 posts for Kashmiri Pandits who want to settle in the Valley. This reallocation is part of the 3,000 posts announced in 2015. Providing jobs to displaced people from Valley is being done under a two pronged strategy by the government. Besides, providing a livelihood to a displaced family, the government wants to provide the chance to displaced families to link it to their roots. Nearly two lakh Pandits left their ancestral homes in 1990 and migrated to Jammu and other parts of the country when a bloody insurgency broke out in Kashmir in 1990.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jk-govt-to-construct-transit-camps-for-migrant-kashmiri-pandit-employees-911618.html

The defence minister also said that India attaches importance to peaceful resolution of differences through dialogue and is committed to respect various agreements inked for maintenance of peace along the borders. "However, India is determined to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of unilateralism and aggression," he said, in an address at a virtual seminar organised by the National Defence College. Singh said India is a peace-loving country and it believes that differences should not become disputes. The standoff between India and China began on May 6 and has significantly strained their ties. Both sides held a series of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the row. However, no breakthrough has been achieved to end the standoff. The eighth round of Corps Commander-level talks between India and China is likely to take place on Friday. In his address, the defence minister also talked about efforts being made to enhance India's military prowess as well as to boost domestic defence production. "Peace can only be ensured through the ability to deter war; we have attempted to build deterrence through capability development and indigenisation," Singh said. On Pakistan, the defence minister said it continues to be "adamant" in use of terrorism as a state policy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/india-determined-to-protect-its-sovereignty-territorial-integrity-against-chinas-aggression-says-rajnath-singh-911636.html

These rural women were growing inbred rice, a self-pollinated home-grown rice, in a traditional way. Now, they are trained to grow hybrid seeds even by using the Direct Seed Rice (DSR) technique. Now, they have become ambassadors of early adopters of the new technology and advocating the same in their villages to have a multiplier effect, thereby creating demand and market for hybrid seeds and crop protection products. Corteva Agriscience Marketing Director (South Asia) Aruna Rachakonda told PTI, "These woman farmers, after the training, have sown hybrid paddy seeds in about 10,000 acres in the current Kharif season of 2020-21." In fact, there have been about 15-20 per cent rise in the acreage under hybrid paddy from the previous kharif season when the company first rolled out the training programme. "We worked on two hybrid paddy seeds 27P37 and 27P31 in these two states (Bihar and Jharkhand). We have received good response," she said adding that Corteva had launched hybrid paddy seed 27P37 four years ago, while the other one seven years ago in India. The company first made a technological intervention by introducing to women farmers hybrid paddy seeds, she said. She added that growing hybrids is different from inbred rice, as it requires training in proper transplantation technique, agronomical practices and post-transplantation care. The second technological intervention was introducing them to the Direct Seed Rice (DSR) technique with hybrid seeds which is basically Corteva's technology, she said. The Corteva's DSR technology has three components -- transplanting hybrids, weed management and sowing service. "DSR was introduced this kharif season to these women farmers. It cannot be just broadcast but has to be sown in a certain way with the help of a machine. " Further, Rachakonda said that about 20 per cent of 90,000 women farmers have now been trained in the DSR technology, which the company is promoting in a structured and sustainable format. "In India, we are promoting with a mechanical sowing machine, which is tractor mounted. We specify how many seeds required for an acreage. "That's the training we give. If you train 100 farmers, 40 of them will not get it right in the first instance. It is quite a strenuous and structured training," she added. In Bihar and Jharkhand, woman farmers are being trained separately for a period of three years. The company is holding similar training programmes in other rice-growing belts of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana where both man and woman farmers are being trained. Rachakonda said these training programmes are part of the business strategy and the aim is to create an environment very much receptive of hybrid seeds and sell more weed control chemicals. "There is a lot of cultural change that we need to bring to the farmers' mind. It does not happen with a blink of an eye. In one season, you will not find transformation," she said. Rachakonda added that besides the commercial interest, the company through these programmes wants to promote community development with a focus on "sustainability as a shared value". Companies are vying for a huge potential market of hybrid seeds in India, which still cultivates inbred seeds in about 95 per cent of the country's total paddy area of around 45 million hectare. Inbred paddy seeds are self-pollinated seeds that can be saved and used for the next few years unlike hybrids.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hybrid-rice-corteva-slowly-making-inroads-into-bihar-jharkhand-trains-90000-woman-farmers-911641.html

The CBI, who was assigned to the case by the Uttar Pradesh CM earlier, quizzed members of the victim's family several times in the past few days besides the other suspects. The brother of the victim was quizzed by the CBI on Wednesday. ''The CBI asked me why I had killed my sister,'' the brother of the victim said during an interaction with some civil rights activists, who had met the family members at their home in Hathras district after the CBI questioning. ''I told them (CBI officers) that I would not have taken my sister to the police station if I had tried to kill her. We could have killed her at home,'' he added. The brother of the victim also reminded the CBI that the teen had named those who had perpetrated the crime. The girl, who belongs to a Scheduled Caste community, had been brutally assaulted by four youths and died in the hospital. The family members alleged that she was gang-raped. The police had apparently held her family hostage and cremated the victim's body at midnight. All the four accused were arrested The police claimed that the postmortem report and forensic examination of the Hathras victim did not confirm ''rape or gang rape' and that she had died due to injury on her neck. The incident triggered a massive outrage with the opposition leaders targeting chief minister Yogi Adityanath for failing to ensure the safety of the womenfolk in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/cbi-suspects-hathras-rape-victims-brother-killed-her-family-now-under-radar-911668.html

"All higher education, medical education and research and technical education institutions, including all universities and colleges, in areas outside containment zones in the state would be allowed to re-open from November 16," the spokesperson said. He said all these institutions should strictly observe the standard operating procedures to be framed by their respective administrative departments in consultation with the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Punjab and the ministry concerned of the central government. Earlier, the Punjab government had given permission to open higher education institutions for research scholars (Ph.D.) and post-graduate students in science and technology streams requiring laboratories/experimental works in areas outside containment zones after October 15.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/universities-colleges-to-reopen-in-punjab-from-november-16-911677.html
05-11-2020||North and Central||Mayawati heading towards 'mahagirawat' from 'mahamilawat': UP Deputy CM||BSP supremo Mayawati is heading towards a sharp decline ('mahagirawat') after having been part of a 'mahamilawat' (adulterated) anti-BJP alliance and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav's dream of returning to power in 2022 will remain just a dream, Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said on Thursday targeting the two opposition parties. Maurya said his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) doesn't need the support of Mayawati who has been "losing her base" since 2014. "Mayawati is heading towards 'mahagirawat' from 'mahamilawat'," he said, referring to the alliance between the SP, the BSP and the RLD in the 2019 parliamentary elections. "Her fluctuating statements are a sign of her 'mahagirawat' and 'ghabrahat' (nervousness). Giving statements and changing them is her habit," Maurya told PTI-Bhasha in an interview. Maurya was asked about Mayawati's statement that she could support any party, including BJP, in the legislative council elections to defeat the Samajwadi Party (SP) and then asserting that she would rather retire from politics instead of allying with the BJP. On the Samajwadi Party's 'Mission 2022' to regain power in the state, the Deputy CM said, "I know that people have voted for BJP (in the recent bypolls). Akhilesh Yadav is dreaming (of forming government in 2022) and it will remain so. Even if the SP, BSP and the Congress contest together, their dream (of defeating the BJP) will not be fulfilled." Rejecting the Samajwadi Party's charge of misuse of government machinery in the by-elections, Maurya said, "One views others as one's own self. The hooliganism under the SP regime has not been forgotten by the people of the state. How his ministers used to harass people by abusing power is also not hidden from anyone." "Akhilesh has vision impairment and needs treatment to correct his vision," he added. On the death of a Dalit woman following assault and alleged gang rape by some upper caste men in Hathras and another such case in Balrampur, Maurya said the government would not tolerate such crimes and criminals at all. "It has been seen by all that whenever such an incident happened, immediate action was taken irrespective of caste and religion (of the people involved). A criminal can no longer seek protection due to the clear intention of the government." The death of the Dalit woman from Hathras and her subsequent cremation in the dead of the night, reportedly without the consent of the family, triggered a nationwide outrage. On the stance taken by Congress General Secretary and Uttar Pradesh in-charge Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on the Hathras case, Maurya said, "He (Rahul Gandhi) was dreaming of taking oath as Prime Minister in 2019 but people showed him reality. I always call Priyanka Vadra as Twitter Vadra. Her politics is no more than this. In UP, the Congress politics is no more than photo opportunity." Asked about a BJP MLA backing a party leader accused of shooting a man dead at a meeting attended by police and officials, he said the government took "the sternest action and gave a message about how the criminal should be treated". "The BJP national president took note of the MLA's activity and the party has given notice to the MLA on the matter. This matter is with the (party) disciplinary committee," he added. Replying to a question, the former BJP state president said the opposition parties are only doing politics to weaken the BJP at the Centre, but they will be disappointed. On the claims of repeating the BJP's success of the 2017 polls in the next election, Maurya said, "The governments of the Centre and in the state have fulfilled the promises made to the people. The BJP is stronger than the organisation of opposition. Sixty per cent of votes are ours, the rest is divided (among opposition)." "No party will be in a position to stand against the BJP for the next 25 years," he claimed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/mayawati-heading-towards-mahagirawat-from-mahamilawat-up-deputy-cm-911694.html
05-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi government bans firecrackers ahead of Diwali as Covid-19 cases surge||Delhiites will not be allowed to burst crackers during Diwali with the Arvind Kejriwal government on Thursday deciding to ban firecrackers between November 7 and 30 due to rising Covid-19 cases and pollution in the national capital. The announcement was made by Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal on Twitter after a review meeting of Covid-19 in the capital, which has witnessed a huge surge in daily cases of virus infection, with the Chief Secretary, Health Department officials and District Magistrates (DMs). Delhi has become the third state to ban the bursting of crackers due to rise in Covid-19 cases. Rajasthan and Odisha have already taken the decision to ban crackers. Kejriwal said Covid-19 cases have increased in Delhi due to the ongoing festival season and pollution. It was decided to "1. Ban crackers in Delhi 2. Ramp up medical infrastructure, oxygen and ICU beds are being increased in Delhi government hospitals", he tweeted. He also said the Delhi High Court has stayed the government's order to increase ICU beds in private hospitals following which the latter has filed an appeal in the Supreme Court on Wednesday. "We hope the Supreme Court will lift the stay keeping in view the critical situation," he said. The Chief Minister said the meeting also decided for targeted testing and that all steps should be taken to ensure that fatality rate does not increase. The decision to ban bursting crackers came hours after Kejriwal himself appealed to Delhiites to celebrate Diwali without burning crackers. "If we burn crackers, we will be playing with the health of our children and our family. We are arranging for something different for Diwali this year," he said. He said Delhi is facing trouble with Covid-19 and pollution this year and the state government is making all efforts to deal with it. "The situation of Covid-19 is deteriorating due to pollution. Every year, the smoke from stubble burning causes pollution in Delhi. This has been continuing for many years now, but no state government has provided any effective solution to the problem of stubble burning," he said. He said pollution is at its peak right now...Last year, we had vowed to not burn crackers on Diwali...We will celebrate Diwali together this year as well, without burning crackers. If we burn crackers, we will be playing with the health of our children and our family. We are arranging for something different for Diwali this year," he added. He also said that he along with his Cabinet colleagues will perform 'Lakshmi Puja' on November 14 on the occasion of Diwali, which will be telecast live from some TV channels. "I wish to appeal to my brothers and sisters in Delhi to join in the puja celebrations. I believe that when the people of Delhi will perform Lakshmi Puja from their homes at the same time, celebrating the coming back of Lord Rama after 14 years of vanvaas, celebrating the coming of Lakshmi, it will generate a very positive atmosphere and good vibes in Delhi. I believe it will be good for the people of Delhi, it will be for the good of every family," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-government-bans-firecrackers-ahead-of-diwali-as-covid-19-cases-surge-911703.html
05-11-2020||North and Central||Mehbooba Mufti shown black flags at Jammu Airport during protests against her tricolour remark||PDP president Mehbooba Mufti was shown black flags at the Jammu Airport on Thursday by local Shiv Sena and Rashtriya Bajrang Dal activists protesting against her remarks on the national flag. The activists asked the former chief minister to go back and threatened to disrupt law and order here if she was allowed to carry forward her Gupkar Agenda in Jammu. Led by youth leaders Rakesh Kumar and Manish Kumar, the Shiv Sena Sena and Rashtriya Bajrang Dal activists blocked the road on the Jammu Airport and showed black flags on her arrival. However, police later cleared the road to facilitate passage of Mufti. Amid chants of 'Mehbooba Mufti Hai Hai' and 'Mehbooba go back', the activists, including women, appealed to Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha not to allow the meeting of the Gupkar alliance in Jammu on November 7. Jammu and Kashmir's mainstream political parties, including the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party, formed the Gupkar alliance on October 15 for restoration of special status of the erstwhile state and also to initiate a dialogue between all the stakeholders on the issue. "We will not allow it to happen. We will go there and hold protests. No anti-India meeting will be held on the soil of Jammu," Shiv Sena leader Manish Kumar told reporters. Mufti's visit to Jammu can disturb the law and order situation and it is up to the government to take a call to ensure no meeting takes place here, he said. Rashtriya Bajrang Dal head Rakesh Kumar also said they will not allow the meeting of the Gupkar Alliance to take place in Jammu. "She has come here today with the Gupkar Agenda. We will not allow it here. We warn all those who will take part in their Gupkar agenda," Kumar said. He hit out at Mufti for her remarks on the national flag. "We have protested against her with black flags. We have shown her black flags because she has always insulted the tricolour and also the law or land," he added. Protests were staged outside the PDP office last month after Mufti said she was not interested in contesting elections or holding the tricolour till the constitutional changes enforced on August 5 last year are rolled back. Following the PDP chief's statements, the BJP had accused her of making "seditious remarks" and had demanded her arrest.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/mehbooba-mufti-shown-black-flags-at-jammu-airport-during-protests-against-her-tricolour-remark-911741.html
05-11-2020||North and Central||Punjab govt assured us all blockades will be removed by October 6: Rail Board chairman||Amid farmers protests in Punjab against farm laws, Railway Board Chairman V K Yadav on Thursday said that the Punjab government has assured the railways that all blockades on rail premises by protesters will be cleared by Friday morning. Of the 31 blockades, 14 were removed by Thursday evening, he said. Yadav also said that a joint team of state officials as well as the RPF have been formed to conduct ground surveys in order to ascertain if it was safe to run trains. "We have been assured by the Punjab government that all blockades will be removed by Friday morning. Fourteen of 31 blockades have been removed on Thursday. Our maintenance teams are ready, as soon as tracks are under rail control, we will run trains," he said. Train services in Punjab have been suspended since September 24 due to farmers' protests over the three farm bills passed in Parliament. While it had resumed for a few days in October, it was suspended again due to concerns over the safety and security of train crew members. Earlier in the day a delegation of Punjab BJP leaders met Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and urged to sought his intervention to start the train operation. "We request immediate redressal by your august office to take an undertaking from the state government for security and protection to start goods and passenger trains with immediate effect. The common man is reeling under great economic stress," the delegation said in its memorandum to the Minister. The national transporter said that it has already suffered losses of around Rs 1,200 crore and in several places protestors blocked railway tracks and occupied stations. The three farm laws -- the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 -- were enacted recently. Farmers' bodies protesting against the laws have expressed apprehension that these would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporate entities. They demanded that the laws be withdrawn. The Centre has asserted that these new laws will be beneficial for farmers and will increase their income.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/punjab-govt-assured-us-all-blockades-will-be-removed-by-october-6-rail-board-chairman-911750.html
05-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality dips to worst level since December last year||Delhi's air quality on Thursday dropped to its worst level since December last year, with farm fires accounting for 42 per cent of its pollution, the maximum in this season so far, according to data from central government agencies. Experts said unfavourable meteorological conditions -- calm winds and low temperatures -- and smoke from farm fires in neighbouring states led to a dense layer of haze on Wednesday night as the air quality index entered the 'severe' zone. The haze thinned on Thursday with higher wind speed helping in dispersion of pollutants. However, the 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 450, the highest since December 30 last year, when it was 446. All the 36 monitoring stations in Delhi recorded air quality in the 'severe' category. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Gurgaon and Noida also recorded 'severe' air pollution. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 563 microgram per cubic metre (µg/m3) at 10 am, the highest since November 15 last year, when it was 637 µg/m3. It came down to 497 µg/m3 by 5 pm, according to CPCB data. PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers and can get into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India. The level of PM2.5 -- finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream -- were 360 µg/m3 at 12 noon. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe. The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the farm fire count in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and neighbouring areas increased significantly and stood at 4,135 on Wednesday, the highest in this season so far. SAFAR said the boundary layer wind direction was northwesterly, favourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires. It predicted conducive conditions for dispersion of pollutants over the next two days. "The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was estimated at 42 per cent on Thursday,” it said. "Better dispersion condition and not so low daytime boundary layer height is predicted for the next two days which is likely to improve AQI unless more than estimated fire-related emission takes place." Stubble burning accounted for five per cent of Delhi's pollution on Wednesday, 10 per cent on Tuesday, 16 per cent on Monday and 40 per cent on Sunday. Last year, the stubble contribution to Delhi's pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data. On Wednesday evening, the noxious haze reduced visibility to merely 600 metres at the Safdarjung Observatory, smudging landmarks from view. It was 1,200 metres on Thursday morning. On top of that, a large number of people across Delhi-NCR burst firecrackers to mark the Karwa Chauth festival. "People are bursting crackers, it is not even Diwali yet. The city has already become a gas chamber. This happens every year. For how long will this continue?" asked Shiv Shrivastava, a resident of south Delhi. "I can feel the pollutants in my throat despite wearing a mask. My eyes are burning. It is going to make the pandemic worse. I am scared," said Piyush Vohra, a resident of Jangpura. Health experts said during the Covid-19 pandemic, air pollution has become a serious health concern for about the two crore residents of the national capital. According to a doctor at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, intake of every 22 micrograms per cubic metre of polluted air is equivalent to smoking a cigarette. Ajit Jain, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, said air pollution was turning the pandemic catastrophic. IMD officials said sudden change in the wind pattern on Wednesday had led to "subsidence", the downward movement of air over a large area when it cools and becomes heavier. "The wind speed slowed down suddenly in the Delhi-NCR region. The temperatures have dipped alarmingly over the last few days," V K Soni, the head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said. The haze was primarily smoke from stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana. Unfavourable meteorological conditions trapped it in Delhi-NCR, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-dips-to-worst-level-since-december-last-year-911792.html

The PAGD was formed by seven political parties last month to fight for the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status revoked by the Center last August. Reports said as soon as Mehbooba came out of the airport at Satwari, Jammu, the activists of Rashtriya Bajrang Dal and Shiv Sena staged a protest demonstration while showing her black flags. However, a strong contingent of police personnel restricted the movement of the protesters and escorted Mehbooba safely out of the airport. “We are protesting against the arrival of Mehbooba Mufti in Jammu. It is the land of martyrs and we will not allow her to step on this land. The Gupkar Agenda will not be allowed to flourish in Jammu,” Rakesh Sharma, president of Bajrang Dal, who was leading the protest, said. He vowed to oppose Jammu based leaders who will become part of Gupkar Alliance. “Those who do not accept our constitution and flag, we will not allow such people,” Sharma added. Shiv Sena leaders protesting the arrival of Mehbooba said the PDP president should apologise for her recent remarks on tri-colour. Sources said during her stay in Jammu, Mehbooba will attend a meeting of the PAGD scheduled to be held on Saturday at National Conference president and another former chief minister Farooq Abdullah’s residence. “Mehbooba will also hold informal meetings with the PDP leaders in Jammu where the threadbare discussion will be held on the political scenario post-August 2019, especially after new land laws were notified,” they said. A PAGD delegation is also expected to meet Jammu based leaders and the prominent people in Jammu city. Another delegation of PAGD on Friday last visited Drass and Kargil in Ladakh under former chief minister Omar Abdullah’s leadership and vowed to fight for the restoration of the special status and Jammu and Kashmir’s unification.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/amid-protests-mehbooba-arrives-in-jammu-to-attend-pagd-meet-911800.html

The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to review the preparedness along with a need for advanced planning to deal with the spread of coronavirus. "In the meeting, it was also decided to augment the bed capacity in the Delhi government hospitals. The medical infrastructure will be ramped up with an increase in the oxygen and ICU beds in the Delhi government hospitals for Covid-19 patients," the government said in a statement. Delhi has recorded a spike in Covid-19 cases in the past few days with the number of daily infections crossing the 6,000-mark for the second consecutive day on Wednesday. The statement said the AAP government has also decided to increase targeted testing at crowded places such as markets and added that mobile testing vans will be deployed in such areas. The testing can be availed free of cost by the people at these places, it said. With regard to reserving beds in private hospitals, the chief minister said the Delhi High Court has stayed the AAP government's order to increase ICU beds in private hospitals. The Delhi government has filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court, to lift the stay on the reservation of beds in private hospitals, keeping in view the critical coronavirus situation. The high court on September 22 had stayed the Delhi government's September 13 decision, saying asking 33 big private hospitals to reserve 80 per cent of ICU beds for Covid-19 patients would violate the fundamental rights of those having other health conditions. In the statement issued on Thursday, the chief minister, during the meeting, said all steps should be taken to maintain a lower fatality rate in the national capital. At present, Delhi is at the 17th position in terms of the deaths per million population due to coronavirus despite a decrease in the number of virus cases, far behind all metropolitan cities in the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/surge-in-covid-19-cases-delhi-govt-to-augment-bed-capacity-deploy-testing-vans-at-crowded-places-911802.html

The posters come up months after the local administration had put up hoardings with pictures of some protesters for realising the damages for vandalism, leading to a major controversy. The two new separate posters also mention a reward Rs 5,000 for giving information about the agitators. A police spokesperson said the posters with photographs had been put up at public places in the Uttar Pradesh capital. One of the posters carries pictures and addresses of eight people who were booked under the Gangsters Act and have been declared absconders. The other has pictures of those who are absconding, but acting under the act has not been initiated, the official said.] According to police, all these people had participated in a protest against the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Lucknow on December 19 and instigated violence, in which a person was killed and public property was damaged. Earlier this year, the Allahabad High Court had directed the Lucknow administration to remove the "name-and-shame" hoardings and the government had approached the Supreme Court, where the matter is pending.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/posters-of-absconding-anti-caa-agitators-come-up-again-in-lucknow-911815.html

It has also asked the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) to file an affidavit stating that it has provided security to the victim's family members. A bench of Justice Pankaj Mithal and Justice Rajan Roy is hearing a PIL which the court had earlier filed suo motu in the Hathras case. It heard the matter on November 2 and its order was made available on the court website on Thursday. A 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras on September 14. She died on September 29 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital during treatment. During the hearing on November 2, the bench asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to apprise it on November 25, the next date of hearing in the case, how long it would take to complete its probe in the case. It also asked the agency's lawyer, Anurag Thakur, to file a status report with regard to the investigation so far. The bench directed the CRPF to file an affidavit stating that it has provided security to the victim's family members. During the hearing, the court had also expressed concern on allowing Hathras District Magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxkar to continue in office during the pendency of the investigation into the case. Laxkar came under fire after the victim was cremated in the dead of the night near her home on September 30, with her family members alleging that they were not allowed to bring the body home one last time. Senior police and administration officials were also present at the cremation. The bench asked state government lawyer S V Raju if retaining Laxar was fair and reasonable. The bench further asked Raju, "Would it not be appropriate to shift him elsewhere during the pendency of these proceedings without there being any stigma attached to such an action only to ensure fairness and transparency in the matter?" At this, Raju assured the bench that he would convey the court's concern to the state government and get back to it on November 25.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/how-much-time-do-you-need-to-complete-hathras-case-probe-allahabad-hc-asks-cbi-911825.html

05-11-2020||Oasis||In ritual we find solace||Some years ago, I read a book called 'In ritual we find Solace' by a young American woman who had spent a year in Varanasi collecting data for her doctoral thesis which she published under the aforesaid title. She had interviewed elderly women and girls from ordinary Hindu families and also had followed the rituals and festivals of the ancient city, which is steeped in the cultural ethos of centuries. Ritual comes from the root ‘rite’ which translates as ceremony, observance, custom etc. Ritual and festival are indeed close cousins with a great family resemblance. Festivals are rituals constituting observance of cultural practices like the Navaratri, Ganesha annually. Apart from festivals that entail feasting there is fasting, a ritual that spells austerity. Fasting, observed on various occasions among Vaishnavites especially on ekadasi day is a ritual that has a great deal of cultural and religious significance. The ekadasi fast is a remembrance ritual for one’s ancestors which indeed brings solace to the person who undertakes the fast. Life in India is basically ritualistic. The morning bath is a purifying ritual and the puja that follows and the food that is prepared with ritualistic purity are all in the name of God. The woman of the house worships the sacred tulsi plant and offers a prayer to the sun to ensure the smooth running of the day and peace among the family. The rituals give her the power to endure the onslaughts of the day and also mental strength and solace in the long run.  The rangoli drawn at the threshold at dawn by the woman of the house meant to drive away the evil eye has the stamp of traditional practice. The colourful rangoli patterns of gods and goddesses, even scenes from the Ramayana or the Mahabharata show the connection between art and religion.  Allen Ginsberg, the American poet was asked on his return to his homeland after a sojourn in Benares, what he had learnt in India. He replied thoughtfully, ‘Well, I learnt the yoga of daily living.’ The practice of Yoga or ritual brings one mental peace and solace especially in difficult times like the one we are living in.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/in-ritual-we-find-solace-911430.html
05-11-2020||Opinion||Vaccination strategy? Go figure||Dismissing an RTI activist’s complaint, the Election Commission of India (ECI) recently held that the BJP’s electoral promise of free Covid-19 vaccination for all people in Bihar was not a violation of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC). At the time of writing, neither the complaint nor the ECE's decision is available in the public domain, despite the RTI Act turning 16 last month. Meanwhile, going by media reports of the ECI’s decision, other reasonable individuals may come to the opposite conclusion on similar grounds. For example, the last para of the Code for poll manifestos which the ECI apparently reiterated in its decision, clearly states: “in the interest of transparency, level playing field and credibility of promises, it is expected that manifestos also reflect the rationale for the promises and broadly indicate the ways and means to meet the financial requirements for it.”  The BJP’s poll manifesto gives no details about financing the free Covid-19 vaccination programme in Bihar. The optics of the Union Finance Minister making this announcement first, instead of a party functionary, also seems to have disappeared behind the blind spot of the ECI’s otherwise observant eye. The rival RJD’s poll promise of creating 10 lakh jobs does not meet the MCC’s test either, but nobody is complaining yet. Be that as it may, this article is neither about political parties’ capers to retain or wrest back power or about voters making their choices on the EVMs in Bihar. It is about the existential question people living in other parts of the country asked, almost instinctively – “What about us? Do we also get the vaccine for free?” The government’s thinking on this issue is obscured by a Klingon-like cloaking device which is difficult to probe, even with RTI. This August, the Union Ministry of Heath put out a press note about the working of a National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19, chaired by a member of NITI Aayog. Apart from the selection of vaccine candidates and available options for financing their purchase, the Expert Group is said to be deliberating upon a delivery strategy that will be equitable and transparent. Engagement with unnamed international players for early delivery of vaccines not only in India but also in other low income and developing countries is on this group’s agenda. Yet, neither the Expert Group’s terms of reference (ToR) nor the details of its deliberations are available in the public domain, officially. Meanwhile, speculation is rife. The CEO of an institute conducting advanced human trials of a potential Covid-19 vaccine estimated a cost of Rs 80,000 crore for vaccinating everybody in the country. The Union Health Secretary was quick to refute this claim. He also announced that the government had the funds required to buy and administer the vaccine across the country. He did not say how much. In September, this author filed an RTI application seeking details of the composition of the Vaccine Expert Group, its ToR, agenda, minutes of its meetings and inputs received about international assistance available for planning the purchase and administration of the vaccine. After almost a month, the Immunization Section of the Health Ministry supplied some information about the Expert Group. Apart from 12 representatives of the central government, five others represent the states on a rotational basis. The ToR covers areas such as identifying vaccine candidates, providing guidance for its procurement, financing its purchase, selecting delivery platforms including cold chain and other necessary infrastructure, and most importantly -- prioritisation, i.e., deciding which population groups will be vaccinated before which others. Inexplicably, the ministry’s Public Information Officer (PIO) claimed that the agenda and the minutes of meetings of this Expert Group including the meeting dates, the materials and presentations shared with members to enable discussions are not ‘information’ according to the RTI Act. This despite his admission that the ministry services the Expert Group. One of these RTI queries regarding inputs received from international players was transferred to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), represented on this group by the Foreign Secretary. MEA’s PIO rejected the query on grounds of national security, friendly relations with foreign countries and also claimed that the information had been received in confidence from abroad. This resistance of dyed-in-the-wool bureaucrats to transparency is reminiscent of another recent instance of their inept handling of Covid-19-related RTI queries. The Central Information Commission rapped the knuckles of some babus in the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology for feigning ignorance about the makers of the Aarogya Setu app which monitors millions of users using their own smartphones. The government’s handling of Covid-19-related RTI queries is increasingly contradictory to the letter and spirit of the law despite several ministers’ claims of being more transparent than previous regimes. A public health emergency cannot be dealt with effectively by simply lecturing people about taking precautions or by imposing hefty fines on people already suffering due to the shrinking economy. While masks help keep the virus at bay, people must not be kept out of the working of the Vaccine Expert Group. “Nothing about us, without us” as noted disability rights activist, the late Javed Abidi used to say. The government must recognise that citizens are not cattle passively waiting to be inoculated against a life-threatening pathogen. We are not only potential beneficiaries of the vaccination programme but also taxpayers who will foot the bill eventually. There may be many wise people inside government but the pool of wisdom outside is much larger. For a change, babus must light lamps to brighten the dark corners of governance. Volunteer more information and involve people in the development of Covid-19 mitigation strategies. This will make an ideal Deepavali gift for all.

05-11-2020||Opinion||Wanted: An anti-discrimination law for LGBTQI Indians||On October 29, Isko Moreno – Mayor of the City of Manila – signed the Manila LGBTQI Protection Ordinance of 2020, or Ordinance No. 8695. This new law might seem like a drop in the ocean but it can have implications far beyond the capital city of the Philippines, if it is used to advocate for reforms in other Asian countries. Activists, lawyers and policymakers in India will hopefully draw on this ordinance while thinking about how to end discrimination against LGBTQI individuals, as a follow-up to the celebrated Supreme Court judgement of 2018 that led to the reading down of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. The City Council of Manila describes it as “an ordinance for the protection of the rights of lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgenders, queers and intersex (LGBTQI) in the City of Manila against any and all forms of discrimination solely on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, expression (SOGIE) and providing penalty for violation thereof.” It is an important document for LGBTQ Indians who want to push the envelope beyond decriminalisation of “carnal intercouse against the order of nature,” and work towards establishing legal protections in several areas including education, housing and employment. This ordinance spells out forms of discrimination that are punishable by law. Here are some examples: Denying access to medical services, limiting opportunities for promotion in workplaces, imposing disciplinary sanctions against students, subjecting people to verbal insults on social media platforms, refusal of entry to malls and hotels, unjust detention and involuntary confinement, turning down applications for licenses and other documents to be issued by government authorities, not allowing people to rent houses, etc. solely because of their sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression. A lot of thought has gone into this ordinance. It seeks to hold accountable not only individuals but also organisations including educational institutions, corporations, and associations. It mentions the creation of the Manila Gender Sensitivity and Development Council to document cases of discrimination, monitor complaints regarding violations of the provisions, to assist victims of discrimination with legal representation and psychological assistance, and to review various policy documents to ensure that they are free of “discriminatory statements and provisions.” It guides LGBTQI individuals about the process to file complaints. It also mentions a specific time frame within which gender-neutral toilets must be constructed. Why should India learn from Manila? In an article titled ‘The Role of Foreign Precedents in a Country's Legal System’ (2010), published in the National Law School of India Review, Justice K G Balakrishnan writes at length about how Indian courts have “looked to international as well as comparative sources as part of creative strategies to read in previously unenumerated norms into the 'protection of life and liberty' guaranteed under Art. 21 of the Indian Constitution.” According to him, the tradition of building on foreign precedents has helped the Supreme Court extend constitutional protection to “several socio-economic entitlements and advanced causes such as environmental protection, gender justice and good governance among others.” A recent example of this practice is the judgement by former Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra and Justice A M Khanwilkar in the case of Navtej Singh Johar & Others v. Union of India in 2018. They refer to legal precedents from other courts and jurisdictions, including a judgement of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Philippines in the case of Ang Ladlad LGBT Party v. Commission of Elections. An LGBT organization in the Philippines was denied the opportunity to register as a political organisation on the grounds of allegedly offending religious beliefs and public morality. The Commission on Human Rights intervened on their behalf, and the court upheld the organisation’s right to participate in the political process. The Manila LGBTQI Protection Ordinance of 2020 can provide a legal blueprint to help Indian policymakers devise strategies to address experiences of discrimination in the Indian context. Based on a study by the community-based organisation, Sahodaran, UNESCO had published, Be a buddy, not a bully! Experiences of sexual and gender minority youth in Tamil Nadu schools (2019). In this report, Sunil Menon C, Venkatesan Chakrapani and Sarita Jadav draw attention to “the absence of SOGIE-related anti-bullying school policies and reporting mechanisms” that feed the “fear of retaliation or negative consequences” among students who face discrimination. Another report that deserves serious attention is Living with Dignity: Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Based Human Rights Violations in Housing, Work, and Public Spaces in India (2019) published by the International Commission of Jurists. In the preface, Justice Ajit Prakash Shah notes, “In order to make the promises of Navtej a reality, India needs to make its broader law and policy frameworks more inclusive of, and responsive to the concerns of LGBTQ persons and communities. This will require an overhaul of some systems and re-development of commonly accessed institutions and spaces, including schools, workplaces, families, public transport and even streets.” It is true that institutions are resistant to change but clearly defined policies can fuel small transformations and make a huge difference in the long run. Parmesh Shahani has studied this phenomenon in the context of corporate India. His book Queeristan: LGBTQ Inclusion in the Indian Workplace (2020), published by Westland, offers a five-step guide for companies to make their workplaces inclusive: 1. Set in place strong policies and specific benefits for LGBTQ employees 2. Actively recruit LGBTQ employees 3. Create an LGBTQ-friendly work culture within the company 4. Address the specific circumstances of trans employees 5. Become an advocate for LGBTQ inclusion outside your company. Shahani writes about various companies that have instituted policies to protect employees from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression. However, not all LGBTQI individuals in India are covered by such policies. That is why an anti-discrimination law is needed. As Justice Misra and Justice Khanwilkar state, “The constitutional framers could have never intended that the protection of fundamental rights was only for the majority population. If such had been the intention, then all provisions in Part III of the Constitution would have contained qualifying words such as 'majority persons' or 'majority citizens'...constitutional courts are under an obligation to protect the fundamental rights of every single citizen.” (Chintan Girish Modi is a writer, educator and researcher who tweets @chintan_connect) The views expressed above are the author’s own.

05-11-2020||Opinion||We waited in vain for a repudiation that never came||The liberal hope for the 2020 presidential election was a decisive repudiation of Donald Trump and the Republican Party. This is no longer on the table. A Joe Biden win, if it happens, will be as narrow an Electoral College win as Trump’s was in 2016. Biden won the national popular vote — which matters for popular legitimacy, even if it doesn’t weigh on the outcome — but Trump outperformed his job approval, winning more total votes than any Republican presidential nominee in history. In spite of everything, the president expanded his support, most likely saving the Republican Senate majority in the process. A Trump loss is still possible — perhaps even probable since Biden holds a lead in states totalling 270 electoral votes — but there’s every reason to think Trumpism will survive as a viable strategy for winning national elections. And what is Trumpism? It is a performance, or rather, a series of performances. It is a performance of nationalism, one that triangulates between open chauvinism in favour of the dominant ethnic group and narrow appeals to inclusion, with the promise of material gain for anyone who joins his coalition. It is a performance, on the same score, of success, projecting an image of wealth and power and urging the public to embrace it as its own — a version of “The Apprentice” in which the contestants are the American people. It is also the performance of aggressive and aggrieved masculinity centred on the bullying and domination of others. Even without policy to match the populist persona — the Trump administration has been as generous to the wealthy and connected as it has been stingy with the poor and the working class — Trumpism appeals to tens of millions of voters, from the large majority of white Americans to many people in traditionally Democratic constituencies. That, if anything, is the surprise of this election. Although it is still too early to make any definitive statement about the shape of the electorate (broad white support for Trump notwithstanding), it is clear that the president made modest inroads with Black and Hispanic voters, especially men. This is most apparent in the states of Florida, Georgia and Texas, where Trump outperformed his 2016 totals in several areas where Hispanic voters make up a majority. We don’t yet know why Trump made those gains — although the aforementioned performances, which figured prominently in his outreach to those groups, may have something to do with it — but this shift is a useful reminder that politics does not move along a linear path. For all of our data, the political world is still a fundamentally unpredictable place. A decade ago, for example, Democrats believed that demographic change — the shift from a “majority white” country to a “majority-minority” one — would give the party an almost unbreakable lock on national politics; that a growing population of Asian and Hispanic Americans would inevitably redound to liberal benefit. At the time, I wrote that this was unlikely, that while it was a seductive theory, there was not much evidence to support the vision of an enduring Democratic majority. Racial and ethnic identity, I argued, was too fluid, and there was no guarantee that future members of those groups would think of themselves as “minorities” in the way that has been historically true of Black Americans. Changing conditions — greater assimilation and upward mobility — could make them as volatile in partisan politics as European ethnic groups were in the 20th century. If the Hispanic shift is as large as it appears to be, then we are living in that reality. What I didn’t expect is that it would come heralded by a Republican like Trump. But this only speaks to the diversity, ideological and otherwise, of the Hispanic electorate, which is as varied in racial background and national origin as most other groups of Americans. To extend an earlier analogy, it is probably as useful to speak of “Hispanics” in 2020 as it was to speak of “Europeans” in 1950. The category is just too broad, obscuring (in electoral politics, at least) far more than it illuminates. Again, it is too early to say that there’s been a permanent realignment, although some trends — like the rising partisan significance of gender and education — are clear. It’s true, though, that the possibilities for change and transformation are wide open. Perhaps a future Republican, one with the same or similar fame and charisma, will build a real majority from the foundation laid over the last four years. Perhaps a future Democrat will turn the party’s consistent voting majority into a greater share of electoral votes and congressional seats. Perhaps we see neither and are in for another decade of fierce partisan competition between two equal and evenly-matched sides. The 2020 election, in other words, will have an outcome. But it won’t be conclusive. It will be an uncertain result for an uncertain time in American life. Political trench warfare will continue. Total victory, whether in politics or anywhere else, is not on the immediate horizon. The future remains unwritten and is perhaps even more unknowable than before.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/we-waited-in-vain-for-a-repudiation-that-never-came-911735.html
05-11-2020||Panorama||Will handshakes become history?||To shake or not to shake hands? That is the Hamletian dilemma most of us will be facing until the Covid-19 pandemic ends. Ever since fears of the infectious coronavirus spread, lockdowns came into force accompanied by social distancing. Suddenly, physical touching became taboo and one of the casualties is the age-old habit of a handshake.  It has changed the way we greet one another. Greeting customs are varied across the world but the handshake, the most common physical form of greeting people, has an interesting history, albeit foggy, dating back to the fifth century B.C in Greece.  Ancient sculpture, engravings and texts are replete with early representations of the practice, which the Greeks called dexiosis, roughly meaning “to take the right hand.” One of the earliest recorded handshakes occurred in the ninth century B.C when the Assyrian King Shalmaneser III struck an alliance with a Babylonian ruler. Shalmaneser III (859-827 B.C) had intervened directly in Babylonian politics to ensure the ascendancy of the heir to the throne of Babylon.  The meeting between the Kings of Assyria and Babylon sealing a peace treaty and extending equality to Babylonia with a handshake was carved as a relief found on the throne pedestal of the Assyrian King.   Notably, handshakes also began as a gesture of peace and it is believed the custom originated as a means to convey peaceful intentions between meeting parties. By extending the right hands openly and shaking them, strangers could assure each other that there is nothing up their sleeve (weapons, for example) and bore no hostility towards each other.    However, the popularity of the modern handshake is largely attributed to the 17th century Quakers – a Christian faith group committed to working for equality.  In comparison to bowing, tipping the hat or kissing the hand, the handshake served as a more egalitarian gesture as it put both parties in equal positions.  By the 19th century, the gesture was counted as an essential etiquette and was often included in manuals. And so, shaking hands was deemed a good method of greeting, became acceptable as a symbol of equality and went on to become the most ubiquitous greeting around the world. Handshakes became common during a meeting, greeting or parting; on finalizing business deals, diplomatic agreements, meetings of heads of State, even offering congratulations or expressing gratitude, not to mention as a sign of true sportsmanship. It is the handshake at any important occasion that gets photographed the most, signalling the purpose – trust, respect and equality. Most of us remember historic handshakes published in newspapers and magazines or on television - the Hitler-Chamberlain handshake of 1938 just before the end of World War II, Anwar Sadat-Menachem Begin pact in 1979 with Jimmy Carter, the 1970 Nixon-Elvis Presley handshake and even long-running handshakes to break Guinness records.  Former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt set a record for a head of state by shaking hands with 8,513 people at an official function at a New Year’s Day White House presentation on 1 January 1907. In recent memory – the world saw the famous Trump-Macron handshake that lasted for 29 seconds when the two leaders, along with their wives were present at a military parade celebrating Bastille Day. During a pause in the music, the leaders grasped hands and neither let go. Tragically, one handshake led to the killing of U.S. President William McKinley in 1901. Mckinley agreed to a long round of public handshaking at an exhibition when a man, Leon Czolgosz, shook the president’s left hand and fired twice. The president died after a week.   On a lighter note, once, an ardent fan of George Bernard Shaw asked to kiss the hand that penned his literature only to be told that the same hand had done many unsavoury things! Shakespeare too wrote in As You Like It that two characters “shook hands and swore brothers.” However, today, a handshake draws critical and even condemnatory comments. Many on our planet are aware of the risks of physical contact, preferring to avoid a handshake as our palms could carry bacteria and viruses. Already the handshake is being replaced by different forms of greeting that we have been seeing - the elbow touch, fist bump, a tap on the back, a simple wave or a bow of the head, a namaste or even the ‘Wuhan Shake’. All said and done, with a history of thousands of years, will the handshake itself become history? Only time will tell.

05-11-2020||Panorama||Malnourished, stunted and wasted, can this be India’s Demographic Dividend?||India is proud of its current demography -- 67.3% of our population is between 15 and 59 years of age, a demographic advantage that will continue for at least another three decades. This we believe is a great powerhouse for economic growth and our aspirations of becoming a world power – our demographic dividend. Let us take a look at what sort of a powerhouse it actually is. Findings from a succession of reports during this decade -- NNMB 3rd Repeat Survey (2012), NFHS 4, 2015-16, NNMB Technical Report Number 27, 2017, continuously record that at least 40% of our population of all age groups has a huge dietary deficit, covering protein, calories and micronutrients, as compared with Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for Indians. The situation among children below six years, our future demographic dividend, is even worse. Stunting, wasting and anaemia rates are high and a mere 14.3% infants below two years receive adequate diets necessary for proper physical and cognitive growth, meaning thereby that 85.7% children in India will never achieve their complete physical and cognitive potential, will have lower immunity, higher infections, and permanent stunting. Scientific evidence establishes that inadequate nutrition among infants below three years, which is a period of rapid growth of their brain cells, can result in slower and lesser development of cognitive ability. As for school children and adolescents, our intermediate demographic dividend, high rates of undernutrition, anaemia and micronutrient deficiency again result in slower physical growth, reduced ability to learn, play and do physical work. This translates into poor numeracy and learning ability, and lower educational achievement as they grow, school dropouts, lesser ability to acquire professional skills and lower-income generation capacity as they enter the workforce. Additionally, undernourished adolescent girls become undernourished and anaemic mothers, thereby completing the intergenerational cycle of undernutrition and poverty. What about adults, our present demographic dividend? Dietary deficit, Chronic Energy Deficiency (CED) and anaemia result in reduced energy to work and earn, quick fatigue, lower earnings and a permanent poverty trap. The body systems of such adults become programmed to function in scarcity, creating a negative balance where muscles don’t build and existing muscles become thinner. This adversely affects protective mechanisms of the body and reduces immunity and life expectancy. The late Prof RW Fogel, Nobel laureate, has explained the consequences of dietary deficit in the simplest and most lucid manner in his paper, The Conquest of High Mortality and Hunger in Europe and America, 1990, “The First Law of Thermodynamics applies as strictly to the human engine as to mechanical engines. Since the overwhelming share of calories consumed among malnourished populations is required for BMR and essential maintenance, it is quite clear that in energy-poor populations such as those of Europe during the second half of 18th century, the typical individual in the labour force had relatively small amounts of energy available for work.” This logic of 18th century Europe very aptly applies to the energy situation of our workforce in India today. This Dietary Deficit is compounded by an Information Deficit at household level, especially among the lower-income families about what are balanced diets, why they are important, and how to have the most balanced diet within their family budgets. Every village in India has valuable and affordable greens, vegetables and local fruits, but they do not form part of the diets of the agricultural or construction labourers. Apart from poverty and ignorance, their diets, which normally consist of watery dal and roti/rice in the morning, and the same in the evening, are also rigidly governed by custom, generational tradition and taboos.  Finally, we have an inequitable Market Deficit for affordable, fortified energy food which can be consumed by children, adolescents and adults in lower-income families to bridge their dietary deficit. While the market has stacks of expensive fortified energy food and beverages for higher-income groups, there is nothing affordable for low-income groups except junk kurkuras and chips costing Rs 5. It is perfectly possible to produce a low-cost nutritive fortified energy food for children within Rs 5 from wheat, defatted soya, green gram and ragi malt, providing around 380 calories from 25 grams. A feasibility study conducted through KPMG in 2018 under the Karnataka Multi-sectoral Nutrition Pilot Project, calculates a market demand of 42 million tons of low-cost energy food per year, but strangely, no private entrepreneur wants to enter this field. One can only conclude that there is a quiet understanding between multinationals monopolising this market and our F&B sector, that this market vacuum for affordable energy food will not be disturbed and protein imperialism will continue. This, despite the firm finding in the feasibility study that there is a direct correlation between high incidence of low weight, stunting and wasting among children; low body mass index and stunting among adolescents, and lack of low-cost fortified energy food in the market. So, how does India overcome this triple deficit to create a smart demographic dividend? First and foremost, by acknowledging the problem, and including it in the public policy domain, as an unaddressed goalpost for development. So far, this has not happened, either in the Niti Aayog, or the Poshan Abhiyaan, though the New Education Policy 2020 devotes some space to it. Only after acknowledging the problem, and throwing it open to public debate, will the best innovative solutions emerge to overcome the triple deficit -- of reform and improved coverage by ICDS, new outcome-oriented interventions by our vast pool of women power through SHG groups and panchayats, who can be trained to work as village volunteers for spreading awareness and information, or even starting energy food production units under existing livelihood programmes, if our F&B sector continues to be inequitable. Finally, the mindset of policymakers and programmers, down to field workers and families, that subsistence diet equals food/nutrition security, must change. Raising the diet of the people from subsistence level to a higher level of nourishment and overcoming the triple deficit is the only way that the health, education, skills, employability and earning capacity of our demographic dividend can improve. They are our greatest asset for building a new India, expanding our economy, raising our GDP, and becoming the world power that we aspire to be. We have started the process of creating smart cities and villages. We must now create our greatest asset -- the smart demographic dividend.  (Veena Rao is a retired IAS officer; Dr Shankar is a Public Health expert)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/malnourished-stunted-and-wasted-can-this-be-india-s-demographic-dividend-911434.html
05-11-2020||Right in the Middle||In the patient's shoes||This incident happened a few months ago in our psychiatry clinic. We had put in place a universal rule in the clinic, for patients as well as for the staff, to leave footwear on a stand at the entrance. Following a busy session one morning, I was rushing to go to an important lunchtime meeting. To my horror and consternation, I found my pair of shoes missing!  What followed perhaps were Elisabeth Kubler-Ross’ five stages of grief. My instant reaction was that of being in a state of shock and denial that such a thing was happening to me. I had little time to lose and had to get going to the meeting.   Following a quick enquiry, I found an extra pair of black shoes lying on the stand and assumed that someone had ended up leaving their shoes for mine. I had by then moved on to Kubler-Ross’ second stage-- that of anger. I began to wonder if this was a prank that someone had played on me. My anger was focussed in two directions, one that was external and the other was channeled inwards. My anger, which later turned inwards, was me blaming myself for not being careful. With little time left, I rushed to the meeting wearing the shoes that were left behind. Slipping my feet into the shoes, I realised that they were worn out and that one of the soles had a gaping hole in it! What transpired in my head over the next few hours were feelings of empathy for this patient and many like him who went about their lives with personal hardships. The worn-out shoes were perhaps only symbolic of the adversities the patients were going through when in pain – both physical and emotional. The medical definition of empathy that I had learnt was that of ‘developing emotional resonance and rapport with patients’. In common parlance in psychology, we describe empathy as being ‘in the patient’s shoes’ which I was in literally!  Our administration team at the clinic did a good job of contact tracing and the shoes were exchanged the next day. Unfortunately, I never got a chance to ask the patient what his experience was being in the doctors’ shoes.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/in-the-patients-shoes-911442.html
05-11-2020||Second Edit||The BJP’s bogey of ‘love jihad’||A number of BJP-ruled states have announced plans to bring in legislation to disallow what the party has come to call “love jihad”, which is a pejorative and politically loaded term to describe marriages between Hindu women and Muslim men. Two Karnataka ministers have said that legislation is under consideration to ban religious conversions for marriage, on the lines of a recent Allahabad High Court verdict, and one of them has declared that the government “would not remain silent when jihadis strip the dignity of women”. Haryana has spoken of enacting such a law, Madhya Pradesh is planning it. UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said that a stringent law against “love jihad” will be passed and has threatened that those “who exploit women” should be prepared for their final journey. The Assam BJP is planning to make it an issue in next year’s Assembly election campaign. “Love jihad’’ is a bogey invented by the Sangh Parivar to malign members of the Muslim community and to widen the religious divide. The contention is that Muslim men trap Hindu women into marriage and religious conversion by concealing their identity or exploiting their vulnerabilities. It is called a ‘jihad’ because it is taken to be a diabolic plan to change the country’s demography. Earlier this year, the central government told Parliament that no such cases had been reported by its agencies. The Supreme Court has found that charges of coercion and religious conversion in cases of inter-faith marriages brought before it are unfounded. Young men and women from different religions have got married in the country through centuries without politics interfering with their decisions, and they have helped to bridge the religious divide. “Love jihad” is not just a mischievous and insidious political idea. It is deeply rooted in a patriarchal and misogynist notion that considers women incapable of deciding for themselves matters relating to their lives and seeks to set store by their “honour” and to protect them. Ironically, the loudest voice supporting it has come from a state where women are the least secure. Decisions about marriage are taken by two consenting adults. There are civil laws and the Special Marriage Act that make marriages legal and legitimate. The family, the clan and community, the government, and least of all political parties and groups, have no authority to interfere with the independent decisions of intending couples. Legal and other issues arise when there is coercion or deception in any marriage, there is no need to involve religion in the matter. It is ridiculous to think that a Hindu-Muslim marriage is a conspiracy to undermine Hinduism, and any curbs on them would be legally untenable.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/the-bjp-s-bogey-of-love-jihad-911438.html
05-11-2020||South||Will Tamil Nadu BJP's 'Vetrivel Yatra' achieve desired results?||Never in the history of Tamil Nadu politics has a planned event of the BJP garnered attention like its 'Vetrivel Yatra.' This Friday, the BJP will embark on a month-long tour – police permission for which has not been granted as yet – to "unmask" the people behind Karuppar Kootam, a YouTube channel that made derogatory remarks on Kandha Shashti Kavasam, a devotional song dedicated to Lord Murugan. However, the month-long yatra that will cover all six abodes where Lord Murugan is believed to have lived has nothing to do with the song or the native God of Tamils, said political analysts, adding that it was part of the BJP's strategy to make itself heard in Tamil Nadu, a state where it lacks any base now.   The controversy over the song seems to be long forgotten by the people after the police arrested members of the YouTube channel but the BJP is making every attempt to use the row to gain maximum political mileage. The BJP has been trying one strategy after the other to make inroads into Tamil Nadu, especially since 2016 after it sensed a chance following J Jayalalithaa's death. These strategies not just failed but some of them even backfired on the BJP, which has now resorted to its time-tested method of undertaking a yatra in the name of God, hoping that the strategy would result in consolidating the Hindu votes. The party believes that there is anger among people against the Dravidian parties which it accuses of failing to stop such incidents. It hopes a yatra across the state in the name of Lord Murugan will help expand the base and the timing is also crucial. If the yatra does attract crowds, the BJP can also use it to increase its bargaining power with the AIADMK during seat-sharing talks if the alliance continues for the 2021 polls. Also, by going to town with the 'Hindus are hurt' narrative, the BJP is also trying to drag the DMK, which it always projects as “anti-Hindu.” The DMK, which had maintained a studied silence so far, opened up on Wednesday to ask whether the BJP was ready to announce Tamil as a national language if its love for the language and its people was “true". But it is not easy for the BJP to bring about Hindu consolidation that it dreams of overnight in a state that has never voted on religious lines in the past. That the state has always kept national parties at bay for the past half-century only adds to the BJP's woes.   The biggest hurdle for the BJP in Tamil Nadu is the trust deficit that people seem to have with the saffron party. It became clear in August that politics over religion may not be welcomed in the state when BJP leaders were called out on social media for making a “mockery” out of Vel Pooja, an event that the party thought would help project itself as “saviour of Hindus". "If someone thinks that the yatra is just aimed at the 2021 elections, they are wrong. This is part of the BJP's long-drawn strategy to bring about a Hindu consolidation in Tamil Nadu. The BJP believes there is a section within the Hindu community that is not too happy with the way the Dravidian parties deal with them. They feel BJP is the right choice for them and that ballot is the only weapon that they have," senior journalist R Bhagwan Singh told DH. The BJP's agenda is to emerge as a political and ideological alternative to the Dravidian parties but the strategy of the party comes into question most times – the latest being the appropriation of AIADMK founder M G Ramachandran who has been made part of a propaganda video. The AIADMK has taken objection to the move, while it has led to criticism against the BJP with questions being posed on why it is “depending” on Dravidian leaders when its motive is to overthrow their ideology. As the opposition to the yatra grows shriller and with the government yet to give its nod, the BJP seems to be changing the agenda of the “Vetrivel Yatra” from time to time. In the beginning, the month-long yatra's agenda was to "unmask" people behind the YouTube channel but a few weeks later it was changed to "bring the BJP" to power in the 2021 elections. Last checked, it was to take the "good programmes" of the Narendra Modi government to the people and it may undergo another change before November 6.   The shifting goalposts may be to ensure that the government gives its nod for the yatra, but Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami has shown the state BJP its place more than once. He refused to give the BJP permission to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi and now his administration is making the BJP wait for permission for the Vetrivel Yatra till the last minute.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/will-tamil-nadu-bjps-vetrivel-yatra-achieve-desired-results-911525.html

Bineesh's close relatives, including women, even staged a sit-in in front of Bineesh's house alleging illegal detention of his family  Bineesh's wife Renita told media that the ED pressurised her to sign on the search report mentioning that a credit card in the name of Mohammed Anoop, one of the key accused in the Bengaluru drug trafficking case, was recovered from Bineesh's room. She said that the ED could not recover anything else from the house and the credit card seemed to be a planted one. She said she had not seen the ED recovering the card from the house and hence she refused to sign on the search report that mentioned that the card was recovered from the house. The ED officials pressurised for hours to sign on it. They said that Bineesh could be saved only if she signed on it, alleged Renita, adding that she refused to sign on the documents. She claimed that her husband was innocent.    The ED search at Bineesh's house prolonged owing to the reluctance of his wife to sign on the search report. The ED is likely to take a stand that the family did not cooperate with the search. Meanwhile, a team of Kerala Police blocked the ED officials while they were leaving Bineesh's house. They received a complaint from a relative of Bineesh that his wife, child and mother-in-law were illegally detained in the house. After the ED officials offered to give a statement, the police allowed them to leave the premises. The Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights also visited Bineesh's house following a complaint of denying the right of Bineesh's three-year-old child. ED allowed Bineesh's wife, daughter, and her mother to meet the commission. They alleged that the basic needs of the child could not be met owing to the 24-hour-long search by the ED. The commission later said that action would be initiated as the child's rights were being denied. Considering chances of protest, a search at Bineesh's house since Wednesday was carried out under tight CRPF officials. Earlier in the morning, Bineesh's relatives, including two maternal aunties, staged a sit-in in front of Bineesh's house alleging that Bineesh's wife and child were kept in illegal detention. Meanwhile, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan refused to make any direct comments on the developments citing that it was an investigation against an individual. The CPM state leadership was learnt to have met on Thursday morning and evaluated the developments. The swift actions of the child rights commission and local police also triggered allegations of political favouratism by the agencies.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/bineesh-kodiyeris-wife-alleges-ed-attempted-to-plant-evidence-911531.html

The ED moved an application in the Special PMLA court here, seeking seven more days custody of Sivasankar to probe details of communication between him and Swapna Suresh, prime accused in the sensational gold smuggling case, as he was produced before it after the seven-day custody granted to the agency last week ended on Thursday. Considering the ED plea, the court extended the custody of Sivasankar by six days. The Enforcement Directorate, probing the money trail in the gold smuggling case, has alleged multiple offences against Sivasankar. The National Investigation Agency, Customs and the ED are conducting separate investigations into the seizure of gold worth nearly Rs 15 crore from a "diplomatic baggage" of UAE Consulate at Thiruvananthapuram airport on July 5. The ED has alleged that Sivasankar had intervened to clear the diplomatic baggage containing smuggled gold without examination by the Customs at the Thiruvananthapuram international airport.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/m-sivasankars-custody-in-kerala-gold-smuggling-case-extended-by-six-days-911584.html

Advocate-General Vijay Narayan communicated the government's decision to the first bench of the High Court comprising Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar, which was hearing two PILs seeking a ban on the month-long tour by the Tamil Nadu unit of the BJP. After the A-G's submission, the High Court disposed off the PILs and directed the state government to decide in accordance with the prevailing pandemic situation. The PIL was filed by Senthil Kumar, who had alleged that the there is every possibility that the BJP may try to create trouble in areas where minorities are thickly populated. "Further the culmination of the proposed rally by BJP is scheduled for 6th of December, 2020 the date of demolition of Babri Masjid. It appears the date has been chosen by the BJP to foment communal tension and create a law and order situation,” the petition said.

A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah issued notice to the General Secretary of TDP Varla Ramaiah, on whose plea the HC on September 16 stayed the actions initiated by the Y S Jaganmohan Reddy government, in view of reports related to "unbridled corruption, ruthless exploitation of natural resources for private gain, avaricious grabbing of land from small and marginal farmers". Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for the state government, contended the HC order was extraordinary as it stopped the entire investigation into allegations of fraudulent practices and abuse of power. He referred to a report by the Cabinet sub-committee of December 27, 2019 on the basis of which an SIT was constituted to probe several procedural, legal and financial irregularities and fraudulent transactions concerned with various projects. "It is impossible for a High Court to interfere at a pre-investigation stage and stay all proceedings," he said. A busybody, like a member of TDP, moved the court talking about the image of his party and the petition was admitted, he added. The counsel maintained that there was no mala fide by the state government as the CM wrote to the central government for referring the probe into Amaravati land deals to the CBI but the Centre was yet to respond. On this, the court asked Dave if the Jaganmohan Reddy government has decided to review all decisions of the previous TDP government. To this, he said, "Not at all, but only those cases where gross illegalities are found." "The High Court is also bound by the laws declared by the Supreme Court. They don't have extraordinary powers to pass any order as they like. In this case, they interdicted a probe and even registration of a case. Can this be allowed? Is this how a High Court can function," he asked. He maintained that the state government has been completely fair and itself preferred a CBI probe. "What more can a state do to show its bonafide? But the High Court passes an extensively wide order," he said. The court sought a response from the TDP leader on a petition filed by advocate Mahfooz A Nazki against the HC's interim order passed on September 16 and put the matter for hearing after four weeks.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sc-to-examine-ap-hcs-stay-on-probe-into-land-deals-for-capital-city-911607.html

The existing jumbo care centre at Kottoor, located over 25 kms away from the capital city, is being upgraded to international standards as part of the state government's special programme for the protection and conservation of elephants. The facility is upgraded with an aim to give the elephants that come to the rehabilitation centre a natural ecosystem just like in the forest, official sources said. The first phase of the Centre, where upgradations initiatives are being implemented at a cost of Rs108 crores with funding from Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), would be commissioned in February 2021. Spread in 176 hectares of forest land, the centre, known for its lush greenery, has facilities to accommodate 50 elephants including the existing 16 jumbos. A total of Rs 71.9 crores were spent on the construction work of the first phase of the project that began in 2019, they said. Being upgraded with extensive facilities, it will have 50 elephant habitats, (enclosures) specially enclosed by steel poles and nets to house jumbos in their natural habitat. Of these, 35 would be completed in the first phase and the rest in the second phase, sources said. It will also include the construction of various reservoirs and check dams at the Neyyar Dam and also special facilities for the care of elephant calves. The upgraded centre would also have an elephant museum, a veterinary hospital with super speciality facilities, a study and research centre for nature lovers and students, a training centre for mahouts, an entrance plaza, an administrative office, parking for visitors, a cafeteria, cottages, a toilet block and a special elephant viewing facility. A post-mortem facility and a cemetery are being set up as part of the project. A large kitchen for cooking food for the elephants, a spacious separate area for feeding them and a facility for the public to view the elephants at a safe distance would be additional features, they said. The project envisages a large convention centre, an amphitheatre, a unit for making paper from elephant dung and a system for producing biogas from waste would be set up here. Special facilities would be provided for collection and disposal of solid wastes including non-recyclable plastics. A liquid waste treatment plant is also part of the project. With the completion of the project, more than 250 people would be employed every day and of these 100 would be elephant herders, an official statement said. A total of 40 people would be accommodated with their families and 40 would be provided with dormitory facilities as part of the project. The project is also expected to generate job opportunities also for the locals. Tribals living in the nearby forest areas would be given priority in the employment at the centre. With the completion of the project, Kottur is also expected to become a major tourist destination here and will see a huge leap in the tourism sector in general as more than 3.5 lakh people, including half a lakh tourists from overseas, are expected to visit the Centre every year. Tourism projects of the Forest department and the Water Resources department in the Neyyar Dam area would also be developed along with this project, the statement added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-jumbo-care-centre-to-be-worlds-largest-care-and-cure-facility-for-elephants-911616.html

A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian dismissed his review petition as well as an application for an oral hearing. Notably, according to the Supreme Court Rules, the review petition is considered by judges on the basis of documents in their chamber without the presence of counsel. In its November 3 order, the bench said, "We do not find any error in the order impugned, much less an apparent error on the face of the record, so as to call for its review.The review petition is, accordingly, dismissed." Mulakkal has asked the court to relook the order passed on August 5. The court had then said there is no merit in his petition. "You don't have a case," the court had then told senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Mulakkal. In his plea, he alleged he has been framed in the case out of feeling of revenge on objecting to financial dealings of the victim. The Kerala government as well as the victim had also filed a plea opposing his petition. Among other grounds, Mulakkal contended there were discrepancies in the nun's version, warranting his discharge in the case. He challenged the Kerala High Court's order of July 7 rejecting his plea for discharge. He was arrested in September, 2018 in the case on a complaint made by the nun in the Missionaries of Jesus Congregation, alleging he raped her multiple times between 2014 and 2016 in Kottayam. The Kerala police had filed a charge sheet against him. He was released on bail in October, 2018.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sc-rejects-kerala-bishops-review-plea-against-dismissal-of-discharge-in-nun-rape-case-911617.html

Thulasendrapuram, located about 320 km (200 miles) south of Chennai, is where Harris's maternal grandfather was born more than a century ago. "From yesterday, we are excited about the final result," said Abirami, a resident of the village. "Now, we are hearing positive news. We are waiting to celebrate her victory." Many of her neighbours watched updates from the count on their mobile phones. The lush, green village in the south of the country has also been decked out in posters of Harris, with prayers offered at the local Hindu temple. Biden leads the count and has predicted he will win but closely contested states - including Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina - were still tallying votes, leaving the election outcome uncertain. Harris’s grandfather PV Gopalan and his family moved to Chennai nearly 90 years ago. He retired there as a high-ranking government official. Harris, who was born to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father who both immigrated to the United States to study, visited Thulasendrapuram when she was five and has repeatedly recalled walks with her grandfather on the beaches of Chennai.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kamala-harris-s-ancestral-village-in-tamil-nadu-gets-festive-as-joe-biden-leads-in-us-911650.html

"Our candidates are going to win with a huge margin in both Sira and Rajarajeshwari Nagar constituencies, results of which will be declared on November 10. On that day or after that I will go to Delhi or talk to our national president (JP Nadda) and Amit Shah (union home minister) over the phone and discuss expanding the cabinet at the earliest," Yediyurappa said. Speaking to reporters ahead of the BJP state executive meeting in Mangaluru, he said he will expand the cabinet at the earliest. Earlier in September, Yediyurappa had paid a visit to Delhi to seek approval from the high command for the cabinet expansion, but failed to get any green signal. He had then even hinted about the possibility of a cabinet reshuffle by stating that things would depend on what the party leadership decides. The cabinet expansion or reshuffle is expected to be a tightrope walk for 77-year-old Yediyurappa, considering that there are too many aspirants. While several of the old guards like 8-time MLA Umesh Katti are awaiting a chance to be inducted into the Ministry, Congress-JD(S) rebels like A H Vishwanath, R Shankar and M T B Nagaraj, who helped the BJP come to power and are now BJP MLCs, are also aspiring for slots. As per the agreement, Yediyurappa will also have to keep space for Munirathna, if he wins the Rajarajeshwari Nagar seat in the bypoll, and also for Pratap Gowda Patil who needs to win the Maski bypoll that is yet to be announced. The cabinet currently has 28 members, and six berths are still vacant. Meanwhile, despite the state BJP denying it, speculation about a possible change in leadership in the future, considering Yediyurappas age, refuses to die down, with some within the party like MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal giving credence to it with their statements. Later speaking at the state executive meeting, Yediyurappa expressed confidence about the BJP coming back to power by winning a minimum of 140-150 seats in the 224-member assembly in the next assembly polls. He urged the workers not to take any election lightly and to strengthen the organisation where the party is not strong. BJP will win Rajarajeshwari Nagar bypolls by a margin of over 40,000 votes and over 20,000-25,000 votes in Sira, he claimed as he predicted defeat for the Congress.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/b-s-yediyurappa-to-discuss-cabinet-expansion-with-bjp-high-command-after-november-10-bypoll-results-911695.html

Tamil Nadu is a major cracker manufacturing state using raw materials with reduced emission level and low decibel, Palaniswami said, adding that the state contributes to about 90 percent of total manufacture of crackers in the country, providing direct employment to around 4 lakh people and indirect employment to an equal number of people. “Their livelihood solely depends on the sale of crackers during Diwali season. The ban on bursting crackers in your state can have a direct bearing on the livelihood of over 8 lakh workers in the state of Tamil Nadu and another equal number of people engaged in its sale,” he wrote in the letters.

A video of G Babji of Abid's police station running ahead of an ambulance clearing traffic for over a KM distance from MJ Market to Koti in the city's centre on Monday evening to save a life became viral on Wednesday. The seriously ill patient’s life could be saved because of Babji valiant act, said, officials. The video was reportedly made by relatives of the patient in the ambulance who shared it on social media in gratitude for the cop's help in time. “The road I was posted on that evening was heavily jammed and the ambulance which arrived there was not able to move ahead. (As there was a patient inside needing hospitalisation) I ran ahead of the ambulance, clearing the traffic. I was just doing my duty,” Babji told reporters. But the continuous run, requesting the numerous bikers, drivers to pull their vehicles aside to allow the ambulance pass through has won him widespread praise. Even Telangana finance minister Harish Rao shared the video in appreciation of Babji, tweeting that his heart was filled with joy, witnessing such a humane act. “It is our daily job to see that commuters reach their destinations safely. So, even though no one requested me, my effort that day was to ensure that the patient is taken to the hospital on time. I am happy that my actions helped save a life,” Babji said. The video shows people also cooperating, squeezing their bikes, etc., into narrow spaces to allow the ambulance to move on. When he becomes socially responsible, every citizen is police without uniform, said the cop. Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar felicitated Babji on Thursday. “I am proud to say that we have many such dedicated men in our department. Being sensitive is what gives we cops strength,” Kumar said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/hyderabad-traffic-cops-urge-to-save-life-wins-hearts-911756.html

Paddy field owners will get a royalty of Rs. 2,000 per hectare for paddy fields that are being cultivated.  Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan launched the scheme on Thursday, which is the first of its kind in the country, said state agriculture department officials. Apart from paddy fields that are now under paddy cultivation, paddy fields in which other short term cultivations were being carried out without altering the paddy field's structure can also avail the scheme. Owners of paddy fields that are now remaining uncultivated will be also eligible for the royalty if they initiate cultivation by themselves or lease it out for cultivation. Owners will not get the royalty if the cultivation was not carried out for three years in a row. The government launched the scheme with the objectives of protecting nature and ensuring food security. Over the last few years, there has been an increase of over 20,000 hectares of paddy cultivation in Kerala. Kerala government's recent decision to implement a minimum support price for 16 vegetables and fruits had received much attention.

Elephant owners say they require Rs 2,500-Rs 5,000 on an average for daily expense for maintaining an elephant, which includes the charges towards food and mahouts. According to elephant owners, at least 300 captive elephants used to be paraded for festivals and on average each elephant used to participate in around 80 festivals during the December-May season. Those associated with temple festivals say that the charges for parading one elephant for a festival range from Rs 50,000 to several lakhs based on the popularity of the jumbo. The peak temple festival season in the state is from March to May. Owing to Covid-19 restrictions, which started before March, the last season was bleak as over 1,000 festivals, including Thrissur Pooram, were limited to rituals only. As the pandemic scenario persists, the elephant owners are uncertain about the upcoming season as well. Kerala Elephant Owners Federation secretary K Sasikumar told DH that elephant owners are preparing themselves to face the challenges as the chances of festivals to revive was bleak until a vaccine for Covid-19 is found. The bleak scenario was also affecting the livelihood of hundreds of mahouts, he added. The Kerala government has offered onetime assistance of Rs 12,000 to elephant owners. Around 200 elephant owners had availed the benefit. Kerala Animal Welfare Board member M N Jayachandran said ownership of elephants are issued only after ensuring that the owners can look after the animals. Parading elephants for money is a violation. But the money used to be collected as maintenance expense. Animal rights activists feel that the elephants could be relieved from the severe torture they used to face during the festival season owing to the hectic schedules. The forest department is supposed to conduct frequent inspections to ensure that the owners were taking proper care of elephants.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-elephant-owners-fear-prolonged-covid-19-may-upend-festival-season-911776.html

The permission has been denied despite pressure from the BJP leadership in the state for the past few weeks – Tamil Nadu BJP chief L Murugan had met Palaniswami on Tuesday ostensibly to thank him for piloting legislation providing 7.5 per cent reservation to government school students in medical admissions. Palaniswami told reporters on Thursday evening that permission for Vetrivel Yatra cannot be granted as Section 144 was in force due to the pandemic. The government's decision was first conveyed by Advocate General Vijay Narayan before the first bench of the Madras High Court comprising Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramalingam which was hearing a petition that sought a ban on the month-long tour by the Tamil Nadu unit of the BJP and another seeking permission for the event. During the argument, the A-G said that the time was not conducive for the yatra to be conducted as there is a risk of a second wave of Covid-19 in Tamil Nadu. Following his submission, the High Court disposed of the petitions and directed the state government to decide on the issue. It also allowed BJP to challenge the decision of the Tamil Nadu government. The yatra aimed at exposing Karuppar Kootam, a YouTube channel that uploaded a derogatory video on Kandha Sashti Kavasam, a devotional song dedicated to Lord Murugan, was to begin on Friday from Tiruttani, 90 km from here. The yatra was to cover all six abodes of Lord Murugan, considered native God of the Tamilians. Through the yatra, the BJP was planning to expand its base in the state. “The spread of Coronavirus has been brought under control in Chennai and elsewhere in the state. But there is a risk of the second wave of the pandemic and it is the responsibility of the government to protect people. In such times, it (the yatra) is needed and the decision has been taking in the interests of the people,” Fisheries Minister D Jayakumar told reporters. He also said the law will take its own course if the BJP went ahead with the yatra despite being denied permission for the same. The BJP, in its reaction, said that it will make its stand known very soon after consulting party leaders in New Delhi. The state government was also under pressure from Opposition parties to ban the yatra, which they alleged, was conceived to incite “communal tension” in the state. This is not the first time that the Palaniswami government has refused to oblige BJP during the pandemic – in August, the administration stood firm on its decision not to allow public celebrations of Vinayagar Chaturthi despite BJP's repeated pleas for reconsideration.

The ruling AIADMK asked its saffron ally to drop the plans to take out the rally in the interest of the people of the state. The BJP said the party high command would be consulted before announcing the next plan of action. Hours after the state government made a submission in the Madras High Court on the matter, Chief Minister K Palaniswami said it was not "legally" possible to permit the yatra, slated from November 6 to December 6. "Legally it cannot be permitted. The Central and state governments have come out with rules that rallies cannot be taken out," he said in an apparent reference to the Covid-19 protocols against large religious gatherings. Under those provisions, "permission cannot be given," he said. The BJP, under its state chief L Murugan, had announced taking out the Vel Yatra in honour of Lord Muruga, in the wake of the Kanda Sashti Kavacham controversy, where a YouTube channel had allegedly denigrated the Tamil hymn song in praise of the God. Vel, a spear-like weapon of Lord Muruga, is worshipped by the faithful as a destroyer of evil. The rally was scheduled to start from Tiruttani and end at Tiruchendur. With the government making its stand clear in the Madras high court on the matter, BJP should drop the plans in the interest and wellbeing of the people during the pandemic times, senior AIADMK leader and state fisheries minister D Jayakumar said. The government was duty-bound to protect the people against the dreaded infection, Jayakumar said adding the state government has declined permission for the Vel Yatra only to ensure that there was no second or third Covid-19 wave in Tamil Nadu. He warned that law would take its own course if anyone violated the restrictions. "The law is the same for everyone. We cannot compromise on people's health and wellbeing," he told reporters in Chennai and pointed out that the entire world is battling against the corona crisis. "People's support is required in this fight against the pandemic. Due to the government's effective measures, the pandemic has been contained and the virus spread is on the decline," the minister said. World over, medical experts have warned of the second and third wave of the coronavirus, he noted. "Even if we anticipate this and take precautionary measures in Tamil Nadu, massive yatra like this will give room to spread of the infection among the community," he reasoned. To a question, he replied it would be better for the BJP if it did not emphasis on this yatra and give it up for now. "Our objective is to create a coronavirus-free Tamil Nadu. The vaccine is the ultimate remedy for this. But this may take three months or go beyond a year. The government is duty-bound to protect the people from the infection. We feel that this yatra is not needed at this juncture," he said. The minister said the ruling AIADMK was for social justice and followed the principles of its late leaders like C N Annadurai, M G Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa. Meanwhile, BJP state vice president K S Narendran, in-charge of the yatra, said the party's Central leadership has been approached for their opinion. "We will announce the dates soon. Like our president L Murugan has already said the Vel will pounce and proceed no matter what hurdles come," he said. Earlier, opposition parties in the state had voiced concern against BJP's yatra in these pandemic times.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/legally-not-possible-to-permit-bjps-vel-yatra-says-tamil-nadu-chief-minister-k-palaniswami-911801.html

Hours after his father submitted an application before the Election Commission seeking to register a party under the name All India Thalapathy Vijay Makkal Iyakkam, Vijay issued a statement saying he has nothing to do with the move and asked his fans not to join the party just because it had his name. “I came to know through the media that my father has launched a political party. I would like to clarify that I have no direct or indirect connection with the party launched by him,” he said in the statement, released by his publicist. He also told his fans that there was no compulsion for them to join the party just because it has been launched by his father. “There is no connection between our movement (fan's club) and the political party. I am also making it clear that appropriate action will be taken if they use the name of our movement or my photo,” he said. Chandrasekar told the media that Vijay has nothing to do with the party as it was his initiative. The public spat is being interpreted as the culmination of a cold war between the father and son who have been divided on political plunge. It is understood that Chandrasekar wants Vijay to take a plunge in politics, while the actor is not in favour of the idea.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/actor-vijay-distances-himself-from-party-launched-by-his-father-911824.html

The court has also clarified that prior sanction for prosecution is not required against Roshan Baig. The petition was filed by Baig, his wife Sabiha Roshan and son Ruman Baig Rehman, seeking quashing of the entire proceedings before the special court, set up to deal with criminal cases against MPs/MLAs. The Lokayukta police had registered a case against the petitioners in 2012. The police submitted a 'B' report (closure report) in 2014. In May 2018, the special court took cognizance against Sabiha and Ruman. In respect to Roshan Baig, the special court directed the investigating officer to secure sanction for prosecution from the competent authority since he was an MLA and a cabinet minister. The special public prosecutor submitted before the High Court that prima facie material in the case revealed that the accused possessed disproportionate assets of Rs 56.71 lakh. Justice John Michael Cunha observed that the special court judge has assigned cogent reasons to reject the 'B' report and the procedure is in accordance with the law. The court held that prior sanction for prosecution is not necessary against Baig since he ceased to hold the office which he held as a public servant at the time of the commission of the offence.    On the rejection of the 'B' report filed by the police, the high court observed that the magistrate is not bound by the opinion or conclusion of the investigating officer. The court said the investigating officer filed the 'B' report on the ‘erroneous understanding of the law’ that possession of disproportionate assets within 10% of the total income does not qualify as disproportionate assets, based on a Supreme Court decision. “This decision does not lay down any invariable rule that in all cases if the disproportionate assets possessed by the accused are less than 10% of the total income, the offence is not made out,” the court said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/baig-family-members-to-face-trial-in-da-case-911436.html

Earlier this week, Shivakumar was given a presentation by Gujarat-headquartered DesignBoxed that offered a strategic outlook for the party going forward. This firm has designed political campaigns for elections in Rajasthan, Punjab, Chhattisgarh among others.  In the past, Shivakumar met political strategist Prashant Kishor and a company that designed Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy’s election campaign among others, sources said.  "Shivakumar is seeking professional help in assessment and surveys at the ground level in assembly constituencies. He is also looking at a concerted social media strategy for the party," a party leader who attended the DesignBoxed meeting with Shivakumar said. This meeting was set up by Congress MP Karti Chidambaram. Youth Congress leader Mohammed Nalapad has already onboarded DesignBoxed for his political strategy.  Another senior leader said the idea behind roping in professional firms was to help the party counter the BJP effectively during polls. "The BJP has a paid army that can be dismantled in Delhi and set up in Bengaluru within a fortnight. We need campaign machinery like that.”  Internally, those in Shivakumar’s camp are trying to get him to mend his image in what is being seen as a game of one-upmanship with Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Siddaramaiah. "If he’s going to be the chief ministerial candidate, he has to shed the tags of being 'bande' (rock) and troubleshooter," a leader loyal to Shivakumar said, adding that his 'acceptability' in the Lingayat-strong north Karnataka was crucial.  Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar, both seen as power centres, have kept mum on claims made by some leaders projecting each of them as the next chief minister.  Apparently, for the November 3 bypolls, they had the following arrangement: The Sira ticket went to former minister TB Jayachandra, who was Siddaramaiah’s pick. The Rajarajeshwarinagar ticket choice of debutant Kusuma Hanumantharayappa was Shivakumar’s.  "Even if we say that Siddaramaiah has a say in 65 constituencies with MLAs loyal to him, Shivakumar should look at another 100 constituencies where MLAs can support him. To do this, he needs professional help in assessments while deciding on tickets," the leader quoted above said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/dk-shivakumar-turns-to-professional-firms-to-get-congress-in-shape-911466.html

Recommendation will be made for geographical indication (GI) tag for two varieties of paddy -- Kaggabhatta in Kumta, Rajamudi from Hassan - and 'Kare Eeshadu', a variety of mango from Ankola. Previously, the Karnataka Agricultural Price Commission, had worked for getting GI tag for Rajamudi, the rice patronised by the royal famly of Mysuru, hoping to build a brand for the rice grown in the old Mysuru region. The decisions were made at the Board meeting on October 22, where officials decided to work with the Fisheries Department to open aquatic sanctuaries at seven strategic places with rich diversity of fish in Karnataka. This is in addition to the eight fish sanctuaries already declared. The board decided to declare the Adinarayanaswamy Hill in Chikkaballapur District's Gudibande Taluk as a state biodiversity heritage site in recognition of its flora. The Mahimaranga Hill in Nelamangala, Antaragange Hill in Kolar will also get the same treatment. The board will also recommend that the Shakunagiri Hill in Chikmagalur be added to the nearby Hogrekan Giri Biodiversity Heritage spot. Urumbi, an area on the banks of Kumaradhara river in Dakshina Kannada district, has been recognised as a vulnerable biodiversity site and a declaration in this regard will be made soon. Recommendation will be made to declare the Mundige lake at Sonda village in Sirsi taluk (Uttara Kannada) district, which has been recognised as a host for herons, as a bird sanctuary.

After interrogating Vinay for more than 10 hours, CBI officials produced him before the second additional district court at 6 pm and sought three-day custody. However, judge Panchakshari H remanded him to judicial custody for one day. The judge told CBI officials to produce Vinay before the court by 11.30 am on Friday. Amid tight security, Vinay was taken to Hindalga jail in Belagavi. Yogeshgouda, a ZP member from the BJP, was hacked to death in Dharwad in June 2016. Subsequently, following a plea by his family, the case was handed over to the CBI. Before producing him in the court, the CBI took him to the district civil hospital for a Covid-19 test and a general health check-up. Earlier in the day, the CBI team reached Kulkarni’s house and issued him a notice to appear before it for interrogation. Accompanied by his daughter, Kulkarni reached the Dharwad sub-urban police station at 7 am. Another team of CBI, which had picked up Vijay Kulkarni, younger brother of Vinay, from his residence in Hubballi, arrived at the police station at 8.30 am.  As the news spread, Congress workers gathered in front of the police station and staged a protest. They accused the BJP government of vendetta politics. Yogeshgouda was murdered at his gym in Saptapur, Dharwad on June 15, 2016, by a group of unknown persons. The Hubballi-Dharwad police arrested Basavaraj Muttagi and six others on June 17, in connection with the murder over a land dispute. Gouda’s family accused the then Dharwad Rural MLA Vinay Kulkarni of masterminding the murder. The state government handed over the case to the CID. With the change of guard in the state, the Yediyurappa government handed over the case to the CBI last year. The CBI nabbed seven persons, allegedly hired to eliminate Gouda.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/former-karnataka-minister-vinay-kulkarni-arrested-by-cbi-in-murder-case-of-bjp-worker-911713.html

Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar made this observation while rejecting the bail petitions filed by Ragini Dwivedi, Sanjana Galrani and Prashant Ranka. The counsel, appearing for the petitioners, argued that whenever the seized substance is in a small quantity and if it is a case of mere consumption, the offence is bailable and it was in this background that the Bombay High Court granted bail to Rhea. “There is no denial of the fact that bail was granted to the accused in that case, but it was based on factual circumstances,” the court said. It also said that the offence punishable under Section 27 (A) of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) is not quantity specific. On the investigation, the court said that the evidence, collected by the investigating officer so far, rules out the argument that a false case has been registered. After going through the police diary, provided by the special public prosecutor, the court observed that some of the accused were in regular contact with peddlers which is “diagrammatically depicted.” It was mentioned by the prosecution that Ragini filled water in the bottle when she was asked to give her a urine sample. The court noted this and observed that if it is true, it shows her intention to mislead the investigation. “If anticipatory bail is sought in the background of the accusation of committing offences having adverse implication on the society, the discretion must be exercised with great circumspection to strike a balance between personal liberty of a person and the interest of society” the order stated. While rejecting the petitions, the court said that “bothersome brutality dangerously affecting the young is substance abuse.” “The ill effect of this substance not just costs the physical and psychological abilities of an individual but spreads a dark shadow on the future of the society. The courts should not remain oblivious of this malady even while deciding application for bail,” the court said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/factual-circumstances-not-same-in-rhea-s-wood-drug-cases-hc-911803.html

Shivakumar alleged that the arrest was a ploy to end the political career of Kulkarni. Ruling BJP criticised his comments over the arrest, with Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan accusing the Congress of politicising the issue. JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy, meanwhile, urged officials to investigate the case without being politically influenced, so as to ensure justice for the victim’s family. Alleging that few BJP leaders from north Karnataka had succeeded in politically using the case against Kulkarni, Shivakumar expressed confidence that he will be protected by law. “None of our workers have made any mistake,” he said, adding that the case was being pursued to weaken the party. “You enquire him as many times as you want. But don’t yield to political pressure,” he told CBI, requesting them to fulfill their duty but not be used as a political weapon. Noting that former minister K J George had to resign after he was named in the death of a DySP, Shivakumar noted that High Court has given him a clean chit. He accused the BJP of blaming the Congress for recent riots in Bengaluru on Congress leaders, even when the leaders were innocent. Expressing reservations on the remarks, Ashwath Narayan advised against giving a political colour to the detention of Kulkarni by CBI. “Every time there is Income Tax, ED or CBI raid, or if someone is arrested (by these agencies), it is not right to cry ‘political vendetta’ and blame the BJP,” he said, responding to a question. Law will take its own course, he added. JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy said that there were suspicions about the murder of Yogeshgouda among the general public. “Officials should investigate to bring out the truth and provide justice for the victim’s family,” he said, adding that CBI should not be influenced during the probe. There were talks of Kulkarni’s possible jump to the BJP in October, which did not materialise.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/cong-cries-political-vendetta-over-vinay-kulkarnis-detention-911806.html

The Prisons Department submitted a statement before the court on the overcrowding in the prisons. The affidavit stated that the overall occupancy percentage of prisons in the state at present stands at 96% with the population of 14,535 as against the capacity of 15,083. According to the affidavit, of the 47 prisons across the state, 13 are overcrowded. The affidavit further stated that several proactive steps were taken after the order of the Supreme Court in March 2020. This includes the transfer of 575 prisoners from nine overcrowded prisons to 15 other prisons. The affidavit said the overall occupancy percentage was reduced from 110 to 96. As an augmentation process, four central and four taluk prisons with an additional capacity of 4,339 prisoners are at various stages of construction. “This will increase the total accommodation capacity for prisons in the state from the present 15,083 to 19,422, thus augmenting the capacity of state prisons by almost 29%,” the affidavit stated.    It also stated that as on March 23, 2020, the overcrowding at the Bengaluru Central Prison was almost 134%. The overcrowding was brought down by almost 22% by creating an additional capacity of 760 by creating a new prison block.

While there were encouraging signs in August when the department was able to shore up Rs 969 crore - 83% of its revenue target set for the month - it has been able to generate Rs 831 crore (70.69%) and Rs 933 crore (74.82%) in September and October, respectively. Authorities expect registrations to pick pace in the coming months. According to CREDAI, it would take at least six months for ‘normalcy’ to prevail, as uncertainties over the market has pushed even active real estate buyers into a shell. Data shows that while the Department had achieved below the target in September and October months of the previous fiscal too, the difference was more pronounced this year owing to higher targets. In the previous fiscal, the Department had mopped up Rs 878.26 crore (88.02%) and Rs 902.36 crore (88.77%) respectively. Though the Department had reached 90.26% of the monthly target for May this year, it was against a low target of Rs 397.7 crore. During the same month in 2019-20, the Department reached Rs 1058.95 crore - 165.5 crore above the target.  The overall target for the first seven months of 2020-21 fiscal was Rs 6,151.37 crore of which the Department has shored up Rs 4,610.12 crore - 74.94%. Last year, it collected Rs 5,572.23 crore - 86.62% of the target of 6,432 crore from the corresponding period. Realtors’ apex body CREDAI Bengaluru chairperson Suresh Hari said that property registrations will pick pace only after everything is opened up. “Economy is kicking back. But, till the disease is around and until a vaccine is developed, there won’t be normalcy,” he said. The next Deepavali festival season was crucial, he said, to prevent the second wave. “We can probably come out of the woods during April,” he added. Sources in the Department told DH that it will be difficult to reach the targets set for the fiscal due to the effect of the pandemic. Though registrations have improved compared to previous months, the Department was expecting a surge during the last two-quarters of the fiscal, sources added. KP Mohan Raj, Inspector General of Registration and Commissioner of Stamps told DH that registrations were picking pace. “Compared to the revenue generated in September 2019, we have raised Rs 31 crore more this year,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/coronavirus-prop-registrations-slump-for-seven-months-on-trot-911819.html

All sectors are facing losses. People are left worried without jobs and salaries. It is better to postpone the hike,” the former CM said in a tweet. Hiking tariffs from 20 paise to 50 paise per unit and 40 paise on average will burden the people, Kumaraswamy said, urging the government to roll back its decision. The Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission announced a revision of power tariffs on Wednesday. As a result, there will be an average of 5.49% increase in power bills from November. Though the revised tariff was supposed to be introduced from April this year, it was delayed due to various factors. Kumaraswamy said that the hike was against the interests of the people, in the wake of the pandemic and the devastating floods in North Karnataka.  ‘Confident of Sira victory’ Kumaraswamy said that the JD(S) was confident of retaining the Sira constituency, while it would fare better than the 2018 Assembly polls in RR Nagar. BJP state vice president B Y Vijayendra has apparently said that they would win by a margin of 20,000 votes in Sira. “They think that they have successfully lured Sira voters with money as they did in KR Pet,” he said, adding that people of Sira were firmly behind JD(S). To a question, Kumaraswamy said that there could be some additions to the JD(S) leadership to strengthen the party ahead of the Gram Panchayat polls.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/roll-back-power-tariff-hike-h-d-kumaraswamy-tells-govt-911820.html

A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik will hear the plea on Thursday afternoon. Goswami was arrested on Wednesday from his residence at Lower Parel in Mumbai for allegedly abetting the suicide of interior designer Anvay Naik, and was taken to the Alibaug police station in neighbouring Raigad district. He was later produced before a magistrate's court in Alibaug which remanded him in judicial custody till November 18. Goswami is currently kept at a local school which has been designated as a Covid-19 centre for the Alibaug prison. In his petition, Goswami has challenged his "illegal arrest" and sought an urgent order of stay in the investigation into the case and also a direction to the police to release him immediately. The plea has also sought the FIR against him to be quashed. It alleged that Goswami was assaulted by the police team that barged into his house on Wednesday. "He has been wrongly and illegally arrested in a motivated, false and closed case. This is another attempt of political witch-hunt and vendetta politics against the petitioner and his channel," the petition said. "The arrest was conducted in blatant violation of the fundamental rights to life and personal liberty of the petitioner (Goswami) and his dignity. The petitioner and his son were assaulted and dragged into the police van when Goswami was arrested," it added. As per the plea, the investigation into the case was closed last year and a closure report was filed which was accepted by Chief Judicial Magistrate of the Alibaug court by an order dated April 16, 2019. "It is shocking that a case that was decisively closed has been reopened with the sole purpose of misusing power, concocting facts and forcibly arresting the petitioner in a prime facie act of revenge and vengeance for his news coverage which questioned those in power in Maharashtra," the petition said. The petition claimed that in May 2018, the police had recorded the statements of Goswami and two senior officials of the Republic TV and after conducting a thorough investigation, the case was closed. "The petitioner had at that time provided detailed documents to the police in relation to the business transactions with the deceased's company and had fully cooperated in the matter," the petition said. It also said Goswami's company ARG Outlier Pvt Ltd had paid over 90 per cent of the amount due to the deceased Anvay Naiks company Concorde Designs, as per the contract. "In July 2019, the entire balance amount due was transferred to the bank account of Naik's company but the amount returned because the account was inoperative," the petition said. It said the petitioner has been fully cooperating with the police in the past and will continue doing so in future also.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/arnab-goswami-moves-bombay-high-court-challenges-his-illegal-arrest-by-police-911543.html

Paying rich tributes to Dadasaheb Phalke, the father of Indian cinema, the chief minister said that a “Marathi-manoos” laid the foundation of the film industry. “Maharashtra was janmabhoomi and karmabhoomi of Dadasaheb Phalke…today the biggest national award is named after him…we will continue the rich tradition,” he said. Responding to suggestions from various stakeholders, he said that the State government will work in creating affordable theatres and cinema houses. “Today for sound mixing, people go to London…why cannot we have such facilities in Mumbai,” he said at the deliberations hosted by Maharashtra Film, Stage and Cultural Development Corporation Ltd.Without going into specifics, he said that the government would sit together with stakeholders of the entertainment industry and work together creating mega facilities and would even scout for a location. Thackeray’s statement assumes significance in the wake of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s plan to make a mega FilmCity in his state close to the national capital of New Delhi. “Film production in Maharashtra today should be of good quality. For that you need technology, you need space, make an action plan accordingly. Set priorities, we will definitely work on it,” Thackeray assured. According to him, films are part of people’s life. “When you see a film, you often feel that you are part of it…knowingly or unknowingly you become part of it,” he said. “This industry is seen only as a medium of entertainment. It is easy to make one cry but it is difficult to make one laugh or smile,” he said, adding that the entertainment industry has always come forward to wipe out tears of people. “You have always been with us during crises including the Covid-19 pandemic. Rohit Shetty made a beautiful and effective public awareness film with Amitabh Bachchan and other actors,” he said. Thackeray also recalled how his late father Bal Thackeray used to make show cards. My father was a politician but also an artist, a cartoonist,” he said, recalling the family’s association with legends like Dev Anand, Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Dharmendra, Rajesh Khanna, Mohammed Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Mukesh and Manna Dey. “Its like family,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/if-up-govt-capable-of-taking-mumbais-filmcity-they-can-maharashtra-cm-911624.html

A police team along with forensic experts also went to the spot in the morning to collect samples. Deputy Commissioner of Police A M Muniya said an FIR will be registered after a thorough probe into the incident. Twelve labourers, including five women, were killed and 10 others were injured after a portion of the godown located on Pirana-Piplaj road on the city's outskirts collapsed on Wednesday morning following a powerful explosion. Primary investigation revealed that one Buta Bharwad owned this premises having several godowns separated with walls. He gave these godowns on rent to several parties, the police official said. A small portion of the godown was given on rent to one Hetal Sutariya, owner of chemical trading firm Sahil Enterprise, he said. "Sutariya had stored various hazardous chemicals, including hydrogen peroxide, in his rented godown. It is suspected that the explosion occurred when some mixing process was going on," the official said. The explosion destroyed three to four adjoining godowns where labourers were packing textiles and garments, the police official said. "We have initiated a detailed probe into the incident and started preliminary questioning of Sutariya and Bharwad. The police will lodge an FIR after completion of the investigation," he said. Meanwhile, a team of the city's Narol police, who have started questioning Bharwad and Sutariya, reached the spot on Thursday morning with forensic experts for collecting samples, police inspector S A Gohil said. After the incident, the Gujarat government on Wednesday announced an ex-gratia compensation of Rs 4 lakh to the kin of each deceased. However, family members of the victims are not satisfied with the announcement and have decided not to claim the bodies, currently kept at the civic-run VS Hospital here. "I lost my son in this explosion. He wanted to financially help the family. What will do with Rs 4 lakh? The government must give Rs 20 lakh as compensation and book those responsible for the tragedy," a relative of one of the victims told reporters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-police-summons-godown-owner-tenant-after-explosion-911643.html

Goswami was arrested on Wednesday from his residence at Lower Parel in Mumbai for allegedly abetting the suicide of architect and interior designer Anvay Naik, and was taken to the Alibaug police station in neighbouring Raigad district. He was produced before a magistrate's court which remanded him in judicial custody till November 18. Goswami then moved the HC against the "illegal arrest", sought a stay to the investigation and a direction to the police to release him. He has also sought that the FIR against him be quashed. A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik on Thursday directed Goswami to make the complainant in the case, Akshata Naik, Anvay's wife, a respondent to his plea. "We have to hear all the parties concerned before considering the interim relief sought. We have to also hear the complainant as the family of the deceased has filed a petition here seeking transfer of the probe," the bench said. "The respondents (the Maharashtra government and the complainant) are entitled to respond....We will consider the interim relief sought tomorrow," the court said. Senior counsel Aabad Ponda, appearing for Goswami, said a bail plea filed before the Alibaug magistrate's court has been withdrawn. "The magistrate had not given clarity on when the bail plea would be heard and had also expressed difficultly in hearing the same as the case lies in the jurisdiction of the sessions court. "Hence, we are seeking for interim bail here in high court," Ponda said. Senior counsel Harish Salve, also appearing for Goswami, argued that no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution if he was released on bail. The court, however, said it cannot consider the issue of bail without giving the respondents a chance to argue. Ponda also argued that the police have resurrected a dead case in which a closure report had been filed and accepted by the Chief Judicial Magistrate at Alibaug in Raigad district by an order dated April 16, 2019. The petition alleged that Goswami and his son were assaulted by the police team when it arrested the journalist in a "motivated, false and closed case". "This is another attempt of political witch-hunt and vendetta politics against the petitioner and his channel," it alleged. A case that was "decisively closed" was reopened for forcibly arresting the petitioner "in a prima facie act of revenge and vengeance for his news coverage", it said. It claimed that in May 2018, the police had recorded the statements of Goswami and two senior officials of Republic TV, and he had also provided documents to the police about the business transactions with Naik's company. Goswami's company ARG Outlier had paid over 90 per cent of the amount due to Naik's firm Concorde Designs as per the contract, it claimed.

Both were released on bail later, a police official said. A case was registered against Kakade and his wife in August this year on a complaint lodged by Usha's brother Yuvraj Dhamale at Chartushringi police station here. Offences under IPC sections 500 (defamation), 504 (intentional insult to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) were registered against them. "We arrested Kakade and his wife today and produced them before the court. Since the sections in the case are bailable, the couple got bail," the police officer said. The police has also filed a charge sheet in the case, he added. As per the complainant, he and Kakade were partners in construction business once. In 2010 Dhamale started his own construction business and since then they were having disputes.

According to the state guidelines announced on Wednesday, cinema halls, multiplexes and drama theatres outside containment zones can operate with 50 per cent seating capacity and a host of dos and don’ts, including ensuring physical distancing, sanitisation and no eatables allowed. Given the extensive guidelines, no theatres opened on Thursday. "The permission came just yesterday. A week will go into planning and strategising, training the staff, sanitising, getting the films, etc. We have started working towards this. We intend to reopen in Diwali week (next Friday)," leading distributor Akshaye Rathi, who owns eight theatres in the state, told PTI. The decision has come as a relief for the business that was crippled due to the lockdown in March to contain the spread of Covid-19. "We are very happy with this decision of the government. This is first step of normalcy for us. The sector is crippled financially and we would need support of the government, production houses, and content creators to revive it," Rathi added. Cinepolis India CEO Devang Sampat added that they will open their doors in the state from Sunday. “We will start opening from Sunday onwards in a phased manner,” he said. Several cinema hall owners in the state, the hub of the Hindi film industry, also welcomed the decision that will help the industry revive but wish the green signal had come earlier. The Centre allowed reopening of theatres and multiplexes on October 15, and halls in several places, including Delhi and parts of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, resumed functioning in accordance with the new normal. But states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Chhattisgarh remained closed. Nitin Datar, president of the Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India, said it will take time to plan things. “Most cinema halls will reopen from November 13. The order came yesterday while the SOPs have come today. It takes time to do all the necessary planning like which film to purchase and screen and training the staff,” he told PTI. Datar, who owns a theatre in Mumbai that is under renovation and another in Satara, said they are planning to resume activity at the Satara hall. "We have called our staff members. We are thinking about the films to showcase. The only problem is of content, what new to show. We will open by Diwali week, which is from Monday,” he added. Rajasthan-based distributor and exhibitor Raj Bansal agreed. "It has come out a little late because we may not be ready to release a big film on Diwali. Wish it was decided about a week ago, so we would have been in a better situation. But this is a welcome decision because Maharashtra is important as maximum business comes from the state. We will now look forward to big releases," Bansal told PTI. Lack of new content and big films to entice audiences to overcome their fears of contracting the disease and enter a cinema hall is a major stumbling block to audiences returning. Rathi is looking forward to screening Christopher Nolan's espionage thriller "Tenet" and the upcoming comedy satire "Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari", starring Manoj Bajpayee, Diljeet Dosanjh and Fatima Sana Shaikh. But there is no commitment on when biggies such as Akshay Kumar-starrer cop drama “Sooryavanshi” and Ranveer Singh-starrer “83” will release. Manoj Desai, executive director of G7 Multiplex and Maratha Mandir, said a final decision is yet to be taken on which films he would screen, he's already considering several options, including the old staple “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge”. "Preparation are on in full swing. We are planning to start showing 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' in the matinee show at Maratha Mandir," Desai said of the popular romance drama, which celebrated its silver jubilee on October 20. Desai told PTI he had also procured the licence for "Baaghi 3", "Angrezi Medium" and a Marathi film at their other theatres. Both “Baaghi 3” and “Angrezi Medium”, actor Irrfan’s swansong, had released in March just before theatres closed down. The extraordinary situation led to several films, including Amitabh Bachchan's "Gulabo Sitabo", Vidya Balan’s "Shakuntala Devi" and "Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl" headlined by Janhvi Kapoor, being released direct to digital platforms. Rathi said discussions are currently on whether to screen films which were released on OTT platforms, adding it will be a joint decision of theatres, producers and exhibitors. Rajendra Singh, chief programming, Inox, said Maharashtra is one of the biggest states and highest contributor of 25-30 per cent to the box office. With 90 per cent of the market now open, Singh hopes new films start releasing. "We will open with old content as no new films are releasing now. As of now, (we will start work) in 225 screens across India barring few states where permissions are yet to come," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/permitted-to-reopen-but-no-big-screen-movies-in-maharashtra-yet-911732.html

The tenant who had stored drums filled with chemicals in the godown on Pirana-Piplaj Road on the city's outskirts was also arrested, an official said. As a powerful explosion ripped through the structure on Wednesday morning, a part of it collapsed and 12 labourers, including five women, were killed and 10 others were injured. An FIR was registered at Narol police station on Thursday evening and godown owners Buta Bharwad and Nanu Bharwad and tenant Hetal Sutaria were arrested, said Joint Commissioner of Police Gautam Parmar. They were booked under various IPC sections including 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance) and 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house). "Preliminary investigation has revealed that the explosion was the result of some chemical reaction. The picture will be clearer after we receive a report from forensic experts," Parmar told reporters. The Bharwad duo own the whole premises having several godowns separated by walls and have rented them out, the police said. One section was rented out to Sutaria, the owner of chemical trading firm Sahil Enterprise, said Deputy Commissioner of Police A M Muniya. "Sutaria had stored various hazardous chemicals, including hydrogen peroxide, in the godown. He did not have any license to store such chemicals. It is suspected that the explosion occurred when some mixing process was going on," Muniya said in the morning. The explosion destroyed three or four adjoining godowns where labourers were packing textiles and garments. The state authorities, meanwhile, have ordered a crackdown on godowns storing hazardous chemicals illegally in Ahmedabad and other cities of the state. A two-member team of IAS officials is conducting a probe into the incident.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/ahmedabad-godown-explosion-three-held-for-culpable-homicide-911844.html
