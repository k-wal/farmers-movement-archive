The prospects of a Donald Trump victory are bleak but not many are ruling out a repeat of the kind we saw four years ago, when Hillary Clinton, the then favourite according to most pollsters, lost the Electoral College though she got nearly three million more popular votes than Trump. Late reports have it that in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state and the place he was raised in, Biden had a teeny five-point lead. Pennsylvania voted Trump in the last election by a difference of 0.72%, the narrowest seen in 172 years! A small set of people therefore will eventually decide who becomes president. Twists and turns such as these bring to mind the words of historian Will Durant, who wrote, “History is largely the battle of a few minorities, the winner of which is then lauded as the victor by the majority.” In sum, this is not an election in which the outcome is as clear as it is in the minds of many we might think of as “right-thinking individuals” who worry that Trump is unfit for any office, let alone the office known by the odd-sounding acronym of POTUS. Even The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, a large newspaper in Pennsylvania which has endorsed Trump (the first time it has endorsed a Republican candidate since 1972), put out this caveat on his failings: “We share the embarrassment of millions of Americans who are disturbed by the president’s unpresidential manners and character — his rudeness and put-downs and bragging and bending of the truth.”  Yet, the paper’s editorial board endorsed Trump for his support of the petrochemicals sector and criticised Biden for his promise to end fracking, and what the paper called his other “cuckoo California dreams” of green jobs. That is only a partisan endorsement of a candidate based on local priorities, but one cannot deny that there is a lot else that’s cuckoo about America today. The entire election drama is fascinating in that it provides some insight into the working (or the unravelling) of democracy in a nation that is acknowledged as the only Superpower today. Wild ideas have gained currency, the fringe has gone mainstream, decency is at a discount, and reasonableness is discarded as unreasonable. The first and so far only nation to land a man on the moon and to put in place money and technology to explore deep space today has a significant proportion of its people believing in looney tales. Consider the conspiracy theory that goes by the name QAnon, which has found surprising support and gone from being a fringe movement to some force in the election. Trump has refused to condemn the far-right movement, responding to a question by almost playing along, “If I can help save the world from problems, I’m willing to do that.” One report said that at least 19 House Republican candidates who have supported QAnon are on the ballot. The QAnon “theory” holds that America is run by a parallel State that works with cannibalistic elites and Satan-worshipping paedophiles, and President Trump is the only one who can stop them. In the conspiracy are linked, of course, Biden, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, liberal Hollywood stars, and business magnates – almost everyone who questions Trump and supports the Democrats. The story line carries juicy and wild details that can trap the uninformed, but the wilder it gets, the faster it appears to spread. In March, the non-profit polling organisation Pew reported that 23% of Americans polled on the issue had heard about QAnon; by August-September, that number had jumped to 47%. One might ask about the health of a nation, the strength of its inner reserve or the moral fibre running through society for these narratives to take hold, for one man like Trump to come along and drag the conversation down to a level that shames the nation and to stand tall amidst all the ruin he has inflicted. The questions should hold whether Trump wins or not. That he has been a part of the system for four years, almost unchecked, and comes as a close contender for a second run tells us about the rottenness of a system that is flush with data points, surveys, sophisticated analyses and swing meters. We are only one conspiracy theory away from embracing the devil. This is the price to be paid when almost an entire generation of citizens has grown on a diet of modern-day entertainment-laced debate that ignores the substance and overemphasises the form. What is one to expect when presidential election outcomes can be decided based on the soundbite and the headline, or the appearance of a candidate, or based on debates that are like an elaborate attention-grabbing drama? As candidates speak in a much-hyped event called the ‘presidential debates’, television keeps up the charade with ridiculous minute-by-minute tracking of moods, swings and the so-called pulse of the “undecideds”. We can do ever more sophisticated studies, representative and larger samples or complex quantitative analyses, but in those numbers is lost the larger story of a nation that did not see or know or even learn that it is headed to disaster, and that the enemy lies within. This is the tyranny of the smart soundbite – it appears to catch the attention, get the cheers and draw the crowds but it dumbs down everybody and delivers a system where soundbites, not substance, will decide the most important issues of the day. In the 1985 book Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, the author Neil Postman writes: “When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk…” The warning is apt, for America, and equally for India.

This “enigma of two Karnatakas within Karnataka”, one with high per capita income and the other with high poverty, which was highlighted by 15th Finance Commission Chairman N K Singh some time ago, has once again found mention in the latest report of the Public Affairs Centre, a think-tank headed by former ISRO chief G Kasturirangan, which assesses adequacy and quality of governance. Among large states, Karnataka is second after Kerala in terms of growth but when it comes to equality, it ranks 12th, much behind other bigger states like Punjab, Gujarat and Rajasthan. In fact, apart from Telangana, Karnataka is the only state in the South to have a negative ranking on the parameter of equality. While growth is assessed in terms of gross state domestic product (GSDP), employment levels and infrastructure development like construction of schools, equality is measured in terms of access to services and the level of malnutrition and inequalities prevalent in the society. In effect, this means that though Karnataka represents an engine of India’s growth, contributing about 8% of the country’s GDP and boasts of a per capita income higher than the national average, the failure to ensure equitable distribution of resources has only widened the gap between the rich and the poor. Typically, Karnataka politicians and bureaucrats have taken shelter under the “injustice” meted to the state in the devolution of funds by the 15th Finance Commission. Faced with continuous years of both drought and famine, Karnataka has always complained that the lack of adequate financial support from the Centre has drained its resources. The state also claims that the delay in release of GST compensation last year and the projected shortfall in the collections in 2020-21, has only aggravated the problem.  But the real issue is not just the shortage of funds, but their inefficient deployment. While the state has maintained financial discipline by containing fiscal deficit below the stipulated ceiling, the poor control over budgetary spending has always remained a stumbling block. According to the CAG report for the year ended 2019, nearly Rs 25,000 crore of budgetary allocation to various departments had remained unutilised in the previous fiscal. This apart, there is an apparent flaw in the manner in which resources are distributed in the state. Unless the government sets right this lacuna, the wedge between the haves and the have nots will only continue to widen, making Karnataka a rich state with poor people.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/disparity-between-growth-and-equality-910072.html

Many reports, surveys and accounts have shown how badly it has been affected by the pandemic. Families also have personal experiences of the difficulties that their children have faced. Schools in the country have been shut down for over seven months now. After the first few weeks, attempts have been made to restore some form of functioning to schools, but a comprehensive survey by the NGO Pratham has shown that the results should cause serious concern. Its Annual Survey of Education Report (ASER) usually focuses on the quality of education, but this year the main message is that the very process of teaching and learning has been badly hit. The survey, which covered 30 states and UTs, shows that only about a third of the children had access to online learning; and just 11% had access to live online classes. Only one in four children received any learning material from the school and most had no smartphone. Almost 75% of the students’ interaction with schools was over WhatsApp.  The pandemic has aggravated inequality. In education, increased economic and digital inequality has badly handicapped children. Many children have shifted from private schools to government schools, many others have dropped out, and many eligible ones have not been enrolled. Only about half of the children got any support at home for learning. Some got study materials from teachers and most used textbooks instead of online material. Many parents bought smartphones for their children so they could study online but this did not always help. Some schools sent textbooks and worksheets to children, but many children did not get them. Children, whose parents are economically and educationally better off, did not fare as badly as others. But the reading to be got from the survey is that all students have been affected, with the burden falling more on those from less privileged backgrounds. Students in rural areas have been hit much harder than those in cities and towns.  Much of the academic year is gone. The responsibility of governments, schools and other authorities is to ensure that all children are taken on board and engaged in the best manner possible. Every region, state and locality may have to devise its own ways for this. Kerala and Tamil Nadu have done better than others in facilitating online teaching. Government schools in Karnataka and Kerala have done well. While trying to help the students the most in the coming months, the present situation should also be used as an opportunity to learn lessons for the future.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/pandemic-has-worsened-digital-divide-in-learning-910576.html

The knife attack happened a fortnight after the beheading of a schoolteacher in Paris. A Tunisian youth was the attacker in Nice and a Chechen was the killer in Paris. The incidents are the latest in a series of terror attacks that have rocked France after the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo republished caricatures of Prophet Muhammad. Hebdo was provocative in its decision, but it was completely wrong to react to it with violence against innocent persons, randomly chosen for killing. The attackers are immigrants who came into the country recently and seem to have been radicalised. French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to fight terrorism resolutely. The fight against terrorism is always joined at different levels, with the right security and legal measures and in terms of ideas. Every country’s response to terrorism is different, shaped by its social and political traditions, laws, historical experience and the nature of the attack on it. France has a vaunted liberal and laicite (secular) tradition and Macron has sought to formulate new laws and implement public policy in that light. He has gone to the extent of defending Charlie Hebdo’s freedom of expression. No freedom is absolute and deliberately insulting a religion cannot be a form of its expression. The dividing line between freedom and intent to hurt in specific contexts should not be lost sight of even in liberal societies where freedom and expanding its frontiers is an ideal. On the other hand, modern democracies are based on the idea of correcting prejudices and wrongs by debate and argumentation, and even peaceful protests, within the bounds of national constitutions, laws and values, not by acts of violence and terrorism. India has expressed solidarity with the people of France and extended support to Macron in the fight against terrorism. But leaders like former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who said Muslims have the “right to kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past,” and others like Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has launched a personal tirade against Macron, are not serving the cause of peace and amity, nor even of Islam. Protests by Muslims worldwide against Macron, instigated in many places by local politicians or clerics, have the effect of setting up a global ‘Muslims vs Others’ clash of civilisations. That is dangerous. Only a minuscule minority of Muslims the world over follow the creed of al Qaida or the Islamic State. They should not be justified and need to be isolated and fought.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/terrorism-can-t-be-a-response-to-any-issue-910577.html
02-11-2020||In Perspective||It’s time we called 2020 a gap year||It’s time to call 2020 a gap year.  Let our young learn invaluable life lessons from a global pandemic, the likes of which the world has not seen in a hundred years. Our children are living in an unprecedented period of history when over 43 million people worldwide and over 7.9 million in India have been infected by Covid-19. They are living in the new normal of digital lessons, remote study, sans the physical experience of a classroom. Their lives have forever changed. In April 2020, UNESCO estimated that because of the pandemic, some 1.4 billion students had been affected by school closures in nearly 166 countries. In India alone, some 320 million students were affected by school and college closures. UNESCO has called it the largest education disruption ever. Commendably, most schools, colleges and universities quickly switched to the digital platform to deliver their classes, so as to ensure that the academic year was not lost for their students. However, a digital classroom can never replace the ‘touch and feel’ experience of a physical classroom. No virtual laboratory class can bring alive a science experiment; no digital coaching can bring alive the adrenaline rush of a sports arena; and no online drama coaching can bring alive the magic of theatre.   As the US and other countries closed their borders to international students, Indian students who had secured admission in international institutions, found that their online classes did not give them the in-class experience of a foreign campus. They missed the interaction with faculty, peer learning and the real-life cultural experience of travelling to another country. Many Indian students decided to defer their admission and opted to treat 2020 as a gap year. It has not been much different for students studying in the country. Parents share the same home space to work from home as their home-schooled children. While middle grade and secondary school children appear to be managing all right with their online lessons, it’s not been the same with primary school children. Parents not only have to supervise their digital lessons, it’s also difficult to hold young children’s attention on a digital screen and a remote teacher. So much so, most young parents have resigned themselves to the inevitability of losing an academic year for their primary school children.     Gap year Research has proved that students who take a year off from formal education -- usually taken between school and college -- come back with a rich life experience, refreshed and with the ability to make better decisions on their electives for graduate study. Educational institutions in the West encourage students to take gap years and accumulate credits.   Students use the gap year to travel, explore other cultures, experience life as it happens. Sometimes, they take up volunteering with NGOs. The Gap Year Association of the US, which helps students navigate the gap year, says “Intentional gap years benefit students in some profound ways: Providing clarity and purpose, the student will have a better grasp on what they want to study; Improving learning and business potential with a global background that is tested in the real world.” The good news is that Indian college students, too, can now opt for a gap year. With the approval of the National Education Policy 2020 this year, students can enter their degree programme through multiple entries and exit points, instead of the rigid semester system. They can save the credits they accrue digitally. In fact, the National Law School of India University is reported to have offered a gap year for students who are not comfortable with online classes. While the gap year is an accepted system for students between school and college or in the middle of their graduate study, what about school students? Given the uncertainty prevailing over the safe reopening of schools or the safe conduct of exams, it’s time the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) came up with clear guidelines for schools so that they too can give their students the option of treating 2020 as a gap year, guilt-free. They should also provide a credit system so that school students can re-enter their school programme easily later on.      However, the nature of the gap year programme has to change, as travel, internships or volunteering options, involving social contact are ruled out, given the risk of Covid-19 infection. So, it’s up to the educational institutions and educationists to come up with innovative programmes for their school students. Credits could be considered for online projects revolving around the pandemic; virtual internships on climate change; sustainable living or a gardening project. Schoolchildren could be induced to improve existing skills or acquire new ones – like learning a new language, learning a new musical instrument, reading out-of- curriculum books, writing about their life experience of the pandemic, learning to paint, and so on.   As Mark Twain famously said, “Don’t let school get in the way of your education.” (The writer is a Bengaluru-based freelance journalist)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/in-perspective/it-s-time-we-called-2020-a-gap-year-910578.html

At many places such Pakistans have been created, he declared. Continuing his tirade, he said it is such places like Ullal which go on to become Pakistan and Bangladesh. Ask anyone who are majority in and around Kinya. "When we (Hindus) are outnumbered, who will safeguard our temples and daivasthana?. Who will protect our tradition and culture?," he asked.  Dr Bhat, a parent of single child himself, urged Hindus to have more children. "When there is only one child in a family, the child will not have any brother or sister and grows up to become selfish. When there are more children in a house, it brings happiness with their activities,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/rss-leader-kalladka-prabhakar-bhat-compares-ullal-to-pakistan-910400.html

The ornaments were taken out of the treasury, in the presence of Deputy Commissioner R Girish, Additional DC Kavitha Rajaram and Tahsildar Shivashankarappa. Pujas were performed and they were placed in a palanquin before taking to Hasanamba temple, amid tight police security. The temple will be opened for the year on November 5 to 17. In the wake of Covid spread, the district administration has banned devotees to the temple, as a precautionary measure. While people's representatives and dignitaries will be allowed to the temple on the first day, the public can have darshan via LED screens installed at several places in Hassan city.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/hasanamba-gold-ornaments-handed-over-to-temple-910501.html

It does not include the expenditure on illumination, which has been borne by Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA). However, a section of the people have welcomed the announcement of the accounts of expenditure for the first time, by District In-charge Minister S T Somashekar. But, some question, if the expenditure was so much for simple Dasara, what amount would they would have spent, if it was a grand Dasara? Retired professor P V Nanjaraja Urs alleged that the funds have been misused under the guise of Dasara celebrations, held from October 17 to 26. He also objected to the payment of Rs 40 lakh, as royalty to use the golden howdah for the Jamboo Savari procession, the last leg of Dasara, to the erstwhile royal family. “Over the past few years, over Rs 4 crore has been spent on the royalty towards the golden howdah, which is a government property, as per the Mysore Palace (Acquisition and Transfer) Act, 1998,” he said. Pointing out that the Dasara was held at only two venues – Mysuru Palace and Chamundi Hill – this year, Urs asks, what was the need to spend so much on the events held on government premises for just a few hundred people? “For the simple Dasara, discouraging participation of people, Rs 1.36 lakh has been spent on invitations. While Rs 38,000 is spent on just designing them, Rs 98,175 has been spent on printing. For printing just six certificates to the Covid warriors, who were felicitated during the inaugural function, Rs 8,496 has been spent. Thus, each certificate costs Rs 1,416,” he said. Urs said, “Rs 35 lakh has been spent on Dasara elephants, belonging to the government’s own Forest department. Five elephants have stayed in Mysuru for 25 days. Thus, Rs 7 lakh is spent on each elephant. It works out to Rs 28,000 per elephant per day.” B R Rajendra, a businessman, said, "Rs 41.08 lakh is spent on building temporary stage at two venues for Dasara events. With such a huge amount, a permanent two storey house could have been built for a middle-class family.” M N Chandrasekhar, a retired government employee, said that just because crores of rupees have been spent for Dasara over the past several years, we should spend similar amounts this year also blindly. “It is a good development that earlier District in-charge Minister V Somanna announced that he will give accounts of the Dasara expenditure of last year, even though it did not happen. It is better than last year, as the present district minister has given the details. We are not blaming that the minister has misused the funds. But, he should look to it that the officials give realistic expenditure. The officials are good at producing bills and clearing bills for a price,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/mysureans-suspect-misuse-of-funds-in-dasara-celebrations-910503.html

Deputy Commissioner M R Ravi has issued orders in this regard, on Sunday. However, those visiting the temple should compulsorily follow Covid guidelines, like wearing masks and social distancing, the release said. Those below 12 years and above 65 years are not allowed into the temple. Others are allowed from 4 am to 10 pm, every day. Earlier, the temple was open from 7 am to 7 pm.

02-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Shortage of ACF, RFOs, a challenge for Forest dept||The rise in crime in the forests under Chamarajanagar Circle has turned into a challenge for the Forest department. The number of forest crimes, like poaching and theft, have increased in recent months, especially after the lockdown was imposed. Vacant posts of officers is also said to be the reason for the rise in forest crime. Biligiri Ranganathaswamy Temple (BRT) Tiger Reserve has an Assistant Conservator of Forest (ACF). But, Male Mahadeshwara and Cauvery wildlife sanctuaries have no ACFs. Besides, five posts of Range Forest Officers (RFO) too are lying vacant. Three posts of RFOs are vacant at MM Hills and two posts at Cauvery wildlife sanctuaries. The RFO posts are vacant at Hanur, MM Hills and Palar range, while two posts have to be filled at Kothanuru and Sangama range in Cauvery wildlife sanctuary. The ACFs and RFOs play an important role in administrative matters and also in protecting the forests. It is difficult to monitor the employees and allot them duties, if there are no RFOs. This impacts the guarding of forests, opine the officials. Chief Conservator of Forest (CCF) Manoj Kumar said, "There is no shortage of second level employees in Chamrarajanagar regional circle, but we are facing a shortage of ACFs and RFOs. It would definitely be a burden on others and also affects their work." According to the statistics available, from January to September 2020, the Forest department has registered 47 poaching cases in the reserve forests. There are also cases of sandalwood thefts. While BRT registered 19 cases, MM Hills sanctuary saw 13 cases and Cauvery wildlife sanctuary 15 cases.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/shortage-of-acf-rfos-a-challenge-for-forest-dept-910505.html

02-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||Voting for RR Nagar, Sira bypolls to be held today||After weeks of spirited campaigning by political parties, voters from RR Nagar and Sira constituencies will exercise their franchise on Tuesday. As many as 6.75 lakh voters are eligible to exercise their franchise during the day, in a poll where both ruling and opposition parties have set their expectations high. Bypolls to RR Nagar constituency was necessitated following the resignation of Muniratna as Congress MLA in 2019. The election in Sira was announced due the demise of JD(S)’ B Sathyanarayana in August this year. Muniratna is now the BJP candidate from RR Nagar and is pitted against Congress candidate H Kusuma and JD(S)’ V Krishnamurthy. At Sira, Congress candidate T B Jayachandra is hoping for a seventh victory but is facing a tough contest from two debutantes. JD(S) has fielded Ammajamma, wife of the late MLA Sathyanarayana as a candidate, while BJP has fielded Dr CM Rajesh Gowda, son of former Congress MP C P Mudalagiriyappa. While the poll outcome is immaterial to the BJP, since it enjoys a clear majority, the results are expected to be a reflection of the public sentiment regarding the state government. In Congress, D K Shivakumar is facing his first election as KPCC president and has made all efforts to secure a victory in both the constituencies, with his brother and Congress MP DK Suresh camped at RR Nagar. Sira is expected to witness a three-way contest, but the prospects of JD(S) bolstered after JD(S) supremo campaigned for almost a week in the constituency.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/voting-for-rr-nagar-sira-bypolls-to-be-held-today-910524.html
02-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||Can't book in-laws on reference in dowry case: HC||The High Court of Karnataka has observed that a casual reference to the names of the family members in a matrimonial dispute without an allegation of active involvement would not justify taking cognisance against them. The court quashed the proceedings against the mother-in-law, brother-in-law, and sister-in-law of the complainant in a dowry harassment case. However, the proceedings against the accused husband will continue. The petitioners had moved the High Court, challenging the proceedings before a JMFC court in Udupi under Section 498-A of IPC and offences under the Dowry Prohibition Act.  The complainant’s case was that her in-laws instigated her husband to demand more dowry. The marriage had taken place on April 13, 2008, and her husband subsequently demanded and extracted more than 450 gram of gold from her. The allegation was that, on December 15, 2013, the husband along with the petitioners abused the complainant and her parents when they demanded that the gold ornaments be returned. The petitioners claimed that there was no specific allegation against them and also contended that there was a delay in lodging the complaint. The petition said that the mother-in-law was presently residing with her son, the brother-in-law of the complainant, in Australia.  While quashing the proceedings against the petitioners, Justice Ashok G Nijagannavar observed that there is a tendency to involve the entire family members of the household in the domestic quarrel taking place in the matrimonial dispute. The court pointed out that all the allegations are against the husband and except for the allegation of instigation for demanding dowry, not a single incident has been mentioned in the complaint. “Thus, the involvement of all these petitioners in the whole incident appears to be a casual inclusion of their names. Hence, it cannot be overlooked that it would be a total abuse of process of law if the proceedings are allowed to be continued as against these petitioners,” the court said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/cant-book-in-laws-on-reference-in-dowry-case-hc-910525.html

02-11-2020||National||Covid-19 facility should have provision for psychiatric consultation: Health Ministry||Highlighting that coronavirus pandemic has induced mental health concerns, both pre-existing and new-onset triggered by lifestyle restrictions and uncertain future, the Centre has issued guidelines stating that Covid-19 facilities should have provision for psychiatric consultation. The Union health ministry on Sunday issued 'Guidelines on Managing Mental Illness in Hospital Settings during Covid-19' stating there are at least three groups affected by mental health concerns during the pandemic. Research suggests that depression (present in about 30 per cent of diagnosed patients) and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (almost everybody diagnosed with Covid-19--96 per cent) could be extremely high. Secondly, pre-existent patients with psychiatric disorders may experience a recurrence or worsening of their symptoms during the pandemic. Thirdly, a wide variety of psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety (ranging from mild to severe), worries, non-specific psychological distress, depression, stress symptoms, insomnia, hallucinations, paranoid and suicidal ideations, among others, have been noted during the pandemic.   "In addition, worries related to restriction of lifestyles, issues related to special populations including children and adolescents, job losses and uncertainty about future, increase in domestic violence and child abuse have also been reported. "Therefore, there is a need for specific guidelines for medical officers and mental health professionals on how to prevent the infection and provide Covid-19 related care in hospital-based settings," the document stated. The Covid-19 pandemic has put an inordinate strain on health facilities, and posed unique challenges to mental health care delivery, both in the community and institutional and hospital settings, it said. According to the guidelines, Covid-19 facility should have a facility for consultation with a psychiatrist either in person or by tele-consultation, while admitting a person with mental illness and at no point should any psychotropic medication be stopped abruptly without a psychiatrist's advice, unless in case of a life-threatening emergency. “Also, the bed allocated for the patient should be preferably close to the nursing station to ensure he or she can be observed round-the-clock while steps must be taken to ensure that the windows are well boarded and there is no access to instruments to harm self/others,” they said. Information about PPE and social distancing can be provided using simple language and visual depictions or videos and contact with caregivers should be maintained via video-call facility at set times in the day. Care-givers must be provided daily updates regarding both physical and mental health condition of the patient, the guidelines stated. The challenges faced by mental health service providers include difficulty in isolating/quarantining patients with active symptoms of mania and acute psychosis, as well as people with mental health emergencies. Also, patients with psychiatric disorders (by virtue of their symptoms) may not cooperate during swabbing and testing and thus may have to be sedated, and some of the procedures and appropriate tests may get delayed. "Staff has to be in close contact with some of the patients who are at risk of violence or suicidality and to keep a check on them frequently. "Some patients may be uncooperative or at times hostile (for example, those with delusional disorders, psychotic disorders) to the treating team, creating additional challenges to the health providers. Provisions of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 have to be complied with-particularly those related to assessment of capacity, supported admission, etc," the document highlighted. Besides, homeless persons with mental illnesses are usually brought (including those with intellectual disabilities) to Mental Health Establishments (MHEs). Such patients often fail to provide proper history and no reliable informants would be available in most cases.  Also, the lack of identity proof and valid phone number for the Covid-19 testing (prerequisite as per the ICMR guidelines) are commonly seen in this population, adding to the challenges faced by the mental health service providers, it said. "Patients and caregivers need to be encouraged not to visit OPDs of MHEs unless any emergency arises. In case of difficulty in procuring medications locally, they can contact the local/state/national helpline number services for further assistance. "Services like home visits for patients who are unable to visit the OPDs, but require clinical consultation need to be initiated," the guidelines said. The guidelines also stated that MHEs need to constitute a Hospital Infection Committee which ensures the implementation of the newer norms recommended by the health ministry during the pandemic at their establishments, so as to safely practice mental health services. As far as outpatient facilities are concerned, only appointment-based OPD consultations to prevent crowding should be encouraged. In addition, provision for telemedicine/telepsychiatry services shall be utilised for reducing the footfalls further. The document mentions guidelines for management of COVID-19 in special populations -- elderly with mental illness, perinatal women with mental illness, children and adolescents with mental illness, substance use disorder (Alcohol) and substance use disorder (Tobacco).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-facility-should-have-provision-for-psychiatric-consultation-health-ministry-910074.html

Prasad (80) had shot to fame after a video of him tearfully recounting the desperation of the months since the lockdown was shared widely across social media platforms recently. Ironically, Prasad’s despair had come to light when Wasan captured the eatery owner breaking down as he talked about his struggles in a video shared on the YouTuber’s social media account. In his complaint to police, Prasad said that Wasan shot his video and posted it online, and convinced the public on social media to donate money to the eatery owner. He further alleged that Wasan "intentionally and deliberately shared only his and his family/friends bank details and mobile numbers with the donors and collected a huge amount of donation through different modes of payments i.e bank account/wallets without providing any information to the complainant". The owner of the food joint also accused the YouTuber of not providing details of the financial transactions to him. “We received the complaint yesterday at the Malviya Nagar Police Station and the matter is being probed. No FIR has been registered yet in the case,” Atul Kumar Thakur, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South), said. After the video went viral, Baba ka Dhaba was the cynosure of many eyes across the country, including celebs from showbiz who posted appeals asking people to go there and get themselves a meal. A day after the heartbreaking video, #Babakadhaba was trending on Twitter and the food joint was flooded with more customers than it had seen in 30 years of being in business.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/baba-ka-dhaba-owner-accuses-youtuber-of-misappropriation-of-funds-910086.html

Protestors blocked tracks between Dumariya and Fatehsinghpura stations in Kota Division of West Central Railways, a Railways official said. Railways diverted 11 trains including Delhi-Mumbai Rajdhani Express, Amritsar-Bandra, Indire-Nizamuddin. "The Railways announced diversion of 11 trains on Sunday. It may divert or cancel more trains in coming days if the protest continued," the Railways official said. Though the railways suspended the operation of regular trains since March 23 to check the spread of Covid-19, it is operating special trains and freight trains. The Gujjars have been demanding the Rajasthan government for including Gujjar reservation in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, filling backlog of vacancies and giving benefit of five per cent reservation to the Most Backward Classes (MBC) in the pending recruitment process. The Gujjars have been protesting for reservation intermittently since 2007.

02-11-2020||National||Is BJP seen as an alternative to TMC in West Bengal?||There is a growing acceptance for the BJP among the masses in West Bengal as an alternative to the ruling TMC but the party has to address organisational issues in some areas, as per two internal surveys. The saffron party, which aims to unseat Mamata Banerjee's TMC from power in next year's assembly elections, had engaged two agencies to conduct separate surveys in 78,000 booths in the state to gauge people's mood, assess the strengths and weaknesses of both the BJP and its rivals and winnability of its candidates, sources privy to the development said on Monday. The party has commissioned another similar survey that will begin by the end of this month, they said. The findings of the previous surveys, conducted in 2019-end and July, have been tabled before the BJP top brass. This will be vital in preparing the party's strategy for the assembly polls due in April-May next year, they added. The second survey has found that corruption charges levelled against the TMC in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan have changed the ground realities more in favour of the BJP, the sources said. "Although there was a wave of support for the BJP in last year's Lok Sabha elections, parliamentary and assembly elections are different ball games and we don't want to take chances. So, the surveys were conducted to assess the ground realities," a BJP central leader said. The party's central unit had appointed the agencies and only a few state BJP leaders were aware of it. The party had conducted similar surveys before the Lok Sabha elections, he said. Post-Lok Sabha elections, the surveys were conducted on the strengths and weakness of the party and its rivals in an area, issues the masses were concerned about, and policies of the state government, he said. After having a limited presence in the politically polarised state for decades, the BJP has emerged as the main rival of the Trinamool Congress, winning 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal in the 2019 general elections. The saffron party had secured 40.5 per cent votes and was ahead in more than 125 of the 294 assembly seats in the state. The BJP is eyeing to win more than 220 seats in next year's elections. Both the surveys were very optimistic about the BJP's prospects in the next assembly elections, the party's central leader said. "The surveys have pointed out that there is growing resentment against the TMC government's 10-year rule and the BJP, which is now the prime opposition in the state, is expected to be the biggest beneficiary of this resentment. "However, we need to address organisational weakness in some areas and infighting among certain sections. But we are confident of plugging those gaps and ousting the TMC from power in the assembly elections," he said. The survey reports will be of immense importance for candidate selection as they will name the most popular leaders with the highest chance of winning, another BJP leader said. "For example, of the 294 constituencies, if the names are unanimous in 150 seats in both the surveys, it is quite obvious they will get the tickets if there are no major changes," he said. Apart from these three surveys, the party will collect reports from all the district units on the ground realities. All the four reports will be compiled and will reflect while preparing the manifesto, candidates and election issues, he said. "Our party conducts such surveys from time to time. I can't divulge further details," BJP state chief Dilip Ghosh said. With assembly elections just six months away, the infighting in the BJP's state unit has forced the central leadership to step in time and again to call a truce so that the squabbling doesn't become the Achilles' heel for the party in the polls, party sources said. The infighting is mainly between the old guards of the state unit who are unwilling to cede their positions to new entrants from other parties, especially the TMC, who are fighting for space in the BJP, a senior party leader said. "More than being an individual conflict, it is a clash of ideologies. The old guard feels that the party will grow on its own strength and inducting leaders from other parties will dilute its core ideological orientation. "The new entrants, on the other hand, feel that if the BJP wants to grow, it has to accept leaders from other parties and make working space for them in the party," he said. Ghosh, however, said it is a "trivial matter", which can be sorted out through dialogue. "We are a big family so these are trivial matters which can be solved through dialogue and discussions," he said. The TMC, however, mocked the surveys and said all their efforts will go in vain as the BJP lacks a mass leader like Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal. "All these surveys will fall flat on their faces as Mamata Banerjee is still the most popular mass leader in the state and the BJP doesn't have anyone to match her mass appeal," TMC secretary-general Partha Chatterjee said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/is-bjp-seen-as-an-alternative-to-tmc-in-west-bengal-910205.html

A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna listed the pleas filed against blacklisting of foreign members of Tablighi Jamaat for attending the Nizamuddin Markaz congregation in the national capital for further hearing on November 20 and asked the lower courts to expeditiously deal with their cases. Senior lawyer Maneka Guruswamy, appearing for some Jamaat members, said the pleas seeking discharge of eight people are listed before trial courts on November 10. Another senior advocate C U Singh said that revisions have been sought by the authorities in cases where some foreign members of the jamaat have been discharged. The courts should dispose of such petitions expeditiously, the bench observed. "It has become a punishment for them, even after discharge the revision applications are filed, and matters will now be heard... They are not being allowed to go back to their countries," Singh said. The top court had earlier directed the Bihar government to move the Patna High Court to seek transfer of pending criminal cases against 13 foreign Tablighi Jamaat members for alleged visa violations before a trial court for quick disposal, preferably within eight weeks of their transfer. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, had said that he did not have any objection and the trial can be consolidated as done in Delhi where a court at Saket is hearing all such cases. Prior to this, the Centre had told the Supreme Court that look out notices issued against some foreigners, who have challenged in the apex court the government's orders blacklisting several citizens of 35 countries for alleged involvement in Tablighi Jamaat activities, have been withdrawn. Mehta said the petitioners who are before the apex court would be "free to leave" India subject to no other pending proceedings, including order passed by the court, requiring their presence. As per the information available, 205 FIRs have been lodged against foreign Tablighi Jamaat members by 11 states and 2,765 such foreigners have been blacklisted so far, the Centre had said in its affidavit. Of these, visas of 2,679 foreigners (including 9 Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card holders) have been cancelled, it said, adding that the remaining 86 include Nepalese nationals who do not require a visa.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-asks-trial-courts-to-expedite-hearing-in-cases-against-foreign-tablighi-jamaat-members-910234.html

A bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde sought a response from the Centre and other authorities, after hearing briefly senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayana on behalf of petitioners Mahender Singh Rana and 37 others.

According to the petitioners, about 53 companies were set up throughout the country and around 500 innocent investors were duped more than Rs 300 crores. The main company took Rs 3 lakh for running grocery stores in May, 2019. It opened stores in Karnataka, Telangana, Goa, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, UP, Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, MP, Delhi and many other states, according to the petition. However, in April, this year, the company defaulted in payment, leaving about 500 investors high and dry. The petitioners sought investigation into criminal offence of cheating, fraud, forgery, money laundering, benami transactions, amassing of disproportionate assets and other economic offences, committed by the fraudsters involved in this gargantuan franchisee scam.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-notice-to-centre-on-plea-for-cbi-ed-probe-into-franchisee-scam-910249.html

A 34-year-old man, identified as Bijoy Sil, was found hanging from a tree near his house in Gayeshpur town on Sunday. The BJP alleged he was murdered by the TMC for leaving the ruling party in the state and joining the saffron party. The TMC has dismissed the allegation. A motorbike rally brought out by the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the youth wing of the BJP, in Gayeshpur during the bandh that started at 6 am was stopped by the police. The law enforcers also detained some BJYM activists for trying to disrupt normal life and conducted patrolling in various areas of the subdivision, sources said. "Sil had quit the TMC and joined the BJP before last year's Lok Sabha elections. He was murdered for joining the saffron party and his role in increasing the BJP's influence in Gayeshpur municipality area," the deceased's nephew and BJYM town vice-president Bappa Sil said.

02-11-2020||National||Madhya Pradesh High Court asking molestation accused to get rakhi tied by victim 'drama', Attorney General tells SC||Attorney General K K Venugopal on Monday told the Supreme Court that an order passed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court directing an accused in a molestation case to "get Rakhi tied from the victim" is "nothing less than a drama" and must be condemned. Maintaining that judges must be taught about gender sensitisation, he said that the National Judicial Academy, state academies should teach that this is not permissible. Judges recruitment exam should have a portion on gender sensitisation, he added. A bench, presided over by Justice A M Khanwilkar, decided to consider laying down guidelines for judges in this regard on November 27. The court asked the A-G, SC Bar Association President Dushyant Dave and senior advocate Sanjay Parikh, appearing for a group of women lawyers, to recommend ways to improve gender sensitivity towards victims while laying down bail conditions for sex crime offenders.  Background On October 16, the top court had issued notice to the Attorney General to decide if a court can issue a direction like accused should get 'Rakhi' tied on his hand by the victim as a condition of bail in sexual offences, trivialising the trauma suffered by her. Parikh, representing a group of woman lawyers, had then contended such orders objectified the victims. The counsel said the HC should not have put such weird conditions for bail, which was against the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. The plea was filed under extraordinary situation against a Madhya Pradesh High Court's order of July 30 but there have been instances of such orders from other states, he said. The women lawyers have approached the court asking it to set aside the Madhya Pradesh High Court's direction. In their plea, they said it has been seen in cases of sexual offence, women and families do not seek redressal from the criminal justice system primarily to avoid such kind of secondary trauma that they are subjected to in the process of a criminal trial. They asked whether High Court ought not to have employed circumspection and sensitivity while dealing with a case involving a sexual offence and also related to wrongful entry into the property of the victim. The "public-spirited" lawyers led by Aparna Bhat said imposing a condition where the accused would be required to go to the house of the complainant on the festival of 'Rakshabandhan' and request her to tie a rakhi around his wrist with the “promise to protect her to the best of his ability for all times to come” resulted in further victimisation of the survivor in her own house. They challenged the validity of the Madhya Pradesh HC's order of July 30 by which the accused was also told to pay Rs 11,000 to the complainant as customary ritual and seek her blessings and pay Rs 5,000 to her son for purchase of clothes and sweets. "While it is routine for courts to award certain compensation to survivors of sexual offences to be paid by the accused, it is highly objectionable for the HC in the present case to put the complainant in a position where she is forced to accept the sum of Rs 11,000," they said. They further pointed out that the present case was of particular concern since it has taken years to undo the damaging approach followed by courts whereby cases involving sexual offences committed against women were attempted to be compromised by way of marriage or mediation between the accused and the survivor.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/madhya-pradesh-high-court-asking-molestation-accused-to-get-rakhi-tied-by-victim-drama-attorney-general-tells-sc-910255.html
02-11-2020||National||SC junks plea against election of Rahul Gandhi from Wayanad seat||The Supreme Court Monday dismissed a plea challenging the election of former Congress President Rahul Gandhi in 2019 from Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency in Kerala. A bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian initially passed over the matter as none appeared on behalf of Saritha S Nair, who has challenged Gandhi's election. Later, in a hearing conducted through video conferencing, the bench dismissed her appeal against the Kerala High Court order. Nair had moved the top court against the October 31, 2019 decision of the Kerala High Court by which her election petitions challenging the Lok Sabha polls in Wayanad and Ernakulam also were dismissed. Nair's nomination papers for contesting Lok Sabha polls from Wayanad and Ernakulam Lok Sabha seats were rejected by the returning officers in 2019 on account of her conviction and sentencing in two criminal cases related to the Solar scam in the state. The top court had on June 10 taken note of the plea of Nair's lawyer for adjournment and had deferred the hearing for November 2. The Kerala High Court had not allowed Nair's pleas challenging the polls in both Lok Sabha seats and said that her nomination papers were rejected as the conviction in the two criminal cases were not suspended. It had that only the sentences in the cases were suspended by the appellate court. The high court said it was clear from the relief sought in the appeal petition that Nair had only sought suspension of the sentence and not suspension of conviction. Nair's nomination papers were rejected under the Secrion 8(3) of the Representation of People Act, 1951 which prescribed for disqualification on account of conviction and sentencing in a criminal case. Gandhi had won Kerala's Wayanad seat -- the second seat he contested in the 2019 polls -- with a record margin of 431,770 votes. He defeated his nearest rival P P Suneer of the Communist Party of India who secured 274,597 votes, while Gandhi got 706,367 votes.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-junks-plea-against-election-of-rahul-gandhi-from-wayanad-seat-910257.html

"A team of doctors is monitoring his health. His ammonia level is slightly high. We have put him on non- invasive ventilator support and his oxygen saturation level is normal now," he said. Gogoi is mentally stable and conscious, Sarma said. Asked if the veteran Congress politician will be shifted to a facility outside the state for treatment, the senior doctor said, "His health condition is serious but is taken care of. The situation does not demand as of now to shift him outside Assam." Gogoi's health condition is being monitored by a nine-member committee of doctors, which was formed by the state government after he had tested positive for Covid-19 in August. The three-time chief minister and veteran Congress leader was discharged from the hospital on October 25 after undergoing treatment for the coronavirus infection and other post-recovery complications. Since then, he was under observation of the team of nine doctors at his residence. Gogoi had tested positive for Covid-19 on August 25 and was admitted to the hospital the next day. The octogenarian leader's health condition had deteriorated on August 31 with a sudden fall in oxygen saturation level. He was administered plasma therapy and became stable later. In the days before he tested Covid-19 positive, Gogoi was at the forefront of the Congress initiative to form a 'grand alliance' comprising all the opposition parties for the 2021 assembly polls and holding meetings with all stakeholders.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/former-assam-cm-tarun-gogoi-hospitalised-again-put-on-ventilator-support-910260.html

The school principals believe that the postponement of board exams will not be a right move as it will impact the schedule of higher education entrance exams and admission processes as well, which will be disturbing for students. The Delhi government had last month written to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to not conduct the board exams next year before May and further reduce syllabus as schools still continue to remain closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had also raised the issue at NCERT's council meeting last month chaired by Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank'. "Postponing the board exams can have some serious repercussions on the students' growth and performance preparing via remote learning. As this session was attributed to getting familiar with remote learning tools, by both the students and teachers," said Priyanka Barara, Principal, Delhi International School. "With no concrete update on vaccines, we don't see parents allowing their wards to return to school. Therefore, we would not like to repeat the pattern of losing time again by supporting the delay in board exams," she added. Alka Kapur, Principal, Modern Public School, Shalimar Bagh, who is also the President of Delhi Sahodaya School Complex, said, a survey was conducted to get feedback from principals and teachers of over 100 schools, on the issue. "We asked this very question that when should the examinations be conducted? By an overwhelming majority, the school authorities suggested that the board examinations should not be postponed beyond March 15. Also CBSE board result for class 12 and higher education entrance exams are interlinked, therefore postponement of exams any further could cause unnecessary confusion. "Secondly, we also unanimously agreed that it is best not to reduce the syllabus any further and that the students should get a gap of at least 3 to 4 days between subsequent exams. Another point that was raised was that we should try to conduct practicals in the offline format only by calling students in small groups," she said. Kalpana Dwivedi, Principal St Joseph’s High School, CBSE Panvel, said, "the exams should not be postponed further, the theory portion will be completed in due time. And practical portion can be dealt with-in Jan-Feb 2021, hence, exams can be conducted in mid-March 2021 in consideration with the existing situation." "We see no reason for postponing the exams to the month of May, as our teachers and students have now got accustomed to the virtual learning methods. We have already planned academic calendar in a manner that relevant attention has been directed towards timely completion of syllabus along with practice sessions and doubt resolving discussions with teachers," Sangeeta Hajela, Principal, Delhi Public School, Indirapuram "Also, as per the government guidelines, the syllabus has been reduced by 30-40 pc which is appropriate considering the physical classroom void created by pandemic. More reduction would create a substantial gap in knowledge and understanding of important concepts," she added. Pallavi Upadhyaya, Principal, DPS-RNE Ghaziabad, said, "a detailed discussion was initiated among teachers, management and parents for planning a systematic academic calendar in the remote learning academic session. Classes are being conducted and planned ever since with the intention of conducting board exams timely". "An extension would lead to a disturbance in the set schedule of students and teachers. The syllabus reduction has already been applied by the board, which has reduced the burden and compensated for the gap created due to no classroom interaction," she said. In a letter to the CBSE, the Directorate of Education (DoE) had said due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a major chunk of time of 2020-21 academic session (approximately seven months) could not be utilised for classroom teaching learning process as schools in Delhi are closed till October 31. Universities and schools across the country were ordered to shut down on March 16 to contain the spread of novel coronavirus. On March 25, the Centre announced a nationwide lockdown. While several restrictions have been eased gradually in different phases of the 'unlock' since June 8, educational institutions continued to remain closed. However, according to the latest 'Unlock 5' guidelines, schools, colleges and other educational institutions outside COVID-19 containment zones can reopen after October 15. The final decision on reopening the institutions has been left with the states and Union Territories. The Delhi government has decided to maintain status quo on schools' closure till further orders.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-school-principals-not-in-favour-of-postponing-board-exams-910290.html

Bengaluru, Hubli-Dharwad also figure in the list of 30, according to the data by the WWF. Almost half the cities are in China, with other hotspots in South Asia, Middle East, South America, and Africa. According to the scenarios in the WWF Water Risk Filter, the 100 cities that are expected to suffer the greatest rise in water risk by 2050 are home to at least 350 million people as well as nationally and globally important economies. Globally, populations in areas of high-water risk could rise from 17% in 2020 to 51% by 2050. The list includes cities such as Beijing, Jakarta, Johannesburg, Istanbul, Hong Kong, Mecca and Rio de Janeiro. The report names 30 Indian cities including Jaipur, Indore, Amritsar, Pune, Srinagar, Kolkata, Bangalore, Mumbai, Kozhikode, Visakhapatnam, Jabalpur, Nagpur, Dhanbad and Bhopal that have been identified as the urban conglomerations, which would face enhanced water risks in the next few decades. “The water risk filter overall risk is a comprehensive risk layer composed of three risk types: physical (scarcity, flooding, quality, ecosystem services status), regulatory (enabling environment, institutions and governance, management instruments, infrastructure and finance), and reputational (cultural importance, biodiversity importance, media scrutiny, conflict),” Ariane Laporte-Bisquit, lead researcher of the WWF Water Risk Filter told DH. Citing the examples of the revival of Bashettihalli wetland in Bengaluru and the Sirpur lake in Indore, the report pointed out that there were many such initiatives across the country that could be scaled up. Dr. Sejal Worah, Programme Director, WWF India, said, “The future of India’s environment lies in its cities. As India rapidly urbanizes, cities will be at the forefront both for India’s growth and for sustainability. For cities to break away from the current vicious loop of flooding and water scarcity, nature-based solutions like restoration of urban watersheds and wetlands could offer solutions. This is our chance to re-evolve and re-imagine what the future of the cities could be.” Alexis Morgan, WWF Global Water Stewardship Lead, added: “Cities across the world have paid a high price in recent years due to worsening water risks.  From acute risks that have seen historic floods to chronic risks that have seen their taps running dry, the water challenges cities are facing are only going to increase in the coming decades because the impacts of climate change will primarily be felt through the water.” The Smart Cities initiative in India could offer an integrated urban water management framework combining urban planning, ecosystem restoration and wetland conservation for building future-ready, water-smart and climate-resilient cities. Urban watersheds and wetlands are critical for maintaining the water balance of a city, flood cushioning, micro-climate regulation and protecting its biodiversity. The future of our cities and sustainability lies in the efficiency in closing the loop by integrating water supply, demand management. A WWF-India press statement said multi-stakeholder engagement and ownership involving local communities is key in creating and conserving sustainable water infrastructure and rejuvenating urban freshwater systems. There are many initiatives across the country that can be scaled up where multi-stakeholder groups have come together and revived wetlands such as Bashettihalli wetland in Bengaluru and the Sirpur Lake in Indore. Urban planning and wetland conservation need to be integrated to ensure zero loss of freshwater systems in the urban areas. While improving urban water infrastructure and cutting water consumption will help reduce water risks, Nature-based Solutions – such as restoring degraded watersheds, reconnecting rivers to their floodplains, and restoring or creating urban wetlands – are critical to avoiding the worst-case scenario and to safeguarding economies and human wellbeing. Public funds will be needed in some cases, but bankable water solutions also offer effective ways to invest in projects that can enhance the health of freshwater ecosystems, reduce water risk and generate returns.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/30-indian-cities-dominate-global-list-of-100-cities-with-highest-overall-water-risk-910304.html

Indo-Tibetan Border Police Director General S S Deswal said the Sino-India front, where militaries of India and China are engaged in a standoff for the last few months in the Ladakh region, is "completely secure and the morale of the troops is high." The ITBP chief was speaking to reporters after finishing a three-day-long 200 km 'Fit India' walkathon in the Thar desert that runs along the India-Pakistan international border. The walkathon began on October 31 and was flagged off by Union Sports minister Kiren Rijiju from the Nathuwala village in this district. "We need to keep our force fit that guards the 3,488-km front with China. It is the world's most difficult border and it is at an altitude of over 10,000 ft." "Even a blade of grass does not grow there and that border area is marred by low oxygen levels and minus 45 degrees temperature during winters," Deswal said. It is a hostile border in every aspect, he said. "Hence, we have to ensure that our officers and jawans are healthy and fit to survive these tough conditions." "We keep upgrading the training of our personnel so that they can render their task with efficiency," the ITBP DG said. He was asked about the aim of undertaking the walkathon. The ITBP chief, who has undertaken a number of such fitness walks at various other locations in the past, said about 100 officials from various central armed police forces and state police forces took part in the walkathon to spread awareness about fitness for a healthy nation. The walkathon moved through sand dunes in areas like Sakhirewala, Bhuttewala, Katoch and culminated after crossing the Indira Gandhi canal here. The ITBP, with about 90,000 personnel, is tasked to guard the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control with China.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/itbp-takes-measures-to-keep-troops-fit-amid-tough-climatic-conditions-at-sino-india-border-dg-910312.html

The star kid also said that she had wrote about it to her parents. In a video on Instagram, she said: "When I was 14, I was sexually abused. That was slightly an odd situation in the sense that I didn't know what that person was doing. It wasn't happening every day, so it took me a year to be sure that they knew what they are doing and that is what they are doing and immediately I wrote to my parents and got myself out of the situation." "Once I was out of the situation, I didn't feel bad anymore. I wasn't scared. I felt like this is not happening to me anymore and it's over. And I moved on and let go. It was not something that has scarred me for life and something that could make me feel bad", she said. Ira said that she never revealed anything to anyone because she assumed that her privilege meant she should handle her stuff herself, or if there was something bigger, it would make people need a better answer than “I don’t know.” She also spoke about her parents' divorce in the video, saying that their separation was amicable.

He said it would not be appropriate for him to deal with the matter as the CJI was seized of the matter, though he agreed that the timing of the letter was "suspect" and conduct of the persons was "contumacious". He pointed out as the letter was addressed to the CJI and "he is well aware of the nature of allegations". In response to a request for consent made by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay for a contempt action in the matter, Venugopal said "objectionable statements" were made in the October 6 letter of the CM to the CJI, which was released to the press on October 10 by his principal secretary Ajeya Kallam. Venugopal maintained, "prima facie, the conduct of said persons is contumacious".

Expressing apprehensions of foul play, Manjhi’s party Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that since several theories were being floated behind Paswan’s death, it will be better if a proper investigation is carried out by a judicial commission to put at rest all speculations.  HAM national spokesperson Danish Rizwan has written to Prime Minister to institute a probe panel which would investigate why no medical bulletin was issued in case of Paswan, why no more than three persons were allowed to meet him in the hospital, and what was the alleged role of his son Chirag Paswan in the case. LJP chief Chirag Paswan hit back at Manjhi and said, “You should feel ashamed of yourself for stooping so low.” Chirag also hit back at the NDA in general and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in particular.

The state Congress has planned to conduct protests in 150 locations in the state where tractors fitted with ploughs will be used in the agitation, TNCC President K S Alagiri said in a statement. The party would soon announce when the protests will be held, he said. "Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is slated to attend a farmers' rally at the end of these protests," he said, while citing the Wayanad MP's participation in similar rallies in Punjab and Haryana against the farm laws, approved by Parliament. The TNCC chief said the latest legislations were inimical to the interests of the farmers, alleging coprorates will have a greater say in fixing price of produce, and that his party was making all efforts to mobilise support against them. Parliament had recently approved the Farmer's Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, even as farmers in parts of the country, especially in Punjab, have been opposed to them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rahul-gandhi-to-attend-farmers-rally-in-tamil-nadu-against-centres-farm-laws-910377.html

"The railways announced diversion of 21 trains on Sunday and cancelled 2 trains. The railways is closely monitoring the situation and working on to protect railway properties," Railway Board Chairman V K Yadav told reporters. Though the railways suspended the operation of regular trains since March 23 to check prevent spread of Covid-19, it is operating special trains and freight trains. As a precaution, internet services have been snapped in some areas of Alwar district and neighbouring areas. The Gujjars have been protesting for reservation intermittently since 2007. They were given 5% reservation in a special category, but it was struck down a number of times as it exceeds the 50% limit set by the Supreme Court. The railways also continue to suspend operation of trains in Punjab due to farmers protest. The railways officials are in touch with Punjab government and requested them to take steps to protect the railway properties and its staff. Once situation normalises, the railways is ready to operate trains in Punjab also, Yadav said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/train-services-on-delhi-kota-mumbai-route-hit-as-gujjars-protest-for-reservation-910381.html

Inaugurating the centres through videoconference, Smriti Irani said, “Through CSC, we will be able to reach each and every block in the country and promote basic health services using Ayush practices for women and children. It will also help us in Poshan Abhiyan especially in villages. CSC VLE will support outreach and create awareness about these facilities through local markets / haats / social gatherings and media.” The Minister also interacted with 13 VLEs who have set up Ayur Sanjeevani Kendra in Amethi. “The initiative of Ayur Sanjeevani Kendra through CSCs can be a milestone in Indian health services and help us move towards Atmanirbhar Bharat.

The lowest price quoted was Rs 35/kg in only two cities -- Udaipur in Rajasthan and Rampurhat in Birbhum district of West Bengal -- out of the 114 cities where price trends are monitored on a daily basis by the government. The average all-India daily price of onion was ruling as high as Rs 70/kg on Monday. Consumers even in the growing regions are paying elevated rates for the key kitchen item. Despite Maharashtra being the top onion producing state in the country, retail price of the commodity in Mumbai was a hefty Rs 77/kg. A similar situation prevailed in Delhi, one of the major consuming markets, where retail prices were firm at Rs 65 per kg, in Kolkata at Rs 70 per kg and Chennai at Rs 72 per kg on Monday, as per the government data. Retail prices maintained by the government are normally lower by Rs 10-20 per kg than the trade data as prices differ depending on the quality and locality. Onion prices have soared for the last few weeks due to tight supplies following damage to this year's kharif crop in the wake of heavy rainfall in the key growing states of Maharashtra and Karnataka. However, the government has taken several measures, including banning exports and imposition of stock limits on traders, to boost the domestic supply and keep the prices under check till the arrival of fresh crop by end of this month. The government is also increasing domestic availability by releasing buffer stock of onion as well as relaxing norms for imports via private trade till December. Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka are the top three onion growing states in India.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/onion-costliest-at-rs-100/kg-in-bengaluru-lowest-at-rs-35/kg-in-just-2-cities-910401.html

According to data provided by the Railways, the average occupancy of these special trains is around 92 per cent. "We are monitoring these 327 trains daily. Once we determine the nature of the waitlist -- for how many days is the waitlist and how long -- we will run clone trains on those routes. "We have been saying that we will introduce trains wherever necessary, but they will be only reserved trains and will follow all coronavirus protocols," said Railway Board Chairman and CEO V K Yadav at a press briefing on Monday. The Railways, which had suspended all passenger train services since the lockdown in March, has so far earned Rs 3,322 crore as revenue from the segment, which is 90 per cent less than what it earned during the same period last year, Yadav said. Other than the 736 special trains being operated, the Railways is also running 200 services of the Kolkata Metro, 2,276 Mumbai suburban services, 20 special clone trains and 436 festival special trains from October 20 to November 30. Yadav said while the overall occupancy of the 736 trains is around 92 per cent, 19 trains have occupancy below 30 per cent, 44 have occupancy between 30 per cent and 50 per cent, 83 trains have occupancy between 50 per cent and 75 per cent and 327 trains have waitisting. Yadav also said besides Mumbai, the Railways is geared to begin suburban services in other cities. Discussions are underway with the West Bengal and the Tamil Nadu governments in finalising modalities for the resumption of suburban services there, he said. While passenger trains have all but stalled, the Railways' freight business seems to be speeding forward with incremental loading of over 14.32 metric tonne over October 2019. In October this year, the freight revenue was Rs 869 crore more than last year and it also saw the highest ever automobile loading. While 320 rakes of automotives were loaded in October 2020, as many as 162 were loaded in 2019 which is around a 97.5 per cent increase. Overall this year, the cumulative automobile loading surpassed last year with 1,156 rakes as compared to 886 rakes till October 2020 which is a 30.5 per cent increase.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/surge-in-demand-for-rail-travel-amid-covid-19-out-of-736-special-trains-327-have-waitlisted-passengers-910405.html
02-11-2020||National||In last 45 years, monsoon withdrew late 28 times: IMD data||Monsoon has retreated late from the country 28 times in the last 45 years, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) data suggests, pointing to a shifting weather pattern. From 1975-2020 monsoon has retreated four times (1978, 1979, 2001 and 2008) from the country on October 15, its normal withdrawal date until last year. The normal date for the onset of monsoon over Kerala is June 1. According to the revised monsoon schedule from this year, it usually covers the entire country by July 8. This year the southwest monsoon made an onset over Kerala on June 1 and covered the entire country by June 26, 12 days ahead of its normal date of July 8. The withdrawal was late. It retreated from west Rajasthan and parts of Punjab on September 28, 13 days after its normal withdrawal date. The withdrawal date was revised from this year to September 17 --- earlier the withdrawal date was September 1. It withdrew from the rest of the country on October 28, 13 days after its normal withdrawal date. Earlier, the withdrawal date was October 15 which has now been revised to October 17. “There is a trend that the monsoon has been arriving and retreating late. This could be due to large scale multi-decadal oscillation. We have a 60-year cycle of monsoon, so it could be part of that. There is a shift in the monsoon pattern,” said M Rajeevan, secretary of the Ministry of Earth Sciences. Rajeevan, who has studied monsoon for the last 35 years as a scientist, said, “This could be part of that or it could be due to climate change. We are not sure about the exact reason behind this. We need to do a very detailed study to understand”. Mahesh Palawat, vice president Skymet Weather, said the extended monsoon could be because of global warming. “The Bay of Bengal witnesses' cyclonic systems probably due to this heating. These systems, after reaching the Odisha-Andhra Pradesh coast, tend to recurve towards the northeast. But this year we have seen that they travelled all through central India. This delayed the withdrawal of monsoon,” Palawat said. He added that this has been the trend for the last few years but there has been no study on it. The late withdrawal also has its effects, especially on farming. Former IMD director general K J Ramesh said sowing picks up only after 60-70 millimetres of rains is realised in the farms. This happens from the third week of June to the end of July. “October is the fag end of cropping. A day or an alternate day's spell is okay, but if the fields are inundated then there is a danger of losing the entire crop,” Ramesh said. This year October saw two-three cyclonic circulations. One intensified into a deep depression, bringing heavy rains over Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Goa. Thousands of hectares of crops and horticulture crops were destroyed due to the unseasonal rain.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/in-last-45-years-monsoon-withdrew-late-28-times-imd-data-910406.html

02-11-2020||National||DH Deciphers | What is the Malabar exercise and why is it important for India?||Q: What is Malabar Exercise? A: It is one of the oldest war games undertaken by the Indian Navy, which began the Malabar series of bilateral naval exercises with the US Navy in 1992. Three drills were held before 1998 when the US imposed sanctions on India in the wake of Pokhran-II nuclear tests and cut off all bilateral military links. It was resumed in 2002 after India joined hands with the USA to fight terrorism globally in the aftermath of 9/11.   Q: Why is this exercise important to India? A: Though it initially began as a bilateral training drill, over the years it assumed a multilateral nature first with the entry of Japan and now Australia becoming a part of it since last month. As of now, it is the only military exercise of the Quad – an alliance of India, USA, Japan, and Australia – that was formed to counter China’s expansionist role in the Indian Ocean region. India of late quietly added military heft to the Quad by inking military logistics sharing agreement with Australia and Japan. It had earlier signed the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) with the US in August 2016. Q: Will Malabar, 2020 be a multi-nation military exercise for the first time? A: Not really. In 2007, India invited navies of the USA, Japan, Australia, and Singapore to participate in the drill that was held in the Bay of Bengal in September. The presence of 27 warships from five naval powers including nuclear-powered US supercarriers riled China so much that the communist country raised strong diplomatic objections with the participating nations. The exercise took place at a time when the idea of forming a Quad was being discussed between the four members. Because of the Chinese objections, other countries didn’t take part in the subsequent editions of the Malabar. It became multilateral once again in 2015 after Japan officially became its member. Q: Where does the exercise take place? A: In the initial years, the exercise used to happen in the Indian waters. But the 9th edition in 2007 was the first that was held outside Indian waters. It took place off Okinawa in Japan. In fact, the 2007 exercise took place twice. The first one was a basic one in Japan in April followed by the bigger one in September. Since then, the mock drill was held several times in Japan. In 2018, it was held at Guam in the Philippines Sea – a US territory. Q: When and where will the Malabar 2020 be held? A: The 24th edition of the exercise is scheduled in two phases in November 2020. Phase 1 of the Exercise is set to commence off Visakhapatnam between November 3 and 6. Being conducted as a ‘non-contact, at sea only’ exercise in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, it would see the participation of the United States Ship (USS) John S McCain (Guided-missile destroyer), Her Majesty’s Australian Ship (HMAS) Ballarat (long-range frigate) with MH-60 helicopter, and Japan Maritime Self Defence Ship (JMSDF) Onami (Destroyer) with SH-60 helicopter. The Indian Navy will be represented by destroyer Ranvijay, frigate Shivalik, off-shore patrol vessel Sukanya, tanker Shakti and submarine Sindhuraj. In addition, advanced jet trainer Hawk, long-range maritime patrol aircraft P-8I, Dornier maritime patrol aircraft, and helicopters will also be participating in the exercise. Phase 2 of the exercise is scheduled in mid-November in the Arabian Sea.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dh-deciphers-what-is-the-malabar-exercise-and-why-is-it-important-for-india-910437.html

Reddy also said that the government has amended criminal laws from time-to-time and enacted the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018, to prescribe more stringent penal provisions to those convicted in offences against women.  "For the present government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and for Union Home Minister Amit Shah, nothing is more important than the safety and security of women. The track record of the government during the last six years is the evidence about its conviction on women safety," he said while addressing a conference on women safety organised by the 'Anandi Foundation' here. "The central government is prepared to make any law and create infrastructure to make women feel happy and safe," the Union minister of state for home said. Reddy said that the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018, provides among many other provisions, death penalty for rape or gang rape of a girl less than 12 years, no anticipatory bail for such crime, completion of investigation within two months, and completion of trials in another two months. Referring to the steps taken by the home ministry for safety of women, Reddy said the single number '112' based emergency response support system has been made operational, the safe city project has been launched in eight large cities and steps have been taken to curb cybercrime against women, besides other measures. The Centre is also supporting states and union territories in setting up or strengthening women help desks in police stations and strengthening anti-human trafficking units in all districts across the country.  The minister said the national database on sexual offenders is used by police officers to identify repeat offenders and receive alerts on sex offenders, as also in investigations. Police can also use this data for verification requests from employers for their employees working in vulnerable areas, like educational institutions, hotels, public transport, he said.  Reddy said India has a rich culture and heritage where women are respected. "We celebrate the power of women as 'Shakti' - the all-powerful. In no other culture, we have such veneration of women's power,” he said. Talking about the government's initiatives, including permanent commission of women in defence forces and deploying them in strategic affairs, Reddy said the Modi government truly understands that women are 'Shakti' and 'Shakti' is power and progress.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-prepared-to-make-any-law-create-infrastructure-to-ensure-women-safety-mos-g-kishan-reddy-910440.html

Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi accused the BJP of turning the legislature into a "forum for business" to satiate its "greed for power" and questioned the ruling party's silence on the charges made in the sting video. The Congress also played the video purportedly showing former Gujarat MLA Soma Patel confessing of being paid Rs 10-crore bribe by the BJP to switch sides. "This is certainly not a flash in the pan or an isolated one-off incident. From Manipur to Goa, from Karnataka to Gujarat, time and again we have had this excessive greed for power, bordering on paranoia. We will win or lose the election but, we must be in power," he told reporters. Former president of Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee Arjun Modhwadia demanded a court-monitored probe by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court or High Court into the sting video. "Where is the black money to pay off MLAs coming from? There should be a thorough independent inquiry into the video tapes. Since all probe agencies have lost credibility and become a part of the government, the probe should be carried out by a sitting Supreme Court or High Court judge and monitored by the court to bring the truth out," Modhwadia told reporters. Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda had first released the video at a press conference in Ahmedabad on Sunday and sought a judicial inquiry or a probe by state and central investigative agencies. State BJP chief C R Paatil had questioned the video's authenticity and rejected the claim that his party was involved in horse trading. AICC in-charge for Gujarat Congress Rajeev Satav said the tapes have "fully exposed the BJP" on the manner in which it operates through this model. "This fully exposes the BJP. It is an insult to the public mandate," he said. Singhvi alleged, "The BJP's motto is clear. It is 'We will have a fair fight and we will lose but, we must get power at all costs'". He also sought changes in the anti-defection law, saying parliament could amend it by not allowing those legislators to recontest within a few months of their resigning and not allowing them to be a minister. "These incidents illustrate that the legislature has become a forum for business for the BJP. I had used the phrase 'trade, trafficking and transactional analysis' of BJP in the legislatures, the three Ts, aggressively indulged in by the BJP," Singhvi said. The Congress leader alleged that the BJP has maintained a "war chest of enormous proportions" for such "dirty tricks" and activities and even if half the amount was used for social welfare, the country would be rid of many problems. "But, the focus of this ruling party at the Centre and in Gujarat, the focus has never been social welfare. It has been to break governments and make governments, by hook or by crook and more usually by crook, not by hook," he alleged. "But, all that we get is silence, not a word and the eloquent prime minister with great 'Jumlas' is suddenly seized by silence whenever we point out these things. There is neither reprimand, nor admonishes, nor action, nor suspension, nor dismissal, not even an acknowledgement. It is time the prime minister reacted at least to his own home state to such repeated clear proved allegations," Singhvi said. "'Na Kahunga, Na Khane Dunga' sounds like Alice in Wonderland. It is hurtful to call yourself a 'Chowkidar'," he alleged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-demands-court-monitored-probe-by-sitting-judge-into-horse-trading-video-910445.html
02-11-2020||National||Foreign policy not part of US presidential elections||Even as President Donald Trump was crisscrossing key battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, was in Hanoi, meeting Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh and Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc. It was the last stop for his five-nation tour to Asia. He earlier visited India, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Indonesia In his earlier stops in New Delhi, Colombo, Male, and Jakarta, Pompeo continued the tirade Trump Administration launched against China, slamming the communist country for the Covid-19 pandemic as well as for its belligerence, not only along its disputed boundary with India but also in the Taiwan Strait as well as in the disputed waters of South China Sea, East China and elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific region. Even in Hanoi, he underlined the United States’ respect for the sovereignty of Vietnam thus tacitly committing support of Washington D.C. to the Southeast Asian nations, which has a protracted maritime boundary dispute with China. Pompeo in fact did his bit to help Trump, who is seeking a second term in the White House and facing a stiff challenge from his rival and former Vice President Joe Biden. Not that foreign policy has been among the central themes of the re-election campaign of Trump. Neither has Biden focussed much on US relations with the other nations. “Foreign policy is really not part of our election campaign, not this year, not four years ago and not four years before that,” Charles Shapiro, a retired US diplomat and the president of the World Affairs Council of Atlanta, said during a virtual briefing on presidential polls organized by the US State Department for foreign journalists. The world may be keenly watching the US presidential elections. But, for the majority of the voters in the US, the rest of the world does not matter much when it comes to choosing the next President. Shapiro was also joined by eminent broadcast journalist Rickey Bevington, who said that if an average US voter was asked to share her or his opinion about the foreign policy of America, one could just get “blank stares” in response. Yet, one nation has indeed made its way into the political discourse in the poll-bound US and it is China. With the SARS-CoV-2 wreaking havoc across the US and his administration’s way of dealing with it drawing flak, Trump and his aides have kept on blaming China for the pandemic. His campaign has also sought to reap the political dividend of the US-China trade war, highlighting the tariff imposed by his administration on imports from the communist country or the restrictions imposed on its telecom companies like Huawei Technologies Company and the ZTE Corporation. “What I hear from conservative voters, particularly Trump’s supporters in Georgia is that this messaging against China very much resonates with the conservative base and not just the far right of the Republican Party base, I mean, mainstream and even conservative Democrats,” said Bevington, who hosts the popular “All Things Considered” programme on the National Public Radio. “There seems to be a consensus among Americans that we've been too lax in China. We've been trying to be too friendly and whether this be politically or economically, that the US needs to grow a little bit more of a spine, but again, whatever that means in policy is different from the actual public talking points, as we see,” she said. “But I will say that that messaging really is resonating right now in the US, whether it regards to Huawei or 5G technology or trade, that that messaging is resonating.”  No wonder, Trump’s Secretary of State Pompeo sought to consolidate his boss’s “tough on China” image during his tour to Asia just days before the election. Trump sought to accuse Biden of being soft on China. But the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate and his aides also argued in favour of taking a tough stand on China, not only on trade issues but also on atrocities and human rights violations by Xi Jinping’s regime in Tibet and Xinjiang as well as on crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. “So, in that sense, the Republicans have moved the Democrats to the right on dealing with China. And I think that that's fascinating,” Shapiro, a former US envoy to Venezuela, said. “I would bet that a Biden Administration would not get in the sort of trade war with China that we're having now and with tariffs, which of course the result of tariffs in the opposite direction and her trade in both ways. But we'd have, I would hope a more nuanced response to China, dealing with China on trade issues.” Biden did accuse Trump of being a ‘puppet’ of Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The US agencies detected attempts by the troll farms and hackers based in Russia to do a rerun of what they had done during the 2016 polls. But neither US-Russia relations nor the Trump Administration’s way of dealing with Moscow turned into a major electoral issue. Nor did US-Iran relations, although Trump did try to take credit for the sanctions he imposed on the Islamic Republic. His campaign also highlighted the Abraham Accords his administration inked with Tel Aviv, Abu Dhabi, and Manama for normalization of Israel’s relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. But none of these resonate much with the US electorate ahead of the polls. Trump made two critical comments about India during pre-election debates with Biden, despite flaunting his personal friendship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make a dent in the traditional support base of the Democratic Party among Indian-Americans. He alleged during his first debate with the former US Vice President on September 30 that the Government of India was not making public the actual number of people who died of the Covid-19 in the country. He also said during the debate on October 22 that the air in India, Russia, and China were “filthy” – a comment, which was not in the context of air pollution in the three nations, but about their contribution to climate change. He made the remark while defending his government’s June 2017 decision to withdraw the US from the 2016 Paris Agreement. Biden on the other hand announced a $2 trillion plan to cut emission and mitigate climate change, which includes “transition away from oil”, a proposition that Trump seized on to attack the former Vice President.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/foreign-policy-not-part-of-us-presidential-elections-910452.html

The eight brands had advertisements selling goods like music CDs, packaged water, non-alcoholic beverages and merchandising, the self-regulatory body said, adding the liquor companies have been given two days' time to explain the same. Advertising for liquor has been banned in the country since 1995, but such companies often use the same brand names for unrelated products to keep the product name relevant or on top of consumers' minds. Such attempts are called 'surrogate advertising'. Often, it has been found that such music CDs or packaged water are not available in the marketplace at all, or their pick-ups are so low that it does not justify ad spends done on the purported product. "Key to ASCI's investigation is determining what are surrogates for liquor, and what constitutes genuine brand extensions," the body said in a statement. For a brand extension of a product to be considered genuine, it must be registered with an appropriate government authority such as the Food and Drug Administration and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, or should have at least 10 per cent of the units of leading brand in the category in stores or produce turnover data, it said. "We are being extra vigilant because the IPL is one of the biggest marketing platforms in India. We are looking at advertising across media - print, OTT, digital," ASCI's Secretary General Manisha Kapoor said. She added that advertisers are usually given time to substantiate claims which should include sales, distribution and market share data that must be certified by an independent body. "If the advertiser fails to respond within the allotted time, the complaint is taken up ex-parte by ASCI's independent Consumer Complaints Council," she added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/asci-gets-cracking-on-surrogate-advertising-by-liquor-brands-in-ipl-sends-notices-to-8-brands-910454.html

The 49-year-old jeweller, fighting extradition in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, will appear via videolink from Wandsworth Prison in south-west London for the latest hearing in the case, during which District Judge Samuel Goozee will hear his defence team's arguments against the admissibility of certain evidence provided by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) in order to establish a prima facie case against the accused. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian authorities, will stress that the evidence meets the required criteria for the UK court to determine whether Modi has a case to answer before the Indian judicial system. The jeweller is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the CBI case relating to a large-scale fraud upon PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of "Letters of Understanding" (LOUs or loan agreements), and the ED case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud. He also faces two additional charges of "causing the disappearance of evidence" and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death” added to the CBI case. Tuesday's hearing follows two separate sets of hearings in the extradition case being presided over by Justice Goozee, the first in May and then in September, during which the CPS sought to establish Modi's fraudulent actions and played videos in court in support of the additional charges. Assurances of adequate prison conditions were also provided by the Indian government, including further commitments of appropriate mental health care for Modi on being extradited. The defence team, on the other hand, sought to not only establish that Modi’s actions related to PNB-issued LoUs did not amount to fraud but also deposed witnesses to highlight his severe depression and deteriorating mental health behind bars. These were further ramped up at a bail hearing last week, when the court was urged to allow Modi to be shifted to a specialist facility under strict bail conditions. However, Judge Goozee turned down the plea, reiterating the concerns from six previous bail attempts that Modi remains a flight risk who would abscond or interfere with the case if granted bail. After this week's hearing to determine the admissibility of the evidence provided by the Indian authorities, it has been indicated that the case would move to a final hearing for the judge to hear the closing submissions in the case from both sides, either next month or early next year depending on the outcome of Tuesday's hearing. A ruling by the District Judge, which would determine whether the case can be sent to UK Home Secretary Priti Patel to order Modi's extradition to India, is expected by next year, a few weeks after the final hearing. Modi, meanwhile, remains in prison since he was arrested on March 19, 2019, on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard. The charges against the diamond merchant centre around his firms Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds making fraudulent use of a credit facility offered by PNB or LoUs. The CPS, on behalf of India, have told the court that a number of PNB staff conspired with Modi to ensure the LoUs were issued to his companies without ensuring they were subject to the required credit check, without recording the issuance of the LoUs and without charging the required commission upon the transactions. Modi’s team has sought to counter allegations of fraud by deposing witnesses to establish the volatility of the gems and jewellery trade and that the LoUs were standard practice. His family history of suicide and severe depression have also been raised as part of the arguments against extradition, which would make prison conditions at Barrack 12 in Mumbai’s Arthur Road Jail inadequate for Modi’s pre-trial incarceration in India.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nirav-modi-extradition-case-to-enter-final-stages-in-uk-court-910458.html

A bench of Justices U U Lalit and Vineet Saran said Section 79 of the RERA Act does not in any way bar the Commission or Forum under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act to entertain any complaint. The court, after going through the provisions of the 2016 law, said the parliamentary intent is clear that a choice or discretion is given to the allottee whether he wishes to initiate appropriate proceedings under the CP Act or file an application under the RERA Act. The court passed the judgement rejecting appeals filed by M/s Imperia Structures Ltd against the directions by National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) to refund the money of flat to buyers on delay in project in Gurgaon with Rs 50,000 cost. It rejected a contention that since the project was registered under the RERA, other proceedings should not be allowed as it would cause drain on the developer. "Section 79 of the RERA Act bars jurisdiction of a Civil Court to entertain any suit or proceeding. However, Section 88 specifies that the provisions of the RERA Act would be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law," the bench said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/despite-rera-flat-buyer-entitled-to-seek-remedy-under-consumer-protection-act-sc-910478.html

Deputy Commissioner Vikash Kumar and exporter Jyoti Biswas were taken into custody on Monday in a case being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on the basis of a complaint received from the Customs department in 2017, they said. It is alleged that the accused in connivance with each other forged export related documents, used those documents as genuine and obtained huge amounts of duty drawback against false export of gaskets to Bangladesh in 2014 in the name of fictitious firms, the officials said. In a separate matter related to an alleged attempt to illegally export Rs 100 crore worth of Red Sanders wood, the CBI arrested Customs Superintendent Sandeep Kumar Dixit and another person, Sudhir Jha, the officials said. "The case relates to allegations of exporting and attempting to export a total 240 MTs (metric tonnes) of Red Sanders, a prohibited item, valued Rs 100 crore through N S Dock, Kolkata Port, in 2016," a CBI spokesperson said here. The CBI had registered the case on December 23, 2017, on a complaint received from the Customs and the Central Excise, Kolkata, he said.

At present, Vadodara, Bharuch and Ankleshwar stations provide rail connectivity to the iconic statue. The nearest airports to the Statue of Unity are Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport and Vadodara Airport. Railway Board Chairman and CEO, V K Yadav said 100 per cent land has been acquired for the Kevadia Rail Link project. The project envisaged gauge conversion between the Dabhoi-Chandod 18 km route and a new line of 32 km between Chandod and Kevadia. “While track work between Dhaboi to Chandod has been completed, the line between Chandod and Kevadia is expected to be completed by November 15, 2020. The project will be commissioned by December 2020,” he said. He said all three major and 16 minor bridges between Dabhoi-Chandod have been built. Out of four major and 47 minor bridges between Chandod and Kevadia, work on one major bridge and 22 minor bridges has also been completed. In the 2017 budget, the Centre had announced the gauge conversion of the Indian Railways’ Dabhoi-Chanod rail line. This rail line is now being extended up to Kevadia. The foundation stone for the railway station which is being built at a cost of around Rs 20 crore and situated just 5 km from the statue, was laid by President Ram Nath Kovind in December 2018. Once the project is completed, one can reach the Statue of Unity from Vadodara in 45 minutes. The speed of the trains in this section will be 110 kmph in phase one and upgraded to 130 kmph later, officials said. The 182-metre-tall monument has been built on an islet Sadhu Bet near Sardar Sarovar Dam.

The Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company had applied to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) seeking permission for full marketing authorisation of remdesivir injection after it recently became the first drug to get formal clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating hospitalised Covid-19 patients. The subject expert committee (SEC) on Covid-19 at the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) deliberated on the application on October 29. "The firm presented the proposal along with clinical data for change in regulatory approval status for remdesivir injection from restricted emergency use to full marketing authorisation. "After detailed deliberation, the committee did not recommend for grant of full marketing authorisation and opined that approval for restricted emergency use of the drug should continue," the SEC recommended. The interim results of the WHO Solidarity Trial indicate that four repurposed drugs for Covid-19, including remdesivir, appeared to have little or no effect on reducing mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay. During the trial, conducted from March 22 to October 4, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon regimens were tested in 405 hospitals across 30 countries covering 11,266 adults. Responding to a question over the interim results of the WHO Solidarity Trial, ICMR chief had at a press conference on October 20 said discussion was ongoing at the National Task force and the Joint Monitoring group, and advisories regarding the outcome of the trial would be issued accordingly. "Debate and discussion is going on at the National Task force and Joint Monitoring group and we will take into cognizance the results of this trial and issue advisories accordingly," ICMR Director General Dr Balram Bharagav had said. The Union health ministry in its 'Clinical Management Protocols for Covid-19' has recommended the use of remdesivir in Covid-19 patients in the moderate stages of the illness. The drug has been included as an "investigational therapy" and recommended only for restricted emergency use purposes. The drug, which is administered in the form of an injection, has been allowed for restricted emergency use for a maximum five-day period for treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19 in adults and children hospitalised in moderate stage of the illness, subject to several safeguards. Several companies in India, such as Dr Reddy's, Hetero and Cipla among others have been granted permission by the the DCGI to manufacture and market remdesivir for "restricted emergency use" on hospitalised Covid-19 patients. Written informed consent of each patient is required before the use of the drug and results of additional clinical trials, active post-marketing surveillance data and reporting of serious adverse events have to be submitted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dcgi-rejects-dr-reddys-laboratories-application-seeking-full-marketing-authorisation-of-remdesivir-910515.html

The exercise is taking place at a time India and China are locked in a nearly six-month-long bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh that has significantly strained their ties. Japan, Australia and the US are also having friction with China in the last few months over a variety of issues. Last month, India announced that Australia will be part of the Malabar exercise which effectively made it a drill by all four member nations of the Quad or Quadrilateral coalition which is primarily focusing on containing China's military expansionism in the Indo-Pacific region. The first segment of the exercise will be from Nov 3 to 6 while the second phase of the drill is scheduled to be held from November 17 to 20 in the Arabian sea. "The exercise, being conducted as a ‘non-contact, at sea only’ exercise in view of COVID-19 pandemic, will showcase the high-levels of synergy and coordination between the friendly navies, which is based on their shared values and commitment to an open, inclusive Indo-Pacific and a rules-based international order," the Indian Navy said in a statement on Monday. China has been suspicious about the purpose of the Malabar exercise as it feels that the annual war game is an effort to contain its influence in the Indo-Pacific region. The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among the leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China's growing assertiveness. The invitation by India to the Australian Navy for the exercise came two weeks after foreign ministers of the 'Quad' member nations held extensive talks in Tokyo with a focus on enhancing their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, a region where China has been expanding its military influence. The Indian Navy said the first phase of the exercise would witness complex and advanced naval exercises including surface, anti-submarine and anti-air warfare operations, besides cross deck flying, seamanship evolutions and weapon firing drills. The Malabar exercise started in 1992 as a bilateral drill between the Indian Navy and the US Navy in the Indian Ocean. Japan became a permanent member of the exercise in 2015. The annual exercise was conducted off the coast of Guam in the Philippine Sea in 2018 and off the coast of Japan in 2019. The Indian Navy will deploy a number of key platforms in the exercise which will include destroyer Ranvijay, frigate Shivalik, off-shore patrol vessel Sukanya, fleet support ship Shakti and submarine Sindhuraj. Also, advanced jet trainer Hawk, long-range maritime patrol aircraft P-8I, Dornier maritime patrol aircraft, and several helicopters will be participating in the exercise, officials said. US Navy ship USS John S McCain, a guided-missile destroyer, Australian Navy's long-range frigate HMAS Ballarat with integral MH-60 helicopter and Japan Maritime Self Defence Force's JS Onami, a destroyer, will be among key platforms to be part of the first phase of the Malabar exercise, they said. During the recent Indo-US 2+2 talks, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper welcomed India's invitation to Australia to join the Malabar exercise. After the invitation to the drill, Australian Defence Minister Linda Reynolds CSC said the Malabar exercise marked a "milestone opportunity" for the Australian defence force and that it will showcase the "deep trust" between four major Indo-Pacific democracies and their shared will to work together on common security interests. For the last few years, Australia has been showing keen interest in participating in the exercise. Defence and security ties between India and Australia have been on an upswing in the last few years. In June, India and Australia elevated their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership and signed a landmark deal for reciprocal access to military bases for logistics support during an online summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison. The Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) allows militaries of the two countries to use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies, besides facilitating scaling up of overall defence cooperation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/first-phase-of-malabar-exercise-begins-in-bay-of-bengal-on-oct-3-910516.html

The data provided by the Railways says the average occupancy of special trains is around 92%. "We are monitoring these 327 trains daily. Once we determine the nature of the waitlist—for how many days is the waitlist and how long, we will run clone trains on those routes. They will be only reserved trains and will follow all coronavirus protocols," said Railway Board Chairman and CEO V K Yadav told reporters here. Yadav said while the overall occupancy of the 736 trains is around 92%, 19 trains have occupancy below 30%, 44 have occupancy between 30% and 50%, 83 trains have occupancy between 50% and 75% and 327 trains have waiting lists. The Railways has so far earned Rs 3,322 crore as revenue from the segment, which is 90 % less than what it earned during the same period last year, Yadav said. Yadav added that besides Mumbai, the Railways is geared to begin suburban services in other cities, and discussions were underway with the West Bengal and the Tamil Nadu governments over this. The Railways' freight business seems to be speeding forward with incremental loading of over 14.32 metric tonnes in October 2019. In October this year, the freight revenue was Rs 869 crore more than last year.

The firebrand BJP leader, who addressed four rallies in poll-bound Bihar, asserted that things changed since Narendra Modi took over and in the new "mazboot" (strong) India the security personnel were asked to "gouge out the eyes" of whoever cast an evil glance at India. "The Congress-led UPA, of which the RJD was also a part, had made us look like a majboor Bharat. When hundreds of people from all walks of life were killed in the terrorist strike of 2008, the nation was yearning for revenge. "The government of the day tried to scare the people by stating Pakistan, which had behind the terror attack, possessed atom bombs", said Yogi. "But things have changed now. We are a new, mazboot India where the security personnel are not asked to wait till terrorists open fire. They have been told to gouge out the eyes of whoever casts an evil glance on the motherland and place these before the nation on a platter", remarked the UP CM, as crowds cheered lustily. Referring to the Balakot airstrikes that followed the Pulwama terror attack, Yogi said "we hit Pakistan on its own soil (ghar mein ghuskar maara), demolished the training camps set up for militants thriving on its soil". "And when one of our fighter planes was shot down and our officer Abhinandan captured, we made it clear to Pakistan that they must hand him over within 24 hours else consequences will be dire. They had do heed, he said. "Even Pakistan has admitted that legs of its leaders were trembling and they were sweating out of nervousness while Abhinandan was in their custoy, since they knew it was a new under Modi", said Yogi referring to a recent remark by a parliamentarian from the opposition party in Pakistan whom the Imran Khan government is said to be planning to charge with treason. The former Gorakhpur MP, who also heads a monastic order based in the eastern UP town and therefore dons saffron robes, also spoke about the commencement of construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya. "Ayodhya may be in UP, but it holds even greater significance for the people of Bihar since the state happens to be the birth place of Mother Sita, whose name is often prefixed to that of Rama", said Yogi. Yogi urged the people of Bihar to vote for the NDA led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar so that the state, with Modi at the Centre, continued to reap the fruits of development. He asked voters to be wary of the "divisive Congress and RJD, who have often stood for forces detrimental to national integrity. They share the blame for the Partition of the country".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/under-modi-majboor-bharat-has-transformed-into-mazboot-bharat-yogi-910562.html

Senior Congress MP Shashi Tharoor says this is exactly what Prime Minister Narendra Modi does when he wants to signal "his bigotry" without being overt about his views on minorities, be it through remaining silent on violence targeting minorities or through statements designed with specific intent. In his new book 'The Battle of Belonging', he says this behaviour is not worthy of a “true nationalist”. Tharoor refers to the cricketing analogy to explain his position: "In cricket nowadays, the umpires use a 'soft signal' when they are unsure of a verdict on an appeal but want to convey what they really think." The Kerala MP adds, "This is exactly what Modi is up to: he actively signals his bigotry to his base without necessarily being overt about his distaste for minorities." To prove his point, Tharoor refers to Modi's exhortation not to vote for the "beef-eating RJD” in the 2015 Bihar elections as well as his ‘kabristan-shamshaan’ reference and 'if there is electricity during Ramzan, there should be electricity during Diwali' statement during the 2017 Uttar Pradesh polls. In Gujarat polls in 2017, he reminds, Modi repeatedly accused former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and former Vice President Hamid Ansari of colluding with Pakistan besides referring to veteran Congress leader Ahmed Patel as ‘Ahmed Mian', referring to his faith. A year later, in the midst of the Karnataka elections, Modi hit out at the Congress’ "celebration of the jayantis of Sultans" referring to the celebration of the birth anniversary of Tipu Sultan, a Muslim ruler. These statements appear "innocuous enough till one recognizes the implicit communal message packaged within", he says. While referring to Modi’s assurance to Muslim leaders in 2015 that he would respond even if they were to knock on his doors at midnight, Tharoor says, it is the “same Modi” who refuses to wear a Muslim skullcap when one is ceremonially presented to him “while cheerfully donning all manner of exotic headgear wherever he goes." "Silence is also a weapon of soft-signalling: when he refuses to condemn instances of communal violence, he implicitly condones it. This is not behaviour worthy of a true nationalist, who ought to be resolute against anything that would divide his nation and so weaken it," he writes. Tharoor also refers to Modi’s attacks on the Congress, particularly its leader Rahul Gandhi, using terms like ‘Aurangzeb Raj’, ‘Shehzada’, among others. He also referred to Modi targeting Rahul for his decision to fight the Lok Sabha polls from Wayanad by saying that he was running away from majority-dominated Amethi to a minority-dominated seat in Kerala, which was ratcheted up by other BJP leaders. Tharoor accuses Modi of embracing Muslim heads of state in the Arab world but keeps Indian Muslims at arm’s length. He notes that the BJP is the first party in India's history to come to power without a single elected Muslim MP in the Lok Sabha. "The very fact that the BJP finds itself unable to put up electable Muslim candidates in any constituency speaks volumes about the party’s attitude to Muslims and of the attitudes of Indian Muslims to it—as well as of the views of its core voters, whose bigotry would not predispose them to vote for a Muslim, not even one contesting on their own party’s symbol," he says.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/modi-soft-signalling-bigotry-says-senior-congress-mp-shashi-tharoor-in-new-book-910123.html

Speaking to the media here, a day before the bypolls in seven Assembly constituencies in the state, Mayawati said that she would prefer to 'retire' from politics rather than joining hands with the BJP. "Our ideology is of 'sarvajan sarva dharma hitay' (benefit of everyone and all religions)' and is opposite to the BJP's ideology," she said. She also claimed that her remarks were 'twisted'. ''I never said that BSP would ally with BJP... our ideology is diametrically opposite to that of the BJP," she said. "The BSP cannot enter into an alliance with those having communal, casteist and capitalist ideology," she said. Mayawati said she would rather take 'sanyas' (retirement) from politics than ally with such parties. "I will fight on all fronts with the communal, casteist and capitalist forces and not going to bow before anyone," she added. Mayawati's clarification comes in the wake of sharp reactions from several Muslim leaders of her party over her remarks. Many of them even threatened to resign from the party. Mayawati, apparently furious over the defection of as many as seven BSP MLAs to the SP, had, a few days back, termed her party's short-lived electoral alliance with SP a ''big mistake'' and vowed to teach the SP a lesson even if it meant supporting the BJP. ''We will teach SP a lesson in the upcoming polls to the UP Legislative Council... our party will support even the BJP or any other Opposition party to defeat the SP nominees,'' she had remarked. "I stand by my earlier statement, which is misused by the SP and the Congress for political gains so that Muslim community distances itself from the party," she said. The BSP supremo, who had forged an alliance with the SP in UP the 2019 Lok Sabha polls but later parted ways, was upset after seven MLAs of her party declared that they would support an independent candidate backed by the SP in the forthcoming Rajya Sabha biennial polls from the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bsp-bjp-alliance-not-possible-would-rather-take-sanyas-from-politics-says-bsp-supremo-mayawati-910226.html

02-11-2020||National Politics||NDA consolidates position in Rajya Sabha; Congress drops to lowest-ever tally||The ruling NDA dispensation further consolidated its position in Rajya Sabha crossing the 100-mark after nine BJP candidates, including Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, were elected unopposed to the Upper House on Monday. On the other hand, the Congress, which dominated the Upper House for a long time, is now down to 38 seats - its lowest ever tally - in the 242-member House after it lost two more seats to the BJP in the current elections. Out of the 11 Rajya Sabha seats up for grabs- 10 from Uttar Pradesh and one from Uttarakhand - nine were won by BJP candidates, including Union Urban Development Minister Puri, taking the party's tally to 92 seats. It was a gain of six as three of the candidates were re-elected. NDA constituent JD(U) has five seats. The ruling alliance also has some smaller parties like RPI-Athawale, Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), Mizo National Front (MNF), National People's Party (NPP), Naga People's Front (NPF), Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) and Bodoland People's Front (BPF), which have one seat each, totalling seven seats. The NDA tally will now be 104 and it can get the support of four nominated members. The half-way mark is 121 in Rajya Sabha whose current strength is 242. The ruling alliance can also seek support on crucial bills from some friendly parties like the AIADMK with nine MPs, BJD with nine MPs, TRS with seven MPs and YSRCP which has six MPs in Rajya Sabha. These parties have been extending issue-based support to the NDA. The Samajwadi Party has lost three seats in these RS polls in Uttarakhand and UP and the BSP lost one seat. With the ruling combine further strengthened, it will be easier for the government to push its legislative agenda in the Upper House, where the NDA did not enjoy a majority. Those elected unopposed today included BJP's Neeraj Shekhar, Arun Singh, Geeta Shakya, Haridwar Dubey, Brijlal, B L Varma and Seema Dwivedi; Samajwadi Party's Ram Gopal Yadav; and BSP's Ramji Gautam. The term of the newly elected members will be from November 25, 2020 to November 24, 2026. High drama was witnessed on the last day of filing of nomination papers on Tuesday with Samajwadi Party- supported independent candidate Prakash Bajaj entering the fray minutes before the deadline. His papers were, however, rejected during scrutiny, but not before four signatories of the BSP candidate Ramji Gautam's nomination papers claimed that their signatures were forged and gave an affidavit to the Returning Officer in this regard. Acting tough, BSP president Mayawati suspended these four and three others who had allegedly met Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav after coming out in the open against the party leadership. There are 31 Rajya Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh of which 22 will now be with the BJP, five with the Samajwadi Party and three with the BSP. The Congress will have only one seat. In Uttarakhand, senior BJP leader Naresh Bansal was declared elected unopposed to Rajya Sabha. Bansal's election was a mere formality as there was no challenger with the BJP having 57 out of the total 70 seats. Bansal replaces Congress' Raj Babbar whose tenure in Rajya Sabha ends on November 25.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/nda-consolidates-position-in-rajya-sabha-congress-drops-to-lowest-ever-tally-910485.html
02-11-2020||National Politics||Bypolls to be held in 54 seats on Tuesday after campaign around 'traitor', 'love jihad' and 'item'||In what could be a reflection of the national political mood, 54 Assembly constituencies across 10 states including 28 in Madhya Pradesh, eight in Gujarat, seven in Uttar Pradesh, two each in Jharkhand, Karnataka, Nagaland, and Odisha, and one each in Chhattisgarh, Haryana, and Telangana will go to polls on Tuesday. The BJP is in power in five of the states, Congress, BJD, JMM, TRS and Democratic Alliance of Nagaland are ruling one each. Congress is also part of JMM alliance in Jharkhand, while BJP is part of the alliance in Nagaland. Bypolls have generally not brought good news for the BJP since 2017. While the results will have no bearing on the stability of the Yogi Adityanath government, it will determine the course of Opposition politics in the state. Six of these seats were held by the BJP and one by the Samajwadi Party. UP bypolls will also be the first electoral test for Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad's new political party Azad Samaj Party, which has fielded a Muslim candidate from Bulandshahr. Former Cricketer late Chetan Chauhan's wife Sangeeta is contesting from Naugaon Sadat, which had fallen vacant after her husband's death due to Covid-19. Bypoll on another seat Ghatampur is also to be contested due to the death of cabinet minister Kamal Rani Varun, while one more seat fell vacant following the conviction of Kuldeep Singh Sengar in a rape case. For a month before the polls, the issue of "love jihad" is back in political discourse of BJP and VHP, with a greater prominence in UP, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. At least two BJP Chief Ministers--Yogi Adityanath (UP) and Manoharlal Khattar (Haryana) talked of bringing a law to curb "love jihad", a connotation used by BJP and VHP to suggest luring of Hindu girls for marriage by Muslims with an eye on conversion. A unique feature of this poll is that the BJP, which is the ruling party in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka, have fielded former Congress MLAs in nearly three dozen seats, who had earlier quit their parent party under sort of Operation Kamala (Lotus) by the BJP. It will be the first time in Madhya Pradesh that bypolls are being held in 28 seats in one go. 25 of them are seats from where Congress MLAs resigned in favour of Scindia as the later switched sides. The outcome here will determine the continuance of Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government and the political future of Jyotiraditya Scindia within the BJP. The BJP has 107 MLAs and needs nine more seats for a majority, while the Congress has 87 legislators in the House and such bouncing back to form a government again is a tall task for Congress. With Scindia crossing over to the BJP, Congress lost government in one of the three states it had won in 2018, the other two being Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. Congress had won MP and Chhattisgarh after a gap of 15 years and hence, the MP loss rankled it more, which was evident in the vitriolic nature of the election campaign that concluded on Sunday. A sign of the high political tempers was also visible when BJP and Congress workers clashed in bypoll-bound Badnawar in Dhar district in the early hours of Monday. The old guards of Congress - Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh have left no stone unturned during the campaigning to turn the tables on Scindia in this election with the Congress calling Scindia and deserting MLAs as 'gaddar' (traitors). Even in Gujarat, the bypolls in eight seats are necessitated after Congress MLAs resigned, five of whom are contesting this time as BJP candidates. They had resigned ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls held in June this year. The Congress is betting big on new entrant Hardik Patel, the leader from the influential Patidar community who was made party working president only this year. In one seat in Jharkhand, Chief Minister Hemant Soren's younger brother Basant Soren is contesting in Dumka, where a sedition case was registered against Jharkhand BJP chief and Rajya Sabha MP Deepak Prakash two days ago on the allegation of trying to destabilise the JMM-Congress-RJD government. On the eve of the poll, the Chief Minister raised the bogey of a scholarship scam when Louis Marandi (BJP candidate) was welfare minister in previous BJP government. The assembly by-poll for lone seat Dubbak in Telangana turned murkier on Sunday with seizure of unaccounted cash worth Rs 1 crore from a relative of the BJP candidate. In Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh, two MLAs of the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J), founded by late Ajit Jogi, came out against the party's decision to support the BJP's nominee in the Marwahi bypoll, which could bring smiles to the ruling party there. The seat had fallen vacant due to Jogi's death this year. In 2018, Jogi had defeated the BJP candidate there. In Karnataka, one of the two seats RR Nagar, which was earlier held by the BJP, was won in last election by then Congress candidate Munirathna. Now Munirathna is a candidate from the BJP, while the Congress has fielded H Kusuma, wife of a former IAS officer late D K Ravi. for the seat. Ally-turned-foe JD(S) can further compound the problems for Congress. In two seats in Odisha, it seems a straight fight between the ruling BJD and the BJP, which had won one each in 2019 state polls.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bypolls-to-be-held-in-54-seats-on-tuesday-after-campaign-around-traitor-love-jihad-and-item-910496.html

According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution rose to 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season. It was 32 per cent on Saturday, 19 percent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday, the second-highest this season so far. "We have been saying it again and again that stubble burning is a major reason behind severe levels of pollution in  Delhi around Diwali, but the BJP and the Congress say the share of farm fires in Delhi's pollution was just 4 to 6 per cent, whereas statistics show it has increased to 40 per cent," Rai told reporters. He said the Delhi government has been doing everything possible to curb biomass burning, and vehicular and dust pollution, "but what should we do about stubble burning?"    Last year, the stubble contribution to Delhi's pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data. NASA's satellite imagery showed a large, dense cluster of fire dots covering Punjab and parts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.  Rai said strict action on the ground was more important than creating new commissions. The Centre introduced a new law recently through an ordinance that put in place a powerful Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas to curb air pollution.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farm-fire-share-in-delhis-pollution-40-opposition-in-denial-says-environment-minister-gopal-rai-910218.html
02-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality improves due to high wind speed, but still 'poor'||Pollution levels in the national capital dipped on Monday with high wind speed aiding dispersion of pollutants, even as farm fires continued to rage in neighbouring states.   The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 286, which falls in the "poor" category. The 24-hour average AQI was 364 on Sunday, with stubble burning contributing 40 per cent to Delhi's pollution and negating the effect of better ventilation. It was 367 on Saturday, 374 on Friday, 395 on Thursday, 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday, and 353 on Monday. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate',201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.  The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said a “significantly” large number of fires were observed over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on Sunday which is likely to impact the air quality in Delhi-NCR and northwest India. Higher wind speed and better ventilation index will be favourable for dispersion of pollutants on Monday, it said. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution rose to 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season. It was 32 per cent on Saturday, 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday, the second-highest this season so far. Last year, the stubble contribution to Delhi's pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data. NASA's satellite imagery showed a large, dense cluster of fire dots covering Punjab and parts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.  According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction was westerly-northwesterly and the maximum wind speed was 18 kilometres per hour on Monday. The city recorded a minimum temperature of 10.8 degrees Celsius, the lowest in the season so far. According to the central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the city's ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 12,000 meter square per second on Monday – favourable for dispersion of pollutants. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-improves-due-to-high-wind-speed-but-still-poor-910225.html
02-11-2020||North and Central||MP bypolls: Case against Congress MLA for threatening cops||A case has been registered against a Madhya Pradesh Congress MLA and three others for allegedly threatening police personnel during a campaign for the state Assembly bypolls, a police official said on Monday. The alleged incident took place at Bhagwa police station in MP's Chhatarpur district on October 29 following which a police official lodged a complaint, Superintendent of Police Sachin Sharma said. A case was registered against MLA from Chhatarpur Alok Chaturvedi and three other persons on October 30 under IPC Sections 147 (rioting), 353 (criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 506 (criminal intimidation) and other relevant provisions, he said. The dispute started after some vehicles of Congress leaders participating in by-election campaign were stopped by personnel of the Bhagwa police station, another official said. Later, the Congress leaders allegedly threatened the police officials, he said. However, district Congress president Manoj Trivedi alleged that the case was registered after Charan Singh Yadav, who contested the last MP Assembly election on BSP's ticket, joined the Congress during a public meeting of Kamal Nath in Bada Malehra, where a bypoll is scheduled on Tuesday. This (case) was an attempt to stop Chaturvedi and others from campaigning for the bypoll, he said. Yadav is among the four persons accused in the case, the police said.

02-11-2020||North and Central||Kamal Nath remains a star campaigner; SC stays EC order||The Supreme Court on Monday stayed the Election Commission's decision to revoke the status of former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath as a "star campaigner" of Congress party over alleged violations of Model Code of Conduct. The senior Congress leader's remark calling BJP leader Imarti Devi an "item" triggered a controversy. Acting on Kamal Nath's petition, a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said that prima facie, EC had no power to withdraw the status of star campaigners. The top court issued notice to the poll panel after hearing counsel for Kamal Nath briefly. EC's counsel, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, maintained that the matter has become infructuous as the campaign is over. However, the court asked, "Where is the power for the EC to pass orders on status of star campaigners?" In his plea filed through advocate Varun K Chopra, Kamal Nath asked the top court to quash the October 30 order by the EC and frame guidelines for speeches during campaigning by star campaigners keeping in mind the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression and concept of democratic elections. The Model Code of Conduct has been in enforced in 12 districts of Madhya Pradesh since September with the announcment of schedule for by-elections to 28 seats in the state Legislative Assembly on November 3. He maintained that Section 77(1) of the Representation of People Act, 1951 read with Guidelines for Star Campaigners issued by the EC from time to time makes selection of revocation of ‘Star campaigners’ the sole prerogative of the political party. However, he claimed, the poll panel passed a "completely unreasoned" order against him without any notice and application of mind. This was also violative of principles of natural justice and fair play, he said. "For a vibrant democracy and for conduct of free and fair elections, it is necessary that voters, candidates, campaigners and workers are not unduly restrained from exercising their freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)a of the Constitution," he said. Outpointing instances where objectionable remarks were used against him by BJP leaders, Kamal Nath claimed the EC took no equivalent action against them despite those grossly violating the Model Code of Conduct. On his remark against Imarti Devi, he said he had already issued clarification and expressed regret.

Normally, the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, records a minimum of 14 to 16 degrees Celsius in the first week of November. The mercury dips to 11-12 degrees Celsius by the last week of November, according to IMD officials. Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of IMD, said Delhi's has been witnessing a trend of low minimum temperatures due to the absence of cloud cover. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground. There hasn't been much snowfall in the hills, so cold winds from that region are yet to start affecting Delhi's weather, he said. According to Mahesh Palawat, a climate expert at Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency, absence of strong western disturbances which cause humid winds to blow is also a reason behind the below normal minimum temperatures. Dry and cool northwesterly winds have been prevailing. The minimum temperature is expected to drop below 10 degrees Celsius by the weekend as no strong WD is likely in the next 10 days, he said. On Sunday, the city recorded a minimum temperature of 11.4 degrees Celsius. The month of October was the coolest in 58 years in the national capital, according to IMD.  The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius, it said. Normally, Delhi records a mean minimum temperature of 19.1 degrees Celsius in October.  The city recorded a mean minimum temperature of 17.5 degrees Celsius in October 2007, according to IMD. On Thursday, Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 12.5 degrees Celsius, the lowest in October in 26 years. The last time Delhi recorded such a low temperature in October was in 1994. The national capital had recorded a minimum of 12.3 degrees Celsius on October 31, 1994, according to IMD data. The city recorded the all-time lowest temperature (9.4 degrees Celsius) on October 31, 1937, Srivastava said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-records-seasons-lowest-temperature-at-108-degrees-910237.html
02-11-2020||North and Central||Open to further negotiations with Gurjars: Rajasthan govt||The government on Monday said they are open to further negotiations with Gurjars who are demanding reservation even as agitating members of the community continued to block a rail track in Bharatpur's Bayana. The protest called by the Gurjar Aarakshan Sangarsh Samiti entered its second day. Movement of roadways buses was stopped on Dausa, Bharatpur, Karauli, Dholpur and Hindaun routes, and road traffic movement entering from Uttar Pradesh was also affected due to the agitation. A North-Western Railways spokesman said routes of several passenger trains were changed in the wake of the Gurjar agitation. According to police, youths in large numbers blocked a rail track in Bayana and also damaged tracks. The issue was also raised in the Rajasthan Assembly session. As soon as the session began, Deputy Leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore sought a reply from the state government on the issue, saying the cabinet sub-committee held talks with Gurjars but members of the community were still blocking railway tracks. Rathore said Internet services were suspended in various districts and rail-road traffic had also been stopped. "The state government should inform the House on the issue," he said. Speaker CP Joshi then asked the state government to give a reply on it after passing three bills to negate the effect of farms bills passed by the Centre recently. Health Minister Raghu Sharma said that the door is always open for holding talks and any problem can be solved through dialogue. "We have made an agreement and if there are any deficiencies... they can be solved through a meeting. The door is always open for holding talks. The state government provided five per cent reservation which was pending from years," Sharma told reporters outside the assembly. He said taking the law into one's hands and damaging property is not a solution to any problem, and added that the people should understand it causes losses to the country. The major Gurjar organisation started the agitation over reservation on Sunday, a day after community leaders held talks with the Rajasthan government and reached a consensus on 14 points. The convenor of the organisation, Colonel Kirori Singh Bainsla, on Sunday asked State Sports and Youth Minister Ashok Chandna to come to Bayana from Jaipur. Later, Chandna reached Hindaun to meet Bainsla and the members of the Samiti but meeting did not take place due to Bainsla's health and blockade on Hindaun-Peelupura route. "The agitation will affect traffic on the Delhi-Mumbai rail route. The movement of traffic was disrupted on the Bayana-Hindaun road," police had said. Earlier on Saturday, Gurjar leader Himmat Singh said the talks with the government were positive. Mobile Internet services continue to remain suspended in many districts. The Home Department had evoked the National Security Act (NSA) in Bharatpur, Dholpur, Sawai Madhopur, Dausa, Tonk, Bundi, Jhalawar and Karauli districts. The organisation is demanding that the Rajasthan government should get the Gurjars included in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, fill the backlog of vacancies and give the benefit of five per cent reservation to the Most Backward Classes (MBCs) in the pending recruitment process. The 14 points on which a consensus emerged during the talks on Saturday include providing regular pay scale to 1,252 MBC employees who have completed their probation period. The state government will once again write to the Centre to include the provision related to reservation for the MBCs in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/open-to-further-negotiations-with-gurjars-rajasthan-govt-910259.html
02-11-2020||North and Central||UP bypolls: Fate of 88 candidates to be decided on November 3||Of the seven seats going to the bypolls, six were held by the BJP and one by the Samajwadi Party. "All preparations to ensure a free, fair and peaceful polling keeping in mind Covid-19 have been made. Voters will have to adhere to the Covid-19 protocol and maintain distance among themselves while casting their votes, " Chief Electoral Officer Ajay Kumar Shukla said. The Yogi Adityanath government has been facing criticism over the law and order situation in the state, particularly after the Hathras and Balrampur rape and murder cases. Last week, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad had launched the Azad Samaj Party campaign for the bypoll in Bulandshahr. The bypolls will also be the first electoral test for the Azad Samaj Party, which evolved from the political movement of the Bhim Army led by Chandrashekhar Azad, as it will be looking to consolidate its hold among the Dalits. The Azad Samaj Party has fielded Md Yameen as its candidate from Bulandshahr. The seven assembly seats where the bypolls will be held include Naugaon Sadat, which fell vacant after the death of cabinet minister Chetan Chauhan. The BJP has fielded his wife Sangeeta Chauhan for the bypolls. In Ghatampur (Kanpur), the bypolls were necessitated due to the death of sitting MLA and cabinet minister Kamal Rani Varun while in Tundla (Firozabad), MLA S P Singh Baghel was elected to Lok Sabha. Chetan Chauhan and Kamal Rani Varun had succumbed to Covid-19. The Bangarmau (Unnao) seat fell vacant following the conviction of Kuldeep Singh Sengar in a rape case. The seats of Bulandshahr, Deoria and Malhani will go to bypolls due to the demise of sitting MLAs Virendra Singh Sirohi, Janmejay Singh and Parasnath Yadav (SP). The counting of votes will take place on November 10. Eighteen candidates are in the fray from Bulandshahr. Six candidates are locked in a contest in Ghatampur, the lowest number among the constituencies. Sixteen candidates are in the fray from Malhani (Jaunpur), 14 each from Naugawan Sadat (Amroha) and Deoria, 10 each from Bangarmau (Unnao) and Tundla (Firozabad). Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, his deputies Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, and state BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh held several election meetings in the past few days. While campaigning in Jaunpur and Deoria on Saturday, Adityanath had said that his government would come out with a law to deal with "love jihad" and used the Hindu funeral chant "Ram Naam Satya Hai" to threaten those who don't respect their daughters and sisters. Welcoming the Allahabad High Court ruling declaring that conversion for the sole purpose of marriage is not valid, the chief minister had said that posters would be put up of those involved in "love jihad", a derogatory coinage referring to the alleged campaign of Muslims forcing Hindu girls to convert in the guise of love. "We will bring an effective law. It is my warning to those who play with the honour and dignity of sisters and daughters by hiding their real names and identities. If they do not mend their ways, their 'Ram Naam Satya' journey will start," Adityanath had said while addressing election rallies. On Sunday, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav had accused the BJP of misusing the government machinery and making voters feel afraid while apprehending defeat in the bypolls. Akhilesh Yadav had said, "The BJP never had faith in 'loktantra' (democracy), 'loklaaj' and 'lokmaryada'. They never hesitate in doing something wrong to gain power." He demanded that central forces be deployed at sensitive places to ensure free and impartial polls. Appealing to the voters, he had said, "These bypolls should be taken seriously. The results of the bypolls will determine as to on which path will UP's politics move. The voters have to choose between development and destruction." UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu alleged that the BJP government has "failed" on all fronts and asserted that the public has decided to teach the ruling party a lesson. "This will be visible in the bypolls. These bypolls will mark the commencement of the decline of the BJP and the Congress will emerge victorious," Lallu had said while slamming the state government over the law and order situation. Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati too on Sunday had appealed to people to vote for her party candidates and send a political message to rivals.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-bypolls-fate-of-88-candidates-to-be-decided-on-november-3-910262.html
02-11-2020||North and Central||SC seeks Centre's report on Vijay Mallya extradition in 6 weeks||The Supreme Court on Monday gave six weeks time to the Union government to file status report on fugitive industrialist Vijay Mallya, currently in the United Kingdom. A bench presided over by Justice U U Lalit granted further time to the Union government for the purpose as Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted that there was no information from the London High Commission in this regard. On October 5, the Centre had told the court that some secret proceedings were going on in United Kingdom, delaying extradition of fugitive industrialist Mallya, despite Indian government's request having received legal sanction over there. The court noted that its August 31 order had cited an MEA report that certain legal proceedings by contemnor was pending in the UK. The counsel for Mallya was then asked to respond as to when he would be available for sentencing in the contempt case on a petition filed by SBI-led consortium of banks. On Monday, Mallya's counsel E C Agrawala, sought discharge from the case. However, the court turned down the request. It posted the matter for consideration in January first week. Mallya, who evaded law enforcement authorities here on defaulting repayment of Rs 9,000 crore loan, and stayed in the United Kingdom, has suffered setbacks after the court over there in May allowed for his extradition. His date of return, however, is still uncertain due to undisclosed legal issues. The Enforcement Directorate has invoked provisions of the Fugitive Offenders Act, 2018 against him. The top court had in August dismissed a review petition filed by Mallya against his conviction in a contempt case in 2017, for failing to disclose transfer of 40 million USD to his children's accounts despite an order against it. The court had then directed Mallya to appear before it on October 5 for hearing on proposed punishment against him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sc-seeks-centres-report-on-vijay-mallya-extradition-in-6-weeks-910263.html

"BJP workers resorted to violence but Congressmen are being booked under pressure from the state government," he told PTI. BJP leader Govind Maloo refuted the allegations and said it was Congress workers who attacked and injured his party colleagues.

02-11-2020||North and Central||Non-payment of salaries: Delhi HC says DU teachers can’t be allowed to suffer||Teachers cannot be allowed to suffer in the blame game between the AAP government and Delhi University colleges, the Delhi High Court on Monday observed while hearing a plea challenging the decision to pay the outstanding salaries to staffers from the Students Society Fund (SSF). The high court asked the counsel for Delhi University Students Union (DUSU), which has challenged the October 16 order of the Delhi government asking the 12 colleges, which are fully funded by the state, to pay the salaries of over 1,500 staff-- both teaching and non-teaching-- from the students fund, to make the colleges party to the petition. The court also observed that Delhi University is the guardian of all its colleges and there is some responsibility of the varsity to put things in order and solve the issues. Justice Jyoti Singh asked as to why the colleges concerned are not made party to the petition and said she will hear the matter once they are arrayed as respondents in the plea. “Colleges should be made a party. In this blame game, teachers cannot be allowed to suffer. Where should teachers go then. They should also say okay fine we are not working… “I am wondering and amazed that colleges which should be made first party are not made a party at all,” the judge said. The high court said it would be unfair to pass any order in the absence of colleges. The counsel appearing for the Delhi government informed the court that a coordinate bench of the high court, on October 23, had stayed the decision asking the 12 DU colleges to pay outstanding salaries of staffers from the students’ fund. The counsel said the colleges are necessary parties to the plea and the petitioner has chosen not to implead them and hence, the interim order of stay shall be vacated. The high court said it found force in the Delhi government counsel’s contention that the colleges must be made a party but refused to pass any order at this stage. Advocate Jivesh Tiwari, representing DUSU, sought time to implead the colleges as parties to the petition. The high court listed the matter for further hearing on November 5 and said the interim order will continue till then. During the hearing, advocate Aakanksha Kaul, representing the Delhi University, said the varsity is supporting the students’ petition and added that the students fund cannot be used for paying teachers salaries and it will amount to cheating the students. The high court asked the DU counsel to take instructions on the issue of funds and grants from the higher authorities and inform the court about it on the next date of hearing. The college staff has not been paid for the last three months. Twelve colleges which are affiliated with the Delhi University and are fully funded by the Delhi government are Acharya Narendra Dev College, Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar College, Bhaskaracharya College of Applied Sciences, Bhagini Nivedita College, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College, Aditi Mahavidyalaya Women’s College, Indira Gandhi Institute of Physical Education & Sports Sciences, Keshav Mahavidyalaya, Maharaja Agrasen College (DU), Maharshi Valmiki College of Education, Shaheed Rajguru College of Applied Sciences for Women and Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies. The high court had on October 23 issued notice to the Directorate of Higher Education, Delhi University and Delhi government and sought their replies on the petition by DUSU. DUSU, in its plea, said “Such arbitrary and illegal usage of the money raised by students for their academic welfare has forced the petitioner who represents the students of the university as a union, to come to this court for quashing of such illegal, unjust and arbitrary order that is unjust and violative of the rights of students as a whole.” The plea said the Directorate of Higher Education has directed the 12 colleges, which are 100 per cent funded by the Delhi government, to exhaust and utilise the funds gathered by the students with respect to the Students Society Fund (SSF) maintained by the respective colleges for and by the students. It said that as per the UGC guidelines, only 11 heads can be included as income and 34 heads for expenditure. It added that for paying the salaries only those heads which are under "income" head can be used for paying salaries. “This does not include the fund collected by students under the societies head or any amount kept in that corpus fund with regard to the SSF can be utilised for this purpose,” the plea said. “...the impugned actions are bad in law and violate the rights of each and every student that has contributed to such SSF and usage of the such Funds for the payment of salaries will be highly objectionable as their lies no reason or precedent for the usage of such student funds for payment of salaries from colleges which are 100 per cent funded by the respondent no.3 (Delhi government)," it said. The government order had given permission for utilising the Students Society Fund (SSF) for payment of salaries to the teaching and non-teaching staff. “If any salaries remain unpaid after the SSF has been exhausted, the remaining amount will be paid by the Directorate of Higher Education after receipt of formal request from the concerned college(s),” it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/non-payment-of-salaries-delhi-hc-says-du-teachers-can-t-be-allowed-to-suffer-910326.html

02-11-2020||North and Central||No manufacturing industry will be allowed in new industrial areas: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||Only hi-tech and service sector companies will be allowed in new industrial areas in Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Monday as changes in regulations barred opening of manufacturing units in such facilities, a move that could have a positive impact on the national capital's environment. Manufacturing units in existing industrial areas will be prodded and given an option to shift to service or hi-tech sector if they wish under the amended Delhi Master Plan 2021. "The historic decision taken for the development of industrial areas will now open up new avenues of possibilities for the service sector in Delhi, accelerate new age business and strengthen the economy of Delhi. Not just new industrial areas, the industry in existing industrial areas could also shift to service and hi-tech industries. We hope that most of the existing industries will make that shift," he said. The Centre has accepted the proposal by the Delhi government in this regard and issued a notification in this regard, Kejriwal told a digital address as he thanked Housing and Urban Development Minister Hardeep Puri. "I thank Hardeep Singh Puri Ji for approving our proposal to amend the Master Plan to change the definition of industrial activity. Earlier, manufacturing was permitted which led to pollution and filth. Now, only the hi-tech and service industries will be permitted. Industrial areas will become neat, clean and green," he said. He said that Delhi's economy is predominantly servicing sector-based and manufacturing sector contributed less. "The service and hi-tech industry were, so far, covered under the office category in the Master Plan and could open only in commercial areas. So, due to very high rates in commercial areas, these were not opening in Delhi and were going to Gurgaon, Faridabad etc instead," Kejriwal said. Now with this change in regulations, he said, such establishments need not go to other cities as they will get more space at cheaper rates in industrial areas of Delhi. In the service and hi-tech industry category, chartered accountants and lawyers can also open their offices, which currently fall under the office category in Delhi's Master Plan, he said. Offices of media, software industry and IT service industry, ITES, BPOs,  vocational and educational institutions, Internet and e-mail service providers, television programme production, research and development and offices of architects and placement services among others can also be set up in new industrial areas. The Chief Minister expressed hope that the face of industrial areas in Delhi would change and pollution-causing manufacturing industries would be gradually replaced by the service and hi-tech industries.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/no-manufacturing-industry-will-be-allowed-in-new-industrial-areas-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-910356.html

Four persons, including the two Muslim youths, who had allegedly offered prayers inside the Nand Mahal temple at Nandgaon in the district on Sunday, were booked in this connection, according to the police sources here on Monday. The matter came to light when a photograph, showing two youths offering namaz inside the temple premises, went viral on social media platforms on Monday. Police sources said that the two youths are members of an NGO and were going to Delhi when they stopped at the temple on the way. The temple priests said that the youths had darshan at the temple and had also accepted prasad. ''We came to know later that two of them offered namaz in a corner of the temple,'' said one of the priests. The priest said that the youths had also recited several couplets of 'Ram Charit Manas', the Hindu epic authored by Hindi poet Goswami Tulsidas containing the life and deeds of Lord Rama. Hindu outfits are up in arms after the reports surfaced and have demanded immediate arrest of the youths. Reports said that a yajna (a ritual by fire) was also performed in the temple to 'purify' it following the offering of the namaz.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/namaz-in-uttar-pradesh-temple-triggers-controversy-four-booked-910361.html

The meeting, which the officials said was routine one, chaired by Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla also decided to ensure high degree of contact tracing and monitoring of quarantined contacts while Metro travel should be carefully regulated, strictly in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) that has been issued. It was also decided to enhance enforcement selectively, accompanied by greater awareness creation through targeted IEC (Information, Education and Communication) campaigns and ensuring that all cases under home isolation were monitored and shifted to hospitals well in time, before any deterioration in their medical condition, an official statement. In its presentation, the Delhi government said that the capital was witnessing a third surge in cases and the administration was focusing on testing, contact tracing and treatment at a time new Covid-19 cases and total active cases are going up. "The recent surge in the number of active cases was attributed to the festival season, which has witnessed greater movement of people, accompanied by laxity in adhering to the basic principles of safe Covid-19 behaviour," according to the presentation. The number of Covid-19 cases in the capital has been recorded above 5,500 in the past few days. The positivity rate has also crossed the 12% mark, one of the highest in the country. Delhi government officials also told the meeting that the hospital bed situation was comfortable with 57% of the 15,789, dedicated beds being vacant. It was also highlighted both by Delhi government officials and Delhi Police Commissioner that there has been no let up in enforcement and awareness generation. Bhalla emphasised that the strategies for containment of spread of Covid-19 in Delhi should be strictly enforced and implemented. He stressed the need for reaching out to the residents of Delhi to sensitise them about safe Covid-19 behaviour through Resident Welfare Associations, market associations and public announcement systems among others. Another review meeting will be held next week along with other districts of the National Capital Region (NCR).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/festival-season-laxity-in-adhering-to-norms-behind-surge-in-covid-19-cases-in-delhi-govt-910363.html

Masood, an MLA from Bhopal, and 49 others were arrested by the police on Sunday and later released on bail as offences registered against them were bailable, he said. They were set free from a police station after they furnished bail bonds, Additional Director General of Police (ADG) Upendra Jain told PTI. Besides the IPC section 188 ((disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant), they were also slapped with four more sections, including under provisions of the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Act, which have been invoked in view of the coronavirus pandemic, he added. They have been charged under IPC sections 269 (act likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life). Also, section 15 (b) (refusal to comply with any direction given by or on behalf of the Centre or the state)of the Disaster Management Act and section 3 (disobeying any order) of the Epidemic Act," he added. After the anti-Macron protest on Thursday, as many as 2,000 people, including Masood and some clerics, were charged under the IPC section 188, Talaiya police station officer DP Singh had said earlier.

02-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality improves due to high wind speed, but still 'poor'||Pollution levels in the national capital dipped on Monday with high wind speed aiding dispersion of pollutants, even as farm fires continued to rage in neighbouring states.   The city recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 293, which falls in the 'poor' category. It was 364 on Sunday, with stubble burning contributing 40 per cent to Delhi's pollution and negating the effect of better ventilation. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate',201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.  The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said a "significantly" large number of fires were observed over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on Sunday which is likely to impact the air quality in Delhi-NCR and northwest India. Higher wind speed and better ventilation index will be favourable for dispersion of pollutants on Tuesday, it said. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution was 16 per cent on Monday. It had soared to 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season. Stubble burning accounted for 32 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on Saturday, 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday. Last year, the farm fire contribution to Delhi's pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data. According to Punjab Pollution Control Board, the state has recorded 33,165 "fire events" this season so far, while Haryana has reported 6,034 farm fires during the period. NASA's satellite imagery also showed a large, dense cluster of fire dots covering Punjab and parts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.  According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction was westerly-northwesterly and the maximum wind speed was 18 kilometers per hour on Monday. The city recorded a minimum temperature of 10.8 degrees Celsius, the lowest in the season so far. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. According to the central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the city's ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 12,000 meter square per second on Monday – favourable for dispersion of pollutants. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. Earlier during the day, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai targeted the BJP and the Congress on the issue of stubble burning, saying the share of farm fires in Delhi's pollution has soared to 40 per cent but the opposition parties were in denial. "We have been saying it again and again that stubble burning is a major reason behind severe levels of pollution in Delhi around Diwali, but the BJP and the Congress say the share of farm fires in Delhi's pollution was just 4 to 6 per cent, whereas statistics show it has increased to 40 per cent," Rai told reporters. In Delhi, the administration sprayed the bio-decomposer developed by Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, in non-Basmati rice fields to prevent stubble burning. "The preliminary reports have been extremely positive. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will ascertain the ground reality on November 4," he said. In a bid to control pollution, the Delhi government has also said that only "green firecrackers" can be manufactured, sold and used in the national capital in accordance with a 2018 Supreme Court order. The 'green crackers' are not as polluting as the conventional types of firecrackers and they contain at least 30 per cent less particulate matter such as Sulphur Dioxide and Nitrogen Oxide. Fireworks can take place between 8 pm and 10 pm only on festivals like Diwali and Gurpurab etc. On Christmas eve and New Year eve, it would be from 11:55 pm till 12:30 am only, according to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-improves-due-to-high-wind-speed-but-still-poor-910413.html

Police have booked four people after a video clip showing members of their group offering namaz on the premises of a temple here surfaced on social media. According to the FIR, the accused reportedly belonged to a Delhi-based organisation, Khudai Khidmatgar, and came to Mathura's Nand Baba temple on Thursday, where they first offered prayers. Later, two of them offered namaz at a secluded place on the temple premises without permission. Stressing that the accused won't be spared and promising deterrent action, the minister said some people are finding it difficult to digest the progress made by the state. They are trying to create hindrance by polluting the environment, the minister alleged, adding that such people are busy creating a verge between different communities in the state. For blocking the road to progress, they are attempting to create differences between Hindus and Muslims, the minister added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/wont-spare-those-who-offered-namaz-at-mathura-temple-up-cabinet-minister-shrikant-sharma-910459.html

J-K BJP leaders and workers distributed sweets and congratulated each other as party general secretary (organisation) Ashok Kaul returned to Jammu from Leh. Former BJP state president Sat Sharma, general secretary and former MLC Vibodh Gupta, general secretary and former minister Devinder Manyal, JMC mayor Chander Mohan Gupta, former minister Sham Choudhary, deputy mayor Purnima Sharma and other party leaders congratulated Kaul. "Congress did try to play spoilsport by using divide and rule policy but despite all odds, BJP did brilliantly in the elections, and in the end, BJP won the chief executive councillor (CEC) as well as the deputy in the elections," Kaul, who led the Ladakh unit in the LAHDC polls, said here. He claimed that the Congress mounted a vicious campaign, boycotting the elections and maliciously involving several local religious organisations as well. "In a closely knitted area like Ladakh, the malicious campaign spread like wildfire, but when the things were made clear, all the people justly participated in the poll process," Kaul said. The BJP won the maximum seats but still lost a few by slim margins, he said, adding, "We ensured seats from areas dominated by every community, including a remote region like Nobra." The BJP won the very first election after the COVID-19 lockdown, and the party will also do extremely well in other parts of the country like Bihar and West Bengal, Kaul said. The BJP won the election to the 26-member LAHDC-Leh by bagging 15 seats, while the Congress got nine. Independents won two seats in the election.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bjp-celebrates-victory-in-lahdc-polls-says-it-won-despite-congress-divide-and-rule-policy-910482.html
02-11-2020||North and Central||Rajasthan Assembly passes bills to counter Centre's farm laws||Rajasthan assembly on Monday passed three bills to negate the farm sector reforms initiated by the Narendra Modi government amid a walkout by the BJP. Rajasthan is the third Congress-ruled state after Punjab and Chhattisgarh to take legislative action to negate the Centre’s farm sector laws after being prodded by Congress president Sonia Gandhi. The three bills, introduced by the Rajashtan government, have state-specific amendments to negate the impact of the central laws that promote contract farming, allow farmers to sell their produce beyond the Agriculture Produce Market Committee limits. After a spirited debate, the assembly passed the Essential Commodities (Special Provisions and Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2020; Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2020; and Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation and Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2020 by voice vote. “I can say it with a guarantee that all three farm laws will have to be withdrawn just like the Land Acquisition Act,” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shanti Dhariwal said, intervening in the seven-hour discussion on the three bills. Leader of the Opposition in the Rajasthan Assembly Gulabchand Kataria accused the Congress-led government of passing the three bills to keep its leaders in Delhi happy and not out of love for farmers. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill allows the state government to impose a market fee on trade outside the APMC limits and even book traders for harassment of farmers. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill mandates that sale or purchase of a crop under contract farming will be allowed only at the minimum support price or above it. The Essential Commodities (Special Provisions and Rajasthan Amendment) Bill grants the Rajasthan government power to regulate or prohibit the production, supply, distribution and imposition of stock limits of foodstuffs, thus getting around the need for concurrence by the Central government for such a move.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/rajasthan-assembly-passes-bills-to-counter-centres-farm-laws-910528.html
02-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's inter-state bus services to resume from November 3, ISBTs to operate at 50% of their pre-Covid capacity||The Delhi government on Monday announced resumption of inter-state bus services from November 3 by allowing the three ISBTs here to operate at 50 per cent of their pre-Covid capacity. The move comes amid a surge in Covid-19 cases in the city with over 5,000 new cases being reported daily for the last few days. Delhi Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said all precautions against the spread of Covid-19 have been put in place for resumption the inter-state bus services.  "As Delhi resumes Inter-state bus service on 03.11.20, from 3 ISBTs, we're ensuring all precautions/SOP are in place. Sanitization of buses at origin & at ISBTs, thermal screening of passengers & crew, Passengers to mandatorily wear mask, testing camps in case of any illness," he tweeted. In an order, the Delhi Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (DTIDC) that operates the inter-state bus terminals (ISBTs) said the inter-state bus services will reopen at the Sarai Kale Khan, Kashmiri Gate and Anand Vihar ISBTs from November 3. "The number of buses plying from the ISBTs shall not be more than 50 per cent of the pre-Covid capacity up to November 15," said the order.  The concerned additional general managers of ISBTs will be responsible for implementation of the standard operating procedures prepared for resumption of the services. The SOP stated, "It is advised that the buses entering the ISBTs should not be older than 2015 model in the wake of alarming situation of pollution in Delhi." The DTIDC may gradually reduce the age of the buses and ultimately allow the entry of only CNG, electric and BS VI standard buses at the three ISBTs, it said, advising bus operators to prepare accordingly. The SOP further stipulated that initially the number of buses from each state will be limited to 50 per cent of pre-Covid levels till November 15. Passengers will have to mandatorily wear face mask and no standing passengers will be allowed in the buses.  Social distancing will be ensured on the ground, boarding time, as well as inside the buses. The buses will be sanitized by the respective depots of bus operators at the point of origin and before departure from the respective ISBT. Thermal checking of both passengers and bus crew at boarding and at the point of entry to ISBTs will also be mandatory, it stated.  In addition to these measures, testing camps for rapid antigen tests and RT-PCR tests have also been set up at the ISBT's to deal with asymptomatic passengers identified through thermal screening.  Gahlot reviewed the preparations made ahead of resumption of inter-state bus services in a meeting with officials.  "The safety of both passengers and staff along with crew are of utmost priority to us. We've been carefully monitoring patterns of travelling since we resumed bus services, and even though inter-state travel is a challenge, we are ensuring sanitization at every point," he said. Apart from this, regular announcements and sensitization of passengers about Covid-19 precautions through audio – visual communication is also being undertaken. Strict ban on use of gutka and other tobacco products will be enforced at the ISBT premises, he said. The three ISBTs used to cater to daily 3,500 trips of inter-state buses from UP, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarkhand and other states, and 2,000 trips of local buses.  The inter-state bus services were suspended with announcement of the lockdown due to spread of Covid-19, leading to shutting down of the ISBTs in March.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-inter-state-bus-services-to-resume-from-november-3-isbts-to-operate-at-50-of-their-pre-covid-capacity-910545.html

The second phase of the survey was held on October 19 and October 20, involving samples 14,477 people from all districts of the state, he said.  In the first survey, which was conducted during the month of August, antibodies were found in eight per cent people, Vij told reporters here while releasing the second sero survey report. He said in rural areas, Covid-19 antibodies were found in 11.4 per cent of the people as against 19.8 per cent in urban areas. According to the report, 40.2 per cent of the people in Faridabad have antibodies, 37.1 per cent in Yamunanagar and 36.3 per cent in Panipat. Faridabad registered 31.2 per cent people with antibodies, Yamunanagar 28.6 per cent and Jind 26.6 per cent. The districts with sero-positive percentage below 10 per cent, Hisar 9.7 per cent, Mahendergarh 8.6 per cent, Charkhi Dadari 7.7 per cent, Sirsa 7.5 per cent, Palwal 5.5 per cent and Bhiwani 3.1 per cent.   The Covid-19 recovery rate in the state is 91.46 per cent and the case fatality rate is 1.06 per cent, Vij said.  About the objective of the survey, Additional Chief Secretary, Health, Rajeev Arora said that this will be useful to take appropriate measures to contain the spread of COVID-19.  The survey is about testing a group of individuals for the presence of antibodies as it helps in understanding the number of people affected by the disease, he elaborated. Arora said it has been observed that the urban population was more affected by the coronavirus than the rural population. Thus, low prevalence findings can be attributed to the proactive efforts made by the government to prevent the spread of infection, including prompt lockdown, effective testing strategies, effective containment and surveillance measures, including contact tracing and tracking, he said. Dr Usha Gupta, Director, Health Department, said survey teams were constituted in all the 22 districts of the state and 720 samples were taken from urban and rural areas in each district for the purpose of the study.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/covid-19-antibodies-present-in-148-people-in-haryana-reveals-second-sero-survey-910552.html

The government said the solution to the problem can only be achieved through dialogue. State Health Minister Raghu Sharma and Speaker C P Joshi both appealed to the agitators to come and talk with the government and find a solution to the problem. Earlier, Sharma apprised the House of the initiatives taken by the government so far on the issue. He said a delegation of Gurjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti consisting of 80 villages and civil and public representatives held discussions with the Cabinet Sub-Committee in Jaipur on October 31 during which 14 points were agreed upon. Sharma said even after this, if the Sangharsh Samiti convener, Colonel Kirori Singh Bainsla, and his supporters feel that there are some issues which have been left out of the discussion, they should come and talk to the government. Sharma said the doors of the government are always open for dialogue and the solution to this problem cannot be achieved by sitting on railways tracks or blocking roads. It can be achieved only through dialogue, he said, while making an appeal to the agitators to maintain peace and take care of the law and order of the state. After this, Assembly Speaker C P Joshi too appealed to the agitators on behalf of the House to negotiate with the government and find a solution.

The contactless mobile ticketing in DTC buses has been extended up to November 31, said RS Minhas, deputy chief general manager (PR), Delhi Transport Corporation(DTC). With a view to reduce the spread of Covid-19, a task force was constituted to explore the options of contactless mobile ticketing in DTC buses so that no physical contact takes place between the conductor and the commuter during exchange of cash or ticket. On the recommendations of the task force, the DTC had started a trial of contactless mobile ticketing in 29 buses of Hasanpur and Gazipur bus depot in September. Twenty-seven more buses of Gazipur bus depot were added in October, he said. "Now, as per the decision of the task force, the existing trial has been extended up to November 31. "The  trial will be conducted on the entire fleet of Gazipur depot in which 128 more buses operating on different routes have been added," he said   A total of 184 buses will be now part of the trial, added the officer.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/contactless-ticketing-trial-in-dtc-buses-extended-till-nov-31-910565.html

The prime suspect, who works in an air conditioner repairing shop but primarily shoots and posts videos on YouTube, was in a relationship with a sister of the deceased, they said, adding that the victim was opposed to the relationship and that was the reason behind his murder. Nithari resident Kamal Sharma, 26, died at a hospital on the night of October 28, and the police initially considered it to be a case of road crash as he was found injured near the elevated road close to the Iskcon temple. He was on his was home on his motorcycle that day. A murder probe was launched the next day after it emerged in the post-mortem examination that Sharma had sustained a bullet injury. "Three suspects have been arrested, and the weapon used in the crime on October 28 also recovered," Joint Commissioner of Police Love Kumar told reporters here. "Prime suspect Nizamul had an affair with a sister of Sharma, who was opposed to their relationship. Nizamul also roped in two of his friends, Sumit Sharma and Amit Gupta, in his plan to eliminate Sharma," Kumar said. The officer said Nizamul is a childhood friend of one of the accused and knew the other for almost two years. He added that Nizamul had enticed the other accused by promising to make YouTube videos for them so that they can earn money. Asked if Sharma's sister knew about the plan to kill her brother, Kumar said, "That part is still being investigated and necessary action would be taken based on the findings." The accused have been booked under Indian Penal Code section 302 (murder) and an FIR was lodged at the local Sector 24 police station, according to officials.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/uttar-pradesh-youtuber-held-for-killing-lovers-brother-his-2-aides-also-arrested-910574.html
02-11-2020||Oasis||The shades of ethical behaviour||The ethical behaviour of an individual is rooted in morality and character. The same person may carry out an action that she believes is to the larger good of society, even if it requires her to compromise personal values. When both morality and reason are run out, instinct takes over. This complexity is best captured in the Mahabharata through the character of Yudhisthira. Yudhisthira is the son of Dharma and his nature is to be virtuous. When he loses his kingdom, his brothers, and his wife, he accepts that all of them will live in exile. His brothers and all his allies and friends, who think that the game itself was unfair, want him to declare war and save themselves the hardship of long exile. Yudhisthira stands by what he agreed to. In philosophy, this is called value ethics. At the end of thirteen years, when the Kauravas break their promise, war is declared. The same Yudhisthira, much against his nature, falsely declares on the battlefield that Ashwathama – the son of Dronacharya – is dead. Krishna convinces him that he must misuse his credibility if the Kaurava General Dronacharya is to be killed. In the larger interest of winning the war, it was necessary that he must compromise his character. His duty to his side came above the personal, and his character had to be sacrificed in the interests of a desirable end-result. Yudhisthira conceded. The morality here is consequential. Finally, when it is Yudhisthira ‘s turn to fight Shalya there is no morality or reason. Shalya is the brother of Madri and the maternal uncle of the Pandavas. He has been instrumental in sabotaging Karna and helping the Pandavas to kill him. He is in effect a spy planted in the enemy camp. Yet when it falls upon Yudhisthira to take on Shalya there is only the instinct to survive. The battle is itself fought with complete compliance to rules. There is no foul play or deceit. Yet the barbarian nature of the fight and the cruelty shocks everyone.  Thus it is that we are capable of exemplary character, compromise and instinctive action. There is no contradiction or inconsistency.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/the-shades-of-ethical-behaviour-910076.html
02-11-2020||Opinion||Off the record: November 2, 2020||Freudian slips?  The campaign for the Madhya Pradesh bypolls is getting shriller with each passing day. First, it was former Chief Minister Kamal Nath’s ‘item’ remark (in reference to a lady politician) and later the Congress’ ‘dog’ jibe at turncoat Jyotiraditya Scindia. While Nath tried to ride out the furore over his remarks, Scindia, the head of the Gwalior royal family, took pride in being called a dog. “Yes, I am a dog and the people of the state are my masters. Yes, I am a dog, because a dog protects its master,” the Congressman-turned BJP ‘karyakarta’ said. Elsewhere, a slip of tongue proved costly for Scindia. Addressing a public meeting, he urged the voters to exercise their franchise by voting for the ‘hand symbol’, instead of the ‘lotus’ of the BJP. The Congress social media team had a field day trolling Scindia. ‘Old habits die hard,’ was the refrain of the Congress. Sagar Kulkarni, New Delhi   Quiet transfer  Last week, the Gujarat government quietly transferred a case involving two officers of Enforcement Directorate (ED) from the Surat police to the CID. According to allegations, earlier, efforts were undertaken to stop the local police from lodging an FIR in the first place. However, a police officer in Surat did not agree with the buzz. The Surat police had already arrested three private individuals but before they could trace the ED officers, one of whom was an IRS officer, the case was transferred. The case involves theft and selling of commercial vehicles seized by the ED itself.   Satish Jha, Ahmedabad  A miracle  A two-page printed statement in Rajinikanth’s letterhead made its way into several WhatsApp groups on October 26 night. The letter indicated that Rajinikanth was reconsidering his plunge into politics due to health issues. The truth is the letter was leaked and Rajinikanth’s office did not have any answers when media persons sought their reaction. With the letter in the public domain, the superstar’s office was forced to come out in the open on its authenticity. When he released a terse statement, he acknowledged that half of the contents in the “fake letter” was true. How can half of content be true and the rest be false? Maybe, it is the athisayam (miracle) that Rajinikanth keeps talking often.  E T B Sivapriyan, Chennai Act of evasion On Thursday evening, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was addressing the media for the first time after the arrest of his former principal secretary M Sivasankar and CPM Kerala secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s son Bineesh Kodiyeri. The main agenda of the routine press conference was Covid-19 updates. Vijayan seemed to be in the mood to be elaborate on the Covid-19 scenario in the state. As soon as the floor was opened for questions, the first question asked was with regard to the arrest of Sivasankar and Bineesh. Vijayan managed to buy time by maintaining that he would initially answer questions pertaining to Covid-19. After putting it off, he asked journalists to ask all questions pertaining to Sivasankar and Bineesh together. He then delivered a reply, that seemed like a prepared speech, but did not touch upon Bineesh’s arrest. Arjun Raghunath, Thiruvananthapuram    Man-animal conflict Forest officials in Assam have stumbled on an unusual reason that has led to the increase in man-animal conflicts--CCTVs. As people living on the hills around the capital city Guwahati are installing CCTVs for security reasons, they press the panic button as soon as they see visuals of wild animals on the CCTV screens. “As people raise hue and cry and chase the leopards, the animals go berserk and often attack residents. Hills in Guwahati are the natural homes of the leopards and other wild animals and so they frequent the roads and houses constructed on the hills,” said a forest officer. Guwahati city has witnessed several leopard conflicts and several people have been killed or injured. In many cases, leopards too have fallen victims and have been killed or captured by angry mobs. “Many people are now installing CCTVs to keep watch on leopard movement and thereby take steps to prevent conflict. But in some cases, people panic leading to a conflict,” said the official. Sumir Karmakar,Guwahati||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/off-the-record-november-2-2020-910077.html
02-11-2020||Opinion||China is getting ready for a world without Donald Trump||In less than a month, two unusual things happened at the People’s Bank of China.  First, it no longer required banks to set aside cash if clients wanted to short the yuan. This makes betting against the currency cheaper, and allows room for the yuan to weaken. Second, the PBOC removed the so-called counter-cyclical factor, one of the three elements used to determine its daily currency fix, which guides trading. These significant tools were set up in 2015 and 2017 to stem the yuan’s free fall. Last quarter was the yuan’s best in more than a decade. Now Beijing needs to prevent the currency from strengthening too much, particularly with the increasing odds of a Joe Biden White House. Whatever position the Democratic candidate takes toward China, his policies are certain to be more predictable than President Donald Trump’s. That would be a good thing for the yuan. In fact, currency traders had preempted policymakers, piling into the yuan as the odds of a blue wave rose.  Over the past two years, China’s currency has been whipsawed by volatile geopolitics, while traditional valuation metrics, such as the current account surplus and interest rate differentials, went to the back burner. Now that Trump appears to be on his way out, and China’s economy is growing again — with parts of Europe and the U.S. resuming lockdowns — the yuan’s outlook is rosy.  Reining in excessive currency volatility will be critical if Beijing wants to keep a steady inflow of foreign money. Lured by yield, investors abroad have been buying China’s sovereign issues at record pace, promising to overtake city commercial banks as the second-largest purchasing bloc this year. If the yuan becomes a plaything for speculative traders and overshoots, long-term investors will have to worry about currency hedging and may well stop coming, especially when the market seems to believe that a Democratic victory will result in higher Treasury yields. The 2.4% interest rate differential between China and the U.S. may narrow.   Beijing needs foreign portfolio inflows right now. The government is on track to issue 3.8 trillion yuan ($568 billion) of bonds this year, almost 130% more than in 2019, according to HSBC Holdings Plc. Meanwhile, commercial banks have bought only 56% of net sovereign notes, versus 65% in 2019. Starting in June, the central bank tightened interbank liquidity to discourage asset managers from levering up on cheap loans and investing in risky financial products. Now banks are short on money.  That’s why foreigners have become the key to plugging this year’s fiscal hole. A “slow bull,” one of Beijing’s favorite slogans, offers international bond traders steady currency gains — icing on top of the yield cake.  One valid concern is whether the PBOC gave up key tools too early. But even without the countercyclical factor, the yuan fixing will still be based on two elements: the previous day’s close, as well as dollar’s movement overnight against three yuan currency baskets. Each has its own currency picks as well as weightings. That’s a black box rife with currency-management potential. In the past, onshore traders would turn less bearish when the PBOC sent strengthening signals via the countercyclical factor, observed Goldman Sachs Group Inc. In the future, they could well take the cue from one of the baskets edging near-certain key thresholds.  Looking across emerging markets, one can’t stress enough how important a stable currency is for foreign investors. Of course, China is pleased that a Biden win would unwind some of the damage Trump has done to its currency, but it doesn’t want the yuan to go on a fast track, either.

02-11-2020||Opinion||Who created the Electoral College and how can the US fix it?||By Justin Fox When it came time in 1787 to set the rules for choosing a president of the US, three of the principal authors of the Constitution — James Madison, Gouverneur Morris and James Wilson — argued that the best approach, the one most likely to inspire public confidence and national feeling, would be a nationwide popular vote. All three also understood the prospects of this happening were, as Wilson put it, “chimerical.” It was obvious the method would instead have to reflect the two great (or awful, if you prefer) compromises hammered out at the Constitutional Convention over political representation. To keep the slave-holding states on board, the delegates had apportioned seats in the House of Representatives on the basis of a population count that considered slaves to be three-fifths of a person. And to assuage the smaller states they had created a Senate with two members per state, regardless of population. States were thus allotted presidential votes on the basis of how many Senators and House members they had. At first the plan was simply to have the members of Congress vote. But fears this would make the legislature too powerful led the delegates to create what later came to be known as the Electoral College, with the manner of its choosing left to the individual states. If no candidate got a majority of the electoral votes, then the decision went to the House of Representatives — albeit with each state delegation getting only one vote, in yet another concession to the small states. It’s fair to say the men who designed this system did not entirely think it through. Complaints began springing up almost as soon as it went into effect and have continued ever since. In 2004, the Congressional Research Service found “more proposed constitutional amendments have been introduced in Congress regarding electoral college reform than on any other subject.” Only one amendment directly addressing the method of electing the president has ever been ratified (in 1804), while another (ratified in 1933) had some impact on the contingent election in the House. There have been two periods, the 1810s-1820s and 1960s-1970s, when broader reform seemed possible or even likely, as Harvard Kennedy School historian Alexander Keyssar describes in his excellent new book “Why Do We Still Have the Electoral College?” But most of the time, political factions convinced that they benefit from the system as-is have stood in the way of change. As I learned last year while writing about the near-miss 1960s-1970s effort to replace the Electoral College with a national popular vote, these political factions and perceived benefits have not remained constant. The US presidential election system definitely favors particular brands of politics at particular times, as it did in 2016, when it gave Donald Trump the presidency even as Hillary Clinton received almost three million more votes. But it can perhaps best be thought of as a sort of random-number generator, with unpredictably shifting biases, that usually churns out the same result as the popular vote but occasionally does not. With an election coming up in which the makeup of the Electoral College appears to favor Trump again but probably not by enough to get him reelected (when last I checked, FiveThirtyEight’s election model gave him a 3% chance of winning the popular vote and an 10% chance of winning the electoral vote), a brief(ish) review of its post-Constitutional-Convention history seems in order. Mistakes were made The electoral-system amendment ratified in 1804 was the 12th, which arranged that vice presidents and presidents be chosen separately. In the original setup the vice presidency went to the runner-up in the presidential race, and in 1800 Thomas Jefferson and his running mate Aaron Burr ended up with the same number of electoral votes. The subsequent tiebreaker in the House of Representatives proved quite problematic, putting the election in the hands of a Federalist majority that had just been voted out of office in a Democratic-Republican landslide. Two state delegations couldn’t agree on how to vote until, as you may have heard set to music, Alexander Hamilton persuaded just enough of his fellow Federalists to let Jefferson win on the 36th ballot. By changing when members of Congress and the president take office after an election, 1933’s 20th Amendment at least ensured newly elected House members, rather than lame ducks, would do the voting. But the threat of deadlocked state delegations and a deadlocked House remains. The aspect of the real-world Electoral College that seemed most to surprise its designers, though, was how quickly it evolved into a rubber stamp for the partisan leanings of state legislators and voters. Many delegates at the Constitutional Convention assumed that — after voting for George Washington in the first election, of course — electors would choose independently for a variety of well-qualified men, leaving most elections (19 out of 20, predicted George Mason) to be decided in the House. Instead, state political leaders quickly began insisting electors pledge to vote for specific candidates and increasingly arranged that all electors in a state vote for the same candidate, to maximize the national political clout of that state’s majority party. Maryland and Pennsylvania were the trendsetters, awarding all their electoral votes in the 1788-1789 election to the winner of each state’s popular vote (Washington, of course). By 1832 every state but two had adopted this winner-take-all approach. That’s where things stand now, with only Maine and Nebraska choosing some of their electors by House district instead. As scholars started to put in mathematical terms in the 1940s but politicians suspected almost from the start, winner-take-all negates most of the small-state advantage the delegates to the Constitutional Convention had attempted to insert into the system. This is because when individuals or blocs control differing numbers of votes — as with corporate shareholders, the Council of the European Union or the Electoral College — the likelihood that a big bloc will cast the deciding vote is usually higher than its share of the overall votes (the exception is when there are multiple big blocs with identical numbers of votes).  Sure enough, four of the first five presidents came from Virginia, the most populous state in the 1790 and 1800 censuses and No. 2 in 1810. Not until New Hampshire’s Franklin Pierce in 1852 was a president elected from a state in the bottom half of the population ranking, and that didn’t happen again until Dwight Eisenhower of Kansas was elected a century later. (Since then there’s just been Bill Clinton from Arkansas, although Delaware’s Joe Biden would be the fourth.) Thirty-seven of the 44 men who have served as president have come from a state in the top 25% of the population rankings, 26 from a state in the top 12%. The first near-miss: district elections More people live in large states than in small ones, so it should be no surprise their residents get to move into the White House more frequently. Still, small-state politicians perceived early on that winner-take-all was not working to their benefit, and they and other reform-minded sorts began pushing for a requirement that electors be chosen by district rather than statewide. Big-state politicians, understanding such a change would reduce their clout, demanded in exchange that the fallback election in the House be altered to reduce its small-state bias, for example by giving every member of both the House and Senate a vote. Congress came closest to striking such a deal during the “Era of Good Feeling” after the end of the War of 1812 and the collapse of the Federalist Party. Partisan considerations mattered less then because one party, the Democratic-Republicans, controlled almost everything. The Senate mustered more-than-two-thirds majorities year after year for amendments to require district elections, only for them to come up short in the House, where big states were better represented. In 1821, the House did vote 92-54 in favor, but that was still six votes less than the required two-thirds. Not long after that, the Democratic-Republican Party split up into Democrats and Whigs. The prospects for reform faded, even as the 1824 election brought the system under fire again, when the House awarded the presidency to the candidate (John Quincy Adams) who came in second in both popular and electoral votes. There were some perfunctory attempts at reform during the presidency of Andrew Jackson, who lost that disputed 1824 election and then won in 1828. But then Congress more or less let the matter drop until just after the Civil War. Lawmakers proposed multiple reforms both before and after the disputed 1876 election, in which the loser of a not-all-that-close popular vote, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes, ended up in the White House thanks to a political deal even some in his party found suspect. Most of these proposals were again along district-election lines, but some called for a national vote. None really went anywhere, which continued to be the case until after World War II. The barrier to district elections was that the dominant political parties in large states didn’t want to cede clout, while a national popular vote was opposed by the former slave states. The three-fifths compromise had been repealed in 1868 by the 14th Amendment, but after a few years in which freed slaves voted in the South, most states in the region reverted to what became known as the “five-fifths rule,” in which Black citizens counted fully in apportioning House seats and electoral votes but weren’t allowed to vote. A national popular vote would effectively punish the South for this massive voter suppression, so it was a non-starter. By the late 1940s, conditions started becoming more conducive to change. Partisan allegiances had weakened, with liberal and conservative wings in both major parties. The odds Southern states would soon be forced to confer political rights on their Black citizens seemed to be rising. The first big reform effort was led by the odd couple of liberal Massachusetts Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. and conservative Texas Democratic Representative Ed Lee Gossett. They proposed allocating each state’s electoral votes in proportion to its popular-vote tally. This was approved by more than two-thirds of the Senate in 1950, but foundered in the House. Gossett had made it quite clear he hoped the plan would reduce the power of the biggest states and cities and the Blacks, Jews, Italians, Irish, Poles and Communists he said held political sway there. The Czech-born Jewish Chicagoan who ran the House Rules Committee, Adolph Sabath, didn’t let it reach the House floor. The second near-miss: national popular vote Still, the appetite for reform remained, whetted by the third-party presidential candidacies of conservative Southerners Strom Thurmond in 1948 and George Wallace in 1968, which threatened to deprive the major parties of Electoral College majorities and throw the decision to the House. After a series of Supreme Court rulings in the early 1960s asserted the principle of equal representation (before then, states were allowed to have House and state legislative districts with widely varying populations), and the poll-tax-abolishing 24th Amendment (ratified in 1964) and Voting Rights Act of 1965 spelled an end to the five-fifths rule, it became clear a national popular vote was the natural replacement. None of the original justifications for the Electoral College seemed to apply any more. The idea of electors as independent decision-makers had been abandoned by the early 1800s, although there were still occasional “faithless electors” who reneged on their voting pledges. The accommodation made to the slave states in apportioning electoral votes had finally ceased to matter. And the accommodation made to the small states — long viewed as nearly worthless as long as winner-take-all voting was the norm — was made to look even worse than worthless in some calculations published in 1968 by young lawyer and engineer John Banzhaf III. Banzhaf, now a professor at the George Washington University Law School, reckoned based on the bloc-voting considerations described above that voters in California and New York possessed more than twice the per-person voting power as those in the smallest states. Other scholars have since argued Banzhaf’s formula incorrectly assumed victory margins would be tighter in big states than in small ones, and that the biggest voting-power advantages are enjoyed by voters in whatever the current battleground states happen to be. But at the time Banzhaf seemed to have persuaded a lot of small-state lawmakers they’d be better off with the national popular vote. His work also eventually seems to have persuaded some big-state lawmakers they’d be better off without it. But in 1969 the House of Representatives approved a popular-vote plan (with a runoff if no candidate got more than 40% of the vote) by a whopping 338-70 margin. Then a filibuster led by conservative Southerners Thurmond, James Eastland and Sam Ervin halted its progress in the Senate. Sponsor Birch Bayh of Indiana was able to muster 54-36 and 53-34 majorities for cloture in 1970, but both fell short of the required two-thirds vote. They also fell short of the two-thirds majority needed for a constitutional amendment, but both Bayh and his opponents suspected a vote on the actual amendment might have come out differently. National polls conducted in 1968 and 1970 found nearly 80% of Americans supported switching to a national popular vote, so openly opposing it was a risky stance. The 1976 presidential election, in which Democrat Jimmy Carter got 1.7 million more votes but Republican Gerald Ford would have won the electoral vote if just 4,000 votes in Hawaii and 6,000 in Ohio had shifted his way, sparked a renewed effort by Bayh. By this time the South had elected a few Senators who weren’t opposed to a popular vote, but newly elected Republicans Orrin Hatch of Utah and Alan Simpson of Wyoming were opposed, seemingly just because that seemed like the conservative thing to be. The leaders of the National Urban League and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People also voiced opposition, worrying that urban Black voters might find their clout reduced under the new setup. Civil rights leader and future Representative John Lewis begged to differ, presciently describing such arguments as succumbing to the “temptation of temporary advantage.” But the proposal again fell short in the Senate. When it came time in 1787 to set the rules for choosing a president of the US, three of the principal authors of the Constitution — James Madison, Gouverneur Morris and James Wilson — argued that the best approach, the one most likely to inspire public confidence and national feeling, would be a nationwide popular vote.

The limits of resilience and inventiveness Throughout the debates of the late 1960s and 1970s, the most consistent argument against replacing the Electoral College was simply that it wasn’t broken. There hadn’t been an electoral vote-popular vote disagreement since 1888 or a vote thrown into the House since 1824. The Electoral College often turned narrow victories into more-decisive ones, thus conferring legitimacy on the winners, the reasoning went, and helped the states and political parties retain a role in choosing presidents they might otherwise lose.  “The Electoral College was unquestionably intended to serve ends we no longer care to serve, and which it no longer serves,” legal scholar Alexander Bickel wrote in 1971, but “we do well to remain attached to institutions that … challenge our resilience and inventiveness in bending old arrangements to present purposes with no outward change.” I happen to find that argument weirdly compelling, or at least charming. But in retrospect it was also quite naive. Between 1892 and 1956 there wasn’t a single presidential election with a popular-vote margin of less than three percentage points. Since then there have been six. The two Bickel was familiar with (1960 and 1968), delivered Electoral College results that arguably added legitimacy to razor-thin popular vote victories. But there was no guarantee that was going to keep happening (in fact there are those who now argue electoral-vote winner John F. Kennedy actually lost the popular vote in 1960). In 2000 it finally did stop happening, with not only an electoral victory for the popular-vote loser but also a drawn-out battle over the crucial Florida result that was finally decided along partisan lines by the Supreme Court. Not a great way of conferring public confidence or legitimacy on the office of president! Still, President George W. Bush did at least strive to appeal to those who didn’t vote for him once in office, and won both popular and electoral votes in 2004. President Trump lost the popular vote in 2016 by a much bigger margin than Bush in 2000. He subsequently showed little interest in winning over doubters and uniting the nation, instead claiming his popular-vote loss was the result of fraud and trying to politically punish states that didn’t vote for him. Trump’s behavior has at times seemed almost a parody of past defenses of the Electoral College. Without the Electoral College, political scientist Judith Best argued in 1975, “demagogues, self-nominated, individualistic leaders of impermanent factions, charismatic leaders riding a single issue might replace the candidates presently recruited because of their moderation, experience, records of electoral success, and service to permanent party organizations.” Oh, really? Still, the odds of doing away with the Electoral College anytime soon seem slim. Past close calls at reform happened in low-partisanship environments, which is not what we have at the moment. And Republican politicians and voters seem to have convinced themselves the current electoral system is permanently skewed in their favor. I’m pretty sure they’re wrong about this: most indications are that in the 2004, 2008 and 2012 elections it was aligned to deliver the election to the Democratic loser of a close-enough popular-vote loss. But good luck changing enough minds about that to get a constitutional amendment ratified. While only 38% of US adults in the latest Gallup poll on the topic want to keep the Electoral College, 77% of Republicans do. Possible paths for change Electoral College opponents have in recent years tried an end-run of sorts with the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, in which states pledge to award all their electoral votes to the popular-vote winner as soon as states representing an Electoral College majority of 270 votes are on board. This does not seem at odds with the Constitution, which lets states select electors by any manner they choose. It’s not an approach the framers of the Constitution envisioned, but neither is the current setup. The weakness of the NPVIC might be its fragility. States can back out at any time, and basing everything on the national popular vote when the counting of those votes and the determination of voter eligibility remains entirely in the hands of the states seems potentially fraught. Still, it’s a lot easier to achieve than a constitutional amendment, and is currently only 75 electoral votes short of going into effect. Another reform that could shake up although not replace the Electoral College would be expanding the House of Representatives. Keeping its membership constant at 435 since 1912, even as the US population has more than tripled, has been an affront not only to representative government but to George Washington, whose only speech at the Constitutional Convention was a plea for each House member to represent no more than 30,000 people. At the current US population of 330 million, this would mean a House membership of 11,000 and an Electoral College with 11,103 votes. A constitutional amendment that was thought to fall one state short of ratification in 1792 but maybe actually didn’t put the maximum at 50,000 constituents, which implies a House membership of 6,600. That’s a lot! But doubling or tripling the House membership seems like a reasonable reform that could be achieved without a constitutional amendment. Given that it would further diminish the voting power of smaller states in the Electoral College, it might force some movement toward a popular vote. “The history recounted here has a Sisyphean air,” Keyssar concedes near the end of his book. But Sisyphus had to keep rolling his boulder up a hill for eternity. We’ve only been trying to fix the Electoral College for about 230 years!

02-11-2020||Opinion||The US election might not yield instant results. That’s fine.||By The Editors of Bloomerg In recent years, Election Night in America has become a lot like New Year’s Eve. Bars, restaurants and hotel ballrooms fill up with revelers; colleges host watch parties; kids beg their parents to stay up late. And everywhere, people tune into election-night coverage. In 2016, more than 71 million Americans watched the returns come in in real time, about twice as many as watched the ball drop in Times Square. This year the entertainment factor will be compromised. The munching of red, white and blue tortilla chips is still permitted, but this is no time to be crowding into bars and parties. And there’s another potential downer: Delays in counting the votes could mean the evening ends in frustration for both sides. That would be a pity — but there’d be no need to call it a crisis. Even if one candidate handily wins the popular vote and the Electoral College, it could take days or weeks to know it. Take Pennsylvania, which went narrowly for Trump in 2016. Some 2.4 million voters there have already cast ballots, thanks to this year’s unprecedented expansion of voting by mail. According to state law, none can be processed before Tuesday, when officials will be busy running in-person operations. Many other states have seen a massive expansion of early voting. More than 93 million Americans have already cast their ballots, and every state has its own rules for counting them. New Jersey officials got a 10-day head start; Wisconsin officials will begin counting tomorrow; in Michigan, even unofficial results might not be available until Friday. Expecting mail slowdowns, some states will accept postmarked ballots that arrive weeks after Election Day. And as results do trickle out tomorrow night, early returns could skew red or blue, depending on states’ ballot-counting methods. So be it. In this year’s extraordinary circumstances, votes will take longer than usual to count, and close races might not be called promptly. The delays are unfortunate, but what matters is accuracy. The president was wrong to say that it would be “totally inappropriate” to tally ballots for two weeks after Election Day, if that’s how long it takes to count them. Note, as well, that valid ballots processed after Election Day can’t reverse the electors’ verdict, as some suggest: Until they’re counted, there is no verdict. Admittedly, voters in most other rich countries are puzzled that the U.S. finds counting votes so taxing. And after the hanging-chads fiasco of 2000 — a protracted muddle that led many voters to call the result of that election illegitimate — it’s shocking that voting systems weren’t brought up to the standards expected elsewhere. The fact is, they weren’t, and the coronavirus crisis then made matters worse. That means delay, which in turn demands patience. It might take the edge off the evening, but there’s no need for alarm. Just count the votes.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/the-us-election-might-not-yield-instant-results-that-s-fine-910468.html
02-11-2020||Panorama||Urea imbroglio: Govt must deal with policy flaw||For decades, successive governments have grappled with large-scale diversion, hoarding and black marketing of urea - a widely used fertilizer that constitutes nearly half of India’s total fertilizer consumption. The scale of diversion could be as high as 30%. Taking annual subsidy on urea to be about Rs 50,000–55,000 crore, this would mean that Rs 15,000–16,500 crore of taxpayers’ money is being guzzled by dubious operators.  During the last five years or so, the Narendra Modi government has taken several steps to address it. Let us see how these have fared and assess what needs to be done to make a dent. At the outset, let us capture a few basics about the pricing and subsidy policy.   To make urea affordable to farmers, the Centre controls its maximum retail price (MRP) at a low level unrelated to the costs of production and distribution, which is much higher. The excess cost over MRP is reimbursed to the manufacturer as subsidy which varies from unit to unit depending on its cost of production.  The cost of movement from plant to the retailer is reimbursed under a uniform freight policy.   The Department of Agriculture and Cooperation (DoAC) - in consultation with states - assesses the requirement of urea (apart from all other fertilizers) for each cropping season - kharif (April to September) and rabi (October to March). The Department of Fertilizers (DoF) prepares an agreed supply plan to cover all of urea requirement from domestic production and import. The states allocate all of the urea arrivals and track disbursal up to the district level. Even as production cost has increased in leaps and bounds, the government has kept MRP frozen. The current MRP is ridiculously low at Rs 5,360 per tonne or $71 per tonne. The average production cost from gas-based plants is more than four times, at about $320 per tonne and the cost of import is about $300 per tonne. This is a tempting scenario for industrial users in India and for farmers in our neighbourhood - Bangladesh, Nepal etc where the price is $250-300 per tonne.  Addressing a rally in 2016, Prime Minister Modi said, “Urea was being sold in the black market and farmers had to bribe officials to get their quota of urea. My government has put an end to the practice of corruption and black market in its sale by distributing neem-coated urea”. In 2015, the government had issued an order mandating all manufacturers/importers to neem-coat all of the urea supplies. The logic was simple. Upon neem coating, it is rendered unfit for use in chemical industries; hence the manufacturers/dealers will have no incentive to divert. But, this would happen only when coating is done. This is where the rub lies. Policing of a mammoth quantity across the length and breadth of the country is well-nigh impossible. During 2019-20, urea consumption/sales were about 33 million tonnes - even higher than during 2015-16 at 30 MT. Had coating been done, we would have seen a steep decline!   In March 2018, the government made disbursal of subsidy to manufacturers conditional upon actual sales to farmers and these getting registered on point-of-sale (PoS) machines. Prior to this, they were getting 95% of the subsidy ‘on receipt of material at a district’s railhead point or approved godown’ and balance 5% on confirmation of sales to farmers by states. That arrangement was prone to “wholesale diversion” of urea straight from the railhead/godown.  Proof of sale Under the new regime, the requirement to give proof of sale to the farmer might have improved the situation. But, this by itself offers no guarantee as diversion can still happen at the retail level all the more because anybody - including non-farmers - can buy any quantity through PoS machines (all that he needs to do is to furnish his unique identity or Aadhaar number). That apart, substantial payment continues to be made under the old dispensation (wherever PoS machines are not available). Hence, diversion is still rampant.   In August this year, the Centre restricted purchase of urea to 100 bags from 999 bags per transaction by one purchaser. Also, it sought states’ opinion on capping the number of such transactions per month. They were also asked to identify top 20 urea purchasers in each of their districts in 22 major fertilizer-consuming states.  To deal with leakages at the retail level, apart from barring non-farmers from purchasing subsidised fertilizers, the government is now planning to impose a ceiling on the number of bags a farmer can buy at the subsidised price for the whole season. The moment a farmer hits this ceiling, the PoS machine will stop registering the extra bags. If the farmer still wants to buy extra, those bags would be available only at the non-subsidised price.  To execute this plan, the government will need to have data – of land holding, crops are grown etc on over 140 million farm households; based on these parameters, how much urea and other fertilizers each will need; record purchase on ‘real-time’ basis; raise the ‘red flag’ when threshold reaches. This is all bizarre! The most abhorrent idea is ‘purchase of extra at non-subsidised price’.  Is non-subsidised urea available? Which dealer will keep it in his shop? Will there be any takers? Can two streams of urea supply, one at $71 per tonne (subsidised) and the other at $300 per tonne (non-subsidised) co-exist? The government is missing the woods for trees. The diversion has to do fundamentally with flawed pricing and subsidy policy in particular, controlling and freezing urea MRP at an artificially low level.  The way forward is to end control of the MRP of urea, allow manufacturers the freedom to fix retail prices based on the market forces, and remove movement and distribution control. The subsidy should be directly credited to the farmers in their bank account or direct benefit transfer (DBT) as it is known in common parlance. When urea at throwaway price is not available—and thus, there is no arbitrage opportunity—the scope for diversion and black marketing will end too.  (The writer is a New Delhi-based policy analyst)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/urea-imbroglio-govt-must-deal-with-policy-flaw-910075.html
02-11-2020||Panorama||This picture is not from Bihar polls, it is from the US election||Vehicles with Trump flags halted traffic Sunday on the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey and jammed the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge between Tarrytown and Nyack, New York. Another pro-Trump convoy in Virginia ended in a tense shouting match with protesters as it approached a statue of Robert E. Lee in Richmond. In Georgia, a rally for Democrats was cancelled shortly before it was scheduled to begin Sunday, with organizers worried about what they feared would be a “large militia presence” drawn by President Donald Trump’s own event nearby. As the nation races toward Election Day, the tensions and acrimony surrounding an extraordinarily divisive campaign, coming on the heels of a summer of protests and racial unrest, are bleeding into everyday life and adding further uncertainty to an electoral process in which Trump has not committed to a peaceful transfer of power. Sunday’s incidents came a day after a group of Trump supporters in Texas, driving trucks and waving Trump flags, surrounded and slowed a Biden-Harris campaign bus as it drove on Interstate 35, leading to the cancellation of two planned rallies. The FBI confirmed Sunday that it was investigating the incident. On Saturday, Trump tweeted a video of the incident with a message, “I love Texas!” After the FBI announced it was investigating, he tweeted again, saying, “In my opinion, these patriots did nothing wrong,” and instead “the FBI & Justice should be investigating the terrorists, anarchists, and agitators of ANTIFA.” In Graham, North Carolina, a get-out-the vote rally Saturday ended with police using pepper spray on some participants, including young children, and making numerous arrests. Organizers of the rally called it flagrant voter suppression. “These people are afraid,” the Rev. Gregory B. Drumwright, his eyes still burning, said as he assailed the police action in Graham. “There’s a climate of fear around this.” And those were just the incidents that were caught on video. Kristen Clarke, executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a voting rights group, said there had been many more. The group settled a lawsuit last month against officials in Graham who they accused of violating the First Amendment rights of protesters. “We are very concerned about groups lurking and trying to intimidate voters in particular communities,” Clarke said. Her group’s election protection hotline received calls from nearly a dozen counties in Florida just over the past week, she said, reporting individuals or groups harassing voters at the polls. “We want voters to know these sporadic incidents are being addressed, and we want them to be able to cast their ballot,” Clarke said. Law enforcement authorities are increasingly worried, too — not just about what they have already seen, but also about what has been threatened, especially online. Most of the internet threats have not migrated to the nation’s streets, according to a senior law enforcement official who has reviewed Homeland Security Department bulletins and warnings as well as online activity from instigators on the political right and left. But law enforcement officials fear that online posts by instigators could materialize into violent acts. Trump supporters mounted a motorcade across the New York City region Sunday, waving flags and cheering for the president while clogging traffic on key arteries. The supporters were spotted crossing the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge over the Hudson River in the city’s northern suburbs and bringing the busy Garden State Parkway in New Jersey at least partly to a standstill. Officials in New Jersey told a local newspaper that the motorcade stopped near the Cheesequake service area — about 30 miles outside New York City — and “backed traffic up for about 5 miles.” Supporters waved Trump flags, leaned out of their vehicles wearing Make America Great Again hats and honked and cheered. The Mario M. Cuomo Bridge might have been a symbolic target for Republicans — it is named for the deceased father of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who has quarreled frequently with Trump. A separate set of anti-Trump protesters marched in New York City to counter the pro-Trump caravans, leading to some scuffles and arrests. Groups that monitor voting have been preparing for intimidation at the polls at least since September, when protesters disrupted voters at a polling location in Fairfax, Virginia. Of particular concern are militia groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, whose members have lurked on internet chat boards like 4Chan. “We are keeping an eye on them,” said Joanna Lydgate, national director of the Voter Protection Program, which works closely with law enforcement on voting issues. Law enforcement officers can be a complicating factor in protecting voters. While their presence can be welcome to help calm tensions, they can also create anxieties. Ria Thompson-Washington, an executive vice president with the National Lawyers Guild, said she had been in Georgia since mid-October, when early voting began in the state, and had witnessed “a heavy police presence” at the polls. All of this has created extraordinary uncertainty, with fears driven not only by the potential outcome of the election but by the tensions that might erupt in the days and weeks after Election Day. “People are upset, and scared, and frustrated,” said Caitlin Foley, a physician in Philadelphia. “I think there will be unrest, regardless of whichever candidate is in the lead.” Turmoil has defined 2020. More than 230,000 Americans have died of Covid-19; the economy has cratered, and racial tension has sparked unrest across the country. Not all the political activity on Sunday was disruptive. In Atlanta, from the virtual pulpit of Ebenezer Baptist Church, the storied congregation once led by Martin Luther King Jr., there was a call for calm and a plea for agitators to stay away. “In the wake of an election, I say to the Proud Boys and to antifa and to other militias and armed groups, Atlanta does not want your foolishness,” the Rev. Robert M. Franklin Jr., a candidate in a runoff election to serve the final month of Rep. John Lewis’ term in Congress, said in a sermon. In Graham, North Carolina, a city of roughly 15,000 people between Greensboro and Durham, police said protest organizers had failed to coordinate with city officials in planning their rally, and that it became “unsafe and unlawful.” Officials disputed any accusations of trying to thwart voters from getting to the polls. Police said that eight people were arrested on suspicion of resisting the officers and failing to disperse. One was charged with assaulting a law enforcement officer. The department also said officers fired a “mild irritant” on the ground and not directly at protesters. Drumwright tried to preach a message of resilience Sunday. For generations, obstacles had stood in the way of voting for African Americans. And this, in his view, was the latest iteration. “We’re still having to march, to protest, to petition, to speak out, to demonstrate, to activate,” Drumwright said. “We are shaken,” he added. “But we are not broken.” International New York Times||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/this-picture-is-not-from-bihar-polls-it-is-from-the-us-election-910580.html
02-11-2020||Panorama||Chirag is BJP’s lamp, Owaisi its ‘petrol bomb’ to destroy Nitish Kumar: Shaktisinh Gohil||Teaming up with the RJD and Left parties, Congress is in the middle of an interesting election in Bihar. Congress’ pointsman for Bihar AICC in-charge Shaktisinh Gohil tells DH’s Sagar Kulkarni that there is a “wave” in favour of the grand alliance and it is time for the “tired and retired” Nitish Kumar to make way for Tejashwi Yadav.  The first phase of elections in Bihar is over, what is your reading of the ground situation? People of Bihar are fed up with the BJP and JD(U). In Bihar, we have given the slogan: "Bole Bihar, Badle Sarkar." This is not our slogan, but the voice of the people. Change is written on the wall. We gave a positive agenda. The five parties in our alliance sat together and, after circulation of the budgetary provision, came up with a Common Minimum Programme, which was released at a joint press conference. Now, people have big hope and trust in us. I'm sure the people of Bihar will bless us. There is a wave in our favour. Mahagathbandhan will form the government. The alliances in Bihar are in a disarray. VIP and RLSP have quit your alliance, LJP has moved out of NDA. How will this pan out in the elections? If you look at the situation before 2015, all these three political parties— Kushwaha (RLSP), Majhi (HAM) and VIP (Mukesh Sahani)— were in the NDA. They had joined us during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Now, they are not with us. Each election teaches you a lesson. During LS elections, we realised that the votes of the three parties are not transferable and keeping them with us will inflict more damage electorally. After the 2019 elections, we have had eight by-polls which were contested jointly by RJD-Congress. We won seven of those seats. From our experience, we decided that we can accommodate them if they don't have larger ambitions. How will Chirag Paswan going solo affect your prospects? Chirag Paswan is entrapped by the BJP. BJP wants to decorate its house with ‘Chirag’ (lamp) and with the same lamp, it wants to burn down the JD(U). The BJP will then extinguish the lamp. On the other hand, the BJP has a ‘petrol bomb’ in the form of Asaduddin Owaisi, by which they want to end the secular leaders. But this is Bihar, the land of Chanakya, where people are politically wise. The BJP's one ‘Gathbandhan’ (alliance) and three ‘Thugbandhan’ have been exposed. The BJP will face the consequences of its immoral political moves. When the poll process started, it appeared that there was no alternative to Nitish Kumar. This appears to have changed. Ours is not an alliance of ‘Dals’ (parties) but of ‘Dils’ (hearts). The history of Congress has been of good governance and we have Tejaswi (Yadav), who doesn't have any baggage, is a fresh face, and young. When the two are together, people are not worried. People believe when Tejaswi says that we will take along people from all classes, castes and religions. People see this grand alliance as a hope against the ‘tired and retired’ Nitish Kumar who hasn't delivered at all. He has sided with the BJP, a party with which the JD(U) has no compatibility of ideology. As they say in Bihar, the JD(U)-BJP government is a two-engine train – one engine moves in the east, the other in the west. Left in the lurch are the people of Bihar. People of Bihar believe they have been conned. On the other hand, the people of Bihar think that they can trust us – the grand alliance – to provide good governance. Congress is making a strong pitch to scrap the Centre’s new farm laws. What is the impact of this issue in this election? Farmers in Bihar don't get the Minimum Support Price (MSP) because the JD(U)-BJP government ended the APMCs. Traders buy from these farmers and sell in other states, taking advantage of the MSP. The Bihar farmer loses in the bargain. In our Common Minimum Programme, we have promised to start the APMCs, provide MSP and put an end to these black laws. The Prime Minister has described Tejaswi Yadav as ‘Yuvraj of Jungle Raj’ and reminded people of the 15-year RJD rule. Is this striking a chord with the people? The people of Bihar are smart. One must not beat around the bush. Had the government done any work, the Prime Minister would have asked for votes on the basis of that work. In fact, there is ‘jungle raj’ in Bihar now. Bullets were fired during a procession to immerse the idol of Maa Durga. There was no provocation at all. A 16-year-old boy died in the lap of his mother. Tejashwi's rule along with Congress will be a Tejaswi (bright), fast-paced one. Do you see a clear verdict in favour of your alliance or some post-poll realignment? It will be a clear mandate from the people. The Mahagathbandhan will form the government on its own. We won't have to do anything after the polls. No possibility of a tie-up with the LJP later on? That sort of situation will not arise. This is also the first election where seniors like Lalu Prasad, Ramvilas Paswan, and Sharad Yadav are missing from the poll arena. They say ‘change is the only permanent phenomenon’. Now, we are witnessing a generational change. It has also been decided that it is time for the ‘tired and retired’ Nitish and Modi to also go and for the fresh face, Tejashwi, to come.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/chirag-is-bjp-s-lamp-owaisi-its-petrol-bomb-to-destroy-nitish-kumar-shaktisinh-gohil-910581.html
02-11-2020||Panorama||The toxic culture of overachievement||Under-40 achievers lists. Hundred per cent cutoffs for college admissions. Thirty things to do before you are 30.  The list is endless, of what we must experience and achieve quickly. We glorify accepted standards of achievements--the right college, the best job, the ‘perfect’ body, the highest designation. And the younger it comes, the more successful we are. The idea of ‘achievement’ has shifted from the personal domain to the public one. What the world recognizes as an achievement is one, and what we may have desired remains a personal feeling, and delegitimised. Comparison has become the key to describing achievement, where the self is eclipsed. Hark back to a macro look. India, a land of limited opportunities and cut-throat competition, has induced a parenting culture of futureproofing lives. In a country where high standards of educational institutes are scarce, where job opportunities are dwindling, and fear of failure paramount, their panic was almost justified. A staid pattern of education, rising above the competition, securing a job that could be enough for survival was key. Eventually, you were to build passion in what you did, to assuage your own mind, and fulfil your responsibility. The idea of outshining others, and that your achievement counted only once you did so. This is engrained from the first time we seek admissions in schools as children when parents were pitted against one another. And once their child does get the admission they wanted, that too is an achievement. And the cycle begins from there. Lack of equity is forgotten in the face of privilege and recognized ideas of achievements.  Add to that atrocities and discriminations on the basis of gender, class, caste. Each oppressed person has to battle adversaries to be able to start competing on a level playing field against the privileged.  What this means every day is a steady attack on mental health and it starts at an age we don’t even recognize it in. What does this mean in everyday life? Look around. There are unrealistic standards of achievements thrown at us from every corner. Hundred percent cut off to secure admissions? Are we meant to be proud of this? We should be ashamed of the pressure we put on children. Crippling anxieties, depressions are acute.  Unrealistic deadlines at workplaces, pressure management and the desire to overachieve brings with it the fear of failure. Checking and rechecking every word, every step we make fatigues the mind. In the middle of the pandemic, as people work harder and harder, it is difficult to keep the balance and sanity check. Along with that is the pressure and desire for being grateful that we have it better than several others.  Exhaustion shouldn’t be a badge of honour. We take pride in working extra hours, in exhaustion, in achieving the ‘impossible’ deadline we were to meet. Exhaustion is not a badge of honour or an acceptable standard of achievement or a prerequisite for a successful life. It leads to panic and anxiety attacks, and often physical ailments as well. The dismissal of mental health issues adds to lack of conversation that in turn induces further stress and further cyclic viciousness. Popular culture is equally responsible for this. Glorifying the underachiever, selling supplements that keep us prepared for the breakneck pace of life, instead of questioning the nature of that itself is a testimony. Real stories Show us a 50-year-old who changed the course of her life at 40 and secured a PhD. A single, plump woman in her mid-30s walking the ramp untouched. Show us a transgender person becoming a successful police officer. Show us the imperfect, the failures, those who could be written off but still survived. Show us the story of survival that bleeds the soul. Not shiny under-40 plaques, but real people, wanting to live through life, instead of mortgaging it to the future. Help demand eco-systems that ease pressure. Ask for institutes, ask for education, ask for jobs. Call out toxic parenting and schooling. Call out unimaginable pressure in workplaces. So that no day does one calculate their worth basis someone else who achieved what seems impossible.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/the-toxic-culture-of-overachievement-910583.html
02-11-2020||Right in the Middle||My first adventure||At 19 years, armed with a mining diploma, and a job offer by the Indian Bureau of Mines, I travelled to Ajmer. The ticket cost 45 rupees, which was a large sum then. Kind TTs helped me on the way to Bombay and at Ahmedabad, as I could converse only in Kannada and English. As the Ajmer passenger train stopped at Marwar station, I looked out of the window eager to glimpse the heart of Rajasthan.  A colourfully-dressed hawker entered the compartment. He started to pat my head. I wondered what he was doing, it was annoying and I asked him to stop. But he persisted then muttered something that sounded like the word ‘polish’. Thinking he wanted to polish my shoes, I gave them to him. This emboldened him. He took the liberty to pour oil on my head and started beating it, with his fingers and palms. I struggled to push him away as he was quite strong. Much later, I came to know that this was in fact telmalish or oil massage. Back in Bangalore, we had oil baths only in private. As the train was nearing Ajmer it began to get colder and I was dressed only in cotton. I rolled down the shirt sleeves, but it was no use. By now the compartment was nearly empty. The train reached Ajmer at night after three days of travelling. A railway porter hefted my holdall and quickly walked me to a joint only a hundred metres from the station. There was a person at the counter who guided me to a cot and gestured me to sleep well. The stars shone brightly above me as I slept. I thought it was a special room with a view. The night was so cold that I put the holdall on top of me and slept. I realised only in the morning that I had been sleeping on the terrace. The porter had apparently pleaded on my behalf, not to turn me away as I was a stranger and did not know the local language. I got ready and searched for the address of my reporting office. The officer to whom I reported, was surprised to see me holding the appointment letter.  He said I looked like a kid. Maybe seventeen years? Was I sure? he asked. I was administered oath on the Constitution of India.   I felt like I was Rana Pratap come alive.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/my-first-adventure-910073.html
02-11-2020||Right in the Middle||Some things don't change||Please come home aunty, please don’t say no,” saying this I used to pull her hand and drag her to my apartment. I am narrating a series of events that occurred when I was just a four-year-old. Aunty, a school teacher by profession, used to give me a cute smile and tried to convince me that coming to my home was not possible as she was returning from school and was dead tired but would try to make it up to me some other day. I remember, I would hear nothing of her words and would somehow manage to bring her to my abode. My mother, though a little embarrassed by my behaviour, would give her a warm welcome. I had somehow sensed that she liked being invited home. This happened almost every day.  She tried to dodge me once or twice but in vain. You see, I could always spot her bright blue saree, which was her school uniform, and would convince her. Thus developed a beautiful bond between the two of us. One time, my mother had gone to my grandma’s place for a few days, leaving me in the care of my father. I had felt a little lonely then and would often slip into a sombre mood. Aunty sensed my sorrow as I had stopped going to the gate to invite her for almost a week. One day, she dropped by uninvited just to check on me and gave me a beautiful present. I cherished not only this gift but also the memory of it. After my father’s job transfer, we had to move to another city. Time flew by, and the thoughts about my dear aunty soon faded away.  I was in college then when one day, I heard the doorbell ring. I was busy and did not bother to even check who the visitor was. My mother called out to me to see who the guest was. To my utter surprise, it was my dear old aunty. Oh! What a transformation time had on her. It seems that she had a spinal injury on her neck and her head was involuntarily shaking. Yet, she still stood there with the same sweet smile and with a beautiful present for me. Even with all her problems she had taken time off just to pay a visit to us and to see me after all these long years. She recollected all my childhood pranks with a sparkle in her eyes. Though time can change everything it can never erase the bond between two friendly souls.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/some-things-dont-change-910584.html
02-11-2020||Second Edit||RTI: Make postings by consensus||Last week’s appointment of the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and an Information Commissioner in posts lying vacant for months will not help to counter the criticism that the Narendra Modi government is not a great supporter of the idea of the Right to Information (RTI). The government appointed one of the five commissioners, Yashvardhan Kumar Sinha, as the CIC and journalist Uday Mahurkar as a commissioner. Five vacancies in the Commission, which is the top RTI appellate body, continue to exist. The selection of Sinha and Mahurkar has also been criticised. Sinha is considered to be lacking experience and is not the senior-most in the Commission. Mahurkar, who is known to be pro-BJP and has written a book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had not applied for the position. Both were appointed ignoring the objections of the Congress nominee on the selection panel. After the retirement of Bimal Julka, the last CIC, the Commission has been headless for two months. He had himself been appointed two months after his predecessor had retired. The government refused to reveal any details about the candidates and the shortlisting criteria, though the Supreme Court had told it to make the information public. The failure to make appointments when the vacancies arise handicaps the Commission, which actually needs more commissioners. In the last four years, the Commission has never had its full complement of commissioners, and appointments have always been delayed. The number of cases pending before it has increased to about 36,000 now, and it will soon be overwhelmed, like the courts.  The Supreme Court has ruled that delays in clearing appeals would frustrate the right to information and had also said that the government should look for persons outside the bureaucracy. When it selected a non-bureaucrat now, the choice was on a person is thought to be partisan. Appointments to positions like those on the Information Commission should be by consensus. The posting of partisan persons would affect the credibility of the institution, which should function above politics and partisanship. The Supreme Court has held that the right to information is a fundamental right. It has empowered the citizens and sought to deepen democracy. But the government has tried to weaken it. It amended the RTI Act, diluted its provisions and has shown scant regard for the right. It has refused to give information, as in the case of the Arogya Setu app’s origin, to the Commission when it was sought, but has disclosed it to the media. Transparency and accountability of the government are essential features of democracy, and the RTI system is an important tool to ensure them. But the government’s approach and actions have done much damage to it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/rti-make-postings-by-consensus-910071.html

As the state continued to show steady decline in cases and mortalities, health minister Dr K Sudhakar appealed to the people to abide by the Covid protocols. "With 8,053 recoveries and 3,652 new cases, Karnataka witnessed more recoveries than new cases for the 18th consecutive day. Let us continue our fight against Covid-19 by wearing masks, ensuring hand hygiene and maintaining physical distance," Sudhakar tweeted. The state had reported an alarming trend of over 10,500 infections and over 200 fatalities a day for almost a week barely a month ago. A total of 8,053 people were discharged on Sunday, taking the aggregate recoveries to 7,65,261 and active cases stood at 50,592, including 935 in Intensive Care Units of various hospitals, a bulletin said.

02-11-2020||South||Kerala CM's former secretary arraigned in vigilance case too||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's former principal secretary M Sivasankar has been made an accused in a corruption case registered by the state Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) with over irregularities in awarding the work of a housing scheme for the poor. Sivasankar, who was already arraigned in the case related to gold smuggling by the Enforcement Directorate, was made the fifth accused in the case registered by the Vigilance. It was found that Sivasankar accepted a costly mobile phone from a private firm that bagged the contract for the Rs 20 crore housing project sponsored by UAE agency Red Crescent. Vigilance sources told DH that a report arraigning Sivasankar in the case was filed before the Vigilance special court in Thiruvananthapuram. Sivasankar, who is now in ED's custody, will be soon quizzed in this connection. Key accused in the gold smuggling case and former employees of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram, Swapna Suresh and Sarith P S, are also among the accused in the case. Corruption cases against Sivasankar have put the Kerala Chief Minister in a tight spot as Sivasankar was handling many key projects of the government. The ED has also already sought details of some key government projects in which Sivasankar was involved. Opposition parties are carrying out protests demanding the Chief Minister's resignation. Though the CBI also registered a case in connection with the alleged irregularities in the housing scheme, the Kerala government had challenged it before the High Court and the court stayed the probe against government officials in this connection. The case pertained to alleged commission and irregularities involved in a Rs 20 crore housing scheme for 140 families in Thrissur district. The project is funded by UAE-based Red Crescent and initiated under the state government's flagship LIFE Mission scheme that aims at providing houses to all homeless in the state.

"IITM Covid Game" takes inspiration from the popular 'Super Mario' game and is available in Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Tamil and Telugu, besides English, it said. Students have developed the browser-based digital game to create awareness among the general public, particularly children, on the importance of following precautions announced by the government to safeguard themselves against coronavirus. "The game takes inspiration from the famous Super Mario game and consists of a character who encounters various right things-like masks, washing hands and also encounters things to be avoided like hugs, handshakes." "As the character does the right things, points keep getting added. If the character fails to avoid a wrong thing, points get deducted to highlight the consequence. The game goes on for one minute and the players should aim for maximum points," a release from IIT-M said. The game was created by students who took a nine-credit elective course called "Let's Play To Learn" offered during the January-May 2020 Semester, in which they were taught game-based learning tools and techniques, it added. The game can be played on personal computers, laptops, tablets and mobile phones. Prof. Preeti Aghalayam, Department of Chemical Engineering, IITM, a co-facilitator for the elective course, said: "The IITM Covid game is a small but very meaningful and engaging contribution." "And it clearly exhibits how thoughtful and aware our students are," Aghalayam was quoted as saying in the release. Kartic Vaidyanathan, Founder, LetsPlayToLearn and a co-facilitator, said the students applied the concepts and created a number of game design prototypes that are relevant in general for science and engineering courses and can be used in IIT Madras courses.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/iit-madras-students-design-digital-covid-19-awareness-game-910265.html

Even the party central leadership had extended full support to the party in Kerala. Earlier, veteran leader and former Chief Minister V S Achuthanandan used to trigger dissenting voice against the party leadership. But owing to his poor health the 97-year-old leader seems to be unable to come out with his comments on the ongoing row. Now except for indirect statements by leaders like M A Baby, who is a politburo member, that those who indulged in any illegal acts should have to face the consequences, there was no voice of dissent, despite the grave allegations. All the top leaders of the CPM in Kerala, including Pinarayi Vijayan and Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, are from Kannur district and hence it is often referred to as the Kannur lobby. Left thinker and veteran political commentator Appukuttan Vallikkunnu said that there was no surprise why there were no voices of dissent in the CPM now and the national leadership also extending support to the Kerala leadership despite the grave allegations. The CPM in India, which is now in its 100th year, has become a party with both its legs fractured. Kerala is the lone place where they have power and the entire party in the country seems to be sustaining on Kerala. Hence there was no surprise why the party national leadership is also taking a stand in favour of the Kerala leadership, he said. He also said that the absence of V S Achuthanandan's interventions owing to his health limitations was very well felt at this juncture. The current CPM leadership had succeeded in suppressing all those who used to raise dissenting voices against the leadership. If Achuthanandan was still active, the CPM central leadership may not have come out with such a stand backing the state leadership despite the serious allegations, he said. Earlier it was Achuthanandan who used to take open stands against undesirable acts by party leaders. Achuthanandan, who is now an MLA and chairperson of the Kerala Administrative Reforms Commission, had taken stand even against the present government over a nepotism allegation against Industries minister and senior leader E P Jayarajan. Achuthanandan even used to take stand against Pinarayi Vijayan owing to the SNC Lavalin corruption case against Vijayan. But now Achuthanandan is not making many interventions owing to his poor health. Meanwhile, sources close to the CPM said that though there was strong resentment within the party against the present leadership over the current developments, the party leaders were maintaining utmost restraint as the elections are approaching. The upcoming local body elections and the Assembly elections in Kerala are very crucial for the CPM's existence in the country itself.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/no-voices-of-dissent-against-cpms-kannur-lobby-in-kerala-910394.html

The train, which would be an attraction for children especially, was part of a string of projects totally worth Rs 60 crore taken up to elevate the facilities at the panoramic destination to international standards. Vijayan also dedicated an "Urban Park" and a swimming pool at the eco-friendly tourist village, located on the outskirts of the state capital where the Veli Lake meets the Arabian Sea. The miniature rail has all the features of a fully- equipped rail system, including a tunnel, station and a ticket office. The train has three bogies that can accommodate around 45 people at a time. "The eco-friendly solar-powered 2.5 km miniature railway will enable visitors to enjoy the beauty of nature. The Rs ten crore project is the first of its kind in the country," the Chief Minister said in his online address. Artificial steam spouted by the engine of the train, modeled after the vintage steam locomotive, will stir nostalgic feelings. The station house was also designed in a traditional style. The surplus energy generated by the system will be routed to the Kerala State Electricity Board's grid, Vijayan said. A tourist facilitation centre, convention centre and Art Cafe are also to be opened at Veli soon.The convention centre will have an art gallery, digital display facility to feature major tourism and cultural centres of the state and an open air theatre. These world-class facilities will impart a new look to Veli, the Chief Minister said. Tourism Minister Kadakampalluy Surendran, who presided, noted the government had allotted around Rs 120 crore for tourism sector. Of these, administrative sanction has been given to Rs 60 crore worth projects at Veli itself. This showed the governments determination to transform Veli into one of the most attractive destinations for tourists, he said. Among the projects at Veli, Rs 20 crore worth of works have been completed, and other schemes were progressing, he said adding the tourist facilitation centre will be opened in January. The urban park entailed a budget of Rs five crore and the swimming pool Rs 2.5 crore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/indias-first-solar-powered-miniature-train-launched-at-veli-tourist-village-in-kerala-910415.html

The ED had produced Bineesh before the special court dealing with the money laundering cases as the four-day custody came to an end today. The investigation agency sought five more days custody stating that the accused did not cooperate with the probe, which the court granted. The ED arrested Bineesh on October 29 in a money laundering case linked to a drug seizure in Karnataka and took him into its custody for four days to interrogate him. On Sunday night,he reportedly complained of back pain following which he was taken to the Bowring Hospital for check-up. On Monday morning, the ED took him from the hospital and produced him before the court. Bineesh's lawyers challenged the ED's plea stating that he was in bad shape due to severe back pain. They also stated that he vomited several times in the hospital. However, the court turned down their plea. The central agency alleged that the "drug peddler" in the case, Mohammed Anoop, was a "benamidar" of Bineesh. The ED probe stems from a Narcotics Control Bureau investigation that claimed to have busted an ecstasy pills drug trafficking racket in Karnataka in August along with the arrest of Anoop and two others. Bineesh has maintained that he knew Anoop and his family and the latter had borrowed money from him and some others for setting up a restaurant business in Bengaluru a few years ago.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/bineesh-kodiyeri-to-remain-in-ed-custody-for-another-five-days-910448.html

"As per the rules, international passengers on arrival have to produce their RT-PCR negative report, conducted within 96 hours before their departures from the origin country. This report has to be furnished to the state government officials deputed at the airport to avoid institutional quarantine. With the RT-PCR testing facility now available at the Hyderabad airport, passengers can also get themselves tested once they land in Hyderabad," the GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited officials said. Hyderabad airport has collaborated with Mapmygenome, a Hyderabad based National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories and Indian Council of Medical Research certified agency to provide the Covid-19 samples testing services. Sample collection counters for passengers are available at two locations – the immigration level and the forecourt of Interim International Departures Terminal. The lab also offers walk-in options for airport personnel or anyone wanting to undergo a test. "Results of samples will be declared within 3-4 hours. Passengers are advised to factor this time span when booking their connecting flights," officials said.  A negative RT-PCR test report lets the arrival of international passengers continue their onward journey or get an exemption from institutional quarantine. However, they will have to undergo home quarantine as per the norms, unless they qualify for special exemptions as per applicable government rules. In case of a positive result, passengers will be processed in line with applicable ICMR protocols, by the state authorities.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/covid-19-testing-lab-at-hyderabad-airport-for-international-passengers-910451.html

Speaking at an event where a BJP leader and his supporters joined the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), he said the national party always created a "gung-ho, but there is no substance in it". He cited the example of 2018 assembly elections when BJP claimed itself to be the alternative to TRS. But the Telangana people have reposed faith in TRS in election after election, Rao, son of Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, said. TRS was ready to prove what the party government had done in the last six years since the formation of the separate state in 2014, he said. "Telangana people, Telangana state gave Rs 2.72 lakh crore to the Centre in the form of taxes in the last six years. It could be Income Tax, Central Excise, GST or others. Rs 2.72 lakh crore in the last six years. But, how much Telangana has got in six years? Only Rs 1,40,329 crores. It is only taking, but not giving us from Delhi, he said. When that was the reality, BJP leaders spoke as if the Centre had been funding all welfare programmes in the state," he said. The BJP leaders, however, were not ready to accept when money was seized from their houses, he claimed, referring to unaccounted money allegedly being seized from the relatives of the BJP candidate in Dubbak bypoll to be held on Tuesday. TRS can speak for hours together on what it had done to the poor, including social security pensions, investment support scheme for farmers, insurance scheme for farmers, he said and asked what was there to say about the contributions of the Narendra Modi government for common people. The NDA governments demonetisation decision derailed the rapidly growing economy and the Covid-19-induced lockdown added to the adverse impact, he alleged. Even before the outbreak of coronavirus, the country which was growing fast, has slowed down because of the Centre's bankrupt policies, he said. In GDP, on one hand, elders in Delhi make claims about their chest. But, the reality today is, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have moved ahead of us in GDP. Today, we, such a large country, are in a position of bowing our head down in front of them and the world with a lesser GDP, he said. The BJP talked about creating two crore jobs every year, "depositing Rs 15 lakhs" in bank accounts and bringing back black money, he said. The NDA government has not brought back black money but brought in 'black' laws that would "leadto a crisis" in the agriculture sector and break the back of farmers in the name of reforms, he claimed. Elders had once said Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.But, the kisan (farmer) is in danger today and Jawan is also not safe at the borders, he said. Some were dreaming and trying to foment trouble in the name of religion, he said, asserting religious tolerance was ingrained in Telangana. For the TRS, religion was not a campaign issue and patriotism not for showing off, Rama Rao added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/trs-slams-bjp-modi-govt-over-economy-black-money-farm-laws-910453.html

At last count on Monday morning, the state had tested 1,00,29,222 samples as the number of individuals whose swab samples were collected stood at 97,60,029. Officials pointed out that Tamil Nadu is the only state that stuck to the RT-PCR test method, considered the gold standard by the medical fraternity, without taking to antigen and rapid test methods that provide faster results. The state has been witnessing a steady decline in the number of people testing positive for coronavirus for some time now with the cases hovering around 2,600 for the past few days. Two north Indian states – Uttar Pradesh and Bihar – have already tested over 1 crore Covid-19 samples. While Andhra Pradesh has tested 81.82 lakh samples, Karnataka has collected 80.12 lakh samples, Kerala (46.95 lakh), and Telangana (42.81 lakh) till Monday morning. Officials said that Tamil Nadu has 203 testing centres, one of the highest in the country. “We have been following the aggressive testing policy from the month of April and we have come to a point where we have tested over 1 crore samples. This was possible because of the Health infrastructure that was available in the state. And we also used Covid-19 to augment the infrastructure. And we are the only state to have tested all samples using RT-PCR,” a senior government official told DH. However, with the festive season approaching, the Health Department has made it clear that it was not letting the guard down and will continue to follow the aggressive testing policy. The official added that the government was now planning to test traders and shopkeepers due to the anticipated festival rush. Chief Secretary K Shanmugam has also convened a meeting of district secretaries on November 4 to discuss the Covid-19 strategy. Besides the festive season, the government also feels the monsoon season could also lead to a spike in Covid-19 numbers post-Deepavali.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-tests-over-1-crore-covid-19-samples-910460.html

Vijayan, who alleged that the central agencies are acting as per the political script, also suspected of an attempt to sabotage Kerala's prestigious projects like the Kerala Fibre Optic Network that aims at providing high-speed internet free of cost to 20 lakh economically weak families. Vijayan has so far maintained that the probe by central agencies into the Kerala gold smuggling racket is progressing in the right track. But with the ED arresting his former secretary M Sivasankar and the agency seeking details of the major projects being handled by him, Vijayan seems to have changed his perception. "The investigation agencies are crossing the limits by probing into the government's policy matters. The entire state government is being painted as corrupt. The investigation agencies have lost their professionalism as selective leaking out of information is happening and the probe is progressing as per political statements. The state government is not opposed to genuine investigations. But the government will strongly resist politically motivated investigations. The attempts to sabotage infrastructure projects like fibre optic network is aimed at helping vested interest group. The state government is determined to take forward such projects," he said.

MNM, which was launched in 2018 by Kamal Haasan on the plank of an alternative to the two Dravidian majors, contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and garnered nearly 4% votes. “(Deciding on) Alliance is my job. Everyone should work for our victory. Our alliance is with the people,” the actor-politician told his office-bearers at the conclusion of the day-long deliberations. Haasan's announcement came after the party had last month authorised him to take a call on the alliance. MNM also released photographs of a specially-designed vehicle to be used by Haasan for his election campaign next year. Party sources said Haasan will tour the entire state to campaign for the party before and during the elections. Tamil Nadu will face its most crucial poll in the first half of 2021 and this will be the first time MNM will be contesting the Assembly elections. As of now, the fight is between the ruling AIADMK and principal Opposition DMK and MNM. Haasan's long-time friend in the tinsel town Rajinikanth had last week dropped hints that he may reconsider his 2017 announcement that he would contest the Assembly elections due to Covid-19. Party sources said the MNM will put up candidates in all 234 Assembly constituencies and give a “tough fight” to the mainstream political parties.

The incident occurred at about 4 am on Monday morning near Goturu village. Four men travelling in a Scorpio were killed on the spot as their vehicle went up in flames due to the collision with the tipper's diesel engine. The accompanying Etios car also caught fire and one among the three men in it also succumbed to the burns. Two men who were severely injured are undergoing treatment in a Kadapa hospital. Several burnt red sanders logs were found inside the Scorpio. All the men are identified as from Salem and Villupuram districts of Tamil Nadu. Some local TV reports claimed that the Etios car is of a local “Isaac” gang, who were chasing the Tamil Nadu men for the logs. However, speaking to DH, Kadapa superintendent of police KKN Anburajan said that no such evidence has been established yet. “We are investigating the matter in depth. As of now, they all appear to be smugglers from Tamil Nadu,” Anburajan said.

Despite a special task force formation over five years back, hundreds of arrests and seizures of the priced wood in thousands of tonnes, the smuggling continues to be rampant in these two districts. Almost all the men involved in the illegal activity like cutting and transportation of the logs are stated to be from Tamil Nadu. “We have stepped up our vigilance with increased combing operations in the forests, setting up check-posts,” the SP said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kadapa-five-alleged-red-sanders-smugglers-charred-to-death-in-road-accident-910510.html

The candidates, who have completed their PUC and appeared for the National Aptitude Test in Architecture (NATA) entrance test to get eligibility for admissions to Architecture courses, said that the authorities have done injustice to them by calculating 50% marks for those who have written JEE-BArch based on their percentile. “For those, who have written NATA, the score has been given in percentage, but for JEE-BArch students, it was in percentile. The authorities have calculated 50% marks on the percentile which is an injustice to us,” said a candidate who wrote NATA. The KEA had announced rankings for Architecture courses on Friday almost after one-and-a-half month wait. “Though my daughter secured 96% in PUC 2 state board, the way the weightage was calculated by the KEA has caused big damage and she might not be able to get a seat on good college,” said a parent. “As the ranking provided by KEA based on percentile to those who attempted JEE-BArch, the rankings of students who wrote NATA has gone down and they are losing seats, not for their mistake,” another parent added.

With this, the railway authorities have resumed 88 per cent of the total 3,141 suburban services which were being operated before the outbreak of Covid-19, they said. During normal times before the lockdown, the Central Railway (CR) used to operate 1,772 services, while the Western Railway (WR) ran 1,367 services on the suburban network, they said. The local trains, considered, as the lifeline of Mumbai, were resumed for the emergency and essential services staff in June this year. To cater to the increasing crowd in suburban trains, the Central Railway has now added 552 more services on its routes, while the Western Railway has added 201 services, as per a joint press release issued by the CR and WR on Sunday. With this, the special suburban services on the CR routes have increased to 1,572 from the earlier 1,020, while the WR services have gone up to 1,201 from 1,000. Earlier, the Railways had decided to run 610 additional special suburban services from Sunday to avoid crowding in trains. "The Railways is subsequently increasing suburban services keeping in view the social distancing norms and safety of public at large," the release said. The railway authorities have also given inputs to the Maharashtra government as asked by it, the release said. "The Railways is hoping that the state government will revert soon deciding the modalities for providing services to commuters in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region," it said. Earlier, the CR and WR resumed the suburban services for emergency and essential services staff from June 15, and gradually allowed passengers from some other categories, like lawyers and staff of foreign consulates, to also travel in local trains. Currently, the special suburban services are not available for the general public, though women are permitted to travel in the local trains during non-peak hours. Last month, the Maharashtra government proposed to the railway authorities to allow the general public to board the local trains at stipulated timings during the non-peak hours. The railway authorities, however, wrote back to the state government, saying in view of the social distancing norms, they can only ferry 22 lakh passengers, instead of the nearly 80 lakh passengers who used to travel in local trains before the Covid-19 pandemic. They also appealed to travellers to follow the "medical and social protocols as mandated for Covid-19" and not to believe in any rumours.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/mumbai753-new-suburban-services-88-locals-now-back-on-track-910188.html

Activists, politicians oppose rail expansion||Hundreds of people, including some leaders of the Congress and other parties, sat on a rail track in South Goa to protest against a rail doubling work, claiming it is being done to transport coal from the state to neighbouring Karnataka. The Goa government, however, said the protest is "politically motivated" and unwarranted. Several people, under the banner of 'Goyant Kollso Naka' (GKN-don't want coal in Goa), gathered at Chandor village, located 50 km from here in South Goa district, around 11 pm on Sunday and continued the protest till 5 am on Monday. Representatives of various political parties, including the opposition Congress, the Goa Forward Party (GFP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), also took part in the protest. The protesters said they were against rail doubling as it involves cutting of trees in the Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary and a national park on the border of the state. Talking to reporters at the protest site, Leader of Opposition in the Goa Assembly Digambar Kamat alleged that the state government was planning to convert Goa into a coal hub. The Congress leader claimed the double-tracking on the South Western Railway line is being done to help coal-handling companies carry their cargo from the Mormugao Port Trust here to their plants in neighbouring Karnataka. Goa Power Minister Nilesh Cabral, however, said the movement against coal was "politically motivated". "There is no intention of the government to increase the coal-handling capacity. The rail double-tracking is required to run more trains. It has nothing to do with coal-handling," he said. Cabral said coal is already being taken to Karnataka in the existing cargo vansby the South Western Railway, but there are no complaints received from people living along the railway line. He also said some protesters had met him in the past with their demands. "I had told them to support their claim that Goa is being converted into a coal hub," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/goa-a-coal-hub-activists-politicians-oppose-rail-expansion-910195.html
02-11-2020||West||IMA up in arms against Maharashtra government||Private doctors are up in arms against the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government once again after it allegedly excluded private doctors, especially general practitioners, and those running their own sonography, pathology, and other centres, from the priority list of the country's Covid-19 vaccination programme. The Indian Medical Association-Maharashtra State has knocked on the doors of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this regard and pleaded for the Centre’s intervention. IMA-Maharashtra President Dr Avinash Bhondwe and Honorary State Secretary Dr Pankaj Bandarkar, in the letter, stated that the Maharashtra government’s order excludes  private doctors. The government is currently collecting the database of all healthcare workers (HCWs), public and private sectors both, from the states and union territories. In response to the Centre’s call, the Maharashtra government has sought details of the healthcare workers from the facilities run by the government, municipalities, Zila Parishad along with Ayush hospitals and dispensaries. However, for the private sector staff, the government has put a clause - “registered with the district”, as per the letter issued by the Public Health Department’s Principal Secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas.  In a subsequent meeting with district collectors, the Health Secretary directed that only the doctors and medical staff of the hospitals under the Bombay Nursing Home Act should be registered. Dr Bhondwe said that the Covid-19 vaccine will be available to all citizens of India in the next three months. “The Government of India decided that the vaccine should first be given to all doctors in the country, who treated Covid-19 patients without regard for their own lives amid the pandemic. It was also decided that priority will be given to all medical professionals and healthcare workers. The Central government finalised to set up a database for this purpose and published a booklet of guidelines in this regard. This includes all government and private hospitals, government doctors as well as all health workers in private clinics, day OPDs, polyclinics. The central government has planned to vaccinate all these health workers on a priority basis,” he said. Dr Bhondwe said that the state government’s order has led to the exclusion of doctors from privately-run hospitals, clinics, pathology clinics, X-ray-sonography clinics. “Along with government doctors, private medical professionals have also played a key role in treating patients in the corona epidemic. Of the 61 private doctors who died of Covid-19 in Maharashtra, the number of general practitioners and private clinic owners was higher. Yet, we feel that they have been left out for the reason known only to the government,” he said. Earlier, the Maharashtra government had rejected the applications of 61 private doctors in Maharashtra for posthumous insurance of Rs 50 lakh, citing similar grievances. Private doctors' requests for getting PPE kits, masks from a certified company, and at reasonable prices have always been denied, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/ima-up-in-arms-against-maharashtra-government-910196.html

An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana also targeted Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi's reported remark that Belagavi will continue to be a part of Karnataka till the sun and moon exist. It said the boundary dispute between Maharashtra and Karnataka (over Belagavi and other border areas) is pending before the Supreme Court, which will not pass its judgment looking at whether the sun and moon exist in the sky or not. Maharashtra claims Belagavi, part of the erstwhile Bombay Presidency but currently a district of Karnataka, on linguistic grounds. On Sunday, Maharashtra cabinet ministers sported black ribbons to express solidarity with Belagavi's Marathi-speaking people, who observe the foundation day of Karnataka on November 1 as "black day". The Saamana editorial alleged that "brutal attacks" are being made on Marathi people, language and culture in the areas concerned in Karnataka since the past 60-odd years, and the observation of 'black day' is a reaction to that. It said except for the Belagavi dispute, the two states enjoy stronger social, cultural and trade ties between them compared to other states, but the "brutal manner" in which Karnataka has been treating 20 lakh Marathi-speaking people there causes anger. "The governor of Maharashtra should speak to his Karnataka counterpart in strong words about these atrocities. At least, he should try to help the Belagavi delegation get the appointment of Prime Minister Narendra Modi," it said. The editorial further said ministers like Savadi should not forget that lakhs of people hailing from Karnataka are doing business and living happily in Maharashtra. Referring to Maharashtra ministers sporting black ribbons on Sunday, the editorial said had leaders of the BJP and other parties in the state joined the protest, it would have highlighted the states unity on the issue to Karnataka politicians. Without naming BJP's Devendra Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar, it said at least the leaders of Opposition in the Maharashtra Assembly and Council could have sported black ribbons to honour "sentiments of the people". The BJP is in power in Karnataka and if "atrocities" are being committed against Marathi brothers there, then the hearts of the party leaders in Maharashtra "must soak in tears", the editorial said. "Why it did not happen, only they know...it has been published that (Maharashtra BJP chief) Chandrakant Dada Patil said Belagavi and other villages of Marathi-speaking people must be incorporated in Maharashtra. Thanking Patil for saying that!" the Sena publication said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/koshyari-should-speak-to-karnataka-governor-over-belgaum-dispute-says-shiv-sena-910294.html

Deshmukh, who is the state medical education minister, said his department will move a proposal in this regard before the state cabinet. The Supreme Court in September this year stayed the implementation of Maratha quota in jobs and education and referred the matter to a larger bench. The Maharashtra government later filed an application before a larger bench of the SC, seeking vacation of the stay on implementation of the quota. The state government is thinking of how students who have been affected by the Supreme Court's interim stay on implementation of Maratha quota can be given relief in admissions to medical education, Deshmukh told a TV channel. Asked if the government will reimburse their fees, he said, "...this (reimbursing fees) could be an option and the proposal will be moved before the cabinet by the medical education department." "Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray ji will take a final call on the same after the cabinet discusses it," he said. Deshmukh also said the Maha Vikas Aghadi government -- comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress -- is committed to ensure that Maratha community students do not suffer. The Supreme Court in September stayed the implementation of 2018 Maharashtra law granting reservation to Marathas in education and jobs, but made it clear that the status of those who have availed of the benefits will not be disturbed. The Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018 was enacted to grant reservation to people of Maratha community in Maharashtra in jobs and admissions. The Bombay High Court, while upholding the law in June last year, held that 16 per cent reservation was not justifiable, and said quota should not exceed 12 per cent in employment and 13 per cent in admissions.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maratha-quota-maharashtra-govt-considering-fee-refund-to-students-910314.html

Sawant said at a function held in the state capital to mark the installation of the new president of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha. Karan Johar's Dharma Production has been in the eye of the storm after a local production team hired by the Mumbai-based film company was accused of dumping garbage -- which included PPE gear -- generated during a film shoot in a Goa beach village. The Goa government has demanded a public apology from Dharma Production for the alleged indiscretion. 'Coffee with CM' is one of the several outreach programmes which have been lined up by the state BJP, in the run-up to the 2022 state Assembly polls, for which the saffron ruling party has already begun preparations. Sawant also acknowledged that one of the key issues facing the youngsters in the state was the lack of available jobs and announced that the government -- which had barred recruitment amid the pandemic -- would be posting vacancies early next year. "There are a lot of problems related to youth. It includes employment too. I know, unemployment is an issue which is prevalent in Goa. But we are not scared. Over the next year 8,000 to 10,000 government jobs will be advertised and filled after January (2021)," the chief minister said. With the state's mining industry still non-functional following a Supreme Court decision scrapping existing iron ore leases and the tourism industry facing a slump following the Covid-19 pandemic, unemployment is expected to be one of the key issues in the upcoming Assembly polls which are scheduled to be held early in 2022.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/coffee-with-cm-goa-bjps-latest-youth-outreach-gig-910490.html
02-11-2020||West||High stake bypolls in Gujarat to eight Assembly seats||Voting for bypolls to eight Assembly seats in Gujarat will be held on Tuesday in which 81 candidates are in fray, whose fate will be decided by 18.75 lakh voters. The opposition party, Congress ended its campaign by making two video clips public which allegedly showed an ex-legislator from the party saying that he and a few other MLAs took Rs 10 crore from BJP in orde to resign. He named Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, state president C R Paatil and Union Home Minister Amit Shah in his allegations. Hours after the clips of a "sting operation" were released by state Congress president Amit Chavda in a press conference, his BJP counterpart Paatil also held a press conference denying the charges categorically. He said his name was not mentioned by Somabhai Patel anywhere in the video. The bypolls were necessitated after eight Congress MLAs resigned. This makes this election significant as five of them are now BJP candidates. The Congress, which has suffered 10 such defections in the last one year, has raised the pitch in its appeal to voters to reject such candidates.   The result of this poll is not going to change the government in the state but is important in many ways. Political observers say that the outcome will show if voters really care about the leaders who change sides for money or power. Secondly, it is going to make or break Congress, out of power in the state for over two decades. Victory in a majority of the seats will be good news for the leadership ahead of upcoming crucial civic body polls which can build the momentum for the 2022 Assembly polls. "In the last Assembly polls (2017), Congress lost in the end, but it fetched 77 seats and reduced the BJP to 99 in a house of 182 Assembly seats. It was the highest number of seats Congress won in last four polls. The result showed that Congress could turn the tables if it fights as a team. If it loses badly in the bypolls, the party will suffer a major setback," said a Congress leader. The outcome can also be decisive for 27-year-old Patidar leader Hardik Patel appointed by Congress as state working president, a decision unpopular among party workers and senior leaders. A big win may increase his acceptance in the party, while a setback could prove costly for him. Similarly, the result will establish state BJP president C R Paatil, who is considered an experienced strategist, as a leader outside his parliamentary constituency of Navsari in south Gujarat. Paatil was appointed state president only in July this year. "The BJP workers are circulating a video of Modi inaugurating a series of facilities for tourists at Kevadia, the seat of Statue of Unity, and the launch of Seaplane service as part of its poll campaign to woo voters. It hardly has anything local to offer," said a source in BJP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/high-stake-bypolls-in-gujarat-to-eight-assembly-seats-910491.html
