12-11-2020||First Edit||Bihar election: Nitish Kumar’s final diminishment||The Bihar Assembly election results were a mixture of the expected and the unexpected. Though it was expected at the beginning of the campaign that the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by JD(U) leader and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar would comfortably come back to power, the alliance could only scrape through in a seesaw battle. As the campaign progressed, there was an impression that the Mahagathbandhan, comprising the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress and the Left parties and led by the 31-year-old Tejashwi Yadav, might even win. Most exit polls also supported this view, but the alliance could only make a tough fight of the battle, which went to the wire. As it has turned out, the NDA has only a very narrow majority, but the state will have a continuity in government. But it is a new NDA in a new situation where the relative strength of the BJP and the JD(U), and probably the equations between them, have changed. Against all the odds that were thought to have been built against it during the campaign, the NDA just about managed to hold on to its tally. This was because the BJP increased its tally. The JD(U) lost ground heavily, showing that Nitish Kumar’s popularity and standing with the people has taken a serious knock. There was an anti-incumbency sentiment against the government, perhaps because of the failure of the government to provide jobs to the youth or to take care of the migrant workers who returned, or for other reasons. But this seems to have affected only the JD(U) and Nitish Kumar, as he was the visible symbol of the alliance and the government. The BJP may have been helped by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s campaigning. The JD(U) also seems to have been hurt by the posture of the LJP (Lok Janshakti Party) led by Chirag Paswan who, it is thought, may have been put up by the BJP deliberately to hurt its ally. The results show that the tactic, if it was one, succeeded. The BJP is the major partner in the alliance now and is entitled to lead the government. Nitish Kumar stands diminished and downsized, politically and in terms of numbers. The BJP leadership and Prime Minister Modi have declared unambiguously that he would be the Chief Minister of the new government. Even if the party does not change its stance now, Nitish would be at its mercy in the new dispensation. At present, the two parties do not also have any option other than to stick together, but there is a new politics in Bihar, and politics is always unstable and uncertain.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/bihar-election-nitish-kumar-s-final-diminishment-914520.html
12-11-2020||In Perspective||A radical idea, proposed by Kautilya||Politicians, grossly deficient in their abilities to deliver, love power and have no power to love, say many analysts. A common complaint is that elected representatives never visit their constituencies after being elected, let alone improving the plight of the people who voted them to power. For money and power, many elected members shamelessly defect from one political affiliation to another to bring down elected governments. Some develop delusionary messianic self-images, many behave like a bunch of sheep, as depicted in Yes, Minister. It sounds like a campaign speech or pontification or self-eulogisation whenever they speak. They behave as if only they have all the wisdom. Many do not even know that they do not know. One principal reason for all this is that politicians are elected, not selected. Most electoral systems are faulty. But that is a separate issue. In India, a substantial proportion of voters belong to economically backward classes. It is common knowledge that poor people are more vulnerable to exploitation and manipulation. In the current era of internet, on the one hand, and of excessive advertising, on the other, political parties spend huge sums of money to hire agencies, especially during elections, to ‘buy’ poor voters and to manipulate others by questionable means. Cambridge Analytica, for instance, is a case in point. Politicians must be well versed, with a deep understanding of the history, the geography, the cultures, and traditions of the diverse group of people they are expected to serve. They must bear the highest ethical characteristic of integrity. They must have a scientific temper and high respect for science. Fundamentally, they must satisfy some minimum eligibility requirements in terms of qualities and expertise in running the government. Unfortunately, there is no process in place by which the politicians can be selected. It is a free-for-all situation. Everyone in society goes through a selection process for everything -- from admissions to school and college to obtaining qualifications to entering employment and promotion to higher positions, in all walks of life, except politics. For jobs and employment, from primary school teacher to university lecturers, from attendants to officers in government, from technical staff to professionals such as engineers, doctors, nurses, mangers, journalists, etc., all have to go through highly competitive selection processes, containing psychometric tests in some cases. In addition, they undergo training and evaluation at various levels. But there is no selection process or evaluation for politicians. It is thus elemental that anyone wishing to be a politician, irrespective of affiliation or ideology, must go through a stringent and rigorous selection process before being considered for contesting elections. Kautilya, traditionally also known as Chanakya or Vishnugupta, is generally credited with authorship of Arthashastra, an economic and political treatise of ancient India. This comprehensive compendium on governing a nation is believed to have been written some 2,000 years ago. Besides many aspects of governance, Kautilya has discussed extensively the qualities of the persons who should be in government. The best king (the leader), he says, is one who learns unceasingly to enrich his thoughts, shuns falsehood, sincerely fosters prosperity of people, develops, and empowers people, lives a humble life. The greatest enemies of a king (leader) are not others, but conceit, arrogance and recklessness, he says. A just king (leader) wins the loyalty of his people not because he is king (leader), but because he is just. Selection of Amatyah (ministers and high officials), he says, must be based on the ability to execute, character and values. The Amatyah must be well prepared, excellent in their fields of expertise, well-versed in theoretical and practical knowledge, kind and philanthropic, free from hate, and dedicated. Kautilya has also laid down methods of screening the politicians. The politicians must be tested and must successfully exhibit the qualities elaborated by him. The text enunciates eligibility requirements and rigorous selection process – including test of knowledge and intellectual abilities, character, values, integrity, etc. It also stipulates regular performance evaluation of all involved in the governance of a nation. In our country, we have fool-proof admission tests like JEE and CAT for higher education, UPSC for civil service, and recruitment tests for military education and training. It should not be difficult for us to develop such a selection and testing system for politicians. To achieve this, formulation of laws by the central government or constitutional reform may be necessary. There is enough expertise, experience and wisdom in our country. All relevant central and state institutions and all political parties must come together to work out the details of institutionalisation and implementation of such a system.

Superintendent of Police Laxman Nimbargi informed the media that village elders, Maruti Koppad and others who had filed a complaint demanding action against miscreants for the desecration of the statue, have withdrawn their complaint. They informed the police that three village residents -- Siddappa Nargund, Raghavendra Hurkadli and Mahantesh Koppad -- while on their way to agricultural lands on Sunday at 2 am, noticed that the shawl on the statue of Lord Basaweshwara had fallen down. Siddappa climbed the statue platform and while putting the shawl on the statue, his leg brushed against the hand of the statue which had been holding the linga and ripped it off. They were afraid after the incident and discarded the damaged statue hand near Chippalkatti village. The trio did not intend to damage the statue and have confessed to it being an accident. People protesting against the incident have been asked to stop them and also there was no need for further investigation, elders said in a petition to the police.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/lord-basaveshwaras-statue-in-ramdurg-was-damaged-by-accident-says-village-elders-914492.html
12-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Action demanded against timber merchants||Villagers in the region alleged that the timber merchants have been collecting wooden logs from the roads on the state highway and rural areas and are loading them into lorries. As the timber transporting lorries are loading wooden logs on both sides of the Madikeri-Hassan state highway, the people passing through the road have been facing inconveniences. The movement of other vehicles has been affected. As the wooden logs are piled up on the curves, the vehicles coming in the opposite direction are prone to accidents. In spite of this, the department concerned has not initiated any action. "The wooden logs should be cleared from the roadsides to facilitate the smooth flow of traffic," said the villagers. The wood is loaded into the lorries using cranes, during nights as well. The people pointed out that even though there is a rule saying that a 40-meter-distance from the middle of the road, on both sides of Somwarpet-Madikeri state highway should be vacant, the rule is being violated. Also, the rural roads are ridden with potholes, making it difficult for the movement of vehicles. PWD Assistant Executive Engineer Mohan Kumar has warned of initiating serious action against those who pile up wooden logs on the road. If the wood is placed on the roadsides in the morning, the same should be vacated by evening, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/action-demanded-against-timber-merchants-914494.html

Paying a visit to the village, Ganesh listened to the woes of the people. Speaking to reporters on the occasion, he said that people in Shirangala GP limits have been facing hardships from the past 35 years. The land was identified for the rehabilitation of homeless people. But, no houses were provided to them. “The MLAs from BJP who have been getting elected from the last 25 years have completely ignored these residents. Instead of responding to the woes of the people, they have turned a blind eye to the problems of the poor people,” he said. He urged the elected representatives to hold a meeting with the officials and provide rehabilitation for the villagers. Houses should be built for them on the five-acre land identified by the district administration. If the district administration does not respond to the plea, the JD(S) workers, along with the villagers, will observe a hunger strike near Gandhi Mantapa in Madikeri, he said. JD(S) district secretary N C Sunil, minority unit district president Isaac Khan, Youth wing general secretary Jashir and others were present.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/provide-rehabilitation-to-harangi-residents-k-m-b-ganesh-914495.html

The petition is filed by Bengaluru city-based advocate Sudha Katwa. The petitioner stated that between August 8, 2014, and May 5, 2020, the government has issued orders withdrawing cases.

Addressing a media conference here, on Thursday, Chairman of MUDA H V Rajeev said, "There are 80,000 applications pending for sites. Landowners have come forward to enter into a 50:50 ratio partnership, with a total of 700 acres, at present." "MUDA has the ability to develop layouts on up to 4,000 acres of land, to meet the residential demands of the citizens. But, among the applicants, some have seniority of up to six attempts. Over this period of time, some of them would not need MUDA sites, now. Thus, we plan to link the applications with Aadhaar number and Permanent Account Number (PAN),” he said. Rajeev said that once MUDA enters into an agreement with a landowner, Rs 5 lakh was paid per acre, earlier, to meet their immediate needs. Now, it is increased to Rs 10 lakh per acre. "Besides, once the agreement of a particular block is over, a deadline of 18 months is set, for the development and handing over of the 50% share of sites to the landowners. It is left to the discretion of the landowners, to either keep or surrender their share of the sites. As the joint-venture of MUDA with landowners is on consent and agreement, unlike notification and acquisition earlier, legal hassles will reduce," he added. “The objective of MUDA is to provide affordable sites to citizens and also to ensure that the landowners are not cheated. We plan a two-pronged approach to meet the demands of aspirants for sites and houses. Besides layouts, we plan to build high-rise apartment buildings. We are also taking possession of MUDA lands and buildings, which have been illegally encroached upon, and will put them to good use. MUDA is recruiting five surveyors to speed up the work. We have also formed teams, to coordinate with landowners.” “We have sent a proposal to the government to have MUDA squad with the police officials to tackle encroachment, cheating, and fraud cases. We have already blacklisted 26 developers in the wake of irregularities. Such action need to be taken on a war-footing, in the interest of the citizens,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/muda-guidelines-now-friendly-for-land-owners-914851.html

12-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Doubling will ensure all-weather link between Goa and Karnataka: South Western Railway||In the wake of objection raised by Goa environmentalists and state Congress unit for doubling of railway line in Goa, as part of the Hosapete-Vasco railway line doubling project, the South Western Railway (SWR) has clarified that double line would improve mobility and provide all-weather rail link in the region. In a virtual press conference, P K Mishra, additional general manager, SWR stated that the line doubling project would result in more number of passenger trains, boost intrastate connectivity and trade and commerce between the states. Apart from relaxing bottlenecks of ghat section operations and improving passenger amenities at stations, the double rail line would also result in increased tourist inflow, he said. Works to double the 90-km line in Goa have been awarded, and are being taken up after ensuring necessary clearances. The single line in the ghat section is limiting train running capacity, and the average section running time is also less. The ghat section is extremely landslide-prone and it remains frequently cut off during the rainy season. Therefore, the doubling project would be a game-changer, the additional general manager explained. He clarified, with the emphasis being given to the usage of environment-friendly sources of energy, the transport of coal is coming down gradually. The purpose of the project is to facilitate the easy and faster movement of the public. Moreover, the doubling is being done on railway land, and there is no additional impact on the environment. The alignment would be decided to avoid trees to the extent possible, and not to affect buildings. Environment impact assessment study is done by IISc-Bengaluru, and electrification would make trains carbon-neutral, he added. SWR chief public relations officer E Vijaya stated that all stakeholders would be taken into confidence, genuine concerns of the public would be addressed, and the work would be executed only by liaising with the Goa government. The SWR issued a clarification on the track doubling between Karnataka and Goa following stiff opposition by the Goan Congress and environmentalists citing the proposed project, along with NH 4 widening, will turn the tiny state into a coal hub.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/doubling-will-ensure-all-weather-link-between-goa-and-karnataka-south-western-railway-914860.html

12-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||Karnataka: Ministerial hopefuls wait as confusion prevails over Cabinet rejig||Two separate delegations of BJP legislators met Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa on Thursday even as hectic lobbying is said to be underway ahead of the much-awaited Cabinet rejig. Plus, there is no clarity on whether Yediyurappa’s Cabinet will be expanded or reshuffled. A reshuffle will mean that some incumbents will be shown the door to make way for new faces. During the day, one delegation of party leaders from Chitradurga and another from Davangere met Yediyurappa at his home office Krishna. According to the chief minister’s office, the delegations discussed developmental works with Yediyurappa. However, it is said that they also discussed the imminent expansion or reshuffle of the Cabinet. After the BJP won the Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar bypolls, Yediyurappa said he would contact the party’s central leadership to discuss the Cabinet rejig. Yediyurappa’s Cabinet has seven ministerial positions vacant and several aspirants are waiting in the wings to be inducted. “Based on seniority, I’m expecting a ministerial position,” six-time Chitradurga MLA G H Thippareddy told reporters. “But, I will not embarrass the CM by repeatedly meeting him to lobby for it. I’ll be happy if I’m given a chance. If not, I won’t do anything to embarrass the party.” Hiriyur legislator K Poornima said she would abide by the party’s decision. “Everybody aspires to be a minister,” she said. Soon after the bypolls win, Yediyurappa hinted at the possibility of a reshuffle when he said some ministers might have to be dropped. Animal Husbandry Minister Prabhu Chavan told reporters that the Cabinet will be expanded. “This is according to the information I have,” he said. Revenue Minister R Ashoka also told reporters that there was no plan to reshuffle the Cabinet. He even said that the Cabinet expansion will take place only after the Bihar election dust settled and the Deepavali festival. Apparently, the party is considering a reshuffle because “there’s too much representation for Belagavi.” While the Cabinet has seven ministers representing Bengaluru, there are four from Belagavi- Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, Women & Child Development Minister Shashikala Jolle, Textiles Minister Shrimant Patil and Jarkiholi. “Bengaluru’s case is different because three ministers were rebels who helped the party come to power,” one minister said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/karnataka-ministerial-hopefuls-wait-as-confusion-prevails-over-cabinet-rejig-914829.html
12-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||D K Shivakumar should convince former mayor to surrender: Nalin Kumar Kateel||BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel said that Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee chief D K Shivakumar should convince former mayor Sampath Raj to surrender. Kateel was speaking to media persons after inaugurating ‘Vishaya Pramukh’s Prashikshana Varga’ at Sharada International Hotel in the town on Thursday. He said that the former mayor had caused a huge embarrassment to MLA Akanda Srinivas Murthy. “The Congress should hand over former mayor because a case is pending against him.” Kateel said that Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa would decide on the expansion of the Cabinet. The decision taken by Yediyurappa will be truly in the interest of the state. Thus there are no apprehensions over his decision. He said the party was all prepared to take action against MLA Basavanagouda Yatnal for his anti-BJP activities. Earlier, Kateel said BJP-led state government was synonymous with the pro-development agenda. After inaugurating the ‘Prashikshana Varga’ (orientation programme), he said the recent elections had rejected ‘Goondagiri’ and caste politics. He accused Congress of becoming a house of rebels. Congress will not be able to gain even 30% of seats in the next election. In contrast, BJP will sweep gram, taluk and Zilla panchayat elections with more than 80% seats, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/d-k-shivakumar-should-convince-former-mayor-to-surrender-nalin-kumar-kateel-914870.html

So where have the votes gone?” he asked. He was addressing mediapersons while participating in the protest against the handing over of Mangalore International Airport (MIA) to Adani Group, organised by the Youth Congress, in Kenjar, on the outskirts of the city. Shivakumar added that the party would undertake a detailed booth-wise study and get experts to analyse the poll results. Responding to D J Halli riots, he said BJP need not preach on justice. On BJP State President Nalin Kumar Kateel’s statement that Sampath Raj was kept in a safe hideout by Shivakumar, he declared, “Is Nalin Kumar Kateel the home minister? If I had hidden him, they could have arrested me. Nalin is a bundle of lies.” He also wished that Kateel should continue as president of the party for the next 100 years.

12-11-2020||Main Article||Arnab Goswami saga: Republic of collective decadence||It is difficult to comment on the validity of the case that led the Maharashtra government to arrest Arnab Goswami, the controversial media anchor known for his noisy engagement with the fate of the ‘republic’. Yet, the fact remains that this dramatic event has aroused mixed emotions and made us rethink issues relating to the ethos of journalism, the increasing politicisation of media houses and freedom of the press. To begin with, it is important to realise that we are living in a time characterised by stimulant nationalism and rising narcissism; and the ruling regime cannot be said to be very open to the culture of engaged debate, responsible journalism and critical voices. In recent times, we have witnessed how civil rights activists, academic intellectuals and journalists with a critical voice have often been humiliated, castigated, stigmatised as ‘anti-national’, and even arrested. Hence, when the likes of Smriti Irani or Amit Shah express their anguish over the arrest of Goswami, shed tears for democracy, recall the horror of Emergency, and speak of the freedom of the press, everything looks absurd. Is the message, “I support your freedom only when you praise my every act, and silence or condemn those who critique me?” At the same time, it would be too naïve to believe that the Shiv Sena, or, for that matter, the Maharashtra government is truly committed to the ideal of justice. Think of a phenomenon called Arnab Goswami. Any careful observer of what he does on the screen is likely to find that in the name of the ‘republic’, the messages of stimulant nationalism are disseminated. Dialogue, for him, seems to be a bad word. His noisy monologue always finds the ‘enemies‘ of the nation: from Kashmiri militants to JNU tukde tukde gang, and from the ‘anti-national’ public intellectuals to all those who dare to critique the policies of the Narendra Modi government. In a way, he symbolises the mood of the times: the way the discourse of hyper-masculine militant nationalism leads to the militarisation of the consciousness. In other words, it is narcissism—the death of self-reflection, critical thinking and the art of conversation. Possibly, his ‘success’ lies in the fact that for many other television channels and their ‘star’ anchors, he became the role model to emulate. Hence, he fits well into a media culture that is aggressively ‘nationalist’ and inherently violent.   Yes, Arnab Goswami is a symptom of the disease that has afflicted the contemporary media culture. This disease can be seen as the manipulated public sphere. In an ideal and democratic public sphere, there is a possibility of dialogue and reflexivity, and politico-intellectual freedom and critical consciousness. And this sphere of ‘communicative action’, it is said, strengthens democracy. The tragedy is that despite multiple media houses and television channels, we are witnessing this decline in the culture of dialogic communication. There are primarily two reasons for this decline. First, when there is an alliance between the neoliberal market and some sort of a totalitarian state, the public sphere is likely to be invaded by the instrumental logic of the system. And hence, quite often—if we reflect on ‘panel discussions’ on our television channels—we experience the absence of critical consciousness and the art of conversation. It would not be entirely wrong to say that barring some remarkable exceptions, what is projected as news is boxing, dialogue is replaced by noise and screaming, sensationalism is promoted, and the oppressive binaries are reproduced: Hindu vs Muslim, ‘deshbhakts’ vs ‘conspirators’. The status quo is maintained.  And second, there is something inherent in the logic of the visual medium. An illustration would make it clear. As a young college student in the mid-1970s, I grew up reading the columns of some of our finest journalists and editors—say, Nikhil Chakravarty, Shyam Lal, Kuldeep Nayyar, Arun Shourie. I never saw them on billboards in our cities; nor was I aware of their look, glamour and style. Yet, there was an intense and silent communion with them. However, in the age of instantaneous consumption, filled with 24/7 television news channels, I began to see the birth of ‘stars’ or ‘celebrity’ journalists. And each of them became a ‘brand’ or a ‘product’ that, as many of these politically motivated corporate media houses think, ought to be sold. I have no hesitation in saying that with the birth of ‘stars’, serious journalism began to suffer. I see its degeneration into some sort of dramaturgical performance. Hence, every night at 9 pm on our television channels—particularly the channels that bother about the fate of the ‘republic’ in these ‘times’—we witness a drama, a thriller, a ‘reality show’. Critical thinking, art of listening, honest ground reporting -- none of those matter; the ‘brand’ or the ‘star’ takes us for granted. But then, the fact is that we have begun to love these channels. We need not forget that Arnab Goswami speaks English; and the urban/metropolitan/affluent class consumes him every night. And they are ‘educated’. This is frightening. Does it then mean that, despite our formal education and social capital, we have lost our critical faculty and finer sensibilities, and allowed ourselves to be hypnotised by this glitz, drama and noise? Is it that we, too, have become mere consumers of spectacles and dramaturgical performances? Or, is it that in this media-induced age of instantaneity and superficiality, anything that demands critical reflection and serious enquiry looks ‘boring’, and the only thing that excites us is, to take an illustration, a glossy story of Rhea Chakraborty, or, for that matter, an imagery of the surgical strike celebrated through an over-dramatic/nationalist gesture? Is it the time to see beyond Arnab Goswami, and look at ourselves?

Captain G R Gopinath has worn many hats: An officer in the Indian Army, a silk farmer and an entrepreneur. But he created history by the launch of the first budget airline, Air Deccan. Actor Suriya's must-waiter film "Soorari Pottru" that was released on Amazon Prime releases today is based on G R Gopinath's book "Simply Fly". Let's listen in to what Gopinath has to tell us.  Nina C George: Sir, tell us a little about your growing up years. You grew up in a small village in Karnataka. From there you reached the global stages. What was the journey like? Captain G R Gopinath: I have vivid memories of my village. Very fond ones. The village was well known because my grandmother's brother was a well known short-story writer and novelist called Goroor Ramaswamy Iyengar, who has immortalised a rural Kannda village. So people know that village, much before me. My father was a school teacher in a local school and he also had a landholding there. He was greatly influenced by Gandhi, Tagore and our very own Shivramkarant. He never put me to school until my 5th standard. He said in any case you are bound, regulated and put in a kind of school prison. So he said, learn from home and learn from nature...

12-11-2020||National||India fears new Covid-19 wave even as cases plummet||Two months ago, India looked like a coronavirus disaster zone. Reported infections neared 100,000 a day, deaths were shooting up, and India seemed ready to surpass the United States in total recorded cases. Today, India’s situation looks much different. Reported infections, deaths and the share of people testing positive have all fallen significantly. By contrast, infections in Europe and the United States are surging. But doubts persist about the reasons for India’s drop, and some researchers say the results stem at least in part from a possible change in testing, though researchers say they do not have access to complete data to really know the big picture. The experts generally agree that the number of infections has far outstripped efforts to track them in India, like elsewhere, and that infections in the country could still get considerably worse. There has also been a shift in collective thinking, and experts worry that India has begun to lower its guard. After an intense lockdown in the spring and restrictions on social gatherings through the summer, the government has been steadily unlocking. There’s no talk of locking down again. The overall mood seems to be, “Let’s move on.” Mobility data show that Indians have returned to shopping areas and public spaces. Many are not wearing masks. A large chunk of the population seems resigned to the threat of infection. “People are saying: ‘What the hell, we have to learn to live with it. God knows how long it will last,’” said Dr. Naresh Trehan, a cardiologist and head of the Medanta hospital chain, based near New Delhi. In many places, he added, “people are partying like there is no tomorrow. So if you do things like that, you are bound to suffer.” Many doctors here believe it’s just a matter of time before the cases start shooting up again. Other countries, including the United States, France and Germany, thought the worst virus days were behind them, only to hit new highs. Parsing the course of the outbreak is difficult anywhere, and the next few weeks could complicate the picture. Cooler weather could spur a rise in infections. The Hindu holiday season, when millions of people travel to see relatives and flock to stores to load up on gifts for Diwali, Hinduism’s festival of lights, is beginning. Air pollution in India’s cities is also increasing, as it does every fall and winter, and doctors fear that toxic air could lead to more hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19. Some areas are seeing spikes, even as the national numbers fall. New Delhi, for example, is currently hitting record highs. “The unexposed, the elderly, the young who missed the first two waves” could still get sick, said P. Umanath, a doctor and civil servant helping to supply testing kits in Tamil Nadu State. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington projects that India’s cases will soon increase again and exceed 1 million daily infections — many of them never detected — by year’s end, in part on the assumption that India does not widely embrace wearing masks. Still, for the moment, official numbers suggest the coronavirus is in retreat. From a high point of nearly 98,000 daily infections on Sept. 16, the average dropped to about 46,000 cases per day this past week. The number of daily virus deaths has fallen to around 500 from 1,200 in mid-September, and India’s overall death toll is still much lower, per capita, than that in many other countries. By official figures, India has had about 8.5 million infections, trailing the United States by about 1.5 million. The government has claimed credit, citing its lockdown in the spring and a public awareness campaign, even as it has urged the Indian people to remain vigilant. Things are getting better,” said Harsh Vardhan, India’s health minister. “However, there is no room for complacency.” Several prominent scientists and doctors have been reluctant to accept that India’s overall infections are dropping, saying the lower numbers could be explained by the increased use of less reliable tests and fewer tests. The number of tests performed each day varies, but on average it has remained around 1.1 million for the past 2 1/2 months, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research, the top government body aggregating Covid-19 data. And the council points to a drop in the positivity rate across the country, or the share of administered tests that find the coronavirus, to 3.7% this week from 8.6% in mid-September. The council also said the country had decreased its reliance on rapid antigen tests, which detect viral proteins called antigens and are considered less sensitive than other tests, to 41% now from 47% in mid-September. Data from the more reliable tests — called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests — showed a similar decrease in infections, said the council’s director general, Balram Bhargava. “We are seeing that downward trend clearly,” Bhargava said. Even more broadly, scientists believe that testing cannot capture the full spread of the disease in India or in any other countries. Surveys of blood samples have suggested that at least 15% of residents of certain urban areas may have already contracted the virus. A new blood sample survey estimated that more than one-quarter of people in Karnataka, a large southern state with a population of more than 60 million, had already been infected. Just how many people in India have contracted the disease, and may have developed protective antibodies, is the big question. A government-backed study based on mathematical projections — employing a model typically used to track the progression of a disease — estimated that nearly one-third of the country had already contracted the virus. The scientists estimated the number of undetected cases for each recorded infection by using data showing the rates of transmission in India, the numbers of infected and the numbers of recoveries. While other scientists cast doubt on that study, they believe infections have reached 200 million, or at least 15% of the population, undetected. “The government and the public have focused on the recoveries and low fatalities and decided to let the virus take its own natural course and cruise toward herd immunity, if that can be attained,” said Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health who tracks India closely.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-fears-new-covid-19-wave-even-as-cases-plummet-914564.html

ICMR and SII have further collaborated for the clinical development of COVOVAX (Novavax) developed by Novavax, USA and upscaled by SII. SII CEO Adar Poonawalla said ICMR has played a huge role in coming forward and strengthening India’s fight against Covid-19. “The collaboration will further aid us in putting India at the forefront of developing an immunogenic and efficacious vaccine. The pandemic has presented a chance to foster structural reforms in building robust public healthcare infrastructure. The partnership further testifies the importance of private-public institutes coming together in scaling up the management and containing the spread of the virus,” he said. ICMR Director General said that India plays a prominent role in vaccine development and manufacturing globally. “Buoyed by the latest technology and well-equipped facilities, SII has continually proven its research and manufacturing prowess. The partnership is our contribution to lending our expertise and support to bolster our fight against the global pandemic,” he said. According to a press statement, ICMR has funded the clinical trial site fees while SII has funded, other expenses for COVISHIELD. At present, SII and ICMR are conducting Phase 2/3 clinical trials of COVISHIELD at 15 different centres, across the country. It has completed the enrolment of all 1,600 participants on 31 Oct 2020. COVISHIELD has been developed at the SII Pune laboratory with a master seed from Oxford University/AstraZeneca. The vaccine made in the UK is currently being tested in large efficacy trials in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and USA. The promising results of the trials so far give confidence that COVISHIELD could be a realistic solution to the deadly pandemic. COVISHIELD is by far the most advanced vaccine in human testing in India. Based on the Phase 2/3 trial results, SII with the help of ICMR will pursue the early availability of this product for India. SII has already manufactured 40 million doses of the vaccine, under the at-risk manufacturing and stockpiling license from DCGI. Furthermore, US-based Novavax has initiated its late phase trials in South Africa and in the UK and will soon commence the same in the USA. SII has received the bulk vaccine and Matrix-M adjuvant from Novavax and will soon fill and finish them in vials. This vaccine formulated at SII (COVOVAX) will be tested in a Phase 3 trial in India and an application for the same to regulatory authorities will be made soon by ICMR and SII.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/serum-institute-completes-enrolment-for-phase-iii-covid-19-vaccine-trials-914592.html
12-11-2020||National||Indian Navy's fifth Scorpene class submarine Vagir launched||The Indian Navy launched the fifth of the Sorpene-series of submarines was launched in Mumbai on Thursday. Known as the Kalvari-class - that is being built at the Mazagon Dock Ltd (MDL) as part of Project-75, the latest in the series, Yard 11879 was launched at the Kanhoji Angre Wet Basin amid Naval traditions.

Several of them demanded that the frequency of trains be increased to avoid the rush. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had also urged railway authorities on Wednesday to run more trains to ensure that people do not jostle to board the rakes. Railway police personnel and other officials were seen making futile attempts to control the surge of passengers at the stations, mainly in the Eastern Railway's Sealdah and Howrah divisions. The situation was slightly better in the Howrah- Kharagpur section of the South Eastern Railway on Thursday, with trains being comparatively less congested. Long queues to buy tickets, with some extending way outside the station premises, were witnessed since early morning at various places including Sonarpur, Baruipur, Mallickpur, Sodepur, Barrackpore, Serampore, Naihati. Throwing caution to the air, passengers shoved each other as they boarded or disembarked the crammed compartments. In many trains, commuters occupied seats, which have stickers marked on them asking people not to use them. The Eastern Railway has said that it would be operating 615 locals daily in its two divisions, while SER would be running 81 services as of now. "We are running 84 per cent of the total number of the trains mentioned in the time table during the peak hours for the convenience of passengers," an ER official said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-norms-in-kolkata-go-for-a-toss-as-commuters-cram-local-trains-914622.html

Their lawyer Shyam Kalyankar said that the plea could not be heard on Thursday as the judge did not preside. "The anticipatory bail plea of Goswami and his wife was simply adjourned till November 23," he said. "We did not seek any interim protection from arrest today as we are waiting for the detailed order of the Supreme Court (passed on Wednesday granting bail to Goswami in another matter)," Kalyankar said. The apex court on Wednesday granted interim bail to Goswami in a case of alleged abetment to suicide of interior designer Anvay Naik in 2018. Goswami, who was arrested on November 4, was released from the Taloja prison in Navi Mumbai late Wednesday evening. Last week, an FIR was registered against Arnab Goswami, his wife Samyabrata Ray Goswami and his son at N M Joshi Marg police station in central Mumbai for allegedly assaulting a woman police officer when a police team went to his house to arrest him on November 4. Currently, Arnab Goswami and his wife have filed an anticipatory bail plea in the assault case. They have been booked under Indian Penal Code sections 353 (assault to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 504 (intentional insult to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) and under the Damage to Public Property Act.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cop-assault-arnab-goswamis-pre-arrest-bail-plea-adjourned-to-nov-23-914637.html

At an online media briefing, Russian Deputy Chief of Mission Roman Babushkin also said that both sides are working on a mutual logistics support agreement and close to seal a multi-billion dollar deal under which an Indo-Russian joint venture will produce 200 Kamov Ka-226T attack helicopters for the Indian armed forces. Asked whether the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) signed between India and the US will have security implications in operation of Russian-origin platforms by the Indian armed forces, Babushkin did not give a direct reply, but said Moscow's defence ties with India are immune to any "restrictions and foreign interference". "We are watching quite closely the relations in strategic areas between India and other nations including the US, of course. But at the same time we are absolutely sure that whatever ties India is developing with other nations, they would not be at the expense of Russia's interests," he said. Last month, India and the US inked the landmark BECA agreement that will provide for sharing of high-end military technology, geospatial maps and classified satellite data between their militaries. "As far as our defence cooperation with India is concerned, it is immune to any restrictions and foreign interference, because it reflects national interests of both countries and we are proceeding with a great sense of confidence to the future progress in our ties," Babushkin said. On the S-400 deal, he said: "The deadlines remained unchanged at the moment. The first batch is expected to be supplied by end of 2021 but we are working very hard for an earlier supply." In October 2018, India had signed a $5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, notwithstanding warning from the Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanction. In view of the evolving security scenario in its neighbourhood, India recently requested Russia to explore the possibility of advancing the supply of the interceptor-based missile systems which can destroy incoming hostile aircraft, missiles and even drones at ranges of up to 400 km. Last year, India made the first tranche of payment of around USD 800 million to Russia for the missile systems. The S-400 is known as Russia's most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile defence system. Babushkin said the Kamov helicopter deal and another one to manufacture 700,000 AK-47 203 rifles in India under a Indo-Russian joint venture were in the final stages of conclusion. In October 2016, India and Russia had finalised a broad agreement to set up joint venture between Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) and two Russian defence majors for procuring 200 Kamov Ka-226T choppers for Indian armed forces. According to the understanding, 60 Kamov-226T helicopters will be supplied to India in fly-away condition, while 140 will be manufactured in India. Russia had agreed to ensure transfer of technologies to India as part of the pact. India and Russia finalised the deal for manufacturing AK-203 rifles during Defence Minister Rajnath Singh's visit to Moscow two months back. On the Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA), Babushkin said it will help in deepening maritime security cooperation between the two countries, particularly in the Indian Ocean Region. The MLSA will allow militaries of the two countries to use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies besides facilitating scaling up of overall defence cooperation. India has already signed similar agreements with the US, Australia, Japan, France and Singapore.   The Russian Deputy Chief of Mission also said that both countries were also working on a number of other military acquisition programmes including supply of another batch Su-30 MKI aircraft to India. The other major programmes mentioned by him are relating to main battle tanks, frigates, submarines and missiles. The Kamov helicopters will be supplied to the Indian Air Force and the Army. Both these forces have been pressing for early conclusion of the deal so that they could replace their ageing fleet of existing choppers within next three to four years. Babushkin said Russia is also aiming to ensure its largest participation in the upcoming Aero-India, considered Asia's largest aerospace exhibition. The exhibition will take place in Bengaluru in February. "It will also see new developments in our defence partnerships," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/working-hard-to-ensure-early-supply-of-s-400-missile-systems-to-india-russia-914688.html
12-11-2020||National||Bollywood actor Asif Basra found hanging at private complex||Actor Asif Basra, a familiar face in several movies and TV shows including "Jab We Met", “Kai Po Che!” and "Paatal Lok", was found hanging in a private residential complex here on Thursday, police said. He was 53. “He hanged himself around 12-12.30 today. We are investigating the matter. We have sent the body for post-mortem... Prima facie it is a case of suicide," Kangra Senior Superintendent of Police Vimukt Ranjan told reporters here. The actor's body was recovered by police officials, he said. Further details are awaited, Ranjan added. Basra had reportedly leased a property in McLeodganj, Upper Dharamshala, about five-six years ago and visited the place regularly. The news of the sudden death of the character actor, which comes months after Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput was found hanging at his residence in Mumbai on June 14, led to shock in the industry with several of his colleagues expressing their grief. "What? This is too shocking!! Shot with him just before Lockdown!!! Oh My God!!!" tweeted actor Manoj Bajpayee. Director Hansal Mehta was equally stunned. "Asif Basra! Can't be true... This is just very, very sad." In his over two-decade career, Basra played supporting parts in many critically-acclaimed features such as "Black Friday", "Parzania" and "Outsourced". Among his notable roles in Hindi cinema was his brief but standout performance as a cunning stall owner in Imtiaz Ali's 2007 film "Jab We Met", alongside Kareena Kapoor Khan and Shahid Kapoor. He played the father of Emraan Hashmi's Shoaib Khan in Milan Luthria's "Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai" (2010). His most recent outing was in Amazon Prime Video's smash-hit series "Paatal Lok". Among the others who condoled his death were directors Onir and Rahul Dholakia. "In shock. Can't believe that we have lost him. #asifbasra Used to meet him so often at the park jogging. He would tell me not to jog sideways,I might loose balance and hurt myself," Onir tweeted. Dholakia, who directed Basra in the National Award winner "Parzania" and in the Sanjay Dutt-starrer "Lamhaa", said Basra was a "wonderful actor and a jovial fellow". "I mean why would he?? Very Sad - had directed him in Parzania (Chagan), in Lamhaa ( the Darzee ) and also in society... Very sad to hear about his passing !! #asifbasra Hope you are at peace," he added. Casting director Mukesh Chhabra tweeted, "This can’t be true Asif Bhai, we have done so much work together from 'Kai Po Che' to 'Hostages 2'. I can not believe this! Whatttt is happening??????????? #asifbasra". Basra’s sudden death is the latest blow for the industry, struggling to get back on its feet after the lockdown that came into effect in March to curb the spread of COVID-19. After Rajput’s death -- which ignited discussions on the nepotistic nature of the industry and its gate-keeping attitude but took an entirely different angle after the actor's family filed an FIR against his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty – TV actor Samir Sharma was found hanging in his Mumbai home in August, Sharma was best known for his roles in “Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi” and “Left Right Left”.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bollywood-actor-asif-basra-found-hanging-at-private-complex-914714.html

Deepak Kochhar was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in September under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the ICICI Bank-Videocon money laundering case. The businessman, through his lawyer, applied for bail on merits as well as on account of default, claiming the prosecution has failed to file a charge-sheet in the case within stipulated period. The special PMLA judge rejected his default bail plea, while the one filed on merits is posted for hearing on November 23, ED's lawyer Hiten Venegaokar said. Responding to Kochhar's claim that the probe agency had failed to file the charge-sheet on time, the prosecution had submitted that the same was filed on November 3, but it is pending scrutiny by the concerned department, as there are five trunks full of documents that needed to be verified. Thus, the court is yet to take the cognisance of the prosecution's complaint. The ED had arrested Deepak Kochhar in September after it filed a criminal case of money laundering after studying an FIR registered by the CBI against the Kochhars, Videocon Group promoter Venugopal Dhoot and others. The central probe agency slapped money laundering charges against the Kochhars and their business entities for "illegal sanctioning of loans amounting to Rs 1,875 crore to the Videocon Group of companies". The ED had earlier said an amount of Rs 64 crore, out of the Rs 300 crore loan sanctioned by a committee headed by Chanda Kochhar to Videocon International Electronics Ltd, was transferred to Nupower Renewables Pvt Ltd (NRPL) by Videocon Industries Ltd on September 8, 2009, just a day after disbursement of the loan by ICICI Bank. NRPL was earlier known as Nupower Renewables Ltd (NRL) and is a company of Deepak Kochhar. The agency had alleged that the "net revenue of Rs 10.65 crore was generated by NRL from these tainted funds". "Therefore, proceeds of crime amounting to Rs 74.65 crore were transferred to or to say generated in NRPL," the ED had claimed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/money-laundering-case-court-rejects-deepak-kochhars-bail-plea-914721.html

He said, "I find that people today believe they can boldly and brazenly condemn the Supreme Court of India and its judges by exercising what they believe is their freedom of speech". "But under the Constitution, freedom of speech is subject to the law of contempt and I believe it is time people understand that attacking the Supreme Court of India unjustifiedly and brazenly will attract punishment under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1972," he said. In a series of tweets on Wednesday afternoon, Kamra said, "Honour has left the building (Supreme Court) long back". In another tweet, he termed the SC as the "most Supreme Joke of the country". The Supreme Court of this country is the the most Supreme joke of this country... In yet another tweet, he posted the picture Supreme Court in saffron colour with the flag of BJP. "This is gross insinuation against the entirety of the Supreme Court of India and that the Supreme Court of India is not an independent and impartial institution and so too its judges, but on the other hand is a court of the ruling party, the BJP existing for the BJP's benefit," Venugopal wrote.

12-11-2020||National||From the Newsroom: Centre announces additional Rs 2.65 lakh crore Covid-19 stimulus package||In your evening news brief, From The Newsroom, India announces additional Rs 2.65 lakh crore Covid-19 stimulus package; Moody's Investors Service says it expects India's economy to shrink by 8.9 per cent in the 2020 calendar year due to the Covid-19 pandemic; Karnataka approves to borrow Rs 7,438 crore for the Bengaluru suburban rail project; Actor Asif Basra found dead in Himachal Pradesh; RJD's Tejashwi Yadav elected leader of the Grand Alliance legislature, and a special court rejects default bail plea of businessman Deepak Kochhar.  Here are the top news of November 12, 2020: The Centre on Thursday announced an additional Rs 2.65 lakh crore as part of a fresh Covid-19 stimulus package that includes Rs 65,000 crore of fertilizer subsidy, income tax relief to home buyers and developers and a new scheme to incentivise the creation of employment opportunities. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also announced an extension of emergency credit support of Rs 3 lakh crore announced under the first stimulus package to 26 other stressed sectors including hotels, tourism, travel, textile and others, as identified by the K V Kamath Committee. The date of the loan support, which was going to expire on November 30, was also extended till March 31, 2021.   Moody's Investors Service said on Thursday it expects India's economy to shrink by 8.9 per cent in the 2020 calendar year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, compared to an earlier forecast of a 9.6 per cent contraction. The revision comes as a rise in novel coronavirus cases slows in the world's second-most populous country, and economic activity picks up after a 23.9 per cent contraction in April-June, when consumer spending, private investments and exports collapsed during one of the world's strictest lockdowns.   The Karnataka Cabinet on Thursday gave administrative approval to borrow Rs 7,438 crore for the Bengaluru suburban rail project that is being implemented jointly by the Centre and the state. The money will be borrowed by a special purpose vehicle that has been set up to implement the Bengaluru suburban rail project, Law Minister J C Madhuswamy said, briefing reporters. While the Centre and state will contribute Rs 2,479 crore each, Rs 7,438 crore will be borrowed from lending agencies through the SPV.   Actor Asif Basra, known for starring in movies such as "Jab We Met", "Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai" and "Kai Po Che!", died on Thursday, the police said. He was 53. The actor was found hanging in a private complex by the police and a team of forensic experts is on the spot, said SSP Kangra Vimukt Ranjan. The police is investigating the case and further details are awaited, Ranjan added. It is being reported that the actor had a property on lease for the past five-six years in McLeodganj, Upper Dharamshala, and used to visit the place regularly.   RJD's Tejashwi Yadav was on Thursday elected the leader of the Grand Alliance legislature party and promptly hit out at the NDA, claiming it won the assembly elections through "deceit". Addressing a press conference, Yadav mocked Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, whose JD(U) has been relegated to the third position in terms of seat tally, and wondered whether the latter would "heed his conscience and give up his attachment to the chair".   A special court in Mumbai on Thursday rejected the default bail plea of businessman Deepak Kochhar, husband of former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar and an accused in money laundering case. Deepak Kochhar was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in September under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the ICICI Bank-Videocon money laundering case. The businessman, through his lawyer, applied for bail on merits as well as on account of default, claiming the prosecution has failed to file a charge-sheet in the case within stipulated period.

12-11-2020||National||PM2.5 levels on Diwali will be lowest in 4 years if no crackers burnt: SAFAR||The PM2.5 concentration in Delhi on Diwali is likely to be the "lowest" in the last four years if no firecrackers are burnt, a central government agency said on Thursday. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said pollution levels in Delhi during the Diwali period are likely to remain in the higher end of the "very poor" category in the absence of emissions due to fireworks. "Under 'zero-firecracker' scenario, the level of PM2.5 is likely to be the lowest in the past four years as not so calm surface winds in Delhi will help in dispersion (of pollutants)," it said. PM2.5 is particulate matter which is about three per cent the diameter of a human hair and can lead to premature deaths from heart and lung diseases. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". SAFAR said stubble burning-induced impact on AQI is expected to increase from “negligible to moderate” in the next two days. A spike in PM2.5 in the early hours of November 15 is likely in case of fire-related emissions, it said. "The transport-level winds are now north-westerly and will have high potential to transport biomass plume in the next three days, but the expected moderate surface winds in Delhi will not allow rapid accumulation of pollutants for a longer period,” it said. However, the air quality is expected to remain in the higher end of the “very poor” category and the lower end of “severe” category on Diwali night. SAFAR said moderate easterly boundary layer winds are likely on November 15 and November 16. Isolated rainfall under the influence of a fresh Western Disturbance is also expected by November 16. "These two factors will help in reducing the impact of any additional emissions and biomass plume," it said. On November 5, the Delhi government banned the sale and use of all types of firecrackers in the city from November 7 to November 30. On Monday, the National Green Tribunal also imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the NCR from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying "celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm25-levels-on-diwali-will-be-lowest-in-4-years-if-no-crackers-burnt-safar-914762.html

There are worrying signs that the resolve to continue adhering to the dos and don’ts of the times -- physical distancing, wearing masks and maintaining hygiene protocol – is flagging. This recklessness, more evident ahead of Diwali, may lead to a resurgence in novel coronavirus infections and stall the progress in curbing the disease, the experts said.  “Yes, people are definitely getting tired but unfortunately the virus is not,” Prabhdeep Kaur, deputy director at Chennai's ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology (NIE), told PTI. Although there is a decline in active cases and test positivity in India, a large proportion of the population is still susceptible to infection, she warned. There is a risk of resurgence unless people wear masks, maintain social distance and avoid gatherings.    According to the Health ministry on Friday, Covid-19 cases rose by 44,879 to take the count to 87.28 lakh while recoveries went up to 81.15 lakh. In Delhi, however, the cases continue to escalate with 7,053 cases and 104 fatalities recorded on Thursday.  "The virus is here to stay and we have to adopt certain behavioural changes for the long term. If we become complacent, the virus will continue to spread and we may see a resurgence of cases,” the epidemiologist said. When the nationwide lockdown was first announced in March, people were charged with energy and there was the desire to actively work towards flattening the Covid-19 curve. However, as the months roll into another with no signs of an end anytime soon, the mix of anxiety and fear has left many people feeling drained.   As motivation dips, people are growing more lax about social distancing guidelines -- and potentially putting themselves, and others, in harm’s way. With Diwali just two days away, the signs are there across the country with large crowds thronging markets, people getting together for social and religious gatherings and a general recklessness setting in. Psychologist Shweta Sharma said people have already reached a higher stage of fear and anxiety in the pandemic and this is the reason for their “avoidance behaviour” as far as precautionary measures are concerned.   “Motivational factors are also important to increase any desirable behaviour but in this situation where people are not sure about their motivational factor due to uncertain causes of getting contamination, it’s becoming a forcing factor for them,” Sharma, a consultant clinical psychologist at the Columbia Asia Hospital in Gurgaon, told PTI.   She said it was natural to develop a sense of complacency over a period of time as people see their efforts have not led to the desired result. “They are not even sure whether their efforts are making any sense or not. So the psychological tendency of complacent behaviour has increased where people are not concerned about the results and are acting in autopilot mode,” Sharma, who is also a counsellor at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Health Center, added. Economist and epidemiologist Ramanan Laxminarayan agreed that the compliance to Covid-19 protocols has fallen significantly as it is a challenge to continually wear masks and maintain physical distance. He noted that there has been a decline in the number of infections post-September in many urban areas, likely because of the build-up of pockets of population immunity that have slowed down transmission.   “However, the virus continues to spread both in parts of urban areas that have been unaffected so far as well as in rural India which is where the bulk of the population lives,” the director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy in Washington told PTI.   Citing the example of the 1918 Spanish flu that killed over 50 million people, Laxminarayan said complacency was common during the second wave of a pandemic.   “In India, this could lead to greater infections during the winter months. Already, ICU beds are unavailable in New Delhi and the same situation is likely to prevail in other cities if control measures are dropped,” he said.    According to a recent survey by Prabhdeep Kaur and her colleagues in the Greater Chennai Corporation area of Chennai, nearly 72 per cent people in slums and 64 per cent in non-slums did not wear masks. The survey, jointly conducted by the GCC and ICMR-NIE, covered 3,600 individuals in 60 streets, including 1,800 individuals each in the slum and non-slum areas.   “We cannot let the virus determine the trajectory in the coming months as the course of the pandemic will depend on various factors. As we have learned from many countries such as Thailand, Vietnam and New Zealand, it is possible to keep the virus under control if we implement the test, trace, isolate strategy and if people cooperate and accept Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” the ICMR-NIE epidemiologist said.   The public health expert suggested that authorities need to do more awareness campaigns using mass media to educate people regarding the importance of mask use and also inform them about how to wear them correctly. “We also need to enforce masks and social distancing in public places and workplaces,” she said, adding that the government alone cannot control this pandemic and everyone must come forward to join hands to defeat the virus.   Although it is difficult and challenging, reminding people of the human toll of Covid-19 is the only approach, concurred Laxminarayan.    “Some states are reducing testing and hiding cases. When that happens, the public does not get an accurate picture of the seriousness of the situation and stops taking measures to protect themselves. Transparency and increased testing are the only solutions,” he added.   Sharma noted that mindfulness is needed in our individual thoughts, behaviour and actions to stop the spike in cases. She added that authorities also need to change strategies for public awareness and come up with a more realistic approach.   “Only 'challans' are not going to help, it should come as an individual's responsibility not as a way for a 'challan'-free exit. Effective visuals and positive affirmations are more required in line to create realistic awareness,” she added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/caution-fatigue-may-lead-to-covid-19-spike-experts-warn-as-crowds-increase-ahead-of-diwali-914786.html
12-11-2020||National||LSR student suicide: University students stage protest outside UGC demanding institutional enquiry||Students from various universities in Delhi staged a protest outside the UGC headquarters here, demanding an institutional enquiry into the death of an LSR college student, who allegedly committed suicide last week following concerns over pursuing education in view of her family's poor financial condition. "The negligence in the disbursement of scholarships, ignorance on the part of the administration and the unjust system of online education have claimed many lives in different ways amidst the pandemic, tampering the future of thousands of students like Aishwarya," one of the protesting students said. The protest call was given by the Left-backed All India Students' Association of India (AISA). Aishwarya, a student of the Lady Sri Ram (LSR) College for Women and an IAS aspirant, was found hanging at her Shadnagar house in Telangana's Ranga Reddy district on November 2. In a suicide note purportedly written by her, the 19-year-old woman said she did not want to burden her parents with her educational expenses, according to police officials. The second-year BSc Mathematics (Honours) student had returned home from Delhi in March, after those staying in the hostel were asked to go home by the college authorities in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. "The digital divide, owing to the class-caste-gender divide in the society is widening and resulting in inequalities that will reflect way after the pandemic is gone. We demand the setting up of an independent inquiry into the institutional murder of the LSR student. "We want the disbursement of all pending scholarships, including JRF and SRF, and a strategic re-opening of college campuses, hostels and other university facilities," a charter of demands submitted by the protesting students said. "The provision of internet be made for those in need and the government must take the responsibility of the bills. Students amidst the pandemic have been one of the worst-hit communities. From a lack of resources to a lack of resilience on the part of the government, the education of India's poorest has suffered terribly," it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/lsr-student-suicide-university-students-stage-protest-outside-ugc-demanding-institutional-enquiry-914788.html

The ministry, in its notice, has directed Twitter to explain within five working days why legal action should not be initiated against the micro-blogging platform and its representatives for disrespecting the territorial integrity of India by showing an incorrect map. The notice was issued to Twitter by the Ministry of Electronics and IT on November 9, the sources said. In the notice sent to the global vice president of Twitter, the ministry asserted that showing Leh as part of Jammu and Kashmir is a deliberate attempt by the micro-blogging platform to undermine the will of sovereign Parliament of India which has declared Ladakh as a Union Territory with its headquarter in Leh. Twitter had earlier shown Leh as part of China, following which the IT secretary had written a stern letter to the company's CEO Jack Dorsey. In response, Twitter had replaced China with Jammu and Kashmir. However, Twitter has not yet corrected the map to show Leh as part of the Union Territory of Ladakh. It is still showing Leh as part of Jammu and Kashmir, which is against the official position of the Government of India. Last month, Twitter came under heavy criticism and faced backlash from social media users after its geotagging feature displayed "Jammu & Kashmir, People's Republic of China" in a live broadcast from Leh's Hall of Fame, a war memorial for fallen soldiers in Ladakh. This had triggered angry responses from netizens who demanded that stringent action be initiated against the micro-blogging platform. Meanwhile, an industry watcher said that in case Twitter does not fall in line even after the latest notice, possible options could include action initiated under Section 69A of the IT Act for banning access to Twitter in India. Also, under the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, the government can lodge an FIR, which has punishment of up to 6 months of imprisonment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-issues-notice-to-twitter-for-showing-leh-as-part-of-jk-instead-of-ut-of-ladakh-914807.html

One should be proud of his own ideology, but on subjects of national interest, our ideology should be seen standing with the nation and not against it,” the Prime Minister said addressing students of the University, which is considered as an unconquered Left bastion by the BJP. Modi addressed the gathering through a video link. The Prime Minister cited the freedom struggle and the days of Emergency as instances when leaders of varied ideologies had united to fight for a national cause. “Whenever the country faced difficult time, people of every ideology have united in national interest. People of every ideology united under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi during the freedom struggle,” Modi said. The Prime Minister recalled that during the Emergency, former Congress leaders, RSS volunteers, leaders of the Jana Sangh, socialists and communist had stood together. “No one had to compromise on ideology. There was only one purpose – national interest. Whenever there is a question of national interest, taking decisions under the burden of any ideology will lead to the loss for the nation,” Modi said. Established in 1969, the JNU has always been considered as a bastion of the Left, with students’ organisations aligned with Left parties dominating the university’s Students Union. Between 1974 and 2018, Students Federation of India, All India Students’ Association and students with socialist leaning dominated the JNU Students Union elections. The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) managed to win the President’s post of the JNUSU only in 2000.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/keep-national-interest-above-ideology-modi-to-jnu-students-914808.html

12-11-2020||National||Rumblings in Mahagathbandhan days after Congress' poor show in Bihar Assembly polls||With Congress' poor performance in Bihar polls pulling down the RJD-led Grand Alliance, daggers are out. In fact the call for introspection came from the party backyard itself with former Union minister and AICC General Secretary Tariq Anwar taking to social media asking for "accepting the reality". Anwar, who was in past also the president of Bihar Congress and a tall leader from Katihar in the Seemanchal region where Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM has won five seats denting the prospects of RJD-Congress, said: "We should accept the truth. Bihar could not have a government of the Mahagathbandhan because of our poor performance. Congress must introspect on this issue where it erred." Reflecting the concern in the Congress about AIMIM, which has now decided to contest Assembly polls in West Bengal in 2021 and Uttar Pradesh in 2020, cornering away Muslims vote Anwar felt that the entry of MIM in Bihar is "not a good omen". In fact as soon as the results were out, the former AICC Secretary mouthed a vitriolic attack against party leaders, including AICC general secretary in-charge for Bihar Shaktisinh Gohil, the chairman of the AICC screening committee for Bihar Avinash Pandey and Congress Legislature Party leader of Bihar Sadanand Singh, accusing them of 'fielding weak candidates' with ulterior motives. In Bihar while the BJP increased its strike rate from 33.75% in 2015 to 67.3% in 2020, the Congress came down by more than half of its last performance. While it had recorded a strike rate of 65.85% in the 2015 polls winning 27 of 45 seats it had contested then, its strike rate declined to nearly 27% in 2020. While the Mahagathbandhan's Chief Ministerial face Tejashwi Yadav maintained the poise refusing to go into the issue of which party of the Grand Alliance getting how many seats, RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari did not hold his fire accusing the Congress of "arm twisting" the RJD and going to the extent of threatening even walk out of the alliance to secure 70 seats for itself on which it could not perform. Terming the Congress response to Bihar polls very lacklustre (thanda), Tiwari pointed out that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi addressed only two rallies in the state. "The high command of Congress did not take the Bihar election seriously," he said. CPI-ML leader Dipankar Bhattacharya also felt that instead of Congress contesting on 70 seats, the Left and RJD contesting more seats could have ensured a better result while CPM leader Sitram Yechury said had the Left and Congress contested equal numbers of seats, MGB would have been in power. "Apparently, 70 assembly segments in Bihar were too much to handle for the Congress," said Bhattacharya. Congress, which contested 70 seats, managed to win only 19 seats. On the other hand, CPI-ML, which contested 19 seats won 12 and CPI and CPI-M two each of the six and for they contested respectively. In 2017 UP polls, Congress had entered into an alliance the with Samajwadi Party (SP). Out of 403 seats, SP contested on 298 and Congress on 105. The alliance lost but while the Samajwadi Party won 47 seats, Congress could win only 07 seats. The BSP, which contested alone, had won 19 seats in the one-sided election in which the BJP scored its biggest victory of 312 seats. A grand alliance of SP-BSP and Congress could not be formalised in UP despite a successful example in 2015 in Bihar where a combined alliance of RJD, JD(U) and Congress had defeated the BJP-led NDA. In the 2020 Bihar alliance, three parties—Upendra Kushwaha-led RLSP, Mukesh Sahani led VIP, and Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM—which wanted an alliance with the RJD earlier quit the alliance and the RJD did not make much effort to retain them. On the contrary the RJD entertained Congress with much care and cushion. Political analyst Rasheed Kidwai says "Tactical error is on the part of Tejashwi as well. Allies which left the MGB were to be handled by Tejashwi, as he was the leader of the alliance not Congress. Being a veteran Lalu Prasad would have handled the situation better. Also we should not ignore that a large number of seats, the Congress contested on were not winnable for it, being the strongholds of the BJP." Analysts also believe that this dilemma of the Congress to choose between "building the party" and "defeating the BJP", between which it keeps on vacillating is the main reason why it opts to contest on large number of seats in UP and Bihar, the states which it had ruled for decades till the rise of the caste based parties.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rumblings-in-mahagathbandhan-days-after-congress-poor-show-in-bihar-assembly-polls-914810.html

The MEA's assertion comes days after Biden defeated incumbent President Donald Trump in a bitterly-fought presidential election that attracted a record number of Americans to cast their votes. MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the prime minister had congratulated US president-elect Biden through a tweet and had also appreciated the former American vice president's contribution to strengthening India-US relations. Prime Minister Modi had also conveyed that he looks forward to working with him to take India-US relations to greater heights, Srivastava said at an online media briefing. Asked when will the two leaders speak with each other, he said it will happen in "due course at a mutually convenient time". On the future of ties under the incoming US administration, Srivastava said the foundation of India-US relations is very strong and this comprehensive global strategic partnership between the two countries has bipartisan support in the United States. "It has been seen that successive presidents and administrations have deepened the ties," he said. The ties between India and the US have witnessed a major upswing in the last four years, particularly in areas of defence and security.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/modi-biden-will-speak-at-mutually-convenient-time-ties-have-bipartisan-support-in-us-mea-914818.html

Brazil and South Africa too are likely to join India, Russia and China to set up a BRICS Integrated Early Warning System for future outbreaks of infectious diseases and to minimise the risks of such outbreaks turning into pandemics, Roman Babushkin, Moscow’s deputy envoy to New Delhi, said on Thursday. The initiative is likely to take shape when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa for the annual BRICS summit on November 17. Putin will chair summit, which will be held through video link in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The advent of a new coronavirus – now known as SARS-CoV-2 – was first reported at Wuhan in China late last year. The Chinese government, however, drew flak for allegedly sitting on vital information about the virus and the outbreak of the disease, as well as for delaying putting the rest of the world on alert. The virus caused a pandemic, which infected more than 5.15 crore people and killed 12.75 lakh of them around the world over the past 11 months. With the forthcoming BRICS summit taking place amid a pandemic, the leaders are expected to focus on stepping up healthcare cooperation within the five-nation bloc. They are expected to focus on increasing relevant scientific and practical data exchange in order to support developing a comprehensive global approach to prevent the situations detrimental to the public health, Babushkin, Russia’s Deputy Ambassador to India, told journalists in New Delhi. The leaders are expected to add momentum to the process to set up the BRICS Vaccine Research and Development Centre. It was during the BRICS summit in Goa in October 2016 that the leaders of the five nations stressed on “cooperation in promoting research and development of medicines and diagnostic tools to end epidemics and to facilitate access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines”. The BRICS summit at Xiamen in September 2017 saw Modi and the leaders of the four other nations agreeing that the bloc would step up its role in global health governance, especially in the context of the World Health Organization and United Nations agencies. They also agreed to ensure “availability of innovative medical products through promotion of research and development and access to affordable, quality, effective and safe drugs, vaccines, diagnostics and other medical products and technologies as well as to medical services through enhanced health systems and health financing.” The proposal of setting up a BRICS Vaccine Research and Development Centre was mooted and endorsed in the bloc’s 10th summit in Johannesburg in South Africa in July 2018. It, however, did not see much progress on the ground over the past couple of years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/brics-nations-plan-integrated-early-warning-system-to-combat-potential-pandemic-outbreaks-914827.html

In a strongly-worded reaction on the issue, Spokesperson in the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said India has repeatedly called on Pakistan to give up its "obfuscation and dilatory tactics" in discharging its international obligations in the trial of Mumbai terror attacks. "We have seen media reports in Pakistan about Pakistan's Federal Investigative Agency (FIA) releasing an updated 'book on most wanted/high profile terrorists' listing several Pakistani nationals involved in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks," he said. "While the list includes a select few members of the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a UN-designated terror entity based in Pakistan, including the crew members of the boats used to execute the 26/11 attack, it glaringly omits the mastermind and key conspirators of the heinous terror attack," Srivastava said. According to reports, a total of 19 terrorists were named as those involved in the attack. "It is a fact that the 26/11 terror attack was planned, executed and launched from Pakistan's territory. The list makes it clear that Pakistan possesses all the necessary information and evidence on the conspirators and facilitators of the Mumbai terror attack based in Pakistan," Srivastava said. On November 26, 2008, a group of Pakistani terrorists sneaked into Mumbai through the sea, arriving by boat from Karachi, and went on the rampage, carrying out coordinated attacks on the main Chattrapati Shivaji railway terminus, the Taj Mahal hotel, the Trident hotel, and a Jewish centre. A total of 166 people including 28 foreigners were killed in the nearly 60-hour assault. "The government of India has repeatedly called on the government of Pakistan to give up its obfuscation and dilatory tactics in discharging its international obligations in the Mumbai terror attacks trial," he said. Srivastava said several other countries have also called upon Pakistan to expeditiously bring the perpetrators of the dastardly terror attacks to justice. "It is a matter of serious concern that despite its own public acknowledgement as well as the availability of all necessary evidence, including that shared by India, Pakistan is yet to show sincerity in delivering justice to the families of 166 victims from 15 countries across the globe, even as we near the 12th anniversary of 26/11 attacks," he said. Replying to a separate question on reports about the killing of an 82-year-old Ahmadi man in Peshawar in Pakistan, Srivastava said it is a sad reflection of the state of minorities in Pakistan. "We have seen media reports of an 82-year-old Ahmadi man believed to have been shot and killed by some gunmen, apparently because of his faith in Peshawar. This is, unfortunately, a sad reflection of the state of minorities in Pakistan," he said. "Over a period of time, we have seen the space for people from the minority community to practise their religion shrink continuously. Besides, their condition remains deplorable," Srivastava said. He said India has been consistently raising the issue of the safety, security and well-being of minority communities with the government of Pakistan.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-rejects-pakistans-list-of-terrorists-involved-in-26/11-mumbai-attacks-914830.html

The Congress managed to win only 19 of the 70 seats it had contested, down from its previous tally of 27 seats out of 41 it had fought in the 2015 assembly elections in the state. The people of Bihar came "pretty close" to change the government, the Congress' senior spokesperson P Chidambaram told reporters. Asked about the party's performance in the Assembly polls, he said, "We accept the verdict. We are disappointed with our performance in Bihar. The Congress Working Committee (CWC) will review it in due course and come up with an official statement of our position." The former finance minister said one should remember that Bihar was the poorest state of India, even though Narendra Modi has been the prime minister since 2014 and Nitish Kumar the chief minister of the state since 2005. "In the poorest state of India, as I agree in the alternative analysis, voted for no change in the government. Well, they came pretty close to change the government. I think, 10 seats either this way or that would have changed the government," he said. The vote difference between the NDA and the 'Mahagathbandhan' was only 0.3 per cent, Chidambaram said. Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said the mandate in Bihar was not in favour of the chief minister. The difference in voting percentage was very low and the Congress should have done better, he said, adding the performance would be analysed and reviewed in the CWC meeting. "But to say that the result has negated the issues raised by the Mahagathbandhan or that those did not have a resonance in Bihar, I don't agree to that. The issues raised by us are there and they would remain," Ramesh said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/disappointed-with-performance-in-bihar-polls-cwc-to-review-it-soon-congress-914836.html

Armenia and Azerbaijan announced an agreement on Tuesday to halt fighting over the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan under a pact signed with Russia that calls for deployment of nearly 2,000 Russian peacekeepers and territorial concessions. Asked about the agreement at an online briefing, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said India has always advocated resolution of the conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region between Armenia and Azerbaijan peacefully through diplomatic negotiations. "We hope that the latest agreement of November 10 facilitated by Russia will defuse immediate tensions and result in peace and security in the region," he said. India welcomes the efforts of parties concerned in this regard, he added. To a separate question on connectivity with Bangladesh, Srivastava said the air bubble arrangement commenced on October 28 and has been working well. India's air bubble arrangement with Bangladesh is expected to ease the movement of people on the two sides and will particularly help those who need medical attention, he said. "Coming on to land connectivity, you would know limited movement is taking place and full movement will resume when the Covid-19 situation is addressed," he said. Talking of rail connectivity, Srivastava said both sides have taken measures to strengthen trade via the rail route and this was in view of the fact that border trade faced disruption due to the Covid-19 situation. "We have taken active measures to strengthen rail connectivity," he said. To another question on when Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla is likely to visit Nepal, Srivastava said before foreign secretary's official visits, an announcement is made and it will be done when any such visit takes place.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hope-armenia-azerbaijan-pact-will-defuse-tensions-result-in-regional-peace-india-914876.html

Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the INS AIRAVAT left Mumbai on October 24 on a visit to this region with this aid comprising wheat flour, rice and sugar. He said that in keeping with India's tradition of reaching out to people of Africa in times of need, the government decided to provide humanitarian assistance to Sudan, South Sudan, Djibouti and Eritrea. This is in the form of food aid of 270 metric tonnes to people affected by natural calamities and the Covid-19 pandemic in these countries, he said. "The Indian naval ship is presently in the Port of Djibouti. It has delivered 50 MT of food aid and it will depart Djibouti today and reach Mombasa (Kenya) on November 20 to deliver 70 MT of food aid meant for South Sudan," Srivastava said at an online media briefing. Ambassador of India to Djibouti Ashok Kumar handed over the 50 metric tonnes gift of food items to Mme Ifrah Ali Ahmed, Secretary-General, Ministry of Social Affairs and Solidarity of Djibouti, as part of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, a tweet by the Indian mission in Djibouti said. Srivastava said as per its schedule, INS AIRAVAT had earlier delivered 100 MT of food aid after reaching Port Sudan on November 2. Thereafter, it reached Massawa Port in Eritrea on November 6 and delivered 50 MT of food aid meant for that country. "This gesture of the government of India has been greatly appreciated by the countries concerned," he said. In continuation of the ongoing humanitarian mission 'Sagar-II', Indian Naval Ship Airavat arrived at Port of Djibouti on November 10, 2020, a defence ministry statement said. The government is providing assistance to friendly countries to overcome natural calamities and the Covid-19 pandemic, and towards the same INS Airavat carried food aid for the people of Djibouti, it said. The Mission Sagar-II is aligned with the prime minister's vision of SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and reiterates India's position as a dependable partner in Indian Ocean Region (IOR) with the Indian Navy as the first responder in the maritime domain. The mission also highlights the importance accorded by India to relations with her maritime neighbours and further strengthens the existing bond.

For the first time, India is hosting the summit of the council of heads of government of the SCO. India and Pakistan became permanent members of the SCO in 2017. The other member nations of the SCO are Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. "The country hosting the SCO summit invites all SCO member states to attend the meeting. We have accordingly informed all eight SCO member states, the four observer states, the SCO Secretary general and the director of SCO RATS," Spokesperson in the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said. He was replying to a question on the issue. India had earlier this month announced that it will host the summit of the council of heads of government of the SCO in the virtual format and that it will be participated by prime ministers of the member countries of the bloc. The SCO summit of the Council of Heads of State is considered as the main annual event. It was hosted by Russia on November 10 in the virtual format. Seen as a counterweight to NATO, the SCO has emerged as one of the largest transregional international organisations. The aim of the SCO is to maintain peace, stability and security of the region.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/as-host-india-invites-sco-member-countries-for-virtual-summit-on-nov-30-914888.html

"India has entered into recession for the first time in history. Mr Modi's actions have turned India's strength into its weakness," he said on Twitter. India has entered into recession for the first time in history. Gandhi cited a news report wherein the Reserve Bank of India has said that the country's GDP is likely to contract by 8.6 per cent in the July-September quarter, which means the Indian economy is likely to enter into a technical recession for the first time in history.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/india-has-entered-into-recession-due-to-pm-modis-policies-rahul-gandhi-914624.html

"We wanted to talk about the irregularities done with us (in Uttar Pradesh), but a more serious one has happened in Bihar. Tejashwi Yadav was poised to make his government but could not do so at the last moment. All those who have faith in democratic values are unhappy today and asking if this is how elections will be fought," he told reporters here. Yadav claimed that with only 14,000 more votes, the opposition alliance would have emerged as victorious in Bihar. "The Bihar election was more nail-biting than the US (presidential) polls. I do not know which trick the BJP used. This is the speciality of the BJP," the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said. He said elections today have become mathematics.   "The BJP uses everything to win elections. I can give an example and also play a video to prove as to how all the officials, from the DM to police, were involved (in Uttar Pradesh). At some places, even during the checking of the body temperature while the voters were going in to cast their votes, they were threatened that such a temperature would be shown which would directly shift them to a hospital and ambulances were also deployed," Yadav said. He asserted that the SP would not leave the path of development come what may and claimed that the party's schemes were being repackaged by the current BJP-led government. "I can say it on record that we had given farmers and women pension. Maximum bank accounts and bank branches were opened during the SP regime and online transfer of money had also started, but this government only indulges in publicity and we will also do the same now," Yadav said. He also hit out at the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh for its claims of giving 50 lakh jobs, asking it to name the departments where these jobs were provided. He also asked what happened to the claims of investments worth over Rs four lakh crore in the state, as claimed by the government.  "When the time comes, we will bring a scheme and spell out the details of where we will be giving jobs to youngsters," the SP president said. At least three farmers of Ayodhya also spoke at the press conference and recounted their problems at the hands of officials over land acquisition in their villages for the Sri Ram Airport and development of Ayodhya. They alleged that the officials were harassing them for signing the agreement under which their land is being acquired at very low rates. They also said they met Chief Minister Adityanath over the issue, after which the atrocities of the officials went up. Assuring all possible help from his party to the farmers of Dharampur, Ganja and Kutia gram sabhas who recounted their problems, Yadav said the government is taking land for a pious work and needs to show a big heart and revise the circle rate as there is never any dearth of money for it to serve people. He said the compensation amount for the farmers of these villages should be six times more than what they are being offered. Citing the example of the Agra-Lucknow expressway, the SP leader said the land for it was acquired after giving compensation to the satisfaction of the farmers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/akhilesh-yadav-alleges-irregularities-in-bihar-polls-914748.html

BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia also blamed the TMC for his party workers' alleged murder in the state at a press conference to hit out at Banerjee. "This murderous game is being played in a bid to cling to power by any means...A wind of change is blowing across West Bengal and this has made her desperate," he said.  He also referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech at the BJP headquarters on Wednesday in which he had launched an indirect attack on the TMC, saying those who cannot challenge the BJP democratically have resorted to murdering its workers.   Bhatia said, "You know you cannot fight the BJP's ideology. That is why as many as 115 BJP workers have been killed." The TMC has in the past rejected the BJP's charge.  Bhatia cited the names of several BJP workers who, he alleged, were killed at the ruling party's behest.  Accusing the state government of practicing "communal and appeasement" politics, the BJP spokesperson said Banerjee "loves" Rohingya infiltrators and speaks against their expulsion from the country while looks the other way when Indian citizens are "attacked".  "Why this silence? She is looking the other way while TMC workers are spreading 'jungle raj' in the state," he said. Stones were hurled and black flags shown at BJP state president Ghosh's convoy in Jaigaon area of Bengal's Alipurduar district on Thursday, where he had gone to attend party programmes, police said.  Assembly polls are due in the first half of 2021 in West Bengal, a politically crucial state where the BJP hopes to come to power for the first time by ending Banerjee's 10-year-old rule.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-attacks-tmc-over-murder-of-its-workers-in-west-bengal-914779.html
12-11-2020||National Politics||Fiscal stimulus addresses 'non-existent problem': Congress||Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram contested the government’s thrust on injecting more money into the economy, and argued in favour of giving cash handouts to the poor to spur demand. “Liquidity is a non-existent problem. They are addressing a non-existent problem. What you need to address today is the capacity of the people to spend,” Chidambaram told reporters in a joint press conference with former minister Jairam Ramesh. Chidambaram accused the Modi government of indulging in “headline management” through announcements of fiscal stimulus and to deflect the focus from the dire state of the economy. He suggested a four-point action plan that included steps to ensure farmers get fair and remunerative price for their produce, putting money in the hands of the people to spur demand, create jobs and devolve more funds to the state governments. “Unless more money is devolved on the states, the states will curtail capital expenditure in 2020-21 and the revival of the economy this year will be a pious wish,” Chidambaram said. Ramesh accused the Modi government for pursuing economic policies that had pushed the economy into recession. “The shrinking of the economy began 18 months before the pandemic,” Ramesh said. Earlier, former Congress President Rahul Gandhi too had accused the Modi government of pushing the country into recession. “India has entered into recession for the first time in history. Mr Modi’s actions have turned India’s strength into its weakness,” Rahul said on Twitter. The Congress’ attack on the Modi government came a day after the RBI’s economic ‘nowcast’ suggesting that India’s GDP was likely to contract by 8.6% in the July-September quarter, pushing the country into “technical recession” for the first time in history.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/fiscal-stimulus-addresses-non-existent-problem-congress-914838.html

The protesters had been squatting on a rail track in Bharatpur's Bayana affecting traffic on the Delhi-Mumbai rail route. They had also blocked the Hindaun-Bayana road. The Gurjars vacated the railway track early Thursday morning after the agreement with the state government was read out to them by their leaders, police said. Gurjar leader Vijay Bainsla said the fish plates uprooted by the protesters had been put back in place. A fish plate is a metal bar bolted to the ends of two rails to join them together in a track. "We came to an agreement with the state government... Community has agreed to the settlement. We are vacating the track. Trains will resume soon," Vijay Bainsla said.   The Gurjar Aarakshan Sangarsh Samiti has agreed to the government's proposal of giving Rs 5 lakh compensation and a government job to a family member of those who died in police action in the different agitations over the years, granting regular pay scale to 1,252 candidates who have completed a two-year probation in government jobs, and withdrawal of police cases against protesters.  The government has also agreed to implement the agreement reached between the two sides in February 2020 apart from constituting a committee for pending recruitment, and approving more beds in girls hostel in Jaipur. Meanwhile, mobile internet services, which were suspended in parts of the state due to the agitation, were restored following the announcement to call off the stir. After a marathon meeting with a ministerial group on Wednesday, the Gurjar delegation, including Col Kirori Singh Bainsla, met Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot. However, the delegation had said on Wednesday night that they would take a decision on calling off the agitation at the protest site in Bayana. "A consensus has been reached over the demands with the state government. We have trust that the government will work on the agreement. However, we will take a decision on the calling off of the agitation at the protest site," Vijay Bainsla had said after the meeting. On October 31, a delegation of the Gurjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti held discussions with a Cabinet sub-committee in Jaipur, in which a consensus had emerged on 14 points but it was not accepted by Kirori Singh Bainsla and his supporters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/gurjar-stir-over-reservation-called-off-after-consensus-with-rajasthan-government-914610.html
12-11-2020||North and Central||Covid-19: Delhi faces shortage of ICU beds amid Diwali worry||With Delhi breaching the 8,000-mark for Covid-19 cases on a single day, the national capital is running out of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds that could spell trouble for serious patients. The number of Covid-19 cases is likely to increase in the next few days as pollution is likely to increase due to Diwali even as the state administration has banned the bursting of crackers. However, there is apprehension that some sections may deftly defy the ban, adding to the pollution in the capital. At present, the Delhi government portal on Covid-19 showed that Delhi has 16,592 hospital beds in the capital out of which 7,901 are vacant. However, when it comes to Covid-19 ICU beds with ventilators, 1,111 out of 1,288 are occupied leaving just 177 beds available for fresh patients. Similarly, 1,734 out of 2,096 Covid-19 ICU beds without ventilators are occupied, leaving just 362 vacant. In some relief for the state government, the Delhi High Court allowed it to reserve 80% beds in ICUs of 33 private hospitals for Covid-19 patients. The High Court said the situation in Delhi was "fairly dynamic" and the state has to be "much more alive" to the circumstances. The order came on a Delhi government's appeal challenging a single judge’s September 22 interim order staying its decision to reserve %of the ICU beds in these hospitals. The High Court vacated the stay order and listed the matter for further hearing on November 26 before the single bench and till then the reservation of 80% of ICU beds will continue. On Wednesday, Delhi recorded its biggest single-day jump of 8,593 Covid-19 cases. The total number of cases had crossed over 4.59 lakh people. Eighty-five new deaths were added to the death toll, which stood at 7,228 on Wednesday. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had also requested Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan to augment bed capacity in central government-run hospitals in the capital following apprehensions that the number of Covid-19 cases could reach 15,000 a day in the coming weeks. Kejriwal wrote Vardhan citing a shortfall of around 4,900 beds in hospitals and urged him to direct central government-run hospitals to provide at least 1,092 additional beds, including 300 ICU beds, with the required medical staff.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/covid-19-delhi-faces-shortage-of-icu-beds-amid-diwali-worry-914623.html
12-11-2020||North and Central||Pollution levels dip in Delhi, air quality still 'very poor'||The national capital recorded its air quality in the 'very poor' category on Thursday morning even as experts said the situation was “much better” compared to two days ago when pollution levels were above the emergency threshold. A change in the wind direction -- from north westerly to north-north easterly -- was the reason behind the dip in pollution levels as it reduced the contribution of stubble burning significantly, according to government agencies and weather experts. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 315 at 9 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 344 on Wednesday and 476 on Tuesday. Delhi witnessed six “severe” air days on the trot from November 4 to November 9, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. The AQI in neighbouring cities of Faridabad (306), Ghaziabad (336), Noida (291), Greater Noida (322), and Gurgaon (261), which fall in the National Capital Region (NCR), was also recorded in the “poor” and "very poor" categories. An official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the “situation is much better compared to Tuesday”. The wind direction has changed preventing the transport of smoke from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, he said. The official, however, said the air quality is likely to deteriorate marginally on Friday. The IMD said winds were calm in the morning and the minimum temperature was 11.6 degrees Celsius. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. There was shallow fog in the morning and the visibility was 800 metres at the Safdarjung Observatory. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the change in transport level wind direction has led to a significant decrease in stubble burning-related intrusion in spite of high fire counts. The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 was almost negligible -- 3 per cent -- on Wednesday due to unfavourable transport-level winds, it said. “Deterioration (in air quality) is expected on Friday towards the higher end of the 'very poor' category,” it said. The CPCB had on Wednesday ordered closure of hot mix plants and stone crushers in Delhi-NCR till November 17 in view of a likely increase in pollution levels during the festive season. It also asked the governments of Punjab and Haryana to take immediate stringent actions to curb stubble burning and authorities in Delhi-NCR to strictly check biomass burning.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pollution-levels-dip-in-delhi-air-quality-still-very-poor-914635.html

12-11-2020||North and Central||Cracks surface within PAGD over DDC poll seat sharing||Bickering within the constituents of the recently- formed People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) over seat sharing for the upcoming District Development Council (DDC) polls in Jammu and Kashmir may dent the prospects of the alliance to fight for the restoration of Article 370. The PAGD which is an alliance of seven parties,-- National Conference (NC), PDP, CPI, CPM, Peoples Conference, Peoples Movement and Awami National Conference -- was formed on October 15 to work towards restoring the special status of J&K which was revoked last August. Last week, the alliance decided to contest the first ever DDC polls in J&K unitedly to thwart the BJP’s attempt to make political inroads in Kashmir. A senior leader of the PAGD told DH that issues have started surfacing within the alliance. “The seat-sharing arrangement for DDC polls has been the first challenge before us. No party is ready to concede any space to the other and as such the leadership has a tough job ahead. Even the smaller parties which have no substantial presence on the ground are vying for more seats,” he revealed. The leader said all the parties who are part of the alliance have prepared the list of their candidates and have sent it to their respective party high commands for  approval. While in Kashmir the PAGD is expected to win majority of the seats, it will have a tough fight with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in mainland Jammu. Despite Thursday being the last date for filing nomination for the first phase of the polls, no PAGD candidate had filed his papers till Wednesday evening. However, the PAGD spokesperson Sajad Lone said that there were no issues within the alliance. “The fact is that the government gave us little time to prepare for the polls. There are so many wards and selecting the right candidates is taking time,” he told DH. The DDC poll will be the first major political activity in J&K since the abrogation of Article 370 and will be held in eight phases from November 28 to December 22. In the absence of an elected government in the Union Territory, these councils are set to become a new unit of governance in the region. The holding of  Block Development Council (BDC) polls will complete the third tier of Panchayats for the first time in the history of J&K as never in the past had the erstwhile UT elected DDCs, which used to be headed by the Chief Minister and Cabinet ministers. J&K has been under the Central rule since June 2018 when the BJP pulled out of the alliance government with the PDP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/cracks-surface-within-pagd-over-ddc-poll-seat-sharing-914644.html

A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad allowed the appeal of Delhi government challenging a single judge’s interim order staying the government’s decision to reserve 80 per cent ICU beds.

The high court was hearing a plea by the Delhi government urging it to empower it to enforce reservation of 80 per cent of ICU beds for Covid-19 patients in 33 private hospitals at least for 15 days in view of the rise in the number of cases.

The lone candidate of Chandrashekhar's outfit Azad Samaj Party (Kanshiram) from the Bulandshahr assembly seat surprised everyone by bagging more than 13,500 votes, severely denting the BSP nominee's electoral prospects. The Azad Samaj Party (ASP) nominee finished third, pushing the Congress nominee to the fourth place. The BSP candidate finished second. The seat was won by the BJP by over 21 thousand votes. BSP leaders here admitted that Chandrashekhar, who wielded considerable influence over the Dalit community, especially in the western UP region, posed a ''serious threat'' to their party. ''Chandrashkehar's emergence will seriously impact our electoral prospects in the western UP region....we will have to revise our strategy to counter him,'' said a senior BSP leader here. Chandrashekhar has declared that his outfit will put up its nominees in the next assembly polls in UP, which are due in less than two years' time. ''We are preparing for the next assembly elections...we feel that Mayawati has not been able to protect the interests of the Dalits,'' Chandrashekhar said. The Dalit leader has been active in the western districts of Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Bulandshahr, and many others and had also launched a series of agitational programs on issues concerning the community. His emergence comes at a time when the BSP faces revolt from several senior leaders, who have openly criticised party supremo Mayawati and hinted at quitting the party. As many as seven BSP legislators had recently met Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav and expressed their willingness to join his party.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bhim-army-chief-chandrashekhar-azad-emerges-as-challenger-to-bsp-supremo-mayawati-914691.html

Both the institutes are premier institutions of Ayurveda in the country. The former has been conferred the status of an Institution of National Importance (INI) by an Act of Parliament and the latter that of an Institution Deemed to be University (De novo Category) by the University Grants Commission (UGC), the ministry said. The Ministry of AYUSH, since 2016, has been observing the "Ayurveda Day" every year on the occasion of Dhanwantari Jayanti (Dhanteras). This year, it falls on Friday. Considering the prevailing situation of Covid-19, the 5th Ayurveda Day, 2020 is being observed largely on virtual platforms at national and international levels.   The ITRA, Jamnagar, recently created through an Act of Parliament, is poised to emerge as a world-class healthcare institution. It has 12 departments, three clinical laboratories and three research laboratories, the ministry said. It is also a leader in research work in traditional medicine, conducting 33 research projects currently. The ITRA has been formed by conglomerating the cluster of four Ayurveda institutes on the Gujarat Ayurveda University campus, Jamnagar. It is the first institute in the Ayush sector to be accorded the INI status. With the upgraded status, the ITRA will have the autonomy to upgrade the standard of Ayurveda education as it would offer courses in accordance with modern, international standards. Further, it will forge inter-disciplinary collaborations to give a contemporary thrust to Ayurveda. The NIA, Jaipur, an Ayurveda institution with a countrywide repute, got a shot in the arm with the Deemed to be University status. Inheritor of a 175-year legacy, the NIA's contribution to preserving, promoting and advancing authentic Ayurveda in the last few decades has been significant, the statement said. Presently, it has 14 different departments. The institute has a very good student-teacher ratio with a total intake of 955 students and 75 faculties in 2019-20. It runs numerous courses in Ayurveda, ranging from certificate to doctoral level. With state-of-the-art laboratory facilities, the NIA has also been a pioneer in research activities. At present, it conducts 54 different research projects. With the conferring of the Deemed to be University status, the NIA is set to reach new heights by achieving the highest standards in tertiary healthcare, education and research, the statement added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pm-narendra-modi-to-dedicate-two-ayurveda-institutes-to-nation-on-5th-ayurveda-day-on-november-13-914726.html
12-11-2020||North and Central||Sino-India border standoff in eastern Ladakh expected to be resolved peacefully soon: ITBP chief||The border standoff between India and China in eastern Ladakh is expected to be resolved peacefully "very shortly", the ITBP chief S S Deswal has said, adding the infrastructure along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is also being ramped up at a rapid pace. Talking to PTI during a wide-ranging interview, the director general of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police(ITBP) said his troops have been provided with special winter clothing and nutritious food as they brave the severe chill in eastern Ladakh where the armies of India and China are locked in a tense standoff for over six months. Asked about the current military standoff with China in eastern Ladakh, Deswal said "strains in bilateral relations are already evident but we are confident these will be sorted out peacefully very shortly." Authoritative sources on Wednesday said India and China have broadly agreed on a three-step process on disengagement of troops and withdrawal of weaponry from all major friction points in a time-bound manner. "Indo-Tibetan Border is the highest international border in the world. At every location it is about 10-11 thousand feet high. All our troops are deployed at that height. Oxygen is less, temperature in winters is very severe as it touches up to minus 40 degrees Celsius," he said. "All these difficulties make the very existence of human beings in that area very difficult and then conducting patrolling on the border is equally tough." The training and acclimatization of ITBP jawans are long and we inculcate all kinds of skills and boost immunity so that they find it comfortable to survive in the harsh environment, he said. Deswal said the force does special winter stocking every winter and this time the logistics exercise has been enhanced. "For the protection of our troops, we have provided special cold clothing. We have upgraded the ration content with high nutrition and high-calorie food to survive the cold. These are the working conditions on that border and being an un-demarcated border, a jawan has to be always alert," he added. The protection of the border is undertaken by patrolling and the ITBP conducts long patrols that may extend up to 30 days, said Deswal, who leads the 90,000-strong mountain-warfare trained force. The ITBP chief also spoke about his recent tour of the Ladakh front where he spent 8-9 days and decorated 291 of his personnel for showing gallantry during face-offs and skirmishes with Chinese troops in May and June. "The sincerity of our troops is very high in spite of difficult working conditions. It is my responsibility to visit my jawans especially in difficult times and in difficult conditions. I may not visit them when things are in good position but it is my responsibility to reach them whenever they are in tough conditions," he said. On beefing up border infrastructure, Deswal said the work to raise new border posts and to connect them with all-weather roads is progressing at a fast pace. About 75 per cent of the ITBP border posts are now connected by roads, he added. The ITBP, raised in the aftermath of the 1962 Chinese aggression, has about 180 posts all along the 3,488-km-long LAC that stretches from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh on India's eastern flank. "There is a government focus for the creation of good border infrastructure so that the local population as well as the forces are able to reach all remote parts of our own territory as close to the border as possible." "The pace of construction of roads is very fast now. In the last few years, many roads have been constructed. Initially, when ITBP was raised the patrol party used to go on foot from Leh to Daulat Beg Oldi(DBO) and it used to take more than a month to reach there," Deswal said. The distance between Leh and DBO is about 250 km. From that stage today, he said, almost 75 per cent of the ITBP posts are now connected by roads on the entire border. "With the same pace of road construction in the next 5-6 years, we hope that all our posts will be well connected by roads," he added. The DG said the ITBP is also upgrading its communication infrastructure to the current level of technology and when it comes to an upgrade in weaponry the force is committed to prevailing bilateral protocols on this front. Deswal also said the government has recently sanctioned 47 new border posts (BoPs) to the ITBP along the entire LAC and their effort is to establish several of them by 2021. "Majority of these new border posts will come up in the state of Arunachal Pradesh. We have already identified the sites and the state government is willing to transfer the sites to us...it is in a very advanced stage and we are progressing every day," he said. When asked if the ITBP has sought fresh battalions and manpower to man these posts, Deswal said that by the time we have the physical infrastructure on ground the force is expected to have additional manpower.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sino-india-border-standoff-in-eastern-ladakh-expected-to-be-resolved-peacefully-soon-itbp-chief-914730.html

Additional Sessions Judge Sandeep Yadav dismissed the bail plea of Singh, arrested on October 27, considering the severity and seriousness of the crime allegedly committed by him. Former Fortis Healthcare promoters Malvinder Singh, his brother Shivinder Singh, former CMD of REL Sunil Godhwani (58), Kavi Arora (48) and Anil Saxena were arrested in the case by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi Police last year, for allegedly diverting Religare Finvest Ltd's money and investing in other companies. The EOW registered an FIR in March last year after it received a complaint from RFL's Manpreet Suri against Shivinder, Godhwani and others, alleging that loans were taken by them while managing the firm but the money was invested in other companies. ED lodged a money laundering case based on this. RFL is a group firm of REL, which was earlier promoted by Malvinder and his brother Shivinder.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/religare-case-delhi-court-dismisses-bail-plea-of-ex-ceo-maninder-singh-914793.html
12-11-2020||North and Central||UP govt suspends IPS officer over Kanpur ambush involving Vikas Dubey||The Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday suspended the then Kanpur police chief Anant Dev after a probe by a special investigation team pointed at a nexus between police and gangster Vikas Dubey, allegedly responsible for the death of eight policemen. "Anant Dev has been suspended. The action has been taken on the basis of the SIT report," Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi told PTI. Dev holds the rank of Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police and was later posted with the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) in Moradabad. Eight policemen were ambushed in Bikru village in Chaubeypur area of Kanpur as they headed there to arrest Dubey shortly after midnight on July 2. They were mowed down by bullets fired from the rooftops. Dubey was shot dead by police on July 10 when he was allegedly trying to escape from their custody while being brought back to Kanpur after his arrest in Ujjain. A three-member SIT formed to probe the ambush of policemen pointed at a nexus between police and the slain gangster, officials said. The SIT handed over a 3,500-word report to the state government last week, recommending action against police personnel and administration officials. It submitted 36 recommendations, giving details of the alleged role of some officers and 80 police personnel in the Kanpur episode. “It came to the fore that policemen used to give tip-offs to Dubey and on the night of the ambush, he was aware that a police team was coming to Bikru,” a senior officer said. The SIT findings also refer to the alleged negligence of police in taking action against Dubey, against whom several criminal cases were pending. Sources said the SIT report also mentioned the alleged police failure in securing the conviction of Dubey and his men in cases lodged against them. The report accused personnel posted at Kanpur's Chaubeypur police station and senior officers of negligence, sources said. The SIT analysed Dubey's mobile phone records going back up to a year and found that some policemen were in regular touch with him, they said. The government constituted the SIT led by Additional Chief Secretary Sanjay Bhoosreddy, with Additional DG Hari Ram Sharma and DIG Ravinder Goud as its members, on July 11. The SIT was initially asked to submit its report by July 31 after looking into all angles, studying related documents and conducting inspections in Kanpur. The deadline was later extended by the government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-govt-suspends-ips-officer-over-kanpur-ambush-involving-vikas-dubey-914814.html
12-11-2020||Opinion||Donald Trump still has 70 days to wreak havoc around the world||Of the countless challenges President-elect Joe Biden will face when he assumes office, few will be as daunting as reversing President Trump’s legacy of bulldozing multilateral institutions, ripping up past international agreements, shattering norms and undermining longstanding alliances. But there is only so much low-hanging fruit, not least because the Trump administration has been working relentlessly to make many policies as difficult to reverse as possible. Mr. Biden could employ a similar approach to Mr. Trump’s China trade tariffs. Rather than taking Mr. Trump’s costly and unilateral approach to the trade war as a given, the new president could initiate a comprehensive review of all tariffs that would include close consultation with American allies on the best way to deal with China. It would result in both better relations with those allies and more leverage to wrest meaningful concessions from Beijing. Mr. Biden will also have to contend with the fact that the Obama to Trump to Biden cycle will have underscored the head-spinning, yo-yo quality of American politics in which the positions of one president can be wholly erased and defaced by those of another. Most of America’s partners will see in Mr. Biden’s radical correction of Mr. Trump’s approach evidence that any change, even one they welcome, could be ephemeral. Mr. Trump, the lame duck commander in chief, could conceivably pursue withdrawing all American forces from Afghanistan, accelerating troop reductions in Germany, pushing through additional arms deals or issuing a travel ban on all members of the Chinese Communist Party. He could recognize Israeli sovereignty over West Bank settlements or designate groups such as Yemen’s Houthi movement or Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist organizations. Even bolder and more damaging, he could overtly or covertly strike Iran’s nuclear facilities — or greenlight others to do so — on the theory that he alone can prevent a President Biden from allowing Iran to resume its nuclear march. The diplomatic malpractice, in other words, is not necessarily over yet. Amid the wreckage that has been his foreign policy, these are slim pickings. Mr. Biden has the opportunity to put Mr. Trump’s legacy behind him, but he may not be able to repair all the damage. The job of trying to do so cannot begin too soon.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/donald-trump-still-has-70-days-to-wreak-havoc-around-the-world-914563.html
12-11-2020||Opinion||Will Joe Biden’s victory resuscitate liberalism?||What America thinks today, the world thinks tomorrow. While the cachet of the United States as an international trendsetter may not be what it was at the turn of the century and during the heyday of globalisation, even today, decisions in the Oval Office usually have a ripple effect across the world.  With the victory of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential elections, a new era is about to begin in America. The past four years, under President Donald Trump, have not only eroded the foundations of American democracy but severely undermined the special standing liberalism enjoys as an aspect of democracy in many parts of the world. As the 46th President of the United States, Biden, by all means a pragmatic liberal, must not only restore liberalism at the heart of the American polity but also reorient it for contemporary challenges. The new normal under Biden He may be entering the White House having received the most presidential votes in history, but Biden will have his work cut out in trying to undo the effects of his predecessor. Some of the steps in the Biden recovery plan will be predictable and reasonably straightforward – rejoining the Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization (WHO), regaining American primacy in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and bolstering US-European ties, perhaps even renegotiating the Iran nuclear deal put in place by Barack Obama. A Biden presidency has long been touted as a return to normal without the mercurial twists and turns of a president constantly triggered on Twitter. But a mere reinstatement of status quo ante is not only undesirable but also impossible. Biden cannot simply dial back the clock to the Obama years; he must create his own paradigm, one founded in the remaking of the liberalism that has enjoyed the bipartisan endorsement of all American presidents since the Second World War, all except the last one. A recalibrated liberalism Liberalism, in the context of American polemic, is often taken to mean the philosophical underpinnings of a welfare state, the kind epitomised by the manifestos of social democrat Bernie Sanders. But viewed in a global context, liberalism primarily espouses freedom of three kinds – freedom of trade, freedom of movement, and freedom of thought and ideas. In American politics, this has been translated (at the best of times) into building bridges between warring camps at home and the championing of the vulnerable abroad. But the glorious liberalism at the heart of a vibrant America for decades has plunged into chaos since 2016, replaced by an ethno-nationalist version of populist politics that advocates for hostility towards immigrants, the resurgence of economic protectionism, and the radicalisation of culture wars, so as to drive a wedge between its supporters and those the populists envision as their enemies. Biden, who has reassured the electorate that he will govern as president for “all Americans”, has harnessed a reputation as a moderate centrist, someone with progressive proclivities, but without contempt for conservatives. This perception will be crucial for Biden to enlarge the appeal of his party as well as of his presidency. Over the last decade, the Democrats have ceded a lot of political ground by focusing disproportionately on identity politics and the supposed empowerment of America’s sizable minorities. This, coupled with their obsession with developing a globalised, meritocratic social order, has led them to neglect the needs of working-class whites and evangelicals, as documented excellently in Michael Sandel’s book, The Tyranny of Merit. Biden, while continuing to uphold the interest and integrity of minorities, will have to make liberalism relatable to large sections of America’s white majority, including Trump admirers whom Hillary Clinton had disparaged as a “basket of deplorables”. The liberalism that takes shape under Biden will have to rise above the echo chambers of social media to advocate empathy, sometimes even compromise, with opponents, besides restoring competence in political policy and basic decency in political rhetoric. On the international scene, America cannot be as spineless in calling out violations of human rights as it has been under Trump with reference to the multiple crises in Belarus, Lebanon, Venezuela, among others.  This does not mean that Biden’s America should take upon itself the role of military messiah and kick-start new interventions along the lines of Iraq and Afghanistan from earlier on in the century. Instead, it means that under Biden, America should speak up against the atrocities in Kashmir, the persecution of Uighur Muslims in China, the humanitarian travesty in Yemen, to name a few. American condemnation, by way of words or sanctions or a scuppering of bilateral ties, still holds more heft than similar actions by any other power in the world. Soothe and douse  As President, Biden, unlike Trump, is not coming to shake things up. He is coming to soothe an all-too shaken country, whose blunders have caused tremors around the world. The fabric of American values has been set aflame all too often in the recent past, and the wounds are clear to see upon the edifice of liberalism.  Biden’s most crucial task, and one he seems to recognise, is to articulate a renewed vision of liberalism that does not believe in fighting fire with fire, but in deploying some much-needed water instead.

12-11-2020||Opinion||Bihar yet another SOS for Congress. Anyone listening?||Bihar has sounded warnings to the Congress, warnings it ought to heed before the five assembly elections in 2021 and the next general elections. The verdict from the eastern state holds multiple lessons for the Congress that impact its survival as the GOP (Grand Old Party) and call for an immediate visit to the drawing board to craft strategies and cope with a milieu vastly different from the one it is familiar with.  If the Congress does not grasp the signals, there is every chance it will lose its status as the sole national Opposition and undermine its bargaining power with the allies, present and prospective, to lead an anti-BJP formation. In the just-concluded elections, the Congress, a has-been in Bihar since 1989, nevertheless negotiated hard with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and extracted 70 of the 234 seats, 30 more than what it contested in the 2015 elections. Tejashwi Yadav, the RJD leader, did not want to part with more than 40 seats but he was prevailed upon by Lalu Prasad, his father, to “oblige” the Congress or risk the threat of it fighting solo and perhaps joining hands with the Janata Dal (United) or JD(U) in case the post-poll scenario got muddled.  Five years back, the Congress won 27 of the 40 seats it fought; this time, it was down to 19. On the other hand, the Left spectrum, part of the RJD-helmed Mahagathbandhan (MGB), got 29 seats and won 16, with the CPI (M-L) walking away with 12. Most Bihar political observers believe the Congress knocked down the MGB although the party’s spokespersons hotly contested the charge and claimed most of the seats handed out to them were “throwaways” that the RJD and Left refused to touch. The rationale—if it can be called that—is specious and reflects the Congress’s unwillingness to make a fight of all the seats. In an election, what is a castaway seat and what is a marquee constituency? Does the Congress expect only Rae Barelis and Wayanads to come its way? Has it lost an appetite for a good battle? It would seem so because in the last 31 years, it mostly rode on the back of a “secular” party/formation in Bihar and hoped to reap the gains when the situation looked promising. A major challenge Bihar threw up was the emergence of a new form of identity politics, embodied in the success of the All India Masjlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) that registered its first breakthrough in the Hindi heartland. The MIM hurt the MGB in the last phase of polling in the Seemanchal region, bordering West Bengal. It has a big Muslim presence. Most of all, it damaged the Congress. Tariq Anwar, the Congress general secretary, ruefully remarked that the MIM’s entry into his home state was “not an auspicious sign”. When the Muslims of West Bengal were disillusioned with the Left Front government, they turned to Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TC) as a viable option. The Sachar Committee’s minority report empirically established that the CPI(M) governments had not delivered enough to Muslims to enhance their quality of life. Reading the Sachar report became a sacrament for the minorities before the 2011 elections that first sent Mamata to power. Playlist for Bihar In Bihar, for decades the RJD was an alternative for the Muslims to take on the BJP as was the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh. But the MIM breach into this territory – that the “secular” parties seem to take for granted – created a new social dynamic. It showed that Muslims, who willingly submerged their identity as a religious minority with those of the backward castes and the Dalits and supported a party that represented a broad anti-BJP social coalition, are questioning their choice. Asaduddin Owaisi, the MIM president, makes no bones about whose rights and interests he stands for. His language and oratory are powerful enough to sway Muslims from the “secular” parties and root for him. In the heartland, for some time, Muslim leaders felt that the politically and socially under-empowered castes benefitted at their expense through the “secular” parties while they got little or nothing tangible despite voting with their hearts out to keep the BJP away. They thought Muslims would be better-off going for a party that exclusively articulated and championed their rights and interests even on peril of being labelled “communal”. Owaisi repeatedly questioned the notion of “secularism” and touched a chord in the minorities. Not just the Congress but the “secular” offshoots have become increasingly defensive about speaking up for Muslims in a post-BJP era, another reason for the community’s disenchantment. In the joust to be “as Hindu as the BJP”, Muslims feel they are the biggest losers. Where does Bihar leave the Congress in relation to the DMK in Tamil Nadu, the  All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) in Assam and the Left Front in West Bengal? These parties are long-term allies or prospective Congress partners. Recent history can’t be heartening for any of them. In the 2016 polls, the Congress fought on 41 seats and won only 8 in Tamil Nadu, this when the DMK looked like it was on a winning spree. The DMK won 88 of the 180 seats it contested but the Congress brought down the alliance, giving the J Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK an unprecedented second tenure because ruling parties are almost always voted out in the state. In Assam, in the 2016 polls, in the 126-member assembly, the Congress contested 122 seats and won 26, while the AIUDF fought on 74 seats and won 13. Recently, the Assam Congress proposed having an alliance with the AIUDF that has a base in the minority-dominated, Bengali-speaking Barak Valley, historically a Congress stronghold. The idea was obviously to keep the Muslim votes together. It has run into problems. The BJP resurrected the charge of the Congress being out to “appease” the minorities among Assamese and Bengali Hindus. The AIUDF head, Badruddin Ajmal, is a red rag to the Hindus because he’s perceived as a fundamentalist. Owaisi declared his intent to fight the Assam polls on his own, a spectre that can’t please the Congress because its effort to consolidate the Muslim votes might come unstuck and trigger a round of competitive minority fundamentalism.

12-11-2020||Panorama||A matter of time||Ever since the teacher announced the clock making project, my eight-year-old daughter’s tiny brain got ticking with multiple ideas. She began concentering materials for the same safely in her cupboard. After countless hours of designing and decorating without any help, the little cuckoo clock was ready for submission. Taking the bag containing her hand made clock and brimming with joy, she got ready early for school that day. Little did she know that within hours, it would be lobbed across the class and criticised as a dummy model.  On the lookout for a more professional job, the teacher was more interested in a working model. A work of art so to say, which can decorate the classroom walls in perfection. Many in the class beamed with joy as they were lauded and praised for bringing working models. It was outlandish for these eight-year-olds to have made a working clock. The school projects are nowadays subcontracted to merchandisers, who have made it a lucrative business. This experience crushed my daughter’s creative enthusiasm and the learning associated with it. Tears rolled down as she returned back and narrated the tale to us. The path of creative thinking involves taking risks and making mistakes too. The learning happens only when the bridge is crossed by one’s own effort.  It takes imagination, determination and enthusiasm to reach there. Driven by self-motivation, this road is not risked by many. Outsourcing the child’s work may help the vendor’s business, it slays the child’s creativity and imagination. Any creativity to be shunned is actually damaging it permanently.  It takes no effort to criticise or condemn….but it takes character and self-control to be understanding and compassionate. The system becomes a failure when someone else’s credibility or work pays off. In the words of Einstein “Creativity is seeing what others see and thinking what no one else ever thought”. Give that chasm of creativity a fair chance to prove itself.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/a-matter-of-time-914525.html
12-11-2020||Panorama||Mukesh Ambani takes on Amazon in India's booming online market||Saritha Rai, P R Sanjai and Bhuma Srivastava Billionaire Mukesh Ambani obliterated rivals in India’s telecommunications sector by selling $2 data plans and free voice calls. Four years later, he’s deploying a very similar tactic -- cutthroat pricing -- to gain an edge in the country’s increasingly competitive e-commerce space. As India this week hits the peak of its biggest shopping season, the festival of Diwali, the tycoon’s retail websites -- including JioMart -- are elbowing their way into a space long dominated by Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.’s local unit Flipkart Online Services Pvt. Ratcheting up competition, Ambani’s portals are offering blockbuster discounts of as much as 50% on popular sugary confections and other holiday staples like spice mixes. Meanwhile, his Reliance Digital website is selling some flagship Samsung smartphones at prices cheaper than rivals, with as much as 40% rebates. Reliance’s JioMart website is currently offering up to 50% discounts. It’s a push that comes as Ambani’s sprawling conglomerate, Reliance Industries Ltd., is flush with cash and has seen its shares rally about 35% this year. After raising an eye-popping $20 billion for its technology venture, it’s shifted fundraising to its retail arm, which has won over $6 billion in investment in recent weeks from heavyweights like KKR & Co. and Silver Lake. Already India’s biggest brick-and-mortar retailer, Ambani’s online ambitions pit him against the two U.S. giants, both of which have invested big in India. The country, one of the last big consumer markets, is still up for grabs, and Morgan Stanley estimates that India will generate $200 billion in e-commerce sales by 2026. Yet, the billionaire’s triumphs in telecommunications -- where he started as a tiny player, but outpaced established rivals by undercutting them on price and capitalizing on regulatory changes -- are a cautionary tale for the American giants. Huge edge In retail, Ambani’s firm has a huge edge: Government policies are increasingly stacked in favor of domestic retailers, of which Reliance is the largest. Since the end of 2018, India’s foreign investment rules have also barred Amazon and Walmart’s local unit Flipkart from featuring exclusive products and owning inventory, in a bid to restrict their ability to directly influence prices and offer discounts. International companies aren’t allowed to own more than 51% of local brick and mortar supermarket chains. Even that limit is subject to conditions such as setting up only in cities with populations of less than 1 million. With his local strategy, low-cost procurement and chain of brick-and-mortar stores, Ambani has the ability to shake up online retail, said Siju Narayan, Chief Experience Officer, RexEmptor Consult LLP in Mumbai. “JioMart can dent the fortunes of grocery e-commerce majors like Bigbasket & Grofers,” he said, referring to the country’s biggest online grocers. “And impact the grocery, home & personal care category of e-tail majors like Amazon and Flipkart in coming days.” Many of Reliance’s brands can be sought under one roof at Reliance Malls.Representatives for Reliance and Bigbasket declined to comment, while those for Walmart, Amazon and Grofers didn’t respond to requests for comment. Tweaked rules Ambani’s success in telecom shows his ability to benefit from pricing and policy. India’s government tweaked rules in 2013 to create a “unified license” that allowed operators with a broadband wireless permit to offer voice calls by paying a one-time fee. Only one operator had such a permit nationwide at that time – Reliance Jio. The new rules helped it move swiftly. After receiving a unified license and rolling out Reliance Jio’s telecom services in September 2016, Ambani sold voice and data plans at rock bottom prices. That made digital services more affordable for millions of Indians. Although rivals won similar licenses, some went bankrupt amid the ensuing price war, including his younger brother Anil’s Reliance Communications Ltd. Non-state operators in telecommunications eventually dropped to three from at least a dozen. Jio turned profitable in 2018. It’s currently India’s biggest wireless operator with over 400 million subscribers. High stakes In India, the stakes are high for American retailers. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s hard-charging founder and chief executive officer, has pledged to invest $6.5 billion there. Walmart spent $16 billion in 2018 to acquire Indian portal Flipkart in its biggest ever deal, and has invested over $1 billion this year in the e-tailer and steadily plowed cash into its sister unit, payments service PhonePe. But for Ambani, 63, Asia’s richest man with a net worth of $79 billion, the e-commerce push may turn out to be tougher than telecom. First, he will be up against formidable rivals. The wireless operators he defeated were mostly homegrown players, lacking the heft, experience and deep pockets of Amazon or Walmart. Also, his group’s e-commerce websites are newer compared to its rivals’. Reliance group’s JioMart – which only started this year and is still in the beta phase – has had delivery snafus and refund delays, and some users haven’t been shy about venting on Twitter. All that means winning big against Walmart and Amazon could take years. Yet, getting it right is key because Ambani has cast retail and technology as the future of Reliance, which got its start in textiles under his father and then progressed into petrochemicals and oil refining. Two of his oldest children, Ivy-league educated twins Isha and Akash, are on the board of Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. Reliance is already India’s biggest company and its market capitalization of $179 billion equals about 6.4% of India GDP. Its heft would only increase if it wins a greater foothold in e-commerce -- something that’s increasingly becoming important in India, which has suffered a lockdown for much of the year due to the pandemic and where organized retail is yet to penetrate rural corners. The pandemic is offering a boost to Reliance because many local stores can’t offer aggressive discounts due to financial difficulties, said Laiji Varghese, who runs a provision store in Nerul, a town in the outskirts of Mumbai, and has a partnership with Reliance to deliver orders. “Reliance Retail is a big bulk player with deep pockets,” she said. “They have the financial muscle to offer such discounts compared to others.” For Diwali, JioMart has a “Bestival Sale” on and has been touting the “season’s biggest grocery sale” with large discounts and cashback running through Nov 8. Flipkart and Amazon are also showcasing a slew of discounts, putting the three companies neck to neck. Yet on some key items, Ambani’s sites are offering bigger price cuts. A Samsung S20, this year’s flagship model from the world’s biggest smartphone maker, for instance, was going for 43,999 rupees at the start of this week on Reliance Digital. The same phone on Amazon’s India website was available for 47,990 rupees and on Flipkart for 69,999 rupees. Regardless of who draws more customers and offers the biggest price cuts this holiday season, a pitted, protracted battle for India’s online shoppers is likely to play out in the coming years. Despite the complex pricing restrictions that Walmart and Amazon face in India, they have been able to showcase discounts offered via manufacturers and brands. In some cases, they are able to restructure their relationships with sellers so they can legally offer price cuts, and have allied with banks and credit card companies, which are allowed to offer deals that give shoppers price benefits on websites. Yet, in the long term, pricing rules favouring local companies would allow Ambani’s JioMart and other websites to be more nimble in tweaking costs since they are bound by fewer restrictions. JioMart and Reliance Retail account for around $12 billion of India’s retail market combining brick and mortar and digital sales, according to Ankur Bisen, senior vice president and head of Technopak’s retail consulting division. Meanwhile, Amazon and Flipkart, leveraging their pure online plays, can claim about $14 billion each, he said. Although Amazon and Walmart are far ahead in online retail, a winner will need to straddle both domains, physical and virtual, to cater to India’s diverse and heavily rural geography. Yet the restrictions on foreign companies owning grocery stores, puts them on a backfoot. That’s in keeping with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s goal of nurturing home-grown champions. Across the border, China’s protection of domestic companies has created technology behemoths like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. Ambani has built his businesses with a decades-long understanding of India’s bargain-hungry consumers. Over the years, he’s also aligned Reliance’s own ambitions with government goals across different administrations. In 2016, when he launched Reliance Jio, the telecom business, he promoted it as part of Modi’s Digital India initiative.  “Narendra Modi has clearly decided that he wants to produce an Indian equivalent of Alibaba or Tencent, and he knows Reliance is the only plausible candidate,” said James Crabtree, an associate professor of practice at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, author of The Billionaire Raj, which chronicles India’s economic opening and has Ambani’s much-storied Mumbai home on its cover. To cement his position as the nation’s No. 1 retailer, Ambani bought the retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units of Future Group for $3.4 billion in August. Amazon, which owns a tiny stake in one of the unlisted firms under the Future Group, has sought to block the sale in an arbitration court. Reliance, meanwhile, said it intends to complete the transaction without any delay. “It’s a head-on competition in online retail,” said Devangshu Dutta, CEO of retail consultancy Third Eyesight. “An extremely well capitalized, very aggressive player is the new challenger.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/mukesh-ambani-takes-on-amazon-in-indias-booming-online-market-914535.html
12-11-2020||Right in the Middle||Capping the bottle||The simple act of capping the bottle required many things in my universe to be aligned first. It needed, among other things, the late physicist Dr Richard Feynman’s wisdom, the National Education Policy, and a bit of tulsi to come together. This totally trivial but completely satisfying one morning. As the first rays of the sun glinted off the silk cotton tree in front of my window, I started my work on a document about the National Education Policy. A reviewer had mentioned that it had to be reformed such that children learnt for life rather than learnt just to pass examinations. After an hour’s immersion, I reached absently for my water bottle and knocked it down instead. Thankfully, it was a steel bottle. During the coffee break, my husband and I traded news. I read out some headlines, not at all offended that he wasn’t listening to me. In reply, he read out tweets, aware that I may not be listening to him. But that day, I was listening. The tweet attributed to the author of ‘Surely You’re Joking, Dr Feynman!’ went like this, “don’t get frightened by not knowing things. I have approximate answers, and possible beliefs, and different degrees of certainty about different things, but I’m not sure of anything. There are many things I don’t know anything about. It doesn’t frighten me.” With that thought brewing in my head, I got some tulsi leaves from the balcony believing that possibly, tulsi leaves in our drinking water would boost our immunity. I also plucked the flowering heads and stuck them in a little bottle with a hinged cap, that graced our dining table. Next to it was an empty beer bottle which had been used as a vase for several years. My daughter had used it as a water bottle during her product design course days, and was meant to, but had not yet, set right the faulty hinged cap. I did not have the heart to throw it out. Looking at the two bottles together, it struck me, that while I had no expertise in mechanical matters, I did have a schooling that had taught me something for life—how to copy. So, without being frightened of breaking the glass, or cutting an artery, I studied the little bottle with a functioning cap, priced off the hinge of the beer bottle, and put it back exactly how I had done with the little one. Success! Now, I drink tulsi-infused water from a beer bottle and feel like I’m clinking glasses with Dr Feynman!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/capping-the-bottle-914524.html

The court not only called out the government for its “candid” admission that meals were not provided after May 31, following the closure of anganwadis and schools due to Covid-19, but has also observed that this was a serious lapse that violated the right to life and personal liberty of the children under Article 21 of the Constitution and the National Food Security Act. Denying meals, or food grains in lieu of it, to lakhs of children, most of whom belong to families below poverty line (BPL), was a grave dereliction of duty and neglect of its consequences for millions of children. The Primary and Secondary Education department and Minister Suresh Kumar should take responsibility for this. India is ranked 94th among 107 countries in the Global Hunger Index (GHI), 2020, with 14% of the population under-nourished. The country has recorded a stunting rate of 37.4%, with children achieving lower weight for their height due to chronic undernutrition. Incidentally, the GHI report notes that the stunting is concentrated among children from households facing multiple forms of deprivation, including poor dietary diversity, low levels of maternal education, and household poverty—the very class that the Karnataka government has denied food to. Pulling the plate right from under the nose of hungry children and failing to replenish it for five full months, that too during a pandemic when many of their parents would have no source of livelihood, is indefensible. The World Nutrition Report, 2018, published by the World Health Organisation already paints a dismal picture of the malnutrition levels in Karnataka, which is higher than the national average. The state also fares poorly in terms of underweight school-going children and deficiency of micronutrients like iron, zinc, folate and vitamins. Given this dismal picture, it is unbelievable that the Karnataka government could have acted with such callousness and put the health and productivity of its future generation in jeopardy. While it is heartening that the High Court has taken up the issue with all the seriousness that it deserves, those who did not do so in government must be held accountable and punished. More importantly, Chief Minister Yediyurappa must sit down with his cabinet and officials, plan how to revive the mid-day meal scheme and implement it urgently. When the pandemic passes, the state should not be left with a myriad of other health issues arising out of the government’s neglect of children’s needs.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/restart-mid-day-meal-scheme-immediately-914519.html

Citing festival season and people congregating in large numbers in public places throwing anti-Covid-19 norms like social distancing to winds, the government said curbs shall continue as regards such programmes and it includes those related to entertainment and education. It has come to the government's notice that people gathered in large numbers in public places like markets, and they thronged bus terminals, "without paying attention to social distancing and wearing masks," an official release said here. Though the spread of the virus has been controlled in Tamil Nadu due to a slew of measures when a possibility of a second wave of the pandemic could be seen in some foreign countries, it has become imperative to intensify curbs, the government said. In view of the Diwali on November 14, markets and shopping hubs like T Nagar here are teeming with people. The government had on October 31 said that social, political, religious and cultural events would be allowed from November 16, and permitted the participation of a maximum of 100 people by adhering to measures like social distancing. The government had recently prohibited the 'Vel' or 'Vetrivel yatra' of the BJP, originally scheduled from November 6 to December 6, due to the pandemic and Saffron party leaders courted arrest in multiple locations seeking to take out the yatra despite the ban. As on November 11, a total of 7,50,409 people had tested positive for Covid-19 in Tamil Nadu out of which 7,20,339 recovered. While 18,655 was the number of active cases, the death toll stood at 11,415.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/covid-19-tamil-nadu-cancels-nod-for-socio-political-religious-events-914653.html

On November 11, 2000, twenty years ago, the Foundations first kitchen was inaugurated by the then Minister of Human Resource Development, Murli Manohar Joshi, and Karnataka Chief Minister S M Krishna. Today, Akshaya Patra is commemorating two decades of making a positive impact on the lives of children by providing them with wholesome mid-day meals. As the implementing partner of the Government of India's flagship school feeding programme, the Mid-Day Meal Scheme, Akshaya Patra serves over 1.8 million children in 19,039 Government and Government-aided schools across 12 States and two Union Territories, the Foundation said in a statement. The Foundation said it has cumulatively served over 3.3 billion mid-day meals to children since its inception in 2000. With the schools closed because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Foundation is currently undertaking food assistance to aid the Governments efforts to provide relief to vulnerable communities. It is working with the Government to provide food relief to vulnerable communities in 18 states and two UTs with the proactive support of its donors. Over 100 million meals have been served since March 2020 in the form of freshly cooked food and food relief kits with essential groceries. Akshaya Patra said its mission is to reach five million children by 2025. "The organisation will strive to enhance its initiatives with solutions focusing on food and nutrition security for children and implement innovative solutions to supplement welfare programmes to contribute to their health and well-being," the statement added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/akshaya-patra-aims-to-serve-mid-day-meals-to-5-million-children-by-2025-914685.html

Sanal Kumar Sasidharan, an award-winning film maker, has raised the suspicion as his cousin died last week. A police probe was ordered into the allegation. Sasidharan's father's niece, Sandhya, 40, died in Thiruvananthapuram on November 7. She was under treatment for Covid-19 and was discharged after being tested negative. But her condition worsened and she was hosptialised again and she died. Sasidharan said in a social media post that he became suspicious about her death after noticing some unnatural marks on her body and the reluctance of the police to properly note the marks despite the relatives raising suspicion. On subsequent enquiry, he came to know that Sandhya sold her liver for Rs 10 lakh for a patient at a private hospital in Kochi in 2018. Sasidharan also said in the post that Sandhya's daughter told him that Sandhya forced her to sign the consent form by threatening to take her own life. Sandhya, who hailed from a financially weak background, was having kidney and heart ailments. Even then how did the hospital authorities made her donate organ, he asked. Based on a petition given by Sasidharan, state police chief Loknath Behera ordered a probe by the Thiruvananthapuram rural district police chief into the matter. Meanwhile, the private hospital authorities said that the organ transplant was done by following all formal procedures and the donor had even turned up for review twice and she was also found to be healthy. The hospital authorities also denied the allegations of organ trade. The allegations raised by Sasidharan assumed significance as the Kerala police recently launched a probe into organ trade rackets thriving in the state after a preliminary investigation came across middlemen wooing people form weaker backgrounds to donate organs for cash. The preliminary investigation found that donors from weaker sections were suspected to be induced by middlemen for donating organs, mainly liver and kidney, to patients from well to do backgrounds by offering a price of up to Rs 10 lakh. But the actual cash transaction involved in the trade could be manifold and a major chuck could be going to middlemen and hospitals involved in the racket.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-filmmaker-suspects-organ-sale-lead-to-cousins-death-police-launches-probe-914719.html

The fresh developments were in the wake of the Kerala High Court severely criticising the Kerala government for the inordinate delay in implementing the order to handover the control of the church to the Orthodox faction. The church row has put the left-front government in Kerala in a tight spot as any move to forcefully take over the church might lead to tension. It would also invite the ire of the prominent Jacobite faction, that too on the eve of polls. Even as Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan himself initiated talks between religious heads of the two factions, there was no change in the stand of both the factions. The Kerala High court had even accused the Kerala government of taking a one-sided stand on the issue and even warned of deploying central forces to implement court order. Though the state government earlier initiated a move to take over the church it had withdrawn citing the strong resistance from the Jacobite faction believers. Thereafter the government cited the Covid-19 scenario and delayed the implementation of the order. Meanwhile, government sources said that the government was exploring legal options to further delay implementation of the take over order. The state government may cite that the district administration and police were preoccupied with the local body election arrangements. The High Court in scheduled to consider the case again on Tuesday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tensions-over-church-row-puts-kerala-government-in-a-tight-spot-914759.html

The book which was part of the curriculum for the third semester of the M.A. English course, under Commonwealth Writing since 2017 has now been withdrawn after ABVP sent a representation calling it an “anti-national” subject. The decision by Vice-Chancellor K. Pitchumani was subjected to criticism by leaders from DMK, Left, and Congress which decried that removal of the book was the “first step towards” saffronising education in Tamil Nadu. “Those in power and politics deciding which is an art and which is literature and what students will learn will lead to the destruction of our diversity,” DMK MP Kanimozhi tweeted. DMK Deputy General Secretary and former Union Telecom Minister A Raja wondered whether the state government has “mortgaged” universities owned by it to the Centre. Madurai MP and noted writer Su Venkatesan also questioned the V-C's “unilateral move” and said any decision on the syllabus will have to be taken jointly by committees that are appointed for the purpose. The author herself said she was glad that her writings were taught for several years and that she never knew that it was part of the syllabus at the university. “...oddly enough I was more happy than sad because I had no idea that it was in the curriculum in the first place. I am glad it has been taught for several years. I am not in the least bit shocked or surprised that it has been removed from the syllabus now,” she said in a statement. “This narrow, shallow, insecure attitude towards literature displayed by our current regime is not just detrimental to its critics. It is detrimental to millions of its own supporters. It will limit and stunt our collective intellectual capacity as a society and a country that is striving for a place of respect and dignity in the world," Roy added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-varsity-removes-arundhati-roys-book-on-maoists-from-syllabus-after-abvps-protest-914760.html

This year is no exception for the three villages. For them, Deepavali means just exchanging sweets and wearing new clothes as the hamlets are located within three kilometre radius of the bird sanctuary which is spread across 32.7 hectares. As a mark of appreciation for the villagers' decision, the Forest Department has been distributing half-kg sweets to all residents of the three villages on every Deepavali. This year, Sivaganga District Collector J Jeyakanthan drove to the village and handed over sweets to residents of the three villages and applauded them for sticking to their decision of not bursting crackers in the interests of birds. The Vettangudi birds sanctuary is a natural habitat of winter migratory birds which fly from as far as Switzerland, Russia, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. A safe place for roosting, breeding, and feeding, the sanctuary attracts nearly 15,000 birds a year. V Selvaraj of Kollukudipatti, just 500 metres from the bird sanctuary, said the villagers had been boycotting crackers for over four decades now after the Vettangudi bird sanctuary came into being in 1972. “I am 62 years old and I do not remember me bursting crackers or hearing the sound of a cracker in my village. We do it to ensure that the birds do not get scared of the sound. The villagers do not complain at all,” he told DH over the phone. Not just Deepavali. The villagers do not burst crackers even during marriages and kovil thiruvizhas (temple festivals). “We have a Birds Welfare Committee to ensure compliance of rules that have been set by the villagers. Usually people do not burst crackers or go against the decision of the committee. If they violate rules, we do act against them,” Selvaraj added. “We youngsters of Pothakudi village in Sivaganga district have decided not to burst crackers this year in the interests of the birds that live in our neighbourhood. It is the collective decision of the village that helped us save the hatchlings,” Karuppu Raja, a resident of Pothakudi, told DH. However, Raja said children will just light sparklers as they should not feel disappointed. “No sound-emitting cracker will be allowed,” he added. A Mathivaanan, Forest Range Officer, Thiruppathur, said the sanctuary currently has over 3,000 birds from different countries and the villagers' decision not to burst crackers is music to the ears of the feathered creatures. “The villagers are very cooperative and it is not an easy thing to shun firecrackers for 40 years. People who live near the sanctuary love birds and are very concerned about ecology,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/villages-shun-bursting-crackers-to-save-birds-at-nearby-sanctuary-914811.html

The special court in Kochi will issue orders on Sivasankar's bail application on Tuesday. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) opposed the bail application alleging that there was strong evidence of Sivasankar's involvement in the illegal activities and that he benefitted from it. The money recovered from gold smuggling accused Swapna Suresh's bank locker were meant for Sivasankar as a commission of the UAE agency funded housing project. Sivasankar's lawyers maintained that there was no evidence against him, but only assumptions and also alleged certain intentions of the investigation agency. The ED arrested Sivasankar on October 28 and arraigned him as the fifth accused in the gold smuggling case. He was in ED's custody so far. With the court remanding him to judicial custody, Sivasankar was sent to district prison in Kochi. Meanwhile, Kerala Law Minister A K Balan said that statements of accused in gold smuggling and related cases were being leaked out selectively due to the influence of the BJP and the Congress on the investigation agencies, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/gold-smuggling-case-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayans-former-secretary-m-sivasankar-remanded-914817.html

The government also cancelled its order allowing social, political, religious and cultural events from November 16 permitting participation of a maximum of 100 people. This order is being interpreted as the government's way of not granting permission for BJP's Vetrivel Yatra which was held without permission this week.  The government argued against granting permission before the Madras High Court in a petition filed by the BJP seeking the nod for the month-long yatra. Despite the court refusing to pass any order, the BJP went ahead with the yatra on Sunday and Tuesday. Citing festival season and people congregating in large numbers in public places throwing anti-Covid-19 norms like social distancing to the winds, the government said that curbs shall continue as regards such programmes and it includes those related to entertainment and education. The state government had on October 31 announced that schools for students from class 9 to class 12 will reopen on November 16. However, opposition parties and teachers' associations took objection to the move saying it will put students' life in peril. The government then called a meeting of Parent Teachers' Associations across the state during which "convergent views" emerged.  "After taking several things into consideration, the government has decided to cancel the order announcing reopening of schools for classes 9 to 12 till further orders.

The move by the CNC is not legal, said Karnataka Adivasi Hakkugala Samanvaya Samiti president Y K Ganesh. Addressing reporters in Madikeri on Wednesday, he said demands are being made to add Kodava community to the list of tribal communities. “But, as per the studies conducted by experts, Kodavas are not the aboriginals of Kodagu. They migrated from outside Kodagu. After coming to Kodagu, they followed the practices of the tribal community according to the climate and demography of Kodagu. They only followed the lifestyle of tribals,” he added.  Ganesh further said, “There are 18 various categories in Kodava speaking people. If the affluent among them have been considered as tribals, the question arises as to why the financially less privileged cannot be considered as tribals. This way, the demand for tribal status by other Kodava speaking people from other non-Kodava communities holds more relevance. “Why is the CNC not asking to consider the financially backward communities as tribals?” he asked. He also said that the demand by CNC to consider only the rich and influential Kodavas as tribals is a selfish motive. “The children from the adivasi communities are not getting access to education. The adivasi communities do not have government facilities. Most of them are working as plantation labourers and are staying in line houses. If Kodavas are declared as tribals, then the atrocities on the adivasis will only increase, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/seeking-tribal-status-for-kodavas-is-not-legal-y-k-ganesh-914496.html

The portal has the facility for the applicant to track the status of the application.  According to Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (RDPR) principal secretary L K Atheeq, the government has liberalised its process in rural areas for trade licences that will be issued online and renewed automatically. “Now, we have fully integrated these online services with Sakala,” he said. Bringing these services under Sakala guarantees time-bound delivery.  The trade licence regime is said to be fraught with middlemen fleecing citizens and businesses. The government order insists that gram panchayats accept documents that are uploaded online without asking for physical copies.  “The applicant is not required to get in touch with gram panchayats physically except in cases where inspection/site visit is mandated by law,” the order states. “Any process for clarification on application...shall be raised and replied through Bapuji Seva Kendra portal only.”  Another service that has gone entirely online in rural areas is permission for road cutting. This means citizens or businesses who need to dig up a road for any work can apply online without any physical interface with panchayat authorities.  These initiatives are aimed at improving the overall business climate of the state, the order states. The Centre’s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade is pushing all states and their districts to take up ‘ease of doing business’ reforms.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-goes-online-with-business-approvals-in-rural-areas-914508.html
12-11-2020||State||Mercury drops sharply in Karnataka||The northerly and north-easterly winds sweeping across the state have led to sudden fall in minimum temperatures in Bengaluru and across the state. The minimum temperature that was hovering around 20 degrees Celsius dropped to 15-16 degrees C on Wednesday. Officials from the India Meteorological Department said the phenomena started on Tuesday with many districts in north interior Karnataka witnessing minimum temperatures below 10 degree C. In Bidar, temperature plummeted to 7.6 degrees C, Dharwad 14 degrees C, Haveri and Raichur 13 degrees C. IMD Bengaluru Director G S Patil said that the drop in temperature was steep in north interior parts of the state compared to Bengaluru. On Wednesday, Bidar recorded 7.8 degrees C while other districts in the north interior parts of state saw 10 to 11 degree C. The second factor contributing to the cold conditions, Patil said, was the lack of clouds that trap the heat and keep the atmosphere warm. “The weather will turn warm in the next two days due to the entry of easterly winds. But this will be a temporary phenomenon as the northerly winds will continue to bring cold weather in the coming days,” he said, adding that dry weather will continue in large parts of state. The IMD has already alerted that the coming winter is expected to be colder than usual due to the prevailing La Nina conditions in the Pacific Ocean, during which winds blow stronger bringing the cold wave.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mercury-drops-sharply-in-karnataka-914542.html

There will not be compulsory transfer from this year as the department removed the concept by bringing an amendment to the Act. As per the amendment, the requested transfer and mutual transfer will be done on a priority basis. The process was delayed owing to the model code of conduct for the bypolls to two Assembly constituencies in the state.

"Uddhav Thackeray, listen to me. You lost. You have been defeated," said Goswami (47), while being surrounded by visibly relieved colleagues from his Republic TV channel. Soon after his release from Taloja jail near Mumbai around 8.30 pm, Goswami drove to the Lower Parel studio of the channel, of which he is the Editor-in-Chief. Goswami also singled out Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh for his 'illegal' arrest on November 4 in a 2018 suicide abetment case. Goswami said that while in Taloja jail since November 8, he was subjected to three rounds of police interrogation. "Uddhav Thackeray, you arrested me in an old, fake case and did not even apologise to me," said Goswami, who was seen sporting a stubble. "The game has just begun," he said and announced that he will launch Republic TV channel in every language and also have a presence in international media. Saying he apprehended being arrested again, Goswami said, "I will launch (the channels) even from inside the jail and you (Thackeray) won't be able to do anything." Thanking the Supreme Court for granting him interim bail, Goswami spoke a few words in Marathi, rounding off with the 'Jai Maharashtra' slogan. Goswami was released on Wednesday night, hours after the Supreme Court granted interim bail observing it will be a "travesty of justice" if personal liberty is curtailed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/you-have-been-defeated-arnab-goswami-dares-uddhav-thackeray-after-coming-out-of-jail-914518.html

During patrolling on Wednesday, some police constables found three men roaming around a wall of the Kalamba jail with three tennis balls in their hands.

The blaze erupted at 1Above restaurant and Mojo's Bistro pub located in the Kamala Mills Compound on December 29, 2017, killed 14 people and injuring several others. The police had booked 14 persons in the case, including owners and employees of the establishments, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation officials and owners of the Kamala Mills compound. A sessions court here on Tuesday discharged the compound owners Ramesh Gowani and Ravi Bhandari, but rejected the discharge pleas of owners of the pub and restaurant, BMC officials and other accused. Shelar in a statement said an inquiry committee had admitted that there were violations related to the floor space index (FSI) allotment in the Kamala Mills. "It was expected that the accused persons would be booked under the MRTP (Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices) Act, 1969, but nothing happened. If owners, despite being prima facie accused in the incident, are set free, it could pave way for the other accused as well," he said. "How were the accused discharged when they were found guilty in inquiry?" the former state minister sought to know. "Who should be held responsible for such fraud in FSI? Did police not do their investigation properly or the state government failed to present its case strongly?" he asked. The state government should approach the high court to give justice to the 14 people who died in the incident, the BJP leader said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-govt-should-move-hc-in-kamala-mills-fire-case-bjp-mla-ashish-shelar-914659.html
12-11-2020||West||Bombay High Court orders Varavara Rao's examination by doctors of private hospital||The Bombay High Court on Thursday directed that doctors from a private hospital here should conduct medical examination of the jailed poet-activist Varavara Rao through video link, and even a physical check-up if necessary. The court, which was hearing his bail petition, adjourned the hearing to November 17. Rao, 81, an accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case, is lodged as an under-trial in the Taloja prison in neighbouring Navi Mumbai. A vacation bench of Justices A K Menon and S P Tavade was hearing a petition filed by Rao's wife Hemlata, seeking that he be shifted to the private Nanavati Hospital for better treatment, an independent medical board be set up to assess his health, and he be released on bail. Rao's lawyer Indira Jaising claimed that his health was "fast deteriorating", and there was a legitimate apprehension that he might die in prison. Rao suffers from dementia, is confined to bed in the prison hospital since August and has no bladder control, she said. If Rao died in prison, it would be a case of "custodial death", advocate Jaising said, adding that his detention violated his right to life under Article 21. Since his arrest in June 2018, Rao has been in and out of the government-run JJ hospital in the city. On July 16, he tested positive for coronavirus, after which he was shifted to the Nanavati hospital. He was discharged on July 30 and sent back to the Taloja prison, she said. "He suffers from dementia, he is in diapers. Is this man going to flee away from justice?" advocate Jaising asked. In prison hospital, two co-accused, who are not medical professionals, were deputed to take care of him, the lawyer alleged. To this, the bench suggested that a team of doctors from Nanavati Hospital, who had examined him in July, may conduct a video medical examination. If the doctors felt that a video examination was inadequate, they could use their discretion to conduct a physical examination, the judges further said. "Taloja is not far. It will be open to the Nanvati hospital to send a team of doctors to the Taloja prison for a physical examination," the bench said. The report of video examination be submitted at the earliest and if the doctors conducted a physical examination, its report should be submitted by November 16, the HC said. The National Investigation Agency, which is probing the case, opposed the proposal to shift Rao to Nanavati Hospital or to have his physical examination by its doctors. Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, representing the NIA, said that Rao had previously been treated at the government-run JJ hospital and St George hospital in the city. If the plea was allowed then every prisoner would demand to be sent to the Nanavati hospital (or other private facility), setting a wrong precedent, he said. "Also, we should not underestimate our government hospitals. Recently, a former CM of the state sought treatment at St George Hospital," Singh said. The court, however, said it did not see any harm in a video medical examination by the doctors of Nanavati hospital. The Maharashtra government's lawyer Deepak Thakre submitted a report of Rao's medical examination, conducted by the Taloja prison authorities on November 2. The urine culture report showed his readings were "normal", Thakre said, adding that the prison authorities had consulted Nanavati hospital over phone, and were advised to conduct a complete blood count test for Rao. Jaising said the urine report did not reflect Rao's declining neurological condition. The HC too noted that a mere telephonic consultation may not be adequate. Video examination by the Nanavati doctors was the "best solution in the interest of the accused", the court said. Rao has been booked by the NIA under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. He and some other activists connected to the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune in December 2017 have been accused of having links with Naxals. In October this year, following a plea filed by Rao's wife, the Supreme Court had asked the high court to hear Rao's bail plea expeditiously. The HC will hear the plea next on November 17.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bombay-high-court-orders-varavara-raos-examination-by-doctors-of-private-hospital-914781.html

This is one of the rare occasions when an accused will stand in the witness box and give evidence on oath in support of defence. The state government had moved a plea requesting the court to prohibit the media from reporting the deposition of the accused Qayamuddin Kapadia who has voluntarily decided to stand in the witness box to testify against the prosecution. What is surprising in the development is the fact that even the defence lawyers didn't object to the government's application and left the decision to court. The order passed by special judge Ambalal Patel doesn't mention the reason behind not barring the publication of content of the evidence that the accused is going to put forward in the court. Sources said, "The accused has been charge sheeted as a prime suspect in the case who is alleged to have led the operation in Ahmedabad and Surat. We don't know what he is going to reveal. The defence lawyers should have questioned the government's motive behind putting a ban on the proceeding." The two-page order doesn't have any citation of judgements. It only refers to some orders the court had passed on applications concerning secret witnesses. Earlier, the court had rejected the state government's application demanding not to allow the defence lawyer of the accused to examine him. So far, 1,130 witnesses have been examined in the trial by the prosecution. There are 78 accused facing trial for the series of bomb blasts that rocked Ahmedabad on July 26,2008, killing 56 persons and leaving over 200 injured. Recently, one of the accused turned an approver.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/ahmedabad-serial-blast-special-court-bars-media-from-publishing-deposition-of-key-suspect-914874.html
