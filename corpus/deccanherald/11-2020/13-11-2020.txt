13-11-2020||First Edit||BJP’s relentless rise, Congress’s continued fall||While the BJP rose to dominance in Bihar in the Assembly elections, it has reasserted its supremacy in the other states where by-elections were held this month. By-elections need not always be taken as political barometers but the number and nature of the seats and the diversity of the states where they were held make them somewhat representative and indicative of the political mood. That mood is clear, with the BJP winning 41 of the 59 by-elections, snatching most of the seats from Congress or other parties. It won 27 seats from Congress in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. The seats in MP were those vacated by MLAs loyal to Jyotiraditya Scindia, who defected to the BJP to bring down the Kamal Nath government. It also won all eight seats in Gujarat, six out of seven in UP, two in Karnataka and a seat in Telangana, giving a surprise blow to the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS). In Karnataka, it won two seats which had been held by Congress and JD(S). With the victories, the BJP has further consolidated its position in states where it is in power and has shown the will and ability to move into new areas. They show that the economic downturn, the distress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and other issues highlighted by the Opposition have not made an impression on the people in any of the states.  The BJP’s performance contrasts with that of the Congress. The former gained what the latter has lost, and more. While Congress’ poor showing in the Bihar elections was the main reason for the failure of the Mahagathbandhan, which needed only a few more seats to reach the finish line, the by-elections were disastrous for the party. In most of the seats, it was in direct contest with the BJP, and most were seats which it had held. It won only 11 of the 59 seats and could neither retain most of the seats it had held nor pose a credible challenge to other parties in seats which were held by them. In UP, which is the most important state in the national political calculus, it won no seat and less than 8% of the polled votes. The BJP polled over 20% votes more than Congress in Gujarat. The lone consolation victories were in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Haryana. That is cold comfort. Congress has serious issues to contend with, relating to leadership, organisation, purpose, strategy and even the will to win. It will not be able to stop its decline and find relevance unless all these issues are confronted quickly and earnestly.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/bjp-s-relentless-rise-congress-s-continued-fall-914937.html
13-11-2020||In Perspective||The rise and fall of Mesut Ozil||While receiving the medals during the ceremony at the 1968 Mexico Olympics, black American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who had won gold and bronze medals, respectively, in the 200-metre race, did something extraordinary. Standing on the podium with their heads bowed and their black gloved fists raised to the sky, they performed the “black power salute” as the US national anthem “the star-spangled banner” played. Through the “black power salute”, which Carlos decades later clarified as a “human rights salute,” the athletes were protesting the treatment of black Americans in the US. This demonstration is regarded as the bravest political statement in the history of Olympics. The International Olympic Committee viewed the gesture as a deliberate breach of the spirit of Olympics and both athletes were expelled from the games. Back home, the actions of the athletes were dubbed as ignoble and juvenile. They were also abused and ostracised by the sporting community. Sportspersons taking a stand on political issues or airing their views is not new and is largely frowned upon by society. Cut to 2020, nothing much has changed. Take the case of the German midfielder Mesut Ozil, who joined the English Premier League club Arsenal. For the record, Ozil, who had joined the Gunners in 2013 from Real Madrid, had been instrumental in Germany’s triumph in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He had been voted by fans as the team's ‘player of the year’ five times since 2011. He had also helped the Gunners win the FA Cup a couple of times. He is also one of the highest paid footballers, earning about 350,000 pounds per week. However, Ozil has not played a single game since March 2020 and has recently been excluded from the squad for the Premier League as well as the Europa League. His fault: The tweet he posted in December 2019 criticising the Chinese government over its treatment of Muslims in Uighur. Arsenal knew that there would be a backlash in China and that it could not afford to spoil its brand in the huge Chinese market. The club quickly distanced itself from Ozil’s statement. Its press release said, “The content published is Ozil’s personal opinion. As a football club, Arsenal has always adhered to the principle of not involving itself in politics.” Not just that, when the club sent its materials to China to celebrate the Chinese New Year, it made sure to remove Özil from all the merchandise. A few months back, Arsenal had sacked Jerry Quy, a loyal fan who, dressing up as ‘Gunnersauras’, was the club’s much-loved mascot for 27 years. Ozil tweeted that he felt sad at the sacking of their loyal and famous mascot and offered to reimburse the salary of Jerry Quy as long as he would be playing for Arsenal. Again, this gesture did not go down well with Arsenal. Earlier in April, Ozil had refused a pay cut when the club had asked their players to help the team save money during the Covid-19 shutdown. Ozil came in for a lot of criticism on social media. The fact is, none of the other big premier league teams had forced their players to take such pay cuts. While the club spent millions of pounds on signing on new players like Willian, Gabriel and Thomas Partey, it made 55 of its support staff redundant, citing a funds crunch. Ozil is not new to controversies. After Germany’s disastrous group stage exit from the FIFA World Cup in Russia in 2018, he announced his retirement from international football as he felt he had been a victim of racism and disrespect because of his Turkish roots and his earlier controversial meeting with the Turkish President Recep Erdogan. Ozil was conveniently made the scapegoat for Germany’s exit from the world cup. In a statement, Ozil said “In the eyes of (German Football Association) President Reinhard Grindel and his supporters, I am German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose.” He was also criticised when he married his girlfriend, former Miss Turkey Amine Gulse, in June 2019 on the banks of the Bosphorus in Istanbul with Erdogan, himself controversial and criticised for his regime’s violations of human rights, as his best man. The German public was furious.   Despite the controversies surrounding him, Ozil is also one of the most generous footballers around, donating millions of dollars in charity and helping the starving, sick and the homeless. On his wedding day, he fed one lakh homeless people at 16 refugee camps and shelters in Turkey and Syria. Recently, Ozil also supported Marcus Rashford’s campaign by providing free school meals for around 1,400 schoolchildren in 12 schools in North London’s Knightsbridge. Ozil’s biography, if and when written, promises to be a best-seller.

Speaking to reporters here on Friday, he said the failures of the Congress were exhibited in Sira. Out of frustration due to the defeat in the two constituencies, Siddaramaiah is giving such statements, he alleged.  The BJP had won 12 of 15 assembly segments in the bye-elections held earlier. It was a big challenge for the BJP to win the Sira segment. But the BJP won. Both Congress and JD(S) are pursuing caste-based politics. The lotus has blossomed as the BJP is treating all communities equally, Vijayendra explained.  "Bye-election to Maski and  Basavakalyan assembly segments will be held in the coming days. Leaders will meet in Basavakalyan today. I will accept the responsibility to be entrusted by the State BJP president. I am not an aspirant of a ticket to contest from Basavakalyan segment.

Revenue Department Under Secretary R Umadevi, in the suspension order issued, stated that the suspended official cannot leave the headquarters without the permission of the competent authority. Kudachi MLA P Rajeev had raised the issue in the Legislative Assembly that Bhajantri had misused funds meant for Covid-19 management without availing the permission of the task force. A committee led by Assistant Commissioner, Chikkodi Subdivision had been formed on September 22 to inquire into the misuse of Covid-19 funds. Based on the report of the committee, Deputy Commissioner M G Hiremath had recommended action against Bhajantri as it was found that he had misused Covid-19 funds as per his whims and fancies. Bhajantri has been suspended to ensure that he does not tamper with the documents while in the office during the inquiry period, the order said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/raibag-tahsildar-suspended-for-misusing-covid-19-funds-914901.html

The decision was taken as per the agreement signed between private medical college managements and the state government. With the hike, a student will have to pay Rs 1,28,746 (government quota) and Rs 9,81,956 (private quota) in private medical colleges for the 2020-21 academic year.  Similarly, the post-hike fee in private dental colleges stands at Rs 83,356 and Rs 6,66,023 for government and private quota seats respectively. Justifying the hike, officials from the Department of Medical Education said private college managements had demanded a 30% and 40% hike for government and institutional quota seats. Students and parents expressed anguish at the government's decision. "This is an anti-student move by the government. My parents cannot afford the fee fixed for government quota seats. If I don't get a seat in a government college, should I give up my dream of joining a medical course?" a student questioned. "I feel this is because most medical colleges are run by politicians.

13-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Confusion over green crackers?||The festival of lights - Deepavali - has arrived. This year, it has come with some confusion on crackers, with the government stressing on ‘Green crackers’, to minimise air pollution. Deepavali is celebrated from November 13 to 16. While ‘Dhanteras’, was celebrated on Friday, Narakachaturdasi falls on Saturday (Nov 14), Deepavali on Sunday (November 15), and Balipadyami on Monday (November 16). Although holidays have brought happiness among the people, they are under confusion on selecting fire crackers. Last year, the Police department had allocated two hours time to light crackers, to minimise air and noise pollution. This year, the scenario is different, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Sale of crackers has taken a beating, with the government allowing only ‘green crackers’, with an intention to protect Covid patients, who are susceptible to breathing problems, due to smoke. To give clarity on ‘Green crackers’, the state Government has stated that green crackers can be identified through distinct green logo of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) - National Environment and Engineering Institute (NEERI) and Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO). A QR code is incorporated on the fire crackers, to avoid manufacture and sales of duplicate and low-quality products. The government has directed the Police and Pollution control board members to take suitable action against violations. Hebbal Industrial Area Crackers Traders’ Association claims that every bundle of crackers have the sticker ‘Green cracker’ to help the buyers. The fire crackers sold by members of the association are all purely ‘Green crackers’, as the manufacturing units in Tamil Nadu have been using chemicals allowed by the Union Government agencies, since two years. It is safe to buy crackers in a licensed shops, the association clarified. However, All India Institute of Speech and Hearing (AIISH) Director N Pushpavathi, and Scientific Officers of KSPCB B N Prakash and Geetha advise to shun crackers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/confusion-over-green-crackers-915264.html
13-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Soil need to be strengthened to reconstruct Devaraja Market||The reconstruction of Devaraja Market building, by demolishing may be more risky and expensive as the soil needs to be strengthened, to lay the foundation for reconstruction. As per the Safe Bearing Capacity of Soil, there is a need to either strengthen or stabilise the soil. Otherwise, there is a need to adopt a different technique, to lay foundation, due to the loose soil, water seepage and soft rock. A portion of Devaraja Market caved in August 2016 and it is yet to be decided whether to restore or re-construct the building. Karnataka State Technical Task Force (KSTTF) and Heritage department conducted separate studies and have given different reports and recommendations. While KSTTF has recommended rebuilding of the structure, the Heritage department has suggested restoration. It has to be noted that a team submitted a report on soil capacity to Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), which maintains the market building. The samples were collected from three trial pits (TP), one behind Bombay Tiffanys (TP 1) and one opposite to Autorickshaw stand (TP 2) on Dhanvatri Road and another near Chikkagadiyara (TP 3). The report of TP 1 is given, said an officer. According to him, filled soil was found at one pit on Dhanvanthri Road and it is stable. Another pit has consolidated soft rock. In another pit, near Chikkagadiyara, loose soil and seepage was found. Claiming that it is possible to lay the foundation, he said, “We can lay foundation anywhere, including in sea. But, the construction method will change as per the nature of the soil. The higher-ups will finalise about the civil work of the structure," he said. However, N S Rangaraju, retired professor of Ancient History and Archaeology, also member of the Heritage Committee, opposed demolition and reconstruction of the structure. He said, “We have been telling the authorities concerned, not to go for reconstruction and have advised to restore the structure. Devaraja Market is fit for 100% restoration. Only ‘L’ shaped walls require some extra attention, as they need to be strengthened.” Several heritage structures in Mysuru have been restored and conserved. They are in good condition even today, he said.   According to him, all heritage structures are only two-storey buildings, because of the materials used for the construction. Now, the authorities plan for multi-storied buildings. The thickness of the walls of the market building is 9 to 12 inches and the shops are constructed uniformly and the mantaps were erected using iron pillars. The iron pillars were restored by removing rust and Mangalore tiles were replaced. A part of the inner structure was restored earlier. Unfortunately, the works stopped as a portion of the building collapsed. Heritage structures need respectful maintenance, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/soil-need-to-be-strengthened-to-reconstruct-devaraja-market-915266.html

Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa said Friday that even though he was scheduled to travel to Delhi, it was delayed due to developments in Bihar. Speaking to reporters, Yediyurappa said that though he was in touch with the national leadership and had scheduled to travel to Delhi "today or tomorrow. But, since national leaders are busy with Bihar government formation, I think they want me to come after that is complete," he said. Yediyurappa said that the party leadership would take the final call on whether to expand or reshuffle the State Cabinet. On a meeting of some cabinet aspirants held at Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi's house, he said that it was normal for elected representatives to gather. "When will they meet if not now," he said. Ahead of the by-poll results, Yediyurappa had said that he would travel to Delhi if required for cabinet expansion, adding that he was trying to get approval for the expansion or reshuffle over phone. Apart from inducting four turncoats from the Congress-JD(S) coalition, including the recently elected Muniratna, several other MLAs too are aspirants for cabinet berths. Sources said that the expansion will now take place only after the festival, provided the high command finalised ministers in the Bihar Cabinet.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/cabinet-expansion-or-reshuffle-will-be-decided-after-discussion-with-bjp-high-command-karnataka-cm-b-s-yediyurappa-915119.html

The development has raised some eyebrows in political circles as this is the second such meeting between the two after the BJP came to power last year following the collapse of the JD(S)-Congress coalition government headed by Kumaraswamy. The two leaders had last met on September 11. They had then said that the meeting was with regard to the havoc caused by rains in the Dasarahalli constituency represented by JD(S) MLA Manjunath. The sudden meeting between the two has given rise to speculation about possible political discussions between them, as it has come amid allegations from a section of Congress leaders that Kumaraswamy was going soft on the Yediyurappa-led BJP government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/kumaraswamys-meeting-with-karnataka-chief-minister-yediyurappa-fuels-speculation-915237.html
13-11-2020||Main Article||Prayer, worship and tolerance||Recently, four men recited Hanuman chalisa at a mosque in Mathura. Reportedly, they claimed that it was in “fitting response” to a man performing namaz at Nand Baba temple nearby. These events have rightly raised the question as to why a person of one religion cannot pray at the place of worship of another religion. To address this question, we need to distinguish between worship and prayer. Worship and prayer Temples, mosques and churches are places of worship for Hindus, Muslims and Christians, respectively, and considered holy by those religionists. Worship includes ceremony, and is an expression of reverence and adoration for a deity. It consists of certain procedures or rituals, characteristic of the particular religion or faith, such as performing aarti or reciting scriptural verses, etc., by Hindus; bending down, moving the hands in a prescribed manner, etc., while facing towards Mecca, by Muslims; kneeling and making signs of the cross, etc., by Christians. It may include wearing or not wearing certain forms or items of dress. Prayer in a religious sense is a person’s thought or softly uttered words addressed to a divine entity, and may include making certain wishes. Adherents of different religions perform acts of worship for an individual to better focus or concentrate on the entity being prayed to, or for observance of cultural tradition, or to express solidarity with co-religionists. These acts are within appropriately constructed and furnished premises. All these are verbal, physical or architectural acts, expressing conformity with the dogma of the particular religion. Worship is thus prayer with added ritual or ceremony. The distinction between worship and prayer is also clear in many Indian languages – worship is pooja (Urdu ibadat) and prayer is prarthana (Urdu iltija). Conforming to custom When an individual prays in any place of worship in conformity with the custom, tradition, procedures and rituals of that place of worship, he/she attracts no attention. The intention is to pray, not to attract attention or to “make a statement”. Wearing religion-neutral clothing, a person reciting Gayathri mantra quietly inside a temple would not attract attention, just as a person entering a mosque and worshipping as Muslims do would not. But even a Muslim who does not conform to religious custom in a mosque, or a Hindu who does not conform to Hindu custom in a temple attracts adverse attention. However, a Hindu entering a mosque with tilak on his forehead or reciting a verse from Hindu scriptures, would certainly attract attention, most probably adverse, even if he went there genuinely to pray. Likewise, with genuine desire to pray, a Muslim man wearing his prayer cap or a woman wearing hijab entering a temple, and performing the ritual of namaz, would attract adverse attention. It is departure or divergence from custom/tradition in a place of worship which attracts attention. Attracting attention in whatever manner, to differences in custom/tradition may have spoken or unspoken motivations. A person who performs a divergent act may have honourable or disruptive motives, but in either case, he attracts attention. Also, an observer of the divergent act may take note of it appreciatively, critically or strongly negatively, depending upon several factors at the personal, social or political level.  All goes well when the person who performs a divergent act is well-intentioned, and also an observer of it takes an appreciative or non-critical view. But the reality is otherwise, as the news reports from Mathura indicate. The man who performed namaz in the temple was sent to 14 days’ judicial custody for “promoting enmity between religions” and “defiling a place of worship”, and the men who “fittingly” responded to it by reciting Hanuman chalisa at a mosque were detained by Police.  What is common between recitation of Hindu scripture at a mosque in “fitting” response to namaz at a temple is the deliberate or possibly inadvertent departure from custom, which drew the attention of the opposite religionists, and had unexpected, unhappy consequences. Cultural diversity There are many places of Hindu, Muslim and Christian worship across the country at which persons belonging to any religion go to pray, with faith in their hearts and minds that their prayers will be answered. For such people, faith in prayer clearly supercedes the ritual of religious worship, when they conform to the religious practice of the particular place of worship. There are also many instances of Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs looking after the place of worship of a different religion. But even while understanding that prayer to any deity can be done anywhere by anybody, they always respect the custom or ritual within that place of worship. They understand that prayer is spiritual while worship is cultural. Building religion-neutral houses of worship with common rituals may further inter-religious amity and understanding. But it would be an attempt to remove the differences in religious practices, and amount to cultural homogenisation. The desirability of this is questionable. The way forward In Indian Armed Forces units and establishments, places of worship of different religions are sometimes housed in the same building, even the same room, when space is at a premium as in some field areas. However, each religion has its assigned space, provided with its own religious symbols and ambience. Soldiers belonging to whichever faith may, and often do, pray and worship in the space assigned to another religion, but observe the custom and ritual of that religion. Such places are called “sarvadharma sthal”, in keeping with secular practice. They implicitly observe cross-religion tolerance, respect and acceptance of differences in customs and traditions. At the wider social level, only a de-politicised clergy and laity realising this, can achieve lasting communal harmony and peace in society. Individual acts, howsoever well-intentioned, are apt to be misunderstood, especially in the present times.

13-11-2020||National||Like a student eager to impress the teacher: Obama describes Rahul Gandhi in his memoir||Former US President Barack Obama says Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has a "nervous, unformed quality" about him like a student eager to impress the teacher but lacking aptitude and passion to "master the subject." The New York Times has reviewed Obama's memoir 'A Promised Land', in which among other issues, the first Black American President has talked about political leaders from around the world. On Gandhi, Obama says he has "a nervous, unformed quality about him as if he were a student who’d done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject," according to The New York Times review. Rahul Gandhi's mother and Congress president Sonia Gandhi also appears to find mention in the memoir. The NYT review said in the memoir "we are told of the handsomeness of men like Charlie Crist and Rahm Emanuel, but not the beauty of women, except for one or two instances, as in the case of Sonia Gandhi." Former US Secretary of Defence Bob Gates and former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh both come across as having a kind of impassive integrity, the review states. It added that Russian President Vladimir Putin reminds Obama of the tough, street-smart ward bosses who used to run the Chicago machine. "Physically, he was unremarkable," Obama writes of Putin.

The auction will take place on December 1 or 2, he said. Recently six out of seven properties of Ibrahim which had been put up for auction were sold, while one remained unsold due to technical issues. A plush flat in Mumbai's western suburbs which belonged to Mirchi (who died in 2013) also remained unsold. Among Dawood's unsold properties is a plot in Lote village in Maharashtra's Ratnagiri district.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/fresh-auction-of-unsold-properties-of-dawood-ibrahim-iqbal-mirchi-914902.html

13-11-2020||National||Amit Shah's account temporarily locked; Twitter calls it 'inadvertent error'||Home Minister Amit Shah's verified Twitter handle was temporarily locked, only to be restored by the social media giant after saying that it happened due to an "inadvertent error". On Thursday, Twitter had removed Shah's display picture from the microblogging site in response to a "report from the copyright holder". A message "media not displayed. This image has been removed in response to a report from the copyright holder" was being displayed when one clicked the picture on the account of Shah, who has 23.6 million followers on Twitter. However, a Twitter spokesperson said, "due to an inadvertent error, we temporarily locked this account under our global copyright policies. This decision was reversed immediately and the account is fully functional." Twitter's copyright policy says, "in general, the photographer and not the subject of a photograph is the actual rights holder of the resulting photograph." The micro-blogging site had earlier this month removed the display picture of the Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI) citing this policy. The "inadvertent" locking of Shah's profile came close on the heels of the government issuing a notice to Twitter for showing Leh as part of Jammu and Kashmir instead of the Union Territory of Ladakh. Twitter was asked to explain within five working days why legal action should not be initiated against the platform and its representatives for disrespecting the territorial integrity of India by showing an incorrect map. In its notice, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology had said that showing Leh as part of Jammu and Kashmir was a deliberate attempt to undermine the will of the sovereign Parliament of India which has declared Ladakh as a Union Territory with its headquarters in Leh. If Twitter does not fall in line, the microblogging site could face a ban in the country under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act. It may also face an FIR against its officials, who could face a jail term of up to six months. Responding to the issue, a Twitter spokesperson said, "We have duly responded to the letter and, as part of our correspondence, shared a comprehensive update with the latest developments regarding the geo-tag issue." The spokesperson also said that Twitter remains committed to partnering with the government to serve the public conversation. Earlier, Twitter had landed in controversy after Leh was shown as in China. A Parliamentary Standing Committee had come down heavily on Twitter saying that it was "treason", while insisting that the US-based parent company and not its Indian arm should submit an explanation in the form of an affidavit.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/amit-shahs-account-temporarily-locked-twitter-calls-it-inadvertent-error-915019.html

If final-stage trial data show AstraZeneca’s candidate gives effective protection from the virus, the Serum Institute of India Ltd. -- which is partnered to produce at least one billion doses -- may get emergency authorization from New Delhi by December, said Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer of the family-owned firm based in the western city of Pune. That initial amount will go to India, Poonawalla said in an interview on Thursday. Full approval early next year will allow distribution on a 50-50 basis with the South Asian nation and Covax, the World Health Organization-backed body that’s purchasing shots for poor nations. Serum, which has tied up with five developers, has so far made 40 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine in the past two months and aims to start manufacturing Novavax Inc.’s contender soon. “We were a bit concerned it was a big risk,” said 39-year-old Poonawalla. But both AstraZeneca and Novavax’s shots “are looking pretty good.” The haste underlines Poonawalla’s confidence in one of the main vaccine front-runners. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot has said he is preparing for the possibility of large-scale vaccinations as early as December and once the U.K. grants its own emergency license, Serum will submit that same data to Indian counterparts. Drugmakers are just now getting data that will show how well their vaccine candidates work, but there are plenty of hurdles remaining as the global race to find an effective shot against the pathogen reaches its final stages. Astra and co-developer University of Oxford still need to see testing results. And even if their vaccine proves effective and gets a nod from regulators, there are questions over how easily and quickly the shot can be distributed. Poonawalla reiterated that it will take until 2024 to vaccinate the entire world and two years to see a real reduction in infections, due to affordability and manufacturing hurdles. After talks with the government, Poonawalla said he is confident in their plans to get initial vaccines to the vulnerable and frontline workers. The challenge, will be in getting it to India’s 1.3 billion population, especially in the vast countryside where past inoculation drives have struggled due to patchy health networks. He said AstraZeneca has a significant edge over a rival candidate from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, which this week grabbed headlines after indicating it was more than 90% effective in stopping Covid-19 infections. Expensive cold-chain infrastructure is needed to transport and store that vaccine at -70 degrees Celsius. Poonawalla said it was “just impossible” for most of the world to use at scale, compared to those his company will produce that can be stored at fridge temperatures. “I don’t think even 90% of the countries will be able to take it, because you just don’t have deep freezers everywhere,” he said of the Pfizer shot. “In a pandemic, always remember that simplicity is the key.” For India, which has struggled to contain the world’s second-largest Covid outbreak, negotiations with the Serum Institute on vaccine pricing will be pivotal for the country’s efforts to emerge from the pandemic. New Delhi has set aside about Rs 50,000 crores ($6.7 billion) for vaccines, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. However, in September, Poonawalla argued that India would need Rs 80,000 crores. Poonawalla declined to comment further. Poonawalla is taking a big financial gamble. Operating in the low margin, mass volume world of vaccines, the Serum Institute -- founded in 1966 by Poonawalla’s billionaire father Cyrus -- supplies 170 nations with over a billion shots a year for diseases such as measles and mumps. Close to $300 million of the company’s money has been invested in early production, said Poonawalla. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, the vaccine alliance, have also contributing $300 million this year, earmarking 200 million doses for the Covax effort. That leaves about $200 million left to bridge for Serum’s planned expenditure. “I don’t need all of it right now, the capital we’ve deployed already is enough,” Poonawalla said, adding that advance orders recently signed with countries such as Bangladesh should fill the gap. Serum is also in discussions with India for an advanced commitment. “I think in the next one or two months I’ll be fully capitalized.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/serum-institute-expects-emergency-covid-19-vaccine-authorisation-by-december-915025.html

WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the announcement in a video message at an event to mark the 5th Ayurveda Day. The Institute of Teaching and Research in Ayurveda (ITRA), Jamnagar (Gujarat) and the National Institute of Ayurveda (NIA), Jaipur (Rajasthan) are both premier institutions of Ayurveda in the country. The Jamnagar institute has been conferred the status of an Institution of National Importance (INI) by an act of Parliament and the one at Jaipur has been designated an Institution Deemed to be University (De novo Category) by the University Grants Commission (UGC), according to the AYUSH ministry. “I am pleased to announce that we have agreed to open a WHO Global Centre of Traditional Medicine in India to strengthen the evidence, research, training and awareness of traditional and complementary medicine,” Ghebreyesus said. "This new centre will support WHO's efforts to implement the WHO traditional medicine strategy 2014-2023 which aims to support countries in developing policies and action plans to strengthen the role of traditional medicine as part of their journey to universal health coverage and a healthier, fairer and safer world," he said. Ghebreyesus said traditional systems of medicine such as Ayurveda can play an important role in integrated people-centric health services and healthcare, but they have not received enough attention. Ghebreyesus also lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his commitment to the universal coverage under Ayushman Bharat and evidence-based promotion of traditional medicines to achieve health related objectives. Addressing the function, Modi said Ayurveda is India's heritage whose expansion entails the welfare of humanity and all Indians will be happy to see that the country's traditional knowledge is enriching other countries. Modi said Ayurveda is India's heritage whose expansion entails the welfare of humanity and all Indians will be happy to see that the country's traditional knowledge is enriching other countries. "It is a matter of pride for all Indians that the WHO has chosen India for establishing its Global Centre for Traditional Medicine. Now work will be done in this direction from India," Modi said.  "I would like to thank the WHO and particularly its Director-General Tedros for giving this responsibility to India. I am confident that just like India has emerged as the pharmacy of the world, in the same manner, this centre for traditional medicine will become the centre for global wellness," he said. Pointing out that during the coronavirus period the demand for Ayurvedic products increased rapidly all over the world, he said exports of Ayurvedic products increased by about 45 per cent in September this year compared to the previous year. He said the significant increase in export of spices like turmeric, ginger, considered as immunity boosters, shows the sudden boost in confidence in Ayurvedic solutions and Indian spices in the world. In many countries, drinks related to turmeric are also increasing and the world's prestigious medical journals are also seeing new hope in Ayurveda, he noted. Modi said that during the coronavirus period, the focus was not only limited to the use of Ayurveda alone but also on research related to AYUSH in the country and the world. "On one hand, India is testing vaccines, on the other, it is also increasing international cooperation on Ayurvedic research to fight Covid," he said. Modi pointed out that research is going on in more than a hundred places including at the All India Institute of Ayurveda in Delhi which has conducted research related to immunity on 80,000 Delhi Police personnel. He also highlighted that prices of Ayurvedic herbs like Ashwagandha, Giloy, Tulsi have increased amid the pandemic. The price of Ashwagandha has more than doubled compared to last year and its direct benefit is reaching farmers, he said.   (With inputs from PTI)||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/who-to-set-up-centre-for-traditional-medicine-in-india-pm-narendra-modi-says-matter-of-pride-915031.html

Kamra’s statement comes a day after Attorney General K K Venugopal consented to the initiation of criminal contempt proceedings against him for a series of tweets following the apex court giving interim bail to Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami. “The tweets I recently put out have been found in contempt of court. All that I tweeted was from my view of the Supreme Court of India giving a partial decision in favour of a Prime Time Loudspeaker,” he said in a statement addressed to Venugopal and the judges on his Twitter page.      “My view hasn't changed because the silence of the Supreme Court of India on matters of other's personal liberty cannot go uncriticized. I don't intend to retract my tweets or apologise for them. I believe they speak for themselves,” he added. Kamra, who was banned by several airlines after he heckled Goswami on an IndiGo flight earlier this year, said he enjoys a platform with a captive audience but a time slot before the Supreme Court is a scarce commodity and should go to more pressing issues in front of the nation.         He also referred to contempt proceedings against lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who had refused to apologise for his derogatory tweets and was held guilty of contempt earlier this year. “I wish to volunteer having the time that would be allotted to the hearing of my contempt petition (20 hours at the very least, if Prashant Bhushan's hearing is anything to go by), to other matters and parties who have not been as lucky and privileged as I am to jump the queue,” Kamra said.     The stand-up comedian and satirist then went on to list the important petitions pending in front of the court, listing the pleas on demonetisation, the challenge to the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, the matter of the legality of electoral bonds and “countless other matters that are more deserving of time and attention”.   “The Supreme Court of India hasn't yet declared my tweets anything as of now but if and when they do I hope they can have a small laugh before declaring them Contempt of Court,” he said. The apex court on Wednesday granted interim bail to Goswami in an abetment to suicide case, saying it will be a "travesty of justice" if personal liberty is curtailed. Terming Kamra’s tweets in “bad taste”, Venugopal on Thursday said it was time for people to understand that attacking the apex court brazenly will attract punishment. “I have gone through each one of the tweets which you have annexed for consent to proceed by way of criminal contempt against Kunal Kamra. The tweets which I am extracting below are not only in bad taste but clearly cross the line between humour and contempt of the court,” the top law officer said in a letter to one of the applicants who had sought his consent to initiate contempt proceedings against Kamra.         “I therefore grant consent to proceed by way of initiating contempt proceedings against Kunal Kamra,” Venugopal said.          The consent of either the attorney general or the solicitor general is necessary, under section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, for initiating contempt proceedings against a person.         In one of the letters seeking the attorney general’s consent, three lawyers claimed that Kamra had allegedly attempted to “lower the authority of the Supreme Court of India” through his tweets after the apex court granted Goswami bail.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/don-t-intend-to-retract-or-apologise-for-tweets-kunal-kamra-on-consent-for-contempt-proceedings-against-him-915053.html

"In India’s development cooperation, we will be guided by our partners’ development priorities. Our assistance does not create indebtedness and is without conditionalities,” India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti said at the 44th Annual Meeting of the G-77 Foreign Ministers on Thursday. Tirumurti said the pandemic threatens to setback decades of progress made by developing countries and push millions back into poverty. “As G-77 countries, we cannot let this happen. We need to raise our collective voice for recovery, resilience and reform to ensure that we go back to the path of development,” he said at the forum titled ‘Global response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the obstacles it poses to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and achievement of the SDGs’. Tirumurti reiterated India’s steadfast commitment to work with its partners from the global South in the G-77 “towards a resilient and sustainable recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and to build back better and stronger.” Giving the statement for External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Tirumurti emphasised that India’s approach will be human-centric, based on principles of mutual respect and national ownership with a commitment to sustainable development for all, in the spirit of ‘World Is One Family’. Underscoring the need for affordable health systems and resilient supply chains to fight the pandemic, he said India is assisting in urgent health and medical supplies to more than 150 countries. India has pledged 15 million dollars for GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and operationalised the Covid-19 Emergency Fund for India’s neighbours with an initial contribution of 10 million dollars. Prime Minister Modi has pledged that India, as the largest vaccine producing country, will make its production and delivery capacity available to the entire humanity, Tirumurti said. He further noted that as the 75th anniversary of the United Nations is commemorated this year, the pandemic has laid bare the “shortcomings” of the world organisation and other multilateral institutions. “The call for reformed multilateralism, including reform of UN Security Council, has only become stronger than ever before,” he said. Tirumurti told the annual ministerial meeting of the 'Group of 77’ that in its South-South cooperation, New Delhi has never let geography limit its approach to assist the developing world. The India-CARICOM Leaders Meeting, India-Pacific Islands Summit, India-ASEAN Summits and India-Africa Forum Summits have further strengthened the special bonding between India and fellow developing countries, he said, adding that India’s own embrace of the digital revolution will be a model for the developing world in the global response to Covid. India’s concessional Lines of Credit of over 30 billion dollars, its grants-in-aid projects and flagship training and capacity building project under Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) have made a huge contribution to fellow developing countries. Further, the 150 million dollar India-UN Development Partnership Fund continues to support transformational sustainable development projects with a focus on LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS. Tirumurti underlined that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement and Financing for Development framework should lay the foundations for global efforts. “We need to impress on our developed country partners to do more and show the necessary urgency. Covid pandemic cannot be used as an excuse to not fulfill their commitments or to undermine environmental Conventions. India called on developed country partners to undertake activities to strengthen ‘Convention-Plus’ actions and not do ‘Convention-Minus’. He said ‘Convention-Plus’ examples include the International Solar Alliance spearheaded by Modi where India has pledged 1.7 billion dollars for solar energy projects, and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/our-assistance-does-not-create-indebtedness-india-at-g-77-ministerial-meeting-915056.html

In a review published in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), they said "anti-oxidative herbal medicines can be used as adjuvant to currently prescribed drugs to treat coronavirus in patients with diabetes and also can be considered as a suitable source to identify novel therapeutic agents for Covid-19". “Certain herbs work as antioxidants and check free radicals apart from maintaining normal blood glucose levels,” A K S Rawat, former senior scientist with CSIR- National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI), said. He also referred to anti-diabetic herbal formulation, BGR-34, developed using extracts of herbs like Giloy, Vijaysar, Daruharidra, Gudmar, Methika and Majeeth. The formulation has been scientifically developed by NBRI in collaboration with the Central Institute for Medicinal and Aromatic Plant (CIMAP), both Lucknow-based CSIR labs. BGR-34, commercially manufactured by Aimil Pharmaceuticals, has shown therapeutic efficacy for treating newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, as found in independent clinical trials conducted at Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Varanasi last year. As the world observes November 14 as Diabetes Day, Rawat also said that herbal ingredients like Giloy used in BGR-34 also corrects immunity, while compounds in Dharuharida help in insulin release in type 2 diabetic patients. Based on the 2019 International Diabetes Federation (IDF) report, the world prevalence of diabetes was 463 million, and is expected to reach 578 million in 2030, and 700 million in 2045. According to doctors, patients with co-morbidities like diabetes are more vulnerable to coronavirus because of their compromised immunity.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/herbal-drug-based-adjuvant-therapy-effective-in-treating-diabetic-covid-19-patients-researchers-915074.html

The newly formed Institute of Teaching and Research in Ayurveda (ITRA), which the PM inaugurated through video conferencing, has been accorded the status of an "institution of national importance" (INI). ITRA, situated in the Gujarat Ayurveda University campus in Jamnagar city, was created through an Act of Parliament recently. It was formed by merging a cluster of four Ayurveda institutes at the university campus. These four institutes were - the Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Shree Gulab Kunverba Ayurveda Mahavidyalaya, Institute of Ayurvedic Pharmaceutical Sciences and Maharshi Patanjali Institute for Yoga Naturopathy Education and Research. In September, Parliament had passed a Bill for creation of ITRA and conferred it the status of an "institution of national importance". ITRA is the first institute to enjoy this status in the AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy) sector, said a release by the PIB. "ITRA will be the first institution with INI status in the AYUSH sector, and this will enable the institution to be independent and innovative in the matter of deciding course content and pedagogy," said the release. "The decision comes at a time when global interest in health solutions based on traditional wisdom is at an unprecedentedly high level and ITRA is poised to take Ayurveda education to new vistas," it added. A release by the Ministry of AYUSH stated that ITRA will have autonomy to upgrade standards of Ayurveda education. "It will offer courses as per national and international demand and forge inter-disciplinary collaborations to give a contemporary thrust to Ayurveda," said the release. The Gujarat Ayurveda University was established in 1967 by an Act of the state Assembly. It is the first statutory University of its kind both at national and international level - exclusively devoted to Ayurvedic studies and research, said a release by the state government. "This university is an autonomous organisation fully financed by the Gujarat government. "The university looks after the management of the institutes and colleges situated in the campus along with conducting examinations of degrees/diplomas awarded by the university," it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-inaugurates-ayurveda-research-teaching-institute-915078.html
13-11-2020||National||India, China close in on plan to end months of military standoff||Seeking to end a dangerous military standoff in the western Himalayas, India and China are formulating a plan that involves creating no-patrol zones, pulling back tanks and artillery, and using drones to verify the withdrawal, Indian officials say. Tensions have run high since June when at least 20 Indian soldiers were killed after being attacked by Chinese troops using rocks and clubs. Indian officials say the Chinese troops had intruded across the disputed border in a remote valley. China said the Indian soldiers' actions had been provocative. Since then, the nuclear-armed Asian neighbours have deployed tens of thousands of troops on the rugged frontier between India's Ladakh region and the Chinese-held Tibetan plateau, raising the risk of further confrontation even while looking for ways to de-escalate. After months of fitful progress, the two sides are discussing a staggered disengagement from the high-altitude desert where temperatures have dipped to 18 degrees below Celsius, three Indian government officials said. "We have a firm plan for disengagement on the table, it is being internally discussed on both sides," said one of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. Under the plan that was shared during a meeting of top commanders last Friday, both sides will pull back from the contested Pangong Tso lake area and establish a buffer zone. Chinese soldiers will dismantle defence structures on several hilly spurs overlooking the lake and pull back, the officials briefed on the discussions said. India, which has occupied heights on the lake's south bank, will also withdraw. Both sides will cease patrolling certain sections. The 3,800-km-long India-China border is undemarcated, and the two countries went to war in 1962. While there have been recurrent incidents down the years, troops from both sides have largely abided by a long-standing protocol to avoid firing weapons on the high altitude border, although some warning shots were fired in September. India's defence and foreign ministries declined to comment on the specifics of the latest negotiations. "When we have something to share, we will share. Discussions are ongoing," foreign ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said. The three officials said that military commanders from both sides could meet within a week for further discussions on disengagement. There was no immediate comment from China, but the state-controlled Global Times newspaper cited unnamed sources saying a disengagement plan was under discussion where India would first withdraw troops who had "illegally crossed lines" south of Pangong Tso. Finding a mutually acceptable sequence for withdrawal could be complicated. Indian troops currently occupy heights on the southern shore of the lake, overlooking Chinese positions. "If we empty out from there, there is nothing to negotiate,” a second Indian official said. Under the plan outlined by Indian officials, tanks and artillery that two sides had deployed following the clash in June would be moved back from the frontline. They were also discussing a way to verify the troop withdrawal including the use of drones over the disputed areas at specific times each day, one of the Indian officials said. "If you are going to establish buffer zones, verification is the key to this," the official said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-china-close-in-on-plan-to-end-months-of-military-standoff-915092.html

While a section of Congress leaders expressed displeasure over Obama’s remarks, AICC chief spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala chose to dismiss it as the view of an individual in a book. “Nervous and unformed. Guess who,” BJP spokesman Sambit Patra said even as Union Minister Kiren Rijiju shared the Hindi translation of Obama’s remarks. As BJP leaders took swipes at Rahul, Surjewala recalled that “in the past, a leader has been called a ‘psychopath’ and ‘master divider’ but the Congress had chosen to ignore such comments. However, Lok Sabha member and AICC Secretary Manickam Tagore said Obama’s remarks against Rahul were “not acceptable to any true Indian” and urged Twitterati to unfollow the former US President on social networking sites. “I decided to unfollow Barack Obama whom I followed from 2009. Reason his judgment about Indian political leaders and words against them not acceptable by any true Indian. Will you also unfollow him,” Tagore said on Twitter. Rahul had met Obama at least twice, first in November 2010 when he was on an official visit to India and later in December 2017, when the former US President was here to participate in a conference organised by a media house. “Mr Obama, no one can know the personality of any person in 5 to 10 minutes. Sometimes it takes years. You are wrong to judge the personality of Rahul Gandhi ji. You will bite the dust just wait for some time,” Congress spokesman Udit Raj said. “We don't need a Barack Obama to pass a judgment on 'Our Leader' Rahul Gandhi,” Congress leader Archana Dalmia said. Acharya Pramod Krishnan said Obama had hurt the sentiments of crores of Congress workers “who consider Rahul Gandhi as God.” In a new book, Obama has written that Rahul Gandhi had “a nervous, unformed quality about him, as if he were a student who’d done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject.” Obama’s remarks come at a time when the Congress is reeling under the defeat in the Bihar assembly elections, much of which is being blamed on Rahul’s hand-picked leaders for the campaign. Twitterati had a field day at the Congress’ expense with one use claiming that the grand old party was now busy searching Obama’s “Nagpur connection”, an apparent reference to the RSS.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/barack-obamas-characterisation-of-rahul-gandhi-irks-congress-915114.html

Acting on an appeal filed by the Telangana Fireworks Dealers Association, the top court issued notice to advocate P Indra Prakash and others on whose plea the HC passed the order. It put the matter for further consideration on November 16. After hearing senior advocate Salman Khurshid, appearing for the association, the court said, "The order of the High Court stands modified and is brought in line with the directions issued by the National Green Tribunal by a comprehensive order of November 9, 2020."  The NGT had then imposed a total ban on the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the Delhi-NCR region from midnight of November 9-10, 2020 to the midnight of November 30 – December 1, 2020. It said the order would apply to all cities where the air quality is poor. It, however, had said the cities or towns where air quality is "moderate" or below, only green crackers should be sold and the timings for use and bursting of crackers should be restricted to two hours during festivals, like Diwali, Chhatt, New Year and Christmas eve, etc, as may be specified by the concerned state government. The top court prima facie agreed to the contention of the association which questioned the validity of the HC order passed without hearing them, seriously affecting their livelihood. "For no reason, much less special reason is noted in the impugned order for departing therefrom. All concerned in the State of Telangana must comply with the stated directions of the NGT in its letter and spirit," the bench said||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-allows-sale-limited-use-of-firecrackers-in-telangana-915120.html
13-11-2020||National||Government expands scope of PM-KUSUM for harnessing solar energy by farmers||The renewable energy ministry has expanded the scope of PM-KUSUM scheme to enable greater solar energy generation in farm sector. The ministry has amended the guidelines of the scheme based on the learning from its implementation during the first year, an official statement said. Now, besides barren, fallow and agricultural lands, solar power plants can also be installed on pasture land and marshy land of farmers. To support small farmers, solar projects smaller than 500 kW may be allowed by states based on techno-commercial feasibility, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) statement said. The selected renewable power generator (RPG) shall commission the solar power plant within twelve months from date of issuance of Letter of Award (LoA), it added. Moreover, there shall be no penalty on RPG for shortfall in solar power generation from minimum prescribed Capacity Utilization Factor. As per the amendments, now MNRE will retain 33 per cent of eligible service charges for nationwide Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities. The order mentions that the ministry may release 50 per cent of eligible service charges for the sanctioned quantity after placement of LoA for preparatory activities. For solar pumps to be set up and used by water user associations/farmer producer organisations/primary agriculture credit societies or for cluster based irrigation system, the central financial assistance (CFA) will be allowed for solar pump capacity of higher than 7.5 HP considering up to 5 HP capacity for each individual in the group. Eligibility for participation in the centralised tender has also been amended. During last bid, only solar pump and solar panel manufacturers were allowed to participate in the bid considering quality and post installation services for next five years. During implementation it has been observed that these manufacturers lack workforce in the field and are dependent on local integrators for this purpose, which has caused delay in installation of solar pumps, the statement said. To overcome this situation and also ensure quality and post installation services, it is now decided to allow joint venture of manufacturer of solar pump/solar panel/solar pump controller with integrators. The order further says that quantity equivalent to 10 per cent of total quantity under a particular category of pumps of a cluster will be allocated to the lowest bidder and balance will be kept on market mode for all selected bidders including the lowest bidder. This assured allocation will bring seriousness and competition in the bid. The guidelines related to specifications and testing have also been amended to avoid repetitive testing of same model and for faster implementation. Solar pump specifications were updated by MNRE in July 2019 and same are being used for Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyaan (PM-KUSUM) scheme. As part of amended guidelines separate bid price for solar water pumping system with Universal Solar Pump Controller (USPC) will be invited and subsidy will be made available for these pumps according to benchmark price of solar pumps without USPC, even if price discovered for solar pumps without USPC is less than the benchmark price. Standalone solar pumps are used only for 100-150 days in a year and solar energy generated during the balance period is not utilised. In order to make effective use of solar energy it was proposed to introduce USPC, which will not only run the water pump but can also run other electric equipment like cold storage, battery charging, flour mill, etc. Installation of USPC will increase the income of farmers, which is the aim of the PM-KUSUM scheme, the ministry said. The statement said that now farmers will be provided solar panels and they will be able to use the generated solar power to meet the irrigation needs and sell the surplus solar power. DISCOMs will buy surplus power from them at the pre-determined rate to be decided by the respective state/state electricity regulatory commission (SERC). Solar PV capacity up to two times of pump capacity in kW is allowed under the scheme. The scheme guidelines were silent on CFA applicable for solarisation of large capacity pumps used by water user associations and community/cluster based irrigation system. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had approved PM-KUSUM scheme on February 19, 2019.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/government-expands-scope-of-pm-kusum-for-harnessing-solar-energy-by-farmers-915121.html

13-11-2020||National||Covid-19 threatening India's gains in protecting children against pneumonia, diarrhoea: Report||Although India has made significant progress in ensuring that children under five years of age are protected against pneumonia and diarrhoea through immunisation, the Covid-19 pandemic threatens these hard-won gains, according to the latest annual Pneumonia and Diarrhoea Progress Report. The report by the International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC) at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health also stated that although overall the world's health systems are falling short of ensuring that children have access to prevention and treatment services, India made significant progress in ensuring children receive immunisations to protect against diarrhoea and pneumonia. The report tracks progress by analysing 10 indicators from the latest available data on how countries are delivering key interventions, including breastfeeding, immunisation, care-seeking and antibiotics, oral rehydration solution (ORS) and zinc supplementation, shown to prevent pneumonia and diarrhoea deaths. Due to a large part of its population, India bears a greater burden of under-five pneumonia and diarrhoea deaths than any other country, based on global child mortality data. An estimated 2,33,240 Indian children under five die due to pneumonia and diarrhoea each year, 640 children per day, according to the report.  India's coverage of rotavirus vaccine increased by 18 percentage points (35 per cent rotavirus coverage in 2018 expanded to 53 per cent in 2019), it stated. This coincides with India's rapid scale-up of the rotavirus vaccine across the country that will help protect 26 million children born each year against life-threatening cases of rotavirus diarrhoea, according to a statement released by IVAC. India's immunisation coverage against pneumococcal pneumonia also increased by nine percentage points (six per cent PCV (pneumococcal conjugate vaccines) coverage in 2018 expanded to 15 per cent in 2019), it said. Of the 15 focus countries included in the report, India is one of just four countries that exceeded targets for exclusive breastfeeding (58 per cent exclusive breastfeeding rate), IVAC said. However, nearly every country included in the report lagged in access to treatments against pneumonia and diarrhoea. Treatment for diarrhoea had the lowest coverage in India, only 51 per cent of children received oral rehydration solution (ORS) and only 20 per cent of children received zinc, the statement said. ORS and zinc, especially when co-packaged together, are highly effective treatments that are proven to reduce deaths from diarrhoea in children, it said. ] The report stated that although there was progress in India in 2019, the pandemic threatens these hard-won gains due to disruption of routine health services like immunisation and access to medical oxygen, which is used to treat both pneumonia and Covid-19 patients. "While the world focuses on new innovations in vaccines to respond to the Covid-19 epidemic, we cannot afford to lose sight of the millions of children who die from preventable diseases like pneumonia and diarrhoea," IVAC senior advisor and professor in the department of international health, Mathuram Santosham, said. "These deaths are almost all preventable with vaccines and simple proven treatments that we already have available. India's hardwork to expand the rotavirus vaccine highlights the power of committed stakeholders and the success which can be achieved," Santosham said. The statement said that although the efficient rollout of new vaccines has improved India's scores in the 2020 report, global trends find that progress in preventing child morbidity and mortality is lagging behind targets. The window to act was already urgent in 2019, but in the coming year progress needs to be accelerated in order to sustain decades of progress in reducing childhood mortality, according to the statement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-threatening-indias-gains-in-protecting-children-against-pneumonia-diarrhoea-report-915147.html

The move is aimed at facilitating the movement of the physically challenged. "In order to further facilitate the divyangjan, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has issued advisory to state/UTs to extended various exemptions/facilitation/relief provided by the states /UTs in respect of Invalid Carriage Vehicles to vehicles owned by Divyangjan," MoRTH said in a statement. As per the definition by the Motor Vehicles Act, an invalid carriage means a motor vehicle specially designed and constructed, and not merely adapted, for the use of a person suffering from some physical defect or disability, and used solely by or for such a person. Last month, the government notified amendments to the motor vehicle rules for clearly incorporating ownership details in registration documents for facilitating the movement of physically challenged persons. The step was taken after it was brought to the notice of the ministry that the ownership details are not properly reflected in various forms under the Central Motor Vehicles Rules required for registration of motor vehicles. Under the amended forms, ownership details will be captured under categories like the autonomous body, central government, charitable trust, driving training school, divyangjan, educational institute, local authority, multiple owners, and police department. Further, benefits of GST and other concessions are being provided to the divyangjan (physically challenged persons) under various schemes of the government for the purchase, ownership and operation of motor vehicles. According to the current details under the Central Motor Vehicles Rules (CMVR ) 1989, the ownership type does not reflect the details of divyangjan. It becomes difficult for such citizens to properly avail of various benefits under government schemes like the benefits to divyangjan as per the scheme for financial incentives of the Department of Heavy Industries.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-asks-states-to-facilitate-exemptions-to-vehicles-owned-by-differently-abled-persons-915159.html
13-11-2020||National||Indian rotavirus vaccine poses no extra risk of developing intestinal disorder||Four years after its introduction in the national immunization programme, a pan-Indian study has confirmed that a homegrown vaccine against life-threatening rotavirus does not pose any additional risk of a rare but serious intestinal disorder called intussusception. Carried out in 27 hospitals across India, the study noted that the Indian rotavirus vaccine is not associated with intussusception in infants. The critics of the Indian rotavirus vaccine in the past had claimed that the homemade product posses higher risks of intussusception - a complication of the intestine in which parts of the intestine slides inside another part another and blocks blood supply. They claimed that the Indian vaccine is more dangerous than similar vaccines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.   During the post-marketing surveillance of the vaccine, a team of Indian medical researchers led by Gagandeep Kang from the Christian Medical College, Vellore studied 970 kids with intussusception with 589 others who did not have the disorder between April 2016 and June 2019. The conclusion of the three-year study – published in the New England Journal of Medicine – is clear and straight forward: there is no increase in intussusception risk among the users of the Indian vaccine (Rotavac) developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech. The association of intussusception with rotavirus vaccination was identified in 1998, when RotaShield (made by Wyeth–Lederle Vaccines), the first licensed rotavirus vaccine, was withdrawn because of an increased risk of intussusception. Subsequent, large, prelicensure trials of the second-generation rotavirus vaccines Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) and RotaTeq (Merck) did not show an increased risk of intussusception in clinical trials involving 65,000 to 70,000 infants. However, post-marketing surveillance of Rotarix in Australia, Brazil, England, Mexico, and the USA showed one to six excess cases of intussusception per 100,000 vaccinated children. Post-marketing surveillance of RotaTeq in Australia and the USA too showed one to seven excess cases of intussusception per 100,000 vaccinated children. Despite the hypothesis that intussusception might be an adverse event associated with all rotavirus vaccines, the World Health Organisation recommended the introduction of rotavirus vaccine into childhood vaccination programmes because the projected incidences of rotavirus infection and deaths due to diarrhea that were averted were greater than the incidence of additional intussusception, resulting in a favorable risk-benefit ratio.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-rotavirus-vaccine-poses-no-extra-risk-of-developing-intestinal-disorder-915170.html

"Whenever Pakistan indulges in ceasefire violation, its fears and weaknesses become even more clear. Far from their families even during the festival, the soldiers of the Indian Army are protecting our country and demolishing Pakistan's disgusting plans. My salute to every soldier of the Army," Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi. पाकिस्तान जब भी सीज़फ़ायर का उल्लंघन करता है, उसका डर व कमज़ोरी और भी साफ़ हो जाते हैं। त्योहार पर भी अपने परिवारों से दूर, भारतीय सेना के जवान हमारे देश की सुरक्षा में डटे हैं और पाकिस्तान के घृणित मंसूबों को ध्वस्त कर रहे हैं। सेना के हर जवान को मेरा सलाम। Four security forces personnel were among 10 people killed in multiple ceasefire violations by Pakistani troops along the LoC from Gurez to Uri sectors of Jammu and Kashmir on Friday. Srinagar-based defence spokesman Col Rajesh Kalia said Pakistan used mortars and other weapons and deliberately targeted civilian areas. The troops retaliated strongly causing casualties and substantial damage to Pakistan Army's infrastructure across the LoC, he said. "Several ammunition dumps, FOL dumps and multiple terrorist launch pads have been damaged," the defence spokesman said. Three Army personnel, a BSF sub-inspector and six civilians were killed in Pakistani action, while four security forces personnel and eight civilians were injured. "Pakistan initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation along the LoC spread across multiple sectors to include Dawar, Keran, Uri and Naugam.

President Donald Trump has questioned climate science and withdrew the United States from the 2015 accord, which it formally exited this month. US President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin the pact and invest $2 trillion to wean his country off planet-warming fossil fuels. "(The) US is welcome but should fulfill its responsibility," Prakash Javadekar, Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, told Reuters in response to whether the Paris talks and processes would get fresh momentum with a new US administration in place. "We want all countries to join but ... they should ... not bring in new issues into the discourse. We want action to start immediately." Meeting the Paris Agreement's target of capping warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius should be a top priority, Javadekar said. India, the world's third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases and just behind China on its consumption of coal, is yet to commit to pursuing net-zero emissions. India has pledged to increase the share of renewable energy to 40% of installed coal capacity by 2030, from 23.3% now. Last month, Trump described India as "filthy". That prompted Biden - whose Vice President Kamala Harris is half-Indian - to tweet: "It's not how you talk about friends — and it's not how you solve global challenges like climate change." Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere hit a record high this year, according to a United Nations report in September, despite the economic slowdown linked to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/us-should-walk-the-talk-if-they-rejoin-paris-climate-pact-prakash-javadekar-915215.html

The national capital had on Thursday reported 7,053 new infections and 104 deaths. The spike was attributed by Delhi's health authorities to the crowding of markets due to the festive and wedding season. The Health Ministry said the total infections in the country increased by 44,879, while 49,079 patients had recovered and were discharged from healthcare facilities. India’s recoveries surpassed new infections continuously for 41 days, as of Friday. The total recovered cases have surged to 81,15,580, which translates to a national recovery rate of 92.97%. “The gap between recovered cases and active cases continues to grow and presently stands at 76,31,033,” the ministry said.

The buying was heavily restricted to lightweight jewellery, coins and precious stones due to lower purchasing power and high gold rates, they said. Due to the fear of coronavirus infection, many customers who had booked in advance were taking delivery of wedding orders on Friday, while some were seen buying safely through online brands like Tanishq and Melorra. Those who could not afford precious metal shopped steel utensils to make most of the Dhanteras festival celebrated for two days this year, they added. Dhanteras is an auspicious day for buying gold, silver and other valuables and is largely celebrated in north and west India. Gold prices were ruling at Rs 50,425 per 10 gram on Friday up by over 32 per cent from Rs 38,096 per 10 gram on Dhanteras day in 2019. Similarly, silver prices were ruling firm over Rs 62,000 per kg. Speaking to PTI, All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council Chairman Anantha Padmanaban said though footfalls in retail stores across the country picked up in the second half of the day but were still lower than the year-ago period because of fear of Covid-19.  However, jewellers are expecting good business in north and western India as well as in cities like Hyderabad and Bengaluru, he said. "Overall, the sales in terms of volumes are expected to be only 65-70 per cent of the last year's business. In terms of value, we expect to do 80-85 per cent of last year considering high prices," Padmanaban said. According to World Gold Council Managing Director, India, Somasundaram PR, there was a clear trend of consumers moving to digital buying for investment-related purchases like bars and coins this year. "However, when it came to wedding and heavy purchases, people were still preferring physical buying because of their experiential nature," he said. Quoting market reports, Somsundaram said, "In terms of volume, the industry is likely to do 60-65 per cent of last year's business. In terms of value, it is likely to remain similar to last year as the gold prices have gone up." PNG Jewellers Chairman and Managing Director Saurabh Gadgil said, "In terms of volume, we will be able to do 85-90 per cent of last year's business and in terms of value it will be more than last year as the prices have gone up this year." The purchase for gold and silver coins, bars has almost doubled compared to last year, while for lightweight jewellery it has grown by 25-30 per cent, he said. However, for wedding jewellery even as the online browsing has doubled, the actual purchase is still happening through physical buying, he added. Senco Gold and Diamonds CEO Suvankar Sen said the response for Dhanteras has been 70 per cent year-on-year in sales through ecommerce and digital channels. There were also online advances and digital booking for store sales and use of other online tools was 15 per cent of total business done. Tanishq Vice President (Marketing and Retail) Arun Narayan said: "We have seen consequently a good Dhanteras and the drop in the gold rates over the past few days has also helped." Lala Jugal Kishore Jewellers director Tanya Rastogi said, "People are browsing and shortlisting the items online, but the actual sales are happening offline. We expect to do 80 per cent of last year's business in terms of volume and 90 per cent in terms of value." Whereas Bengaluru-based online jewellery brand Melorra Founder and CEO Saroja Yeramilli said: "While we expected to grow by 30 per cent, we have grown by 90 per cent yesterday. We are expecting very good sales today also." Digital gold platform Augmont Director Sachin Kothari said, "We have observed that the demand has doubled compared to yesterday and even last year's Dhanteras. Customers are keen to buy in the range of Rs 3,000- 4,000 on an average." Candere.com founder and CEO Rupesh Jain said, "We closed Dhanteras 2019 with 250 orders and a revenue of Rs 60 lakh and we hope to surpass the numbers this year with a revenue of Rs 2 crore and over 500 orders by the end of the day." Delhi-based Gem Selections and Khanna Gems Group Chairman Pankaj Khanna said, "We have made a sale of Rs 3.11 crore this Dhanteras. Majority sale was of silver and gold coins. Instead of jewellery, people are preferring bullion owing to its less making charges."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/high-prices-covid-19-take-sheen-off-dhanteras-gold-silver-sales-down-up-to-35-915265.html

"With our skies & airports busy facilitating more than 1.81 crore domestic passengers since May 25, 2020, another area which witnessed robust activity & growth is air cargo," he said on Twitter. India had resumed scheduled domestic passenger services from May 25 after a gap of two months due to coronavirus-induced lockdown. Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23. However, air cargo operations - national and international - have not been suspended this year. The air cargo data across the country has shown multiple green shoots, Puri said. Air cargo at Indian airports has increased from 1.55 million metric tonnes (MMT) in 2006-07 to 3.56 MMT in 2018-19. It faced a minor dip to 3.33 MMT during 2019-20 as a result of global downturn due to Covid-19, he said. "India's international air cargo in October 2020 has already reached 90 per cent of the 2019 October level," the minister added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/international-air-cargo-handled-in-india-during-oct-was-90-of-its-year-ago-level-puri-915283.html

Additional District Judge Mayur Jain rejected the bail pleas of Atiqur Rahman, Aalam and Masood saying the charges against the accused are serious and they cannot be enlarged on bail at this juncture when the investigation into the case is still going on. Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan has not moved any court for the bail till now. District prosecution counsel Shiv Ram Singh said the court rejected the bail application of the trio after hearing arguments of both prosecution and defence sides for four days. Journalist Kappan and three others were arrested by Mathura police on October 5, while they were on their way to a village in Hathras to meet the family members of the Dalit girl, who had died in a Delhi hospital while undergoing treatment after a gangrape in her village. Arrested initially on suspicion of being a threat to the peace, the four were booked two days later on a slew of stringent charges, including those of sedition and terrorism, and were sent to a Mathura jail under the judicial custody. The case was initially probed by the Crime Branch of Mathura police but was later transferred to the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force. After the rejection of the bail plea of the three, their defence counsel Madhuban Datt Chaturvedi told PTI that his clients would now move the high court for bail. He said his client Atiqur Rahman was denied bail although he is suffering from a serious ailment. The court gave weightage only to the prosecution version, ignoring the defence counsel's argument, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/court-denies-bail-to-three-arrested-with-kerala-journalist-on-way-to-hathras-915318.html

On Thursday, Amruta Fadnavis took a jibe at the Uddhav Thackeray-led party over its poor performance in the just held Bihar assembly elections and called it "Shav (corpse) Sena". Hitting back, the Sena, which heads the MVA government in Maharashtra, told her to realise the importance of alphabets in her own name. "Don't let the alphabet 'A' in your name go into "mruta" state (dead in Marathi). Realise the importance of 'A' in your name Amruta". "Don't bring bad thoughts in your mind during the auspicious occasion of Diwali," Shiv Sena spokesperson Neelam Gorhe, who is also deputy chairperson in the Legislative Council, said in a statement here. Gorhe said, "You will not benefit by calling the Shiv Sena names." "What is going on exactly? The Shav Sena did kill its own colleague (Congress) in Bihar. No matter where they are taking Maharashtra, but thanks for putting Bihar at right place," Amruta Fadnavis, a banker, had tweeted. Devendra Fadnavis, a former chief minister of Maharashtra, was the BJP's election in-charge in Bihar, where his party put up a stellar show. The Sena had contested certain assembly seats in Bihar but failed to open its account and most of its candidates lost their security deposit (getting votes less than EC-mandated threshold). The Congress, which fought in alliance with the RJD, won only 19 of the 70 seats it contested in Bihar with many observers blaming its poor show for the opposition bloc's electoral loss. The Sena and the Congress are part of the ruling coalition in Maharashtra.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/shiv-sena-hits-back-at-amruta-fadnavis-over-shav-remark-915091.html

Ghosh told reporters that the TMC has now joined hands with forces it had once labelled as "anti-national", with an eye on three assembly seats in the Hills. He also claimed that the Mamata Banerjee-led party was "distributing money" in the Hills and the Dooars area to increase its influence and support base in the region. "It was all pre-planned (attack on convoy). The TMC leadership knew about it and the police did not take any action to prevent this," Ghosh said. The BJP leadership also accused the TMC of unleashing terror in the Hills and the plains. "Our workers are not scared... we are not scared. We will continue to hit the streets. People are with us. We will ensure they get to vote freely," Ghosh insisted. He said several national leaders of the BJP reached out to him and inquired about his well being after Thursday's incident, which left his vehicle partially damaged. Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent remark 'Maut ka khel se mat nahi mil sakta' (game of death cannot get you votes), the state BJP chief said, "A day after the honourable PM made this comment, one of our activists were killed in Purba Medinipur, and my convoy was attacked. These are telltale signs." Stones were hurled and black flags were shown at Ghosh's convoy at Jaigaon area in Alipurduar district on Thursday, where he had gone to attend party programmes, police said. Several Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) activists were seen raising slogans against Ghosh, asking him to leave. A team of police officers, however, brought the situation under control, after forcing the protesters and the saffron camp supporters to disperse. Protesting the treatment meted out to Ghosh in north Bengal, members of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha took out rallies in several parts of the state, later in the day.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/tmc-and-gurungs-gorkha-janmukti-morcha-plotted-attack-on-my-convoy-dilip-ghosh-915102.html

Malik said some BJP leaders were keen to join the NCP and a "trailer" of the development will "soon be released". He said the state government under Uddhav Thackeray, formed by the Shiv Sena, Congress and his party, will last its complete term. Taking to Twitter, the state minority affairs minister referred to the claim often made by BJP leaders, including former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, that the MVA government would collapse on its own due to "internal differences". Malik, who is also his party's national spokesperson, said the government would complete its term as it is "working unitedly on a common minimum programme". "The ideologies of the three parties are different, but no party has joined the government jettisoning its own ideology," he added. "If we decide, the BJP will become empty, but we do not want to do so. Some BJP MLAs want to join our party. Its trailer will soon be released," Malik claimed, but did not elaborate. Recently, senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse, disgruntled with his party since he was made to resign from the Fadnavis government, joined the NCP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-will-be-empty-if-maha-vikas-aghadi-decides-on-it-says-ncps-nawab-malik-915143.html

In Karnataka, Singh will be replacing Murlidhar Rao, who will now handle Madhya Pradesh though he along with Ram Madhav was dropped as General Secretaries by Nadda recently. Madhav has not found a space in the list of in-charges. BJP Telangana leader D K Aruna will be co-in-charge in Karnataka. Singh will also look after Rajasthan as well as the Other Backward Class wing of the party. For 53-year-old Ravi, who was recently appointed General Secretary, it was a huge leg up as the party chief reposed faith in him and assigned him the poll-bound Tamil Nadu as well as Maharashtra. Besides, he will also look after party affairs in Goa as well as the Scheduled Caste Morcha. Ravi had resigned from B S Yediyurappa government after he was appointed General Secretary. Kailash Vijayvargiya will continue to be the in-charge of West Bengal, a crucial state for the BJP that will be going to polls with Bengal and Kerala next year. Arvind Menon, a Malayali who worked in Madhya Pradesh BJP for long, and party IT cell chief Amit Malaviya will assist the former as co-in-charges in the state. In Kerala, former Tamil Nadu MP CP Radhakrishnan has been appointed as in-charge while Sunil Kumar will be co-in-charge. Radhakrishnan, a former MP, has a task cut out as there is a raging internal strife within the state unit over the appointment of K Surendran as state party head. Baijayant Panda will be in-charge of Assam, which will also go to polls next year. He will also look after party affairs in Delhi. Former Agriculture Minister Radhamohan Singh will be the in-charge of Uttar Pradesh where he will be assisted by Sunil Ojha, Satyakumar and Sanjeev Chaurasia. General Secretary Bhupendra Yadav will continue as in-charge of Bihar, where the party had just pipped its ally JD(U) to be the single-largest bloc in the ruling coalition, and Gujarat in-charge. He will also handle the Kisan Morcha. Pankaja Munde, who was at loggerheads with Devendra Fadnavis, will be co-incharge of Madhya Pradesh. Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan, the only minister in the Modi government to be assigned a state, will continue as in-charge of Andhra Pradesh but his party colleague from Kerala P K Krishnadas, who heads a faction within the party against the former in the state, has been divested of his responsibilities in Telangana.

These fresh coronavirus cases were detected from 60,229 tests, including 19,752 RT-PCR, conducted the previous day. Delhi recorded a positivity rate of 11.71 per cent amid the festive season and rising pollution in the city, according to the bulletin issued by the health department. The national capital had recorded its highest single-day spike of 8,593 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, while 85 deaths linked to the disease were recorded on that day. On Thursday, 104 more fatalities, the highest in a day in over five months, were recorded, pushing the death toll in Delhi to 7,332. The city had registered 93 deaths on June 16. Delhi recorded 71 fatalities from Covid-19 on Monday, 79 on Saturday and 77 on Sunday. The number of active cases of coronavirus infection rose to 43,116 on Thursday from 42,629 the previous day, the bulletin said, adding the total number of cases reported so far has climbed to 4,67,028. Earlier in the day, the Delhi High Court's order allowing the AAP government to reserve 80 per cent of ICU beds for Covid-19 patients in 33 private hospitals came as shot in the arm for the city dispensation which was struggling to ramp up health infrastructure in view of a sudden spike in cases. An official said over 1,000 more ICU beds will be available for Covid-19 patients in the national capital following the high court order. The court vacated the stay order passed by a single-judge and listed the matter for further hearing on November 26 before the single-judge bench. Till then the 80 per cent reservation of ICU beds would continue. As many as 976 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in the national capital in the last 16 days, with experts attributing it to a sudden surge in cases, deteriorating air quality, laxity by people in adhering to safety norms, among other factors. Coronavirus cases in Delhi have registered a sudden spike since October 28 when the daily infection breached the 5,000-mark for the first time and it crossed the 8,000-mark on Thursday, also for the first time. Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain launched a mobile app that would allow people access free e-vehicle service dedicated for transportation of Covid-19 patients not in critical condition, officials said. The Jeevan Seva app can be download through a link which will be sent through SMS and QR codes to every Covid-19 patient in Delhi who have been tested.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/7053-new-covid-19-cases-registered-in-delhi-death-toll-7332-with-104-more-fatalities-914897.html

13-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality remains 'very poor'||The national capital recorded its air quality in the “very poor” category on Friday morning, and it is likely to enter the "severe" zone on Diwali night. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 330 at 9 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 314 on Thursday. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (327), Ghaziabad (360), Noida (331), Greater Noida (329), and Gurgaon (328), which fall in the National Capital Region (NCR), also recorded their AQI is the "very poor" category. An official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the air quality is likely to deteriorate marginally during the day. The IMD said a fresh western disturbance is likely to increase the wind speed and improve the air quality in Delhi-NCR post Diwali. Light rain is likely on Sunday under the influence of a western disturbance. It is still to be seen if it is enough to wash away pollutants, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre said. “However, Delhi-NCR's air quality is likely to improve post Diwali due to an increase in the wind speed. On Sunday, the maximum wind speed is expected to be around 12 to 15 kilometers per hour,” he said. V K Soni, the head of the IMD's environment research centre, said calm winds and firecracker emissions may push the air quality to the “severe” zone on Diwali night. The wind speed is expected to pick up thereafter and the wind direction will be east-southeasterly, he said. There will be a significant improvement in air quality by November 16, Soni said. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the PM2.5 concentration in Delhi on Diwali is likely to be the “lowest” in the last four years if no firecrackers are burnt. It said pollution levels in Delhi during the Diwali period are likely to remain in the higher end of the “very poor” category in the absence of emissions due to fireworks. SAFAR said stubble burning-induced impact on AQI is expected to increase from “negligible to moderate” in the next two days. A spike in PM2.5 in the wee hours of November 15 is likely in case of fire-related emissions, it said. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had on Wednesday ordered closure of hot mix plants and stone crushers in Delhi-NCR till November 17 in view of a likely increase in pollution levels during the festive season. It also asked the governments of Punjab and Haryana to take immediate stringent actions to curb stubble burning and authorities in Delhi-NCR to strictly check biomass burning.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-remains-very-poor-915008.html

Then turn engine off, Delhi urges motorists amid heavy pollution||Choking back exhaust fumes, 22-year-old Rihana Saif stands at a traffic signal in India's capital New Delhi, holding a sign mounted on a bamboo stick imploring motorists to turn their engines off. The city has been facing one of its worst spells of air pollution in years, caused by a combination of traffic, factories, construction dust and the widespread burning of agricultural waste in neighbouring states. Doctors and environmentalists also say the smog is exacerbating the health effects of a third wave of coronavirus infections. "Sometimes it feels like my eyes are burning, standing in the pollution for so long," Saif said, barely audible over the roar of traffic. Saif is one of more than two thousand people in the city's Civil Defence force, which supports the capital's frontline emergency services, deployed to the "red light on, vehicle off" scheme. Paid a monthly salary of around $300, they have also been deployed in coronavirus quarantine zones in recent months. Introduced in October, the Delhi government this week extended the initiative to the end of the month, with Saturday's Diwali festival likely to lead to a further surge in pollution. Residents are expected to set off huge amounts of firecrackers, despite a ban on their sale in the region surrounding the capital. Authorities have also experimented with "smog guns" that mist the air, in an attempt to tamp down clouds of toxic dust. But pollution in some areas of the capital is still more than eight times the World Health Organization's permitted limit. The Delhi government has said the traffic campaign is to raise awareness about pollution, and turning off engines is voluntary. Many motorists leave their engines idling, shaking their heads in disbelief when asked if they think the scheme will help. "It's a waste of public money," said 62-year-old N.S. Rathur, a thin rag covering his mouth as he waited on his motorcycle. "There's no difference at all."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/red-light-then-turn-engine-off-delhi-urges-motorists-amid-heavy-pollution-915024.html
13-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi records its highest Covid-19 deaths, hospitals swamped||Delhi's Covid-19 deaths rose by a record high on Thursday and it also reported the most number of infections in India, an increase attributed to the city's toxic air and a lack of physical distancing in public places around a major festival. While daily case additions have come down significantly in the country as a whole since a mid-September peak, the capital city of 20 million people is going through its worst phase in the pandemic. Delhi late on Thursday reported 104 new deaths and 7,053 new infections. Data from the federal health ministry early on Friday showed that infections in the country rose by 44,789 in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 8.73 million, only behind the US tally. India's deaths increased by 547 to 128,668. As Delhi's cases rise in its third-wave of infections, many hospitals have already run out of intensive care beds and even normal Covid-19 beds are getting occupied fast. On the request of the local government, the Delhi High Court on Thursday ordered of the city's private hospitals to reserve 80% of their critical-care beds for patients infected by the novel coronavirus. The federal government has asked Delhi to prepare resources to handle cases of up to 15,000 a day during the winter season, when pollution peaks in the city and respiratory issues jump. The air is only likely to worsen on the weekend due to thousands of firecrackers ignited during the Hindu festival of lights, Diwali. Its residents have already swarmed markets to buy gifts for family and friends. Doctors say PM2.5 pollutants, fine particles found in high concentration in Delhi's air, can break the nasal passage barrier, weaken the inner lining of lungs and facilitate the spread of coronavirus infection. "Painful," tweeted Arvinder Singh Soin, a surgeon in a top hospital near Delhi, referring to Delhi hospitals getting flooded with Covid-19 patients. "And the festive surge has only just begun."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-records-its-highest-covid-19-deaths-hospitals-swamped-915029.html

Terming pollution as the "biggest reason" behind the spike in Covid-19 cases in Delhi, the chief minister said the situation was under control in the city till October 20. "Covid-19 cases have been increasing for the last few days. I am also concerned about it. We have been taking all appropriate measures to control it. We are considering taking more steps next week. I think the situation should come under control in seven to 10 days and the cases should start decreasing," he said at a press conference. Delhi recorded 7,053 fresh Covid-19 cases in a day, taking the infection tally in the national capital to over 4.67 lakh on Thursday, while 104 more fatalities in a same period, the highest in over five months, pushed the death toll to 7,332, authorities said. The national capital had recorded its highest single-day spike of 8,593 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, while 85 deaths linked to the disease were recorded on that day. As many as 976 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in the national capital in 16 days, with experts attributing it to a sudden surge in cases, deteriorating air quality, laxity by people in adhering to safety norms, among other factors. Coronavirus cases in Delhi have registered a sudden spike since October 28 when the daily infection breached the 5,000-mark for the first time and it crossed the 8,000-mark on Thursday, also for the first time. Citing a report, Kejriwal said the anti-stubble solution prepared by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, decomposed 70 to 95 per cent of crop residue in 24 villages in Delhi. The Delhi government will submit the report along with a petition to the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region (NCR) and Adjoining Areas, and urge it to issue directions to all state governments to implement it. IARI scientists say Pusa bio-decomposer can turn crop residue into manure in 15 to 20 days and therefore, can prevent stubble burning. "The solution was sprayed free of cost in 2,000 acres of non-basmati rice fields starting October 13. We have got an assessment report from 24 villages. The results are impressive," he said. "We have found a solution to the problem of stubble burning, but will state governments implement it?" he posed. This is a "very easy and cost-effective" solution. Now, no government can say there is no alternative to the problem. The report says it just costs Rs 30 per acre, which can be given out of a state's own budget, Kejriwal said. The chief minister said the entire north India reels under the adverse effect of stubble burning in October and November every year. "It has been happening for the last 10 to 12 years, but no concrete step had been taken to find a solution to the problem," he said. "I hope this is the last year when farmers and people of these states have to suffer due to stubble burning," Kejriwal added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/covid-19-situation-in-delhi-should-come-under-control-in-7-10-days-arvind-kejriwal-915032.html
13-11-2020||North and Central||Pakistan violates ceasefire along LoC in Kashmir||Pakistan Army resorted to unprovoked firing and shelling along the Line of Control (LoC) in Gurez and Tangdhar sectors of north Kashmir’s Bandipora and Kuwara district, respectively on Friday. Reports said Pakistan troops violated ceasefire along the LoC this afternoon, triggering panic in Izmerg and Bagtore areas of the Gurez sector. “The cross-border shelling was so intense that the people in far off villages were also hearing the sound of explosions,” locals said. A defence spokesperson said that the Indian Army gave a ‘befitting’ reply to the fire. He said that a few shells fell in the residential areas, but there was no loss of life or injury. In another incident, Pakistan Army resorted to unprovoked firing and shelling along the LoC in Tangdhar sector. A police official said that Pakistan initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation by firing with small arms and shelling mortars along LoC in Dhard area. He said the residents are being evacuated to safer places. The shopkeepers in Tangdhar market have also closed their shops and moved to safer places, reports said. The shelling was going on from both the sides when last reports came in. Pakistan has been targeting the forward areas and border hamlets along the LoC in J&K frequently. In the first eight months of this year, more than 3,000 ceasefire violations by Pakistan have been reported, the most in 17 years. Over 3,200 ceasefire violations by Pakistan troops were recorded in 2019. The Indian Army maintains that Pakistani troops have been frequently violating the ceasefire by resorting to heavy shelling and firing to help the militants to infiltrate. There is a 198-km International Border and over 510 km of LoC with Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pakistan-violates-ceasefire-along-loc-in-kashmir-915036.html

Officials said while ensuring normalcy in the Valley, the government is also tightening the security grid in the wake of heightened militant attacks and fresh infiltration attempts. The DDC polls mark the Centre’s first attempt at restoring democratic processes in the region, following the revocation of its special status and bifurcation in August 2019. The elections are held at a time when Kashmir continues to be in grips of uncertainty. “Intelligence inputs indicate the presence of militants who are likely to disrupt the polls. We are keeping a close watch at any suspicious movement,” a senior police officer familiar with the development told DH, adding that candidates who are contesting these polls are being moved to safer locations. J&K Director General Police (DGP) Dilbagh Singh, who chaired a meeting of senior officers on Thursday evening, finalised security plan for the maiden DDC polls along with bye-elections for panchayats and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). He directed the officers to ensure night patrolling in hyper-sensitive areas and the Line of Control (LoC) to thwart any possibility of militant attacks before or during the polls. A police spokesperson said the DGP stressed upon the officers to put all the necessary security measures in place to ensure the conduct of the upcoming polls in a free, fair and peaceful manner. The DGP stressed the personnel on the ground should be briefed regularly and the synergy at the grass-root level has to be at best for achieving better results, he said. The police chief also directed night patrolling in hypersensitive and border areas to avert any subversive design and also emphasized the need to keep a close watch on the subversive elements.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/security-heightened-in-kashmir-ahead-of-first-ever-ddc-polls-915038.html

Two Congress leaders participated in a meeting of the alliance at PDP president Mehbooba Mufti's 'Fairview' residence at Gupkar here. Mufti is also the vice chairman of the alliance, led by National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah. "We stand by the alliance," Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Monga told reporters outside Mufti's residence. Asked whether there were any differences between the alliance partners, Monga said, "There is no disagreement and a healthy discussion took place." After the meeting at Mufti's residence, the PAGD leaders will meet again at NC headquarters 'Nawa-i-Subah' later in the day. NC provincial president, Kashmir, Nasir Aslam Wani, said the Congress has assured it will be part of the alliance and part of the seat-sharing arrangement for the DDC elections. "The Congress has joined the alliance. Their leader has spoken to (Farooq) Abdullah. Two senior leaders joined the meeting also. They have assured that they will be part of the alliance and part of the DDC elections (seat-sharing arrangement) also," Wani said. He said the alliance "will try to complete the seat-sharing list today only". The meeting was called to discuss the DDC elections and to finalise the list of candidates to contest in the rest of the eight-phased polls. "We discussed the DDC elections and are finalising the candidates. The meeting will reconvene at 'Nawa-i-Subah'. This is not only about (seat) sharing or numbers, but a question of giving a message," NC leader and Member of Parliament from south Kashmir's Anantnag, Justice (retd) Hasnain Masoodi said. The PAGD on Thursday announced the seat-sharing list for the first phase of the polls. The NC is contesting on the majority of the 27 seats in the Kashmir Valley, with the party putting up its candidates on 21 seats.

13-11-2020||North and Central||To deal with 'Veerus', UP to lock stairs of water tanks||In Ramesh Sippy's Bollywood blockbuster 'Sholay', an inebriated Veeru (Dharmendra) had climbed atop a water tank and threatened to jump unless the 'mausi' (Leela Mishra) agreed to let her niece 'Basanti' (Hema Malini) marry him. In the film, 'Veeru' had come down only after the 'mausi' had relented. The Uttar Pradesh government, however, has devised another way to tackle the 'Veerus', who often climbed atop the water tanks and threatened to jump unless their demands, which were usually concerned with inaction by the police or civic authorities, were met. Instead of giving in to their demands, the state government has ordered to either demolish the unused stairs leading to the water tanks or lock them so that no one could climb atop the tanks. In a communique to the district police and civil authorities, the state government also directed the officials to demolish the water tanks which were not in use anymore. ''It is seen that some people often climb atop the water tanks as a mark of protest and threaten to jump.....it is not proper,'' the letter said. The new measures came in the wake of several such incidents in the past few days in different parts of the state. A lawyer and his family members had recently climbed atop a water tank in Prayagraj demanding action against some people who had allegedly grabbed his ancestral land in the village. They came down after 60 hours following much persuasion. Similarly, one Vijay Rawat, a resident of the state capital of Lucknow, had also, a few days back, climbed atop a water tank in protest against the alleged failure of the police to act against a muscleman, who had evicted him from his house.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/to-deal-with-veerus-up-to-lock-stairs-of-water-tanks-915104.html

Three Indian Army soldiers have been killed in action and three soldiers injured,” Col Kalia said. Two among slain soldiers were identified as Naik Satai Bhushan Rameshra from Nagpur, Maharashtra and Sepoy Jondhale Rushikesh Ramachandra from Kolhapur, Maharashtra. A Border Security Forces (BSF) sub-inspector and six civilians were also killed in Pakistani action while five security forces personnel and eight civilians were injured, officials said. The slain BSF sub-inspector identified as Rakesh Doval, 39, deployed at the force’s artillery battery was killed in Haji Peer sector. Among the dead civilians were a woman and a seven-year-old boy. Reports said the cross-LoC shelling triggered panic along the LoC hamlets with residents seen rushing to safer places. The escalation in tensions came only five days after five Indian soldiers and three militants were killed in an exchange along the LoC. Gul Zaman, a resident of Uri told DH over the phone that this was one of the deadliest shelling in many years in the area. “Some shells hit the residential houses and people are scared as mortars and shells are landing in the residential areas,” he said and added ambulances were seen rushing towards the villages on LoC to ferry injured civilians. SSP Baramulla, Abdul Qayoom said that shelling was going on in some areas of Uri till late in the evening. Earlier Col Kalia said suspicious movement was observed by the Army at the forward posts along the LoC in Keran sector (in north Kashmir’s Kupwara district). “The suspected infiltration bid was foiled by alert troops,” he said. “They (Pakistan army) fired mortars and other weapons. Befitting response is being given,” he said. A defence official in Jammu said Pakistani troops also violated ceasefire along the LoC in Poonch district twice.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/multiple-ceasefire-violations-by-pakistan-along-loc-5-security-forces-personnel-among-11-killed-915108.html

13-11-2020||North and Central||PM Modi's dream to make Ayodhya 'Vedic Ramayana City': UP CM Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream to development Ayodhaya as "Vedic Ramayana City" and it should be the most beautiful city. "Our generation is not only fortunate to see the start of the construction of a Ram temple here but we also attended the historic event. In the struggle of 500 years, many saints passed away with a dream to see the start of construction. I thank PM Modi who is the one who implemented the ideology of Ram Rajya," Adityanath said while addressing the fourth 'Deepotsav', an event to mark Diwali here. The prime minister had performed the 'bhoomi pujan' of a Supreme Court-mandated Ram temple in Ayodhya on August 5 this year, bringing to fruition the BJP's 'mandir' movement that defined its politics for three decades and took it to the heights of power. The chief minister said when he used to come here for development work, those who met him only used to say, "Yogiji Ram mandir nirman karwaiye (Yogiji get the construction of Ram temple done)." "I used to only ask them to trust Modiji," he added. "It is the dream of PM Modi to develop Ayodhya as Vedic Ramayana City and it should be the most beautiful. We are here to seek support of you all as to how it can be developed that it has glimpse of a Vedic city," the chief minister said. "He (PM) himself came for starting that work of construction of Ram temple following Covid-19 protocol and gave strength to the concept of Ram Rajya, in which there is no discrimination on the bases of caste, creed, religion, language, region area etc. There is honour and security for all. He gave schemes such as Ayushman Bharat, free cylinders, power connection, toilets for the poor and showed the way for development," Adityanath added. The chief minister said there would have been a grand 'Deepotsav' event "through which all Indians worldwide are connected" had there be no Covid-19. "Countries like Korea, Thailand, Nepal, Japan, Fiji had connections to Ayodhya earlier as well but the event showed a modern way to them to relate with the city," he said. Hailing the prime minister for India's fight against the coronavirus, the chief minister said, "We are fighting strongly under his (PM's) leadership and we will defeat the virus." Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel, Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, BJP state president Swatantra Dev Singh and a number of saints and ministers were present on the occasion. In her speech, the Governor said Ram and Ramrajya were "inseparable parts of the Indian culture" and spoke at length about the ideals of the Maryada Purushottam. She advised the people not to lower their guards in their fight against the pandemic till it was finished.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pm-modis-dream-to-make-ayodhya-vedic-ramayana-city-up-cm-adityanath-915155.html
13-11-2020||North and Central||Talks between agitating Punjab farmers, ministers end inconclusively||The talks between farmers from Punjab and the Modi government to end their one-and-a-half month agitation over agriculture sector reforms were inconclusive on Friday. After a seven-hour meeting with Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal, representatives of 30 farmers’ organisations from Punjab said the would continue their agitation over the demands to revoke the three farm sector laws passed by Parliament and shelve the amendments to the Electricity Act. “The talks have not collapsed yet. They have begun on a positive note. But our movement against the three central laws would continue,” Abhimanyu Kohar, spokesperson of the Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh said. All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee said that leaders of the 30 farmers’ organisations would meet in Chandigarh on November 18 to decide on the next course of action. The farmer leaders argue that the new laws will dilute the MSP regime, benefit corporates more than small farmers, and end the APMC markets. They are also protesting the Electricity Bill, 2020, which could end power subsidies for farmers. At the outset, Tomar told the farmer leaders that the government had no plans to scrap the MSP regime and APMC markets would continue to function. The farm sector reforms would not only provide freedom of choice to farmers to sell their produce at remunerative price and also safeguard farmers’ interests, he said. “The talks were held in a cordial atmosphere and both sides agreed to continue to hold further discussions,” an Agriculture Ministry statement said. Farmers’ agitation in Punjab have blocked railway traffic, starving thermal power plants of coal and the state of essential supplies, fertilisers, and jute bags for storing paddy that has been harvested in the fields. Railway Board Chairman V K Yadav also briefed the meeting railway operations that had taken a hit due to the farmers’ agitation in Punjab and urged them to end the rail roko. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh welcomed the talks of the farmer leaders with the union ministers. Farmers’ organisations from across the country are also planning a massive protest in the national capital on November 26-27 to demand the roll back of farm sector reforms.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/talks-between-agitating-punjab-farmers-ministers-end-inconclusively-915194.html

Singh's condition is stated to be stable and he is being attended to by his family members, they said. Police received information at South Rohini police station on Friday that a man had tried to self-immolate at a prominent mall in the area. The victim, Bhim Singh, a resident of Prahladpur village, was rushed to BSA hospital for treatment after the incident, police said. Police reached the hospital and recorded Singh's statement in front of a doctor and his wife in which he said he had purchased a mobile phone for Rs 16,000 around a month back from a store near Prahladpur, a senior police officer said. Singh said he had gifted the phone to his niece for her online classes. However, the phone started giving problems and did not work properly, a senior police officer said. He then approached the company's service centre for the phone's replacement on November 6 but the service centre declined his request citing company policy. Singh kept approaching the company regarding the issue, but nothing happened, the officer said. “On Friday morning, he decided that if his request was not addressed, he will set himself ablaze. He reached the service centre and urged the staff which again declined his request citing company policy. Thereafter, he set himself on fire by spraying petrol,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Rohini) P K Mishra said. According to police, he went to the parking area, took a bottle from his scooter, filled it with petrol and decided to kill himself by setting himself on fire.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/man-sets-himself-ablaze-after-mobile-firms-service-centre-refuses-to-replace-faulty-handset-915211.html
13-11-2020||North and Central||Ayodhya celebrates Ram's homecoming, lakhs of diyas light up Saryu riverbank||The Uttar Pradesh government on Friday went all out in marking the homecoming of Lord Ram to this holy town – the mythical event in 'treta yug' on which the festival of Diwali is based. Along the way, the organisers broke a world record. As dusk fell, volunteers lit up over six lakh earthen lamps lined up on the Saryu riverbank. A team from the Guinness World Records was present to see if it made it to their book. Hours later, team leader Nishchal Barot gave the final count as 6,06,569 `diyas’, telling PTI that it was “largest display of oil lamps” in the world. An organiser said about 8,000 volunteers, drawn from a local college and NGOs, were involved in the feat. The “Deepotsav” included the reenactment of the arrival of God Ram and Goddess Sita to Ayodhya on their 'pushpak viman', a laser and sound show and cultural programmes. Actors representing the deities of Ram, Sita and Lakshman descended in a helicopter that sprinkled rose petals – a modern take on the ‘pushpak viman’ that brought Lord Ram back home after 14 years in exile. The deities were received by Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. This was the fourth annual Ayodhya Deepotsav, and the first since the ‘bhoomi pujan’ in August for a Ram temple in the city. Its construction has begun following last year’s Supreme Court verdict that settled the temple-mosque land dispute. The CM and the Governor visited the Ram Mandir site along with other UP and some bureaucrats. Adityanath gave Prime Minister Narendra Modi the credit for the just-begun construction of the Ram Mandir. "Our generation is not only fortunate to see the start of construction of a Ram temple here but we also attended the historic event,” he said, adding that generations of seers died without the dream being realised. “I thank PM Modi, who is the one who implemented the ideology of Ram Rajya," Adityanath said in his speech to about 1,000 guests at the Ram Katha Park. With COVID-19 protocols in place, the event was not open to the public. He said when people in Ayodhya used to ask him about the construction of the temple, he would just tell them to trust Modi. He said it is Modi’s dream to develop Ayodhya as the “Vedic Ramayana city”. The celebrations began in the afternoon with a “coronation procession” for Lord Ram starting from Saket College for the riverbank five kilometers away. Eleven tableaux, built around themes from the Ramayana, participated. In the evening, 11,000 earthen lamps lit up the Ram temple site. On the banks of the Saryu bank, the chief minister performed an ‘aarti’. He then lit a 'diya' at Ram ki Paidi. This was immediately followed by volunteers lighting up earthen lamps laid out on the riverbank, aiming to create a new Guinness World Record by lighting at least 5.51 lakh `diyas’. The final count was 6,06,569 ‘diyas’, according to a representative of the Guinness World Records, a private company which publishes a book on records every year. Last year, the organisers lit about 4,10,000 ‘diyas’, the then new record. Adityanath on Friday said the target next year should be 7.51 lakh. Eight teams of folk dancers were invited to perform at the Deepotsav. "We did rehearsals for over two weeks before coming to Ayodhya," said Vishal, a member of a troupe from Jhansi. Anuradha, a folk dancer from Mathura, said, “We are very excited that we are performing on the streets of Ayodhya, the city of Lord Ram.” Before the event, state government officials had listed out development projects for Ayodhya – some of them new, but many already in the pipeline. These include an international airport and widening of roads to other cities. The authorities plan to expand the Ram Katha Park, build a Ramlila Centre and carry out beautification of Ram ki Paidi. Also planned are a modern bus stand, a sewage treatment plant and a multi-level parking lot.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ayodhya-celebrates-rams-homecoming-lakhs-of-diyas-light-up-saryu-riverbank-915232.html

Four security forces personnel were among 10 people killed in multiple ceasefire violations by Pakistani troops along the Line of Control (LoC) from Gurez to Uri sectors of Jammu and Kashmir on Friday, officials said. Three Army personnel, a BSF sub-inspector and six civilians were killed in Pakistani action while four security forces personnel and eight civilians were injured. Expressing grief and sorrow over the killings, senior National Conference (NC) leaders Choudhary Muhammad Ramzan, Nazir Gurezi, Sajjad Uri, Qaiser Jamsheeed Lone and Qafilul Rehman, in a joint statement, said whenever borders are lit up and tensions soar between the two countries, it is the people living along the LoC and the border who bear the brunt. “It is really sad to witness innocent lives being devoured like this. We express solidarity with the bereaved families of civilians and soldiers and call upon both countries to immediately stop cross border shelling. The persistent lighting up of borders has made the lives of people no less than a hell,” the statement said. “People living along borders are fighting a battle of life and death. We, therefore, call for an immediate cessation of shelling on the borders. We also urge the government to provide effective healthcare to the injured,” it said. Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Conference (JKPC) chairman Sajad Lone also condemned the shelling, saying it was “modern-day barbarism”. “Shelling yet again claims innocent lives in Uri, Tangdar and Poonch. No words r enough to condemn this modern day barbarism. Hope the administration of the day provides relief to the affected families. My prayers with the hapless inhabitants of these areas. May sanity prevail (sic),” he tweeted. JKPC leader Raja Aijaz Ali termed the flare-up as highly unfortunate and deplorable. “Targeting the old, women and children is not only uncivilised but also inhumane and barbaric. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims and injured. We pray for peace to the departed souls and swift recovery of the injured,” he said. He also asked the administration to immediately sanction funds for the construction of bunkers for residents living across the LoC in Uri, Poonch and Gurez.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/nc-jkpc-condole-casualties-along-loc-in-jk-call-for-relief-to-injured-915245.html
13-11-2020||Opinion||Pfizer's early results bode well for a Covid-19 vaccine approval this year||After a week during which the US had nearly a million new Covid-19 cases, pharmaceutical company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced on Monday that a preliminary analysis suggests their experimental vaccine is more than 90 per cent effective at preventing the disease. The welcome news signifies that efforts to slow the worst pandemic in more than a century might finally be bearing fruit. The news was reported following an early look at data on 94 cases from Pfizer’s phase III clinical trial, which has so far enrolled nearly 44,000 people. Questions remain about how long protection lasts and whether the vaccine prevents severe disease in the elderly and other vulnerable populations. Still, the preliminary results—announced in a press release—“are extremely encouraging,” says Paul Offit, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “It means that the vaccine is likely to be very effective as we look at more participants in the trial, moving forward.” Developing a new vaccine ordinarily takes years. But Pfizer’s candidate began clinical testing only months after scientists published the genome sequence for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. Given in two doses three weeks apart, the vaccine contains a genetic blueprint, known as mRNA, for the virus’s “spike” protein. The infusion of viral mRNA triggers human cells to make and display the spike, prompting an immune reaction against future infection. Although some laboratories have created such gene-based vaccines for other human illnesses, none has been commercialized in the US. Pfizer is one of four US companies with vaccines against Covid-19 that are now in phase III clinical trials in the nation; a fifth company, Novavax, plans to start its phase III trial later this month. Three firms—Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca—have received funding to develop their interventions from Operation Warp Speed, a federal program aiming to begin mass inoculations against Covid-19 in the US by early next year. (Operation Warp Speed has promised $1.95 billion for manufacturing and distributing Pfizer’s vaccine, but it has not supported its development.) The three companies’ vaccines also deliver spike protein genetic material, albeit using different strategies. And Pfizer’s new results “give us reason to be optimistic for all of them,” says Larry Corey, a virologist at the Covid-19 Prevention Network, which is helping to coordinate Operation Warp Speed’s clinical trials. Offit concurs, adding that while the genetics-based approach appeared promising in animals, Pfizer’s efficacy data provide the first solid and eagerly awaited evidence that it can also succeed in people. The company had initially planned to look at the data when the combined number of Covid-19 cases in the placebo (control) and vaccinated groups reached 32. If, at that point, the vaccine was 80 percent protective or better—meaning that there were five times more sick people among the control group than there were in the vaccinated one—then an independent panel of reviewers could declare it successful. Pfizer and the Food and Drug Administration later changed course and scheduled a data readout once the total number of cases reached 62. But with the pandemic raging, there were 94 cases to assess by the time the review actually took place. The vaccine appears to be well tolerated so far. But to comply with FDA requirements, trial investigators still need to monitor side effects for an average of two months after participants get a second dose. Bill Gruber, Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, predicts the company will wrap up that safety evaluation by next week. If all goes well, the company will apply for an emergency use authorization (EUA) to start making the intervention publicly available to a limited group—most likely including first responders and people at high risk of severe disease—by mid-December, Gruber says. That date “is probably the earliest it would be granted,” he adds. Pfizer plans to continue the trial until a final analysis is conducted at 164 cases—which Gruber predicts will be reached by the end of the month—so that investigators can assess additional end points. The company’s recent announcement concerns the level of protection achieved seven days after the second dose (and 28 days after the first). Trial investigators will now extend their review to look for protection two weeks after the second dose is administered, thus giving infected individuals more time to become symptomatic. Even if the FDA grants an EUA, Pfizer will follow subjects for two years from the start of the trial to assess whether the vaccine has any rare side effects, how long its protection lasts and whether it protects against severe disease. Gruber acknowledges that the company would “feel an ethical responsibility” to vaccinate the control subjects, even though doing so would compromise the trial’s ability to monitor efficacy. “My hope is that participants will see the advantage of remaining in the trial,” he says. “We have to navigate with regulatory authorities to navigate that path.” One approach under discussion would be to give everyone in the control group the vaccine and give the vaccinated people a placebo. “That way, everyone is protected, and you can follow them for a year or two. And if the vaccine is safe and durable for an extra year, there would be little [risk of infection] in the second year for those who got it a long time ago,” Corey says. “That’s a strategy we’ve been thinking about, and we hope that people in the trial will consider it.” For now, experts eager to see Pfizer's clinical trial data will have to wait until they are published. Company representatives claim that up to 42 percent of the trial participants are Asian, Black, Latinx, or Native American—and that up to 45 percent of all the participants are between 56 and 85 years old. “But what I want to know is: How many cases are over 65—and especially over 70 years old?” Offit says. “A 56-year-old person is not nearly as likely to die of Covid-19 as a someone over 70, and that’s an example of why we need to see the data. This is basically science by press release at this point, which is always a little frustrating.” Pfizer’s plant in Kalamazoo, Mich., is now ramping up manufacturing toward a goal of supplying 50 million vaccine doses—enough for 25 million people—in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. Corey acknowledges that the first Covid-19 vaccines out of the gate may not be the best, however. And Pfizer’s mRNA candidate comes with several key disadvantages: it requires two doses, and it has to be stored at temperatures below –70 degrees Celsius. The cold-temperature restriction could be problematic, especially in low- and middle-income countries. By contrast, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine requires only one dose and does not need subzero storage. A phase III clinical trial for that intervention is currently underway. Still, the apparent success of Pfizer’s vaccine “increases our optimism that the others will work as well,” says Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and a co-developer of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. “No single vaccine can supply the global market. We are going to need several to put this pandemic behind us.” Read more about the coronavirus outbreak from Scientific American here.

13-11-2020||Opinion||How Pfizer plans to distribute its Covid-19 vaccine||For months, scientists and public health experts have been saying the most crucial part of defusing the Covid-19 pandemic will be developing a safe and effective vaccine. So it was cause for celebration this week when Pfizer announced that an early analysis showed its vaccine candidate was more than 90% effective. Now the drugmaker, the government and the public health community face a new challenge: quickly making millions of doses of the vaccine and getting them to the hospitals, clinics and pharmacies where they will be injected, two separate times, into people’s arms. If Pfizer receives authorization for its vaccine from the Food and Drug Administration in the coming weeks, as expected, the company in theory could vaccinate millions of Americans by the end of the year, taking advantage of months of planning and decades of experience. “I am very confident. I live and breathe this,” Tanya Alcorn, a Pfizer executive overseeing the supply chain for the vaccine, said in an interview Wednesday. “We have developed a system that does not waste any precious vaccine.” But Pfizer — like other manufacturers that may soon be authorized to roll out their vaccines — does not fully control its own destiny. The effort will hinge on collaboration among a network of companies, federal and state agencies, and on-the-ground health workers in the midst of a pandemic that is spreading faster than ever through the United States. Before Pfizer can begin shipping its vaccine, federal and state governments must tell it where to send how many doses. McKesson, a major medical supplier, will have to provide hospitals and other distribution sites with the syringes, needles and other supplies necessary to administer the vaccine. Employees at those locations will need to be trained to store and administer the vaccine. They will also have to ensure that, four weeks after people receive the first dose of the vaccine, they return for a second dose. And millions of Americans must be persuaded to get the shots in the first place. “We have a lot of confusion at the state and the local health departments level and a lot of concern about the nitty-gritty of deployment,” said Dr. Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, “which places, where to vaccinate, how to get the vaccine there, how to identify people in various risk groups, how to document, how to call back people for the second dose.” Even in normal times, mass vaccination campaigns involve many moving parts within a vast network of suppliers, transporters and middlemen. The particulars of Pfizer’s vaccine will make this effort even more complex. The vaccine, developed with the German company BioNTech, has to be stored at around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit) until shortly before it is injected. That is about the temperature of the South Pole on a winter day and colder than any of the other leading vaccines in development. Pending results from other front-runners in the vaccine race could change the stakes. Moderna Therapeutics said Wednesday that it had seen enough COVID-19 cases in its late-stage study to do an early analysis of its vaccine, which uses the same “messenger RNA” technology that Pfizer’s does. The technology has never produced an approved vaccine. Nine other candidates are also in the final stage of testing. If any of those win approval from the FDA, that will reduce the importance of Pfizer’s vaccine but also introduce new questions, such as which hospitals and people get the different vaccines. For now, though, Pfizer is in the spotlight. If an analysis planned for next week confirms the vaccine’s safety, the company is likely to ask the FDA this month for emergency authorization to distribute its vaccine. In that case, limited doses will most likely be shipped to large hospitals and pharmacies to be provided to health care workers and other vulnerable groups. But the specifics of how that will work are hazy at best. Pfizer does not yet know where the government wants the vaccine sent or who will be first in line to receive it, said Alcorn, the supply chain executive. “We’re working very closely, in the US, in particular, with Operation Warp Speed to identify those distribution points,” Alcorn said, referring to the federal initiative to produce and distribute Covid-19 vaccines. “We don’t have them today.” Pfizer is making the vaccine at facilities in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and Puurs, Belgium. The doses distributed in the United States will mostly come from Kalamazoo. In Kalamazoo, vaccines will go into vials (five doses per vial). Vials will go into trays (195 vials per tray). Trays will go into specially designed cooler-type boxes (up to five trays per box). Pfizer plans to have about 100,000 of the coolers by the end of this month and more than double that total by March. The reusable boxes, each toting between 1,000 and 5,000 doses and stuffed with dry ice, are equipped with GPS-enabled sensors. Pfizer employees will be able to monitor the boxes’ locations and temperatures as FedEx and UPS transport them to hospitals and clinics nationwide. The boxes “will have eyes on them at all times,” Alcorn said. Representatives of UPS and FedEx said they had been planning to play a major role in distributing vaccines and were ready to go. Once the Pfizer coolers reach their destinations, hospitals or pharmacies will have a few choices of how to store the vaccine. The easiest option is using ultracold freezers, but not many sites have them. Otherwise, the facilities can stash the trays in conventional freezers for up to five days. Or they can keep the vials in the cooler for up to 15 days, so long as they replenish the dry ice and don’t open it more than twice a day. Then there is the thorny question of who will receive vaccines first. That will be up to state governments. Pfizer has said it expects to be able to produce 50 million doses this year. The chief executives of Pfizer and BioNTech have suggested that half of those may go to the United States. Since each person needs two doses, about 12.5 million Americans could be vaccinated. “If you’re talking about 12.5 million people, you’re going to have to make some very tough-minded decisions about who this goes to,” said J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research firm. “It’s a pretty small number of doses that are going to be distributed.” One of the biggest early challenges may be distributing the vaccine in rural areas, which may not be able to administer doses quickly enough before they go bad. It isn’t clear how states with large rural populations are going to deal with this. Industry executives acknowledge another potential hurdle: Will Americans resist the vaccine? The country has long had a noisy minority of people who oppose vaccinations. Safety concerns are only likely to be heightened by the speed with which the coronavirus vaccines have been produced. “The challenge, of course, that’s out there is, are people going to go get vaccinated?” Alcorn said. “It would be a shame that we did all this work, and then we don’t have the public trusting that there’s a safe vaccine.” For all the difficulties of making and distributing the vaccine, public health experts said the hardest part of the process could soon be complete. Having devised and tested an apparently effective vaccine, figuring out the logistics is more about applying existing know-how, said Omer of the Yale Institute for Global Health. “The good news,” he said, “is that these are not insurmountable problems.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/how-pfizer-plans-to-distribute-its-covid-19-vaccine-914946.html
13-11-2020||Opinion||Why change of guard in Seychelles matters||Seychelles, located in the Western Indian Ocean and a former British colony, is known as an attractive tourist destination. It is also known as a tax haven. The island nation has one of the highest per capita incomes in Africa but inequality is also very high. Lately, Seychelles has shot to prominence due to the threat posed by the effects of climate change and the escalating geopolitical rivalries in the Indian Ocean. With a population of just about 95,000, Seychelles possesses outsized geostrategic importance. It is located at the crossroads of Africa, the Middle East, and India. As the geopolitics in the Indian Ocean heats up, the importance of smaller yet geostrategically-located island nations like Seychelles, Maldives, Mauritius, and Sri Lanka is growing. Amongst these island nations, Seychelles has been playing the geopolitical game quite smartly and has managed to keep competing powers on their toes.  Seychelles has traditionally been considered close to India. India has covertly helped the Seychellois regime in the early 1980s to thwart the attempts of destabilisation and regime change. Recently, at the peak of the pandemic, as part of Mission Sagar, India had dispatched much-needed food and medical assistance to several Indian Ocean island nations, including Seychelles. China’s growing interest As China expands its footprint in the Indian Ocean, the role and importance of Seychelles have gone up. Seychelles’ location is crucial in the Chinese military and economic strategy towards the Indian Ocean. With the opening up of the military base at Djibouti and consequently growing military presence, China is signalling its strategic willingness to be a major player in the regional security affairs in this critical maritime space.           In this decade, Seychelles has emerged as one of the major attractions for Chinese tourists. As Bertil Lintner writes, the Chinese regime is known to use tourism as a political weapon and has punished countries like the Philippines and Palau when their behaviour was not to the liking of China. However, for now, Seychelles has been receiving a large number of Chinese tourists. From just about 500 tourists in 2011, the number of Chinese tourists has gone up to more than 15,000 in 2016.  Furthermore, in the last few years, China has taken steps to deepen defence and security co-operation with Seychelles. China has trained the military units of Seychelles’ armed forces as well as gifted two light aircraft and two naval ships. China has dispatched senior figures of Chinese armed forces and the Central Military Commission to pay a visit to Seychelles. In the past, China had financed the building of Seychelles’ parliament as well.     Indian ties with Seychelles   However, as the Chinese interest in this tiny island nation began to grow, India has been taking steps to ensure that its maritime primacy in the region stays intact. India has done hydrographic surveys for Seychelles. Moreover, it has gifted two patrol boats (in 2005 and in 2014), two maritime surveillance aircraft (in 2013 and in 2018) and Fast Interceptor Boat (in 2016) for coastal security. India has also established six coastal radar stations in Seychelles. It is part of the network of coastal surveillance radar stations built by India in the Indian Ocean island nations.   However, India has faced significant challenges in building military facilities on the Assumption Island in Seychelles. In January 2018, India and Seychelles had signed an agreement, valid for 20 years, for building an airstrip and a naval jetty on the Assumption Island. It was an updated version of a previous agreement signed in 2015. However, amidst the strong protests from Opposition parties, it was clear that the Seychellois parliament would not ratify the agreement. In June 2018, while President Faure was on a visit to India, New Delhi tried to sweeten the deal by offering a $100 million credit line for boosting up the defence capabilities of the tiny nation.   It is significant to note that, Wavel Ramkawalan, who was then the leader of the Opposition, was quite vocal against the Indian military facilities. It will be interesting now to watch how his government considers this question of India-built military facilities. Perhaps, a change of government may present new opportunities to revive this agreement and take it to its logical conclusion. The role of Indian diplomacy will be crucial in this endeavour.  A base in Seychelles will certainly help India to acquire a permanent foothold in the Western Indian Ocean near some of the busiest shipping lanes of the world. Meanwhile, India is building military facilities in neighbouring Mauritius’ Agalega islands and is steadily increasing its naval presence in the Western Indian Ocean.  Just like India in 2018, China had made efforts to build a military base in Seychelles in 2011. However, so far, attempts by both countries have proven equally futile. Seychelles has been deftly playing the geopolitical game without compromising what it perceives as its national interests and sovereignty.  The example of Seychelles shows the complicated domestic political fallout of the foreign and defence policy decisions of the incumbent governments. It has happened before, in cases of the Maldives and in Sri Lanka. As of now, by reneging on the agreement, Seychelles has managed to avoid the deepening of the domestic fault lines. However, as the geopolitical rivalries heat up in and around Seychelles, it will be interesting to see how the newly-elected government of Wavel Ramkalawan navigates the turbulent waters of domestic politics and foreign policy.     (Sankalp Gurjar is a Research Fellow with the Indian Council of World Affairs.

13-11-2020||Panorama||Laugh your way to good health||If you laugh at yourself, you will never run out of jokes. You will also be surprised at how much you can amuse yourself laughing at your own idiosyncrasies. Other than giving a nice glow to your skin, and a twinkle to your eyes, the sound of laughter is also musical and magical. It instantly makes one forget one’s problems, albeit temporarily, but in this world, even momentary and temporary happiness is a wonderful thing. It’s rightly said that laughter is indeed the best medicine. For starters, laughter, even a mild dose of it, has tremendous benefits. Laughter peps up the immune system by triggering the release of pleasure-inducing neuro-chemicals in the brain. Our immune system contains special cells that act as a defence mechanism against infection, these cells increase when we laugh heartily. A word of caution. Indulge in a bout of healthy laughing, that is laughing at jokes and not at some person.  When we laugh, our central nervous system releases endorphins which are natural morphine-like compounds, that elevate our ability to withstand pain, it also makes us euphoric, which gives us a natural high. This is because the endorphins released during laughter reduce both physical and mental stress and tension. It’s believed that laughter results in burning calories, no wonder it is called as inner jogging. So, if you want to shed a few pounds, go for a walk and also indulge in a bout of daily laughter. When you have had a good laugh with family, friends, or watched a comedy show, you will notice that all the muscles in your body are in a relaxed state for more than 30 minutes. After a hearty laugh, the muscles of our face, chest, shoulders, stomach and even the diaphragm get a fantastic workout. It’s said that laughter also protects our hearts against cardiovascular problems, laughter releases stress which is the major cause of heart attacks and as laughter increases our intake of oxygen-rich air, it ends up stimulating our heart and lungs and various muscles. Now you know why there are so many laughter clubs? So, how about enjoying a heavy-duty laughter session? Make laughter a part of your daily life.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/laugh-your-way-to-good-health-914940.html
13-11-2020||Panorama||China wants to build a Tibet with more wealth, less Buddhism||Sitting in a home built by Chinese authorities near Tibet’s capital of Lhasa, one of the highest cities in the world, Sunnamdanba tells foreign journalists on a government-sponsored tour how much the Communist Party has improved life -- and how irrelevant religion has become for him. “I could have never dreamed my life would be so good,” the 41-year-old father of two, who by tradition uses only one name, said in comments translated by a local official. Foreign journalists can only report from the region on trips organized by the government. Asked about the Dalai Lama, Tibet’s 85-year-old spiritual leader now living in exile and condemned by China as a separatist, Sunnamdanba said: “I never met him and I don’t understand him.” And Buddhism, the religion that has for more than a millennium been the foundation of Tibetan culture? “I spend most of my time and energy now on work and making a living,” he said. “There’s less time to spend on religion.” Why hang a portrait of President Xi Jinping in your living room? “None of this could have happened without the party.” For China, showcasing Tibetans singing the Communist Party’s praises helps affirm its legitimacy to rule the region, something that’s weighed on Beijing’s ties with the West since a failed uprising in 1959 forced the Dalai Lama to flee and set up a government-in-exile in northern Indian. It’s become more important recently as politicians in the U.S., Europe and India accuse China of using forced labor, detentions and re-education campaigns to assimilate ethnic minorities in its borderlands. The Trump administration’s newly appointed special envoy for Tibetan issues met with the head of the exiled Tibetan administration this month, generating outrage from China. India, which only recognized Beijing’s sovereignty over the area in 2003, also recently venerated a Tibetan soldier who died fighting against China this year in the worst clashes along the border since a 1962 war. Tensions have risen in other areas as well. Earlier this year, a Chinese government effort to make Mandarin Chinese the language of instruction at schools in a region inhabited by ethnic Mongolians sparked street protests. And in Xinjiang, a province directly north of Tibet, outrage over China’s move to detain more than a million minority Uighur Muslims in re-education camps has led some U.S. lawmakers to push for the actions to be declared “genocide.” Xi has personally defended the moves in Xinjiang, saying they are necessary to stem terrorism and improve the lives of people. In comments last month, he called the party’s policies “completely correct,” urged more economic development and pushed for more nationalism in education to “allow the sense of Chinese identity to take root in people.” At a meeting on Tibet issues in August, Xi told officials to “actively guide Tibetan Buddhism to adapt to socialist society, and promote the Sinofication of Tibetan Buddhism.” In Tibet, often called the “Roof of the World” because of its high elevation along the Himalayas, ethnic Tibetans comprise about 90% of the 3.5 million people spread across an area the size of South Africa. Their language bears no relation to Chinese, most are Buddhists, and many consider the Dalai Lama their spiritual head -- if not their political leader. In 2008, deadly riots erupted in Lhasa, leaving at least a dozen dead. A spate of self-immolations by ethnic Tibetans followed a few years later, with the Dalai Lama’s followers and human-rights activists attributing the actions to government oppression. Beijing has blamed the Dalai Lama for fomenting the unrest, and that sentiment continues to be expressed by officials today who see religion as the root cause of some of Tibet’s biggest challenges. “Due to some outdated conventions and bad habits -- particularly the negative influence of religion, people put more attention on the afterlife, and their desire to pursue better living this life is relatively weaker,” Tibet Governor Qi Zhala told reporters at a briefing that was part of the trip. “Therefore, in Tibet, we’ll need to not only feed the stomach, but also fix the mind.” Tibetans are allowed to continue with religious practices only under strict controls: Those who openly show reverence and support for the Dalai Lama can face harsh punishment. “Now they want Buddhism to be taught in Chinese language,” Lobsang Sangay, president of Tibet’s exiled government, told a seminar in Washington on Sept. 28. “This is how you control Tibet and this is how you control the Himalaya belt. This is how you control Asia.” But Beijing is also investing heavily in Tibet, betting that new roads, jobs, better housing and improved access to education and healthcare will bring stability to the region. It’s also counting on modern life to erode the sway that religion has had over Tibet since the seventh century. “A gift makes you indebted to the giver,” said Emily Yeh, a professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who is the author of the book “Taming Tibet: Landscape Transformation and the Gift of Chinese Development.” “The bottom line is loyalty to the state and the party.” Tibet is crucial to Beijing for strategic purposes. Its mountainous terrain abuts a 4,000-kilometer (2,500-mile) border with countries including India, Nepal and Myanmar, forming a natural security barrier. Beijing has recently reinforced troops stationed in Tibet as it prepares for a long winter in its high-altitude standoff with India. “To govern a country, it’s necessary to govern the border,” Xi told the Tibet symposium in August, where the party set policy directions for developing the region. “To govern the border, it’s required to stabilize Tibet first.” For Xi, the key to snuffing out calls for independence in Tibet and strengthening Communist Party rule is delivering economic growth in one of China’s poorest regions. Since 2016, China has spent more than $11 billion on poverty alleviation efforts in Tibet. Authorities say they’ve pulled 628,000 people above the country’s absolute poverty threshold, which Beijing currently defines as those with annual earnings of less than approximately $600 -- or $1.64 a day. Those efforts have included building roads to far-flung villages, securing safe drinking water and providing access to health care. But they’ve also fueled concern about the loss of Tibetan culture, in particularly due to widespread relocations of families. Sunnamdanba is among roughly 266,000 Tibetans who have been relocated to new villages over the past five years as part of Xi’s poverty alleviation campaign. He said his family now makes about $13,000 annually, four times what it used to make in a good year, from his job as a security guard, his wife’s work as a cleaner and renting out three rooms in their new home to Chinese tourists. The government’s stance that it hasn’t forced anyone to move as part of the poverty alleviation drive was backed up by an ethnic Tibetan researcher who studies relocations in the region. Asking not to be named for fear of retribution, the researcher said he is aware of villages where only two out of 120 households took up the offer to be relocated. However, a new drive by the government to move 130,000 people from fragile ecosystems at high elevations has been less flexible. According to the researcher, villagers in these locations aren’t given a choice. Those presented to reporters on the trip appeared happy to change locations. Among them were 35-year-old Luoce, who used to graze animals on his grassland some 5,000 meters (16,000 feet) above sea level, where he says the thin air gave him nosebleeds. In 2017, he moved to a so-called relocation village and now works as a security guard and firefighter. His earnings have tripled thanks to his wages and various government subsidies, including one he receives to not graze animals on his land for environmental reasons. Luoce’s goal is to give his seven children the education he never received. “I believe in the party and in science more than I believe in religion,” he said through a government translator. Still, a poorly executed relocation program could also leave people worse off and foment the very kind of instability improved economic conditions were meant to prevent. A notable example of this occurred in Inner Mongolia about a decade ago, when provincial authorities relocated herdsmen from the steppe to so-called milk villages. China’s dairy industry imploded shortly afterward following a tainted milk scandal, forcing many of the herdsman to eke out a living doing odd jobs. Large-scale resettlement involves major changes to social structures, family links, culture, lifestyle, communities and class structure, according to Robbie Barnett, who headed Columbia University’s Modern Tibetan Studies Program until 2018 and has written about the region since the 1980s. “It’s impossible to overstate the enormity of these new forms of development and economic policy in Tibet and Tibetan areas, particularly resettlement,” he said. “To put it at its crudest, the risk is that, while some will prosper, many farming and herding communities will be transformed into a dislocated, disadvantaged underclass.” Officials interviewed during the reporting trip spoke extensively about that risk, and highlighted two solutions: Teaching Tibetans new skills to make money, and expanding education. Outside Shigatse, Tibet’s second-largest city, low-income families are growing mushrooms -- something Tibetans haven’t traditionally done -- and then selling them to a government-financed company. More than 600 kilometers away in Nyingchi, authorities are planning to spend more than $100 million on a vocational training center designed for students who failed a test to continue onto high school after compulsory education in Tibet ends after grade nine. One of those students is Suolanyixi, the 19-year-old son of pepper farmers. He’s already mastered the cappuccino in his quest to become a professional barista, and hopes to one day land a job at one of the roughly half-dozen five-star hotels in Lhasa. And while none of the other students who’ve studied coffee making at the school has ever gotten a job outside of Tibet, Suolanyixi is not ready to rule out the thought -- something that would further the Communist Party’s goal of integrating the region with the rest of China. “Maybe if I am lucky,” he said in fluent Mandarin Chinese.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/china-wants-to-build-a-tibet-with-more-wealth-less-buddhism-914943.html
13-11-2020||Panorama||Enthusing our children the Chacha way||“I may not have time for adults, but I have enough time for children,” expressed our first Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, whose birth anniversary that falls on 14th of November is popularly celebrated as Children’s Day in our country. As is evident from what he expressed, Panditji’s ardent love for children was so immense that his birthday came to be better known as Children’s Day in India.  For a legendary man such as Nehru who is credited to be the architect of modern India, the love he nurtured for our children is something that every political leader in our country will do well to ponder and perhaps to emulate as well.  “The only way to reform them (children) is to win them over with love. So long as a child is unfriendly, you can’t mend his ways,” believed Nehru.  With this belief, he chose to be friends with the children of his times and befriended them where ever he went.  As he was a prolific letter writer, one of the important ways he chose to show his love for all children was through the written word, an approach that not many national leaders of his fame would even remotely contemplate. Among others, “A letter to the Children of India” that he penned in 1947 stands as a testament and is perhaps one of the most charming letters that the premier of a nation could have addressed to the children of his country.  It is considered to be a remarkable letter written from the Prime Minister of a developing country to its humble children.  The letter which has a total of 740 words has been popularly included in textbooks of our school curriculum either as a prose lesson or as a comprehension text. It is an endearing letter and evokes tender feelings of warmth and respect for one of India’s most accomplished politician, orator and author.   “Old people have a habit of delivering sermons and good advice to the young.  I remember that I disliked this very much long ago when I was a boy. So I suppose you do not like it very much either.”  So saying Nehru begins his engaging letter to the children of our country.  A letter in its entirety teaches the child without him getting the feeling that he is being preached to.  In it he gently reminds and pushes the impressionable child to embrace such ideas as fraternity and universal brotherhood. “Grown-ups also have a habit of appearing to be very wise, even though very few of them possess much wisdom. I have not yet quite made up my mind whether I am wise or not,” he confesses with a touch of humour in the letter.  Without much ado and quite simply he then draws their attention to some home truths such as the beauty of the universe and the magic of friendships. He urges them to explore the world through their innocence and curiosity. He recommends that they cultivate real love for work, play and for the building up of a country together. “Our country is a very big country and there is a great deal to be done by all of us. If each one of us does his or her little bit, then all this mounts up and the country prospers and goes ahead fast,” he points out in an appealing manner.  To conclude he gives them a portrait of a hero and a role model for them to follow as he writes, “You know we had a very great man amongst us. He was called Mahatma Gandhi. But we used to call him affectionately Bapuji. He was wise, but he did not show off his wisdom. He was simple and childlike in many ways and he loved children... he taught us to face the world cheerfully and with laughter.”  Chacha Nehru was a remarkable leader who played a very important role in the building up of a nation that was bruised and battered by years of colonial rule.  He was instrumental in the setting of the IITs and the IIMs, the annals from which scores of brilliant Indians have graduated and are now part of the successful Indian diaspora world-wide.  He belonged to the league of educated politicians and chose to use his education to write both charmingly and compellingly.  Whether it is “The discovery of India” or his “Letters from a father to his daughter” Nehru’s love for the written word impresses and influences the reader. His simple yet entertaining style and humour is a joy for a reader of any genre.      Political leaders wield a great influence on the people of their nation.  Their thoughts and words impact all its citizens, particularly its younger generation. They foster a culture of progress and help the common folk to see the world around through the wisdom of their leaders.  It is imperative then that the leaders of a nation should reach and impress its children of their thoughts and ideals.  Letters could act as a powerful medium - even in the current times of social media - for their mass appeal and tenderness.     “Children are like buds in a garden and should be carefully and lovingly nurtured, as they are the future of the nation and the citizens of tomorrow,” rightly believed Nehru.  He, therefore, took time from his busy life to address the children of the nation directly through the written word.  He chose to enthuse them to live their simple childhood in progressive ways. This letter may be regarded as quaint and subsequently irrelevant by the modern world. Yet, it stands out for its simplicity and enduring charm.

13-11-2020||Right in the Middle||Celebrating in a pandemic||The coronavirus has turned snug over the past few months, as it has been nestling in happily all over the world, playing the uninvited guest. Coronavirus is now ruling the world and humans are adapting to this change, some unwittingly, many voluntarily, a few forcibly and yet a few confusedly.  The online world is ruling the roost and businesses that have an online presence are patting themselves on their backs --albeit cautiously, as the shopping appetite has toned down. Thousands of offline business--start-ups and other businesses have sadly started downing their shutters or are bracing for the same. Bustling shopping streets seem like a dream of a past era. Travellers have to live only with their fond memories, as a jaunt, either domestic or abroad seems remote. I remember the vibrant streets of Florence teeming with artists flaunting their talent, eager to sketch one’s portrait for a few euros. The human swarms in the famous subways in London and Hong Kong, or any major city, seem like ghosts of the past. Nowadays travel seems an open invite to the rogue virus.  At such times the online alternative seems to be a solution, offering a ray of hope in the gloomy scenario. Work from home is simultaneously a boon and a bane. The initial relief of not having to hurry and commute along polluted roads has given rise to a tiredness arising from the monotony of working within the confines of the four walls of one’s home, with no chance for a quick repast with colleagues amidst light banter, or a casual stroll around the office premises exchanging brief pleasantries. In turn, managers seem nervous as they are not sure if they are able to get the most out of their team without the usual back-patting or a warm gupshup at the canteen.  Celebrations, a markedly social happening, have gone online too. Birthday bashes, as we knew them pre-Covid were fun-filled parties with variations for toddlers, youngsters and seniors. But post-Covid ones are enjoyable too, as my husband and I discovered during an online birthday celebration of our precious grandson. Armed with a Zoom meeting ID and password, we joined the unique celebration arranged from the backyard of his US home, with grandparents, uncles and aunts showing their virtual presence. The two-year-old enjoyed every bit of it alongside his enthusiastic parents and five-year-old brother, who shyly displayed the elaborate birthday card that he had made himself. We would not have witnessed the celebration if not for Covid.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/celebrating-in-a-pandemic-914939.html
13-11-2020||Second Edit||A way to deny the poor their due||It is unfortunate that the Karnataka government is taking away with one hand what it began giving with the other. Its shifting of Labour Office-2 from Karmika Bhavan on Bannerghatta Road to Bagalagunte in North Bengaluru will severely undermine the ability of unorganised workers in the southern parts of the city to access government benefits. Those living and working in the outskirts of the city will be the most severely impacted as they will have to travel around 40 km to reach the new office at Bagalagunte. Many of them are daily wage-earners and will find it difficult to take a day’s leave from work to make the journey to Bagalagunte if they have issues to sort out with Labour Office officials. There is the added expenditure they will have to incur now to travel to Bagalgunte, which they could avoid or at least reduce in the past. It was only when the pandemic lockdown devastated the lives and livelihoods of millions of workers that the government woke up, somewhat, to the magnitude of the vulnerability of the unorganised sector. Since most unorganised workers were not registered with the government – just 89,000 such workers were registered with the welfare board -- authorities were in a fix as they did not have the data to identify those in need of support through the lockdown period. It was only then that the Karnataka government decided to launch a campaign to register all unorganised workers in the state, and thousands of workers have since registered themselves with the government. They have begun accessing some of the benefits being extended by the government to the unorganised sector, including scholarships and bus passes. The Labour Office is an important nodal point in enabling workers to access these benefits. But now, the office at Karmika Bhavan has been moved out. The government decision to shift the Bannerghatta Road office to North Bengaluru makes little sense for multiple reasons. Efficient governance requires facilities to be made easily accessible to the masses. It requires the government to step up decentralisation of administration. However, the government is moving in the opposite direction. The decision to shift the office is an ill-conceived and insensitive one. It must be reversed. This must be followed up with more labour offices being set up across the city and the state. Unorganised workers are among the most marginalised and vulnerable sections of our society. They should not be put to unnecessary trouble.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/a-way-to-deny-the-poor-their-due-914936.html
13-11-2020||South||Corruption allegations against Anna University V-C M K Surappa; inquiry ordered||Amid a tug of war, the Tamil Nadu government has ordered an inquiry against M K Surappa, Vice-Chancellor of the prestigious Anna University, to probe allegations of corruption to the tune of Rs 280 crore by appropriating funds allotted to the institution and by collecting bribes for recruiting temporary teaching staff. An order issued by Apoorva, Principal Secretary, Higher Education Department, dated November 11, a copy of which has been accessed by DH, says Justice P Kalaiyarasan, a retired judge of the Madras High Court, will conduct an inquiry against Surappa, who was appointed to the post in April 2018 and submit his report within three months. The order said the inquiry was being constituted since allegations raised against Surappa were “serious in nature.” The inquiry was instituted after a complaint, dated February 21, 2020, from A Suresh of Tiruchirappalli that Surappa and Sakthinathan of the Anna University were involved in corruption to the tune of Rs 200 crore. Further, he also alleged that the duo has collected Rs 80 crore by taking bribes anywhere between Rs 13 lakh to Rs 15 lakh from candidates for appointing them as temporary teaching staff. The inquiry comes close on the heels of a tug of war between Surappa and Tamil Nadu government over granting of Institute of Eminence (IoE) to Anna University. The government took objection to Surappa writing directly to the Centre on the IoE status and has now declared that the university does not need the tag as they fear the current reservation being availed by students may be affected. Surappa has had a roller-coaster ride ever since he was appointed to the post. A renowned metallurgist, Surappa's appointment as V-C of Anna University was opposed by Opposition parties on the pretext that he belonged to Karnataka. He has also had several run-ins with the state government. In his reaction, Surappa told DH, "I am surprised and shocked at the development. I cannot imagine (such things can be said against me). I cannot say anything beyond this and I do not want to say anything. I just received the letter and I am surprised." Besides, the Chief Minister's Special Cell received complaints from C Varadharajan, Save Anna University campaign, and R Adhikesavan alleging that the examination office indulged in various scams and promotions have been given by using forged certificates and accepting “illegal grafts.” Adhikesavan, in his complaint, said Surappa has “misused” his powers by appointing his daughter to universities. “There is a scam in purchase of machinery for constituent colleges,” he alleged in his complaint. Another allegation against Surappa is that he appointed Selladurai as Director of CCC without the approval of Syndicate. The inquiry will look into temporary appointments and other recruitments made in academic as well as administrative sides of the university during the tenure of Surappa. The retired judge will also look into whether the appointments were in violation of the Prevention of Corruption Act or the Indian Penal Code. The order further said the retired judge will inquire into amounts received by the university during Surappa's tenure in the form of fees, assistance, donations, grants, besides looking into contracts and agreements entered into by the university during Surappa's tenure.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/corruption-allegations-against-anna-university-v-c-m-k-surappa-inquiry-ordered-915046.html
13-11-2020||South||Telangana government imposes ban on sale and use of firecrackers following HC directions||The Telangana government has issued an order imposing a ban on sale and use of firecrackers with immediate effect following directions from the state High Court. The High Court has directed the state (on Thursday) to immediately ban the sale and use of fireworks by the people and organisations and to immediately clamp down and close shops which are selling fireworks, a Government Order (GO), dated November 12, said. The GO said the High Court has further issued directions to appeal to people, both through print and the electronic media, to refrain from bursting firecrackers, so as to prevent any further deterioration in air quality. "The government after careful consideration of the matter and keeping in view the directions of the Hon'ble High Court, hereby impose ban on sale and use of firecrackers by the people and organisations, with immediate effect," the GO said. The state DGP, DG of Fire Services and all-district Collectors, Commissioners of Police, Superintendents of Police in the state should take immediate action to close the shops which are selling fireworks throughout the state, it said. Meanwhile, state BJP president and MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar alleged the TRS government has failed to protect the sentiments of Hindus vis-a-vis ban on firecrackers. The High Court has directed the imposition of the ban on firecrackers as the state government could not effectively argue the matter in the court, he claimed in a statement on Friday. "It has become fashionable to make the festivals of Hindus controversial every time," Kumar said. Where do the owners of firecrackers shops go when they are asked to shut the shops which are permitted by the government, he asked. He demanded that the government come to the rescue of small businessmen engaged in the sale of firecrackers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/telangana-government-imposes-ban-on-sale-and-use-of-firecrackers-following-hc-directions-915059.html
13-11-2020||South||Kodiyeri Balakrishnan seeks leave from CPM Kerala secretary post||Kerala CPM secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan has taken leave from the post close on the heels of his son Bineesh Kodiyeri being held by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with Bengaluru drug trafficking case. CPM's official version is that Kodiyeri sought leave for follow-up medical treatment and the party state committee allowed it. Left Democratic Front convenor A Vijayaraghavan would hold the charge of the state secretary, said a CPM statement. The fresh move has mounted pressure on Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan as his personal staff members were also facing serious charges. Opposition Congress demanded the resignation of Vijayan taking moral responsibility of the unlawful acts of his personal staff members. Even as Balakrishnan, who is also a politburo member, so far distanced himself from the serious allegations against his son and senior party leaders, including general secretary Sitaram Yechury, maintained that there was no reason for Balakrishnan to quit the secretary post owing to allegations against his son, there were differences with in the party on Balakrishnan continuing as secretary  especially since the local body and Assembly polls are approaching. The Assembly polls that are hardly five months away is more crucial for the CPM as Kerala is the lone state where the party is in power. Hence the decision of Balakrishnan could be seen only as an attempt to protect the party's image. However, CPM leaders Vijayaraghavan and M V Govindan were maintaining that Balakrishnan's resignation had no connection with the case against his son but only since he required follow-up treatment. Balakrishnan had availed leave from party secretary post last year also for treatment in the US. But he later returned to party secretary post and was reported to have regained health and was quite actively involved in politics. Balakrishnan has been a close confidant of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and a key person of the CPM's powerful Kannur lobby. Hence the set back to Balakrishnan would be obviously a setback to Vijayan as well as the Kannur lobby. He was serving as party secretary since 2015. He also served as home minister in Kerala earlier. Vijayaraghavan, who is from Malappuram district and a former Rajya Sabha MP, was given the charge of secretary owing to his proximity with Vijayan and Balakrishnan, said sources. Over these years, allegations against sons often put Balakrishnan in a tight spot. Bineesh, who is the younger, son earlier faced allegations of nexus with shady persons. His links with the Bengaluru drug racket surfaced after Anoop Muhammed held by the NCB revealed about Bineesh's financial support to him. Subsequently the ED arrested Bineesh and also raided his house in Thiruvananthapuram where Balakrishnan even used to stay till recently. Balakrishnan's elder son Binoy faced allegations of cheating a Mumbai-settled woman, who was a former bar dancer in UAE, by impregnated her after sexually abusing by promising to marry. A Mumbai court ordered a DNA test to prove paternity of the child, which was still pending. He had also faced a Rs. 13 crore financial fraud complaint by the sponsor of a Dubai-based firm. While the case was settled, questions were raised by opposition over the source of the funds used to settling the case, which were also remaining unanswered.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kodiyeri-balakrishnan-seeks-leave-from-cpm-kerala-secretary-post-915072.html

The hostels, managed by the Social Welfare Department, are being opened in the wake of colleges re-opening for graduate and postgraduate students, Social Welfare Minister B Sriramulu said on Friday. "As was decided in the meeting chaired by Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on October 23, the classes will begin for graduate and postgraduate students from November 17. In this backdrop post-matric hostels managed by the Social Welfare Department across the state will function from November 17," he tweeted. The state government had, on October 23, decided to re-open engineering, diploma, degree colleges (including PG) that were shut for students due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It had said the students would have an option to either attend the classes physically or online or can go in for blended learning by using both options. Subsequently, the government also formulated standard operating procedures for the colleges to follow once they reopen. To facilitate students for their academic activities, the Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) said in a press release that it has decided to allow them to use its bus services in the city by producing the student pass issued last year or the current year college fee receipt or college ID.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/post-matric-hostels-to-re-open-from-november-17-social-welfare-minister-b-sriramulu-915156.html

The Anna University Teachers' Association (AUTA) also came out in support of Surappa saying the institution remains an “oasis of non-corrupt environment” under the current V-C. “To the best of our knowledge, several anti-corruption measures have been taken up by our Vice-Chancellor himself and he stands tall as the role model of a non-corrupt public personality. Under these circumstances, the executive committee of AUTA felt that initiating such a commission of inquiry against the bold, impeccable and non-corrupt character is ironical,” the AUTA said.

13-11-2020||South||Polls, pilgrimage cast shadow over Kerala's Covid-19 situation||With campaigning for the local body elections gaining momentum and Sabarimala Ayyappa temple pilgrimage beginning from Sunday, Kerala is on alert as health experts haven't ruled out the chance for a further spike in Covid-19 cases in the state. After the Onam festival season, Kerala witnessed a steep increase in Covid-19 cases in September and October. But over the last couple of weeks, the test positivity rate (TPR) has been showing a declining trend. The daily TPR that stood at 18.16 per cent on October 13, came down to 9.54 per cent after a gap of one month on November 12. The average TPR for the last week was 11.25 per cent. Kerala Covid-19 taskforce member Dr. Mohammed Asheel said that even with stringent Covid protocols being prescribed for the local body elections as well as the Sabarimala pilgrimage, the chances for a further Covid spike could not be ruled out owing to the tendency of people to flout the norms. The effect of local body elections and Sabarimala pilgrimage on the Covid scenario of the state could be known only towards the end of December, he said.  Health Department sources said that despite the stringent Covid-19 protocols prescribed at Sabarimala when the temple opened for pilgrims for week-long monthly pooja in October, at least ten, including some temple staff and police personnel on duty, got infected. Hence, the norms were further tightened now by insisting on Covid-19 negative test results issued 24 hours ahead of trekking. Elections to the 1,199 local bodies in Kerala will be held in three-phases from December 8 to 14. As many as 21,865 wards will be going to polls and campaigning by at least 60,000-odd candidates is gaining momentum. Hence, social distancing might go for a toss even with the state election commission prescribing Covid-19 protocols, health department sources pointed out. At present, Kerala has 77,813 active Coivd patients, while the total number of infected patients so far stands at around 5.1 lakh. The highlight of Kerala's fight against Covid is the low death rate of 0.35 per cent.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/polls-pilgrimage-cast-shadow-over-keralas-covid-19-situation-915173.html

HC pulls up state government||The Karnataka High Court on Thursday said that the order of the state government banning the sale and use of firecrackers, except green crackers, is ineffective. Observing that the government has not defined what a green cracker is, the bench said it is not too late in the day to pass a drastic order, considering the Covid-19 situation. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka directed the government to place its response by 10.30 am on Friday. Besides raising concerns about air pollution and health issues, the PIL filed by Dr Vishnu Bharath also highlighted the recent order passed by the Calcutta High Court. The state government submitted two orders, dated November 6 and November 10, on the issue of firecrackers. The additional government advocate said that a conjoined reading of the orders shows that the government has banned all forms of firecrackers, except green crackers. The bench orally said that the officers responsible to implement the order themselves may not know what a green cracker is. The court said that the state government should give wide publicity explaining about green crackers. “Thus, prima facie it appears to us that the orders are ineffective as the state has not bothered to lay down the meaning of green crackers,” the court said. Observing that the consequences of bursting of fire crackers on the environment and human health are well known, the court said it can still pass drastic orders in view of precautionary principle and doctrine of public trust. “The state ought to have taken stringent steps as there is all possibility of air pollution by bursting crackers and which may lead to the spread of Covid-19,” the bench said. The court posted the matter to the next day as the first matter in the morning. It also directed the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board to file a statement explaining whether it can check the decibel level and air safety level of various places in Bengaluru city.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/whats-a-green-cracker-hc-pulls-up-state-government-914918.html

Karnataka has been allocated Rs 577.84 crore for dealing with the damages due to floods and landslides during the South-West Monsoon while Rs 611.61 crore has been allocated for Madhya Pradesh and Rs 87.84 crore for Sikkim. West Bengal has got the highest allocation of Rs 2,707.77 crore for Cyclone Amphan. Odisha was also allocated Rs 128.23 crore for Odisha for handling Cyclone Amphan. Modi had visited Bengal and Odisha on May 22 this year and had announced a financial assistance of Rs 1,000 crore to the former and Rs 500 crore to the latter and were released, in advance, the next day. In addition, he had also announced Rs two lakh ex-gratia for the next of kin of the dead and Rs 50,000 for the injured, which was over and above the ex-gratia provided through the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and the NDRF. In all the six States, an official statement said, the Central Government had deputed Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCTs) immediately after the calamities, without waiting for the receipt of Memorandum from the affected State Governments. In addition, during the financial year 2020-21, the Central Government has released Rs 15,524.43 crore to 28 States from the SDRF till date.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/centre-allocates-rs-57784-crore-central-assistance-to-karnataka-for-monsoon-damages-915045.html

13-11-2020||State||Centre to stockpile syringes for Covid-19 vaccination||The Union government has placed additional orders with suppliers of syringes, who supply to its routine immunisation programme, to handle the additional requirement for Covid vaccination.  For the routine immunisation programme, the country approximately needs 300 million vaccines and syringes a year on a thumb rule basis. If 65 to 70% of its 1.3 billion-plus population has to be vaccinated for Covid-19, it needs 900 million injections. And if the vaccine has to be injected twice, then 1.8 billion injections are required. “On October 29, we received an additional order for 5.22 crore auto-disable syringes of 0.5 ml from the Union government in order to meet the Covid vaccination requirements,” said Sandeep Bhandari, vice-president of Jodhpur-based ISCON Surgicals Ltd. ISCON is one of the two Indian companies that supplies syringes to the country’s routine immunisation programme. The third is a China-based company. Auto-disable syringes cannot be reused. They incorporate a mechanism to break or lock the plunger when the injection is given to make the syringe inoperable for being used for second time. “We have committed to supply 9.4 crore syringes by March 2021. We have been told to expect the second order and plan for it, but it has not been issued yet,” said Rajiv Nath, managing director, Hindustan Syringes and Medical Devices Limited (HMD).  Both suppliers told DH that though there is an ongoing tender of a period of two years from 2020-2022, the government has decided to expand the base of the original tender, and has gone back to all the three suppliers. It has asked them to give additional supplies of syringes over what they have committed in the orders earlier placed with them. Petrochemical-based raw materials like polypropylene and stainless steel capillary tubes are being procured on a war-footing for making these syringes. Syringes are being procured at less than Rs 2 per piece. To make it cost effective, a high-level precision engineering and automation is required. The equipment is imported from Japan, Germany and Switzerland, and it takes nine months to one year for manufacturing, and another three months for delivery, installation and quality validation before being commissioned. Since these are voluminous products, additional storage spaces are also needed. For storing one billion syringes, approximately 4,00,000 sqft area will be required. Meanwhile, S Aparna, Secretary, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Health Ministry, who heads the sub committee on vaccine supply chain and logistics, did not respond to calls and emails from DH.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/centre-to-stockpile-syringes-for-covid-19-vaccination-915300.html

We’ve reached 5G, but we’re still trying to get 4G in every corner of the state.”  Narayan also formally released the state’s new IT Policy for 2020-25 that aims to generate over 60 lakh direct and indirect jobs in the sector.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-government-to-go-beyond-bengaluru-for-it-914914.html
13-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||What are green crackers? Karnataka defines it after High Court rap||After being pulled up by the High Court for not defining green crackers, the Karnataka government issued an order 'to bring in more clarity' on the concept of such crackers. The order said that green crackers did not contain harmful chemicals and can be identified through a distinct green logo of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - National Environmental and Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-NEERI), along with Quick Response (QR) codes. Citing the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, the order by Anjum Parvez, Principal Secretary, Revenue Department (Disaster Management), said that absence of harmful chemicals "considerably" reduced air pollution due to green crackers. "These crackers are less harmful in comparison to conventional firecrackers." The new formulation developed by CSIR-NEERI was used to manufacture these crackers available as sparklers, flowerpots etc. What are green crackers? According to the definition of green crackers attached with the order, the new and improved formulations ensured reduction in particulate matter (PM), sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. Compared with conventional composition for a given category of crackers, there was a minimum of 30% reduction in emissions. ".. a minimum of PM reduction of 20% and rest 10% of gaseous emission (mass of gases emitted based on composition)," the order said. On Thursday, High Court had pulled up the state government over the issue. Observing that there was a lack of awareness regarding green crackers, the Court had said that the previous orders on such crackers were ineffective as the state had not bothered to lay down the meaning of green crackers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/what-are-green-crackers-karnataka-defines-it-after-high-court-rap-915028.html

While the state government order on Friday gave specific direction to the KSPCB to take measures to curb noise pollution, the high court said the police and KSPCB officials should attend to complaints received by citizens regarding noise pollution rules. "Strict instructions have been given to Board officials across the state to work with the police and the district officials to ensure that the order of the state government and the directions of the court are carried out," KSPCB Chairman Vijaykumar Gogi told DH. Sources at a district-level office of KSPCB, however, said complete enforcement of the directions was a herculean task considering the limited number of officials on the ground. "The government order should have been issued at least a week before. We are four people in the district office. We are entirely dependent on the police for any action on the ground. Ensuring that shops are selling green crackers only is a tough task," the source said. An official in the government said that the high court order has given a much-needed momentum for pushing green crackers. "This is the beginning and there will be hiccups, like shops selling polluting crackers. Once we pass this transition period, we can hope for complete enforcement of green crackers in the coming days,"  he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/kspcb-to-work-with-district-officials-police-to-curb-noise-pollution-caused-by-firecrackers-915326.html

13-11-2020||West||Actor Arjun Rampal at NCB office for questioning; friend held||Bollywood actor-model Arjun Rampal was on Friday questioned by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in relation to a drug case with the agency also arresting one of his friends. Rampal, who was initially summoned by the central agency on Wednesday, arrived at the NCB's zonal office in Ballard Estate, South Mumbai, around 11.00 am. The 47-year-old actor, whose home was raided last Monday, said that he is co-operating with the agency. “I am fully cooperating with the investigation. I have nothing to do with drugs. The medicine found at my residence was prescribed. The prescription has been found and handed over," Rampal was quoted saying as he left the NCB’s Mumbai zonal office. The NCB is expected to grill Rampal in the coming days. On Thursday night, Rampal’s Australian friend Paul Bartel was arrested in a drug-related case. Over the last two days, Rampal’s live-in partner Gabriella Demetriades was questioned by the federal anti-drug agency. The apex drug law enforcement agency, which is probing the case for the last few months, had questioned her for almost six hours each on Wednesday and Thursday. Last month, her brother and Rampal’s friend Agisilaos Demetriades was arrested by the NCB. Both Demetriades and Bartel are known to several Bollywood personalities. The NCB summoned Rampal and Demetriades after conducting a search at the actor's residence in suburban Bandra on Monday. Rampal who has featured in several films including Rock On!! (2008), Pyaar Ishq Aur Mohabbat (2001), Om Shanti Om (2007), Raajneeti (2010) and Housefull (2010), is considered an A-lister in Bollywood. The probe agency had seized electronic gadgets like laptops, mobile phones and tablets during the search and also questioned Rampal's driver. A day before the search at Rampal's house, the NCB had arrested Bollywood producer Firoz Nadiadwala's wife after ganja was allegedly found at their residence in suburban Juhu. She was later granted bail by a city court. The NCB launched the probe into alleged drug use in Bollywood after the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June. The central agency arrested Rajput's girlfriend, actor Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik and a few others under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Rampal is yet another top actor to be grilled by the NCB – the others being Deepika Padukone, Rakul Preet Singh, Shraddha Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan. Rhea and some other accused are currently out on bail. (With inputs from PTI)||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/actor-arjun-rampal-at-ncb-office-for-questioning-friend-held-915011.html
13-11-2020||West||Will ensure BJP sits at home for 25 years in Maharashtra: Sanjay Raut||Rattled by charges of financial and land deals between the Thackeray clan and late Anvay Naik’s family, Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut lost his cool and said that his party will ensure that BJP sits at home for 25 years in Maharashtra. “Rest assured, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will continue for 5 years… We will ensure that the BJP sits at home for 25 years,” Raut, a close aide of Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, told reporters here. Over the last couple of days, BJP’s national executive member Dr Kirit Somaiya had claimed transactions involving the purchase of land at Korlai in Raigad district, jointly purchased by Thackeray’s wife Rashmi Thackeray and one Manisha Waikar, the wife of senior Shiv Sena leader Ravindra Waikar from Anvay Madhukar Naik and Akshita Naik in March 2014 at about Rs 2.20 crore. Later, he also claimed that the Thackerays had purchased 21 plots from Naik. Akshita Naik is the late Anvay Naik’s wife – and she and her daughter Adnya Naik had demanded reopening of the 2018 abetment to suicide case, that was shut when the Devendra Fadnavis-led government was in power. Anvay and his mother Kumud allegedly died by suicide on May 5, 2018. Raut said that the charges made by Somaiya are frivolous. “What he is talking about….21 properties…show me even five…there was one (transaction)…absolutely legal,” he said. Referring to BJP as “Shethji’s party” and Somaiya as “vyapari pravakta”, he said, their “maliks” are sitting in Delhi. Asked about the demand for probe by Enforcement Directorate, he said: “Why ED…let there be a probe by CBI also… and why ED and CBI only….let them go to Interpol, FBI, KGB, Interpol and the United Nations.” He said that a mother and son have died and added that the MVA government will ensure justice. “They don’t want that Marathi-manoos get justice but a criminal must be saved,” he said in an apparent reference to Republic Media Network’s Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami, who was arrested in the case and is currently on bail granted by Supreme Court.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/will-ensure-bjp-sits-at-home-for-25-years-in-maharashtra-sanjay-raut-915013.html

Already designated as a national geo-heritage site, the tag of Ramsar Site would go a long way in the conservation of Lonar Lake or the Lonar Crater. The crater-lake was formed nearly 52,000 years ago when a  meteorite slammed the Deccan Plateau. The meteorite weighed two million tonnes and was travelling at an estimated speed of 90,000 kmph. It created a hole which was 150 m deep and 1.8 km wide! Scientists believe that the energy released during this event was equivalent to a six-megaton atom bomb explosion. The collision led to the formation of one of the largest, most unique basalt impact craters in the world. It has a mean diameter of 1.2 km and is about 137 m below the crater rim. The meteor crater rim is about 1.8 km in diameter. According to the Ramsar Convention, India has added two more sites in the  ‘List of Wetlands of International Importance’ – the Sur Sarovar or Keetham Lake which is a human-made reservoir in Uttar Pradesh and Lonar Lake. The Lonar site includes the lake as well as escarpments, which form the crater walls, and forested zones. The lake is high in salinity and alkalinity, as the lack of an outflow leads to a concentration of minerals as the lake water evaporates. Specialized micro-organisms such as anaerobes, cyanobacteria, and phytoplankton survive in this harsh chemical environment. Outside the lake, there is considerable diversity of plant and animal life, like springs which help feed the lake provide a source of fresh water. Inhabiting the Site are 160 species of birds including the vulnerable Asian woolly-neck (Ciconia episcopus) and common pochard (Aythya ferina), 46 species of reptiles, and 12 species of mammals including the iconic grey wolf (Canis lupus). Both these sites are both threatened by household sewage and urban wastewater and by unsustainable tourism. The Smithsonian Institution, the United States Geological Survey, Geological Survey of India, the University of Sagar, and the Physical Research Laboratory have conducted extensive studies of the Lonar site. Biological nitrogen fixation was discovered in this lake in 2007. A 2019 study, conducted by IIT Bombay found that the minerals, in the lake soil, are very similar to the minerals found in moon rocks brought back during the Apollo programme.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/lonar-lake-in-buldhana-added-as-ramsar-site-915100.html

BJP’s Rajya Sabha member and former Maharashtra chief minister Narayan Rane and his son and BJP MLA Nitesh Rane had been claiming that that both Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput and talent manager Disha Salian were murdered. The father-son duo had also dragged the name of Thackeray’s son and state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray into the entire episode. On Friday, the junior Rane once again raked up the issue posing a series of questions. “So the Disha Salian case is apparently going to be closed because there are no proofs found by the police!?” Nitesh said. “Then why was the investigation officer changed twice? Why is Rohan Rai still absconding? Why has her building watchman from that night disappeared? Why her post-mortem report not out yet?” he wanted to know. So the Disha Salian case is apparently goin to be closed becz there r no proofs found by the police!?Then why was the IO changed twice? Y is Rohan Rai still absconding?Y has her building watchman from that night disappeared?Y is her PM report not out yet?Contd.. In the past, the Ranes have demanded that Rohan Rai, the fiancé of Disha Salian be grilled. In a three-part tweet, Nitesh also asked: “Are the mobile tower locations of that night checked? Why is the police in a hurry to shut the case without an investigation?  There is something fishy in all this for sure. And, we are watching it very closely! Hope the police do not want to get embarrassed later if proofs come out!.” Nitesh also claimed that “someone from the forensic lab” has shown him some details of the forensic report which clearly doesn’t show it was a case of suicide so why is the police rushing to close the case. While Disha, a resident of Shivaji Park in Dadar, was found dead on 8-9 June midnight at the Galaxy Regent building complex in Malvani in Malad where her live-in partner Rohan Rai used to stay, Sushant was found dead in his rented duplex accommodation at Mount Blanc building at Carter Road in Bandra on 14 June.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bjp-targets-maharashtra-government-over-closing-of-disha-salian-death-case-915101.html

In the past, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and state’s Public Health and Family Welfare minister Rajesh Tope had given indications of a possible second wave-like surge in coronavirus cases and asked people not to lower their guards in view of the flattening of the curve. The circular issued by Director of Health Services Dr. Archana Patil on 11 November was on the basis of a meeting held on 5 November that was presided over by Tope. "Several countries in Europe are experiencing the second wave of Covid-19 at present. It is likely that we may face the second wave in January-February next year,” Dr. Patil said in the circular issued to district health officers, district surgeons and medical officers. The circular said that there should be no complacency in coronavirus testing and all labs will remain functional as per Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. Besides, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there should be 140 tests per 10 lakh population. The circular also mentions dos and don’ts for citizens. “The district administration and municipal corporations are expected to strictly implement it by making adequate testing facilities operational in their respective jurisdictions. The contact tracing and house-to-house survey should be done on a war footing so that those Covid-19 positive, as well as their contacts, can be treated at the earliest,’’ said Dr. Patil in the advisory. The government has asked for ensuring regular surveys of influenza-like illnesses and potential superspreaders, strengthening treatment amenities, including beds, Covid hospitals, care centers and health centers, uninterrupted supply of medicines and oxygen, and comorbidity clinics. The government has also emphasised the need for proper management of ambulances to ensure that Covid-19 patients will not face problems.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/covid-19-second-wave-likely-to-be-in-january-february-maharashtra-government-915117.html
