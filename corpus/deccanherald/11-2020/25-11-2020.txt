In Haryana, a 20-year-old student was shot and killed outside her college by a man whose overtures for ‘friendship’ had been rejected by the girl. The chilling incident was caught on CCTV camera. This comes close on the heels of another incident where a woman in Andhra Pradesh was burnt alive by a man for breaking up her relationship with him. In yet another incident, a young actor was brutally stabbed by a man on a busy Mumbai street, allegedly for refusing to accept his marriage proposal. Three horrifying episodes -- all in one month – reported from different parts of the country. Many more have likely gone unreported and unrecorded. These are not merely isolated instances of crimes against women -- they are about a sense of sexual entitlement, a culture of toxic masculinity, nurtured, protected and normalised by patriarchal belief systems that allow men to think it is their right to silence and annihilate women who dare to refuse their ‘love’. From being sexually assaulted, doused with acid, to being set on fire, ‘rejection violence’ -- where women face the consequences for saying ‘no’ to men -- has become a revoltingly familiar phenomenon in India. We have time and again expressed our outrage against such violence, sought to bring in stricter legislations and rallied for better support mechanisms for survivors of such violence. Yet, women continue to be subjected to violence with impunity for asserting their right to say ‘no’. It is a form of dehumanisation of women -- a refusal to consider women as equal human beings with the right to make their own choices. Women’s rejection is viewed not only as an insult to the male ego but as an indefensible attack on the very essence of being a ‘real man’. The notions of 'control' and ‘domination’ are integral to such constructions of masculinity while women are expected to be docile, pliant and submissive. Any transgressions from these unsaid/unwritten but deep-rooted norms warrant violence -- lessons must be taught, manhood reclaimed.  While we may condemn such violence, we still continue to make excuses for entitled interactions that might be considered less extreme but are still harmful. The scene from a popular Bollywood film comes to mind where one of the three male protagonists had gone to ‘meet’ a girl on his mother’s insistence with the intention of ‘rejecting’ the girl but gets rejected instead. Much laughter ensues from his friends. Harmless banter? Both on screen and in real life, the notion of being rejected by a girl is rooted in gendered power hierarchies. Some get over it and move on, others are encouraged by social conditioning to weaponise rejection and seek retribution. As reported by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in 2018, 228 incidents of acid attacks were recorded across the country against 240 victims. However, despite being recognised as a specific crime under the Indian Penal Code by the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 2013, whereby a person convicted for acid attack can be sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years or life, a majority of the acid attack cases (94.3%) are still pending in courts. This creates not only a sense of despair and dejection for the survivors, but also abets a culture of impunity with which such crimes against women are carried out.  Further, rejection violence is not limited to street harassment or attacks carried out in public places alone but are widely prevalent in intimate relationships within private spaces. In a study conducted in 2011, the International Centre for Research on Women documented that one in five Indian men admitted to having forced sexual relations with their wives. The National Family Health Survey (2015-2016) records that the most common form of reported sexual violence faced by ever-married women between the ages of 15 and 49 years was the use of physical force by the husband for sexual intercourse against the will of his wife. India is one of 36 countries in the world (including Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan) where it is legal for a husband to rape his wife. Forcing sexual intercourse on a woman against her will – the inability to accept her right to say ‘no’ -- when legitimised by legal systems, not only reinforces and sanctions a violent and toxic masculinity where women are mere ‘property’ of men, but actively encourages it. The often-cited argument for refusing to criminalise marital rape is that it will destabilise the sanctity of marriage. Does not rape itself destabilise the sanctity of marriage? It is quite ironic that while we are increasingly invested in ‘saving’ women from falling in love with the ‘wrong’ man (read ‘Love Jihad’), we are quite accepting of a culture that allows men to express their ‘love’ in violent ways. It is high time that we channelised our ‘collective conscience’ and energies away from treating women as mere pawns in male-dominated social institutions, controlling and dictating their agency and choices. Instead, we must focus on educating our current and future generations not to define their self-worth by artificial and unrealistic standards of masculinity and femininity. Strengthening our legal/judicial processes is imperative, but at the same time we must recognise, call out and challenge everyday sexism and misogyny in public as well as private spaces that sustain and encourage regressive gender norms thereby legitimising violence.

Some decisions made in such cases and observations made by the court doing the course of the hearing have also attracted attention. Last week, Chief Justice of India S A Bobde, while hearing a petition, said that the Supreme Court was trying to “discourage petitions under Article 32”. The reason probably was that the court did not want to be flooded with petitions, as it would not have the time for other matters if too many petitioners came directly to it before going to the high courts. The petition before the court sought its intervention in the case of a journalist from Kerala, Siddique Kappan, who was arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police while he was going to Hathras to report on the rape and murder there last month. The charges against him include sedition, and he is still in jail.   The CJI’s observation raised some concerns over the court's handling of Article 32 petitions. In a hearing on Kappan’s petition, the court had also said that the matter should be transferred to the UP High Court. However, in a later hearing, the CJI said that there was unfair and inaccurate reporting of the court's proceedings in the case, as “the reports said that the journalist was refused relief”. The court allowed Kappan’s lawyers to meet him and sign documents to facilitate bail. Other petitions under Article 32 have also come before the Supreme Court. One was a petition from a person who was arrested for alleged defamation of the Maharashtra Chief Minister. In another petition for the release of poet Varavara Rao, who has been in jail for months in the Bhima Koregaon case, the court asked the Bombay High Court to hear it at the earliest. At the same time, it did well to entertain the petition of Arnab Goswami, editor of Republic TV, and granted him interim bail.  Article 32 is very important because it affirms the right of a citizen to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by the Constitution. It ensures the right to constitutional remedies in case of violation of rights and is, in a sense, the right of rights. Babasaheb Ambedkar called it the heart and soul of the Constitution. So, petitions under this Article should receive proper attention and equal treatment from the court. If there are more petitions now, that means that citizens’ rights are more frequently denied or violated. That increases the relevance and importance of Article 32.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/article-32-approach-key-to-citizens-rights-919616.html
25-11-2020||First Edit||India's RCEP decision may need a rethink||The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which was signed into being by 15 countries of the Asia-Pacific region last week, is set to become the largest trade bloc in the world. It represents about 30% of the world’s economy and population. Its members are some of the world’s top economic and trading powers, including China, Japan, South Korea, the ASEAN bloc and Australia and countries with smaller economies like Vietnam and the Philippines. India opted out of the bloc last year, after 11 years of negotiations, on some valid considerations. There were legitimate fears that goods from these countries would flood the Indian market. That would have done harm to some key areas of the economy and industries, including services, agriculture, dairy products and manufacturing. India’s decision was also influenced by the fact that the RCEP is dominated by China, with whom it has problems other than those related to trade. There are fears that China’s trade rules and predatory practices may not be fully contained by the RCEP framework, and concerns about its increasing presence in 5G telecommunications are real. India already has a free trade agreement with ASEAN, and separate deals with South Korea and Japan. There are also moves for such deals with Australia and New Zealand. During the negotiations, India had sought some safeguards to protect its interests but there was no clear commitment to put them in place. New Delhi considered that as a deal breaker and decided that the balance of advantages and disadvantages was tilted in favour of the latter. The decision to stay out of the deal resulted from this view, aided by the protectionist sentiment that was growing in the country. But it may not be in India’s best interest to keep itself permanently out of such a strong and growing trade bloc. A global free trade system under common rules and regulations is not even a distant possibility now, and regional and bilateral deals are to take its place. India is planning to bilateral trade agreements with the European Union (EU) and the US. But it is doubtful whether the country will get better deals in these trade agreements. Countries which have problems with China, such as Japan and Australia, are also members of the RCEP. The region covered by the RCEP will be economically the most dynamic in the next few years. In the final RCEP agreement, some issues of concern for India like trade in services and movement of people and safeguards have been addressed, and the group has left the door open for India, waiving the normal cooling period. So, there is a case for reviewing the present decision in the coming months.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/indias-rcep-decision-may-need-a-rethink-919916.html
25-11-2020||In Perspective||The (mis)use of ordinance powers||During the initial months of this year’s lockdown, several Indian states, including Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, passed ordinances and notifications exempting businesses in their territories from essential labour laws on sanitation, work hours, and dispute resolution. Some argue that these ordinances are unconstitutional as they violate the right to life under Article 21 and the right against exploitation under Article 23. The public furore surrounding the labour law ordinances brings out some pressing questions: How is the executive supposed to use its ordinance powers? And why is the misuse of ordinance powers so disconcerting – and dangerous -- for our democracy? Article 102 of the Draft Constitution of India, 1948, provided the President with ordinance-making powers. The Article provided for ordinances to be passed by the President when Parliament is not in session if “circumstances exist which render it necessary for him to take immediate action”. Unlike ordinary laws, ordinances would not be scrutinised or debated by the legislature. During the Constituent Assembly debates on this Article, several members expressed concern about the scope for misuse of these powers. Invoking the British practice of passing ordinances to preventively detain Indians for long periods of time, Pocker Sahib Bahadur argued that ordinances could be used to deprive citizens of their personal liberty. H V Kamath and H N Kunzru expressed a similar concern, pointing out that the checks and balances of the ordinary legislative process did not apply to ordinances. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee Babasaheb Ambedkar reminded the Assembly that the ordinance-making power was an emergency power with limited scope. He further stated that ordinances which violated the fundamental rights would be invalid. Ambedkar’s reassurance had the desired effect, and the Assembly passed the draft Article without any amendments. It became Article 123 in the Constitution of India, 1950, while a similar power for the Governor of a state is found in Article 213. The debates in the Constituent Assembly make it clear that the Constitution-framers envisaged a limited ordinance-making power, which was to be exercised in a restrained manner that did not contravene the letter or spirit of the Constitution. Despite this, central and state governments routinely misuse these powers by passing ordinances that violate core constitutional values. The exemptions from labour laws that are in effect in several states are a case study in the misuse of ordinance powers. In Gujarat Mazdoor Sabha vs State of Gujarat (2020), the Supreme Court ruled that a recent notification by the Gujarat government, which exempted factories registered under the Factories Act, 1948, violated both constitutional and statutory law. The court referred to the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) to hold that Article 21 included the right to humane conditions at work and an ‘equal opportunity at social and economic freedom’. While Gujarat Mazdoor Sabha deals with a notification and not an ordinance, the court’s ruling bolsters the argument that exemptions from labour laws are not permitted if they violate important constitutional values – even if their purpose is to mitigate the disastrous impact of Covid-19 on the economy. This strikes a blow against state governments which have used the pandemic to justify the passage of these ordinances. However, the labour law ordinances in other states will remain in effect unless they are withdrawn or struck down by the court. In the meantime, they will impact the constitutional rights of millions of workers who may not have the ability or means to access justice. Democratic backsliding The misuse of ordinance powers is just one way in which the quality of democracy in India has been eroded, a phenomenon also known as ‘democratic backsliding’. Nancy Bermeo observes that actions that directly destabilise democracy -- like coup d’etats or election fraud -- have declined in popularity since the Cold War; instead, they have been replaced with more gradual forms of destabilisation, which occur when a democratically elected executive uses legal channels to enact institutional changes. This correlates with a lack of public trust in democratic institutions and instruments, including the Constitution. The use of legal tools like ordinance powers to enact measures that undermine constitutionally-prescribed values only serves to delegitimise these values in the eyes of the public, especially so during a public health crisis. In Gujarat Mazdoor Sabha, the court declared that the Constitution was “born from a transformative vision which aims to achieve social and economic democracy.” For the Constitution to survive – not only as a text but as a legitimate source of values and norms that dictate our daily life – it is essential that the executive exercises its powers with the restraint imagined by the framers of the Constitution.

25-11-2020||In Perspective||The difficulties of being a ‘Suitable Boy’||A Suitable Boy on Netflix became so popular that I found myself no longer suitable in the eyes of my better half, who has ignored me consistently since the show started airing on Netflix. Its quality and story notwithstanding, like most suitable boys in India, this too caught the envious fancy of one too many competing suitable men, who caused a First Information Report to be registered against the executives of Netflix for offence under Section 295A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (“offence” for short). For the uninitiated, the offence criminalises behaviour that insults religious beliefs and sentiments with imprisonment of up to three years. The phrase “insulting religious beliefs and sentiments” can have potentially infinite number of meanings and in a democratic society, enlightened conversations around these meanings are desirable. However, such subjectivity is alien to criminal law jurisprudence, as held by the Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal vs Union of India, in which Section 66A of the Information Technology Act (which also criminalised “offensive and menacing behaviour” undertaken through the means of a computer), was struck down due to its vague and abstract wording by citing its potential for arbitrary application. While the offence in question has not been declared as ultra-vires the Constitution, its precise scope is discernible by reviewing specific case studies. In Pawan Kamalakar Deshpande vs The State of Maharashtra, the Bombay High Court held that a newspaper/magazine article on terror financing, which also used the picture of a piggy bank while referring to a religious verse/statement, did not qualify as an offence under Section 295A of the IPC, 1860, due to the fact that its primary intent was to convey information about terror financing and not to insult religious sentiments. On the contrary, Telangana MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi remains charge-sheeted as an accused under Section 295A of the IPC for his speech at Adilabad (“Adilabad Speech”) in which he undermined/mocked the strength of the Hindu community, insinuated that Hindus make easy targets for extermination, and denigrated the erotic depictions on certain Hindu temples. Expression of tender affection between a man and a woman in A Suitable Boy (which, ironically, is celebrated in the very temples of Ajantha and Ellora that Owaisi denigrated in his Adilabad speech), stands on an entirely different footing from the case against Owaisi. However, by charging Netflix executives with Section 295A of the IPC, two forms of behaviour completely different from one another are sought to be fit under the same offence, namely Section 295A of the IPC, 1860. How does one reconcile this paradox? One resolution would call for acknowledging the mutually exclusive nature of the offence, i.e., if Owaisi’s Adilabad speech is insulting religious sentiments, a man expressing affection towards a woman, albeit the setting in a temple, is not. That would mean having to choose between charging Owaisi or Netflix but not both, with Section 295A of the IPC. If that is not agreeable, then the only way to justify charging seemingly different behaviours with the same crime is to argue that the wording of the offence is abstract enough to apply to them both. That would, however, ripen the case for the courts to strike down the very provision of Section 295A IPC as unconstitutional by following the precedent set by the Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal vs Union of India. When the case against Netflix is standing on such a weak wicket, it raises legitimate concerns for India as an investment destination for Over the Top (OTT) businesses. As Yuval Noah Harari notes in his seminal work Sapiens, the economic success of Netherlands over Spain during the days of colonial aspirations, particularly as an investment destination, arose out of the assurance of the integrity of the rule of law. The casual manner of charging Netflix for a crime that is seemingly unsustainable deters further investments in the OTT sector and inspires negative perception of the strength of the rule of law in our country. It also calls into question the role of law enforcement in the ideological battles of our times. The antidote to the vitriolic left-right/liberal- conservative political discourses around the globe is law enforcement acting as a referee administering and moderating the debate with the rules and tenets of the Constitution without taking sides. This is the essence of a secular republic. If we are to accept that it is desirable for the police and law enforcement to remain neutral but vigilant referees in our ideological discourses, then we must also be critical of law enforcement when they take sides in the liberal-conservative debates at the expense of compromising the objectivity and integrity of the rule of law.

In her memorandum to the Union Minister, Karandlaje said coffee growers in the country have been suffering huge losses due to the impact of the climatic conditions. The coffee growers in Karnataka and other states have suffered a severe blow in the past few years due to floods and drought, she said. As a relief package, the Centre should take steps to restructure their short-term and long-term crop loans and make it one long-term loan with a reduced interest rate, Karandlaje added. All crop loans and development loans availed by coffee growers, including accrued interest, should be converted into long-term loans for a nine-year period with a 2-year moratorium and a reduced interest rate of 3 %, she suggested.  She also urged the Minister to take steps to sanction new loans to all coffee growers with 3 % interest through commercial banks.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/bjp-mp-shobha-karandlaje-seeks-relief-package-for-coffee-growers-919888.html

In a letter written to the chief minister, Guttedar said there were about 80 lakh people belonging to the Ediga community in the state and they had lagged behind socially and economically. They were rendered jobless after a ban was imposed on extracting neera (toddy) in the state. Hence, a corporation should be created and Rs 400 crore should be set aside for the development of the community, he urged. Guttedar told DH that he had demanded that the corporation be formed when Siddaramaiah was chief minister. The corporation could not be established though it was announced in the budget. “Now, my party BJP is in power. I have not sought Cabinet berth for me, but have demanded that a corporation should be created for the betterment of the community. I can be a minister for two or three years, if I get a berth. But the community will benefit if the corporation is established. I hope the chief minister will fulfill my demand,” Guttedar said. “A corporation has been established even for micro-communities. The people of Ediga community who are in large numbers in the state have not got much facilities from the government. More funds should be earmarked on the lines of money set aside for the Karnataka Veerashaiva-Lingayat Development Board,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/guttedar-seeks-corporation-for-ediga-community-919896.html

Speaking to reporters here on Wednesday, the leaders said that the government must come out with a proper measure on the issue. Srinivas Prasad said, "The government must intervene and resolve the issue of private schools demanding fee from parents amidst the Covid-19 crisis. Schools are under the government and the government is not under the schools." MLC A H Vishwanath said, "The government and the Education department should look into the issue. When no school is open, and not conducting offline classes, it is not right to demand fees. The government should take strict action and the Education Minister S Suresh Kumar must look into it." However, private education institutions claim that it is not possible to run schools without collecting fees. "Though there are no offline classes, teachers are conducting classes online and we have to pay them salary and invest on maintenance of the schools,” said an administrator of a reputed private school. “Let the government take over private schools until Covid-19 is eradicated. Let them maintain the schools and pay teachers' salaries. Is it possible for us to pay from the pocket?" asked another school manager. However, teachers claim that many schools are misusing the Covid crisis. "A majority of the schools have collected fees, but they are not paying salaries. Since the outbreak of Covid, we are receiving only half the salary. Though 80% of the parents have paid full fees, school authorities claim that only 10% parents have paid the fees. The Education department must act against schools misusing the situation," said a teacher.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/govt-must-resolve-school-fee-issue-say-bjp-leaders-919921.html

25-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||Looks like BS Yediyurappa will go, says Congress leader Siddaramaiah||Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah on Wednesday wondered if Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa was on his way out after the government appointed over two dozen people to various statutory boards and corporations in the past few days. “Maybe it’s guaranteed that he’s going,” Siddaramaiah said of Yediyurappa. “What, then, was the need to make these appointments hurriedly?” Siddaramaiah was critical of the appointments made by the government at a time when the state was reeling under financial stress. The Yediyurappa administration has appointed over 30 people as chairpersons and directors at various boards and corporations. This includes MLAs, ex-MLAs, party workers and supporters. “The government hasn’t paid old-age pension, widow pension and pension for the physically handicapped. There’s no money. What was the need to appoint chairpersons? I don’t know,” Siddaramaiah said. “Financially, the government is broke. I’ve said this many times that unnecessary expenditure should be cut and more funds should be provided for development works,” he said, adding that the recent slew of political appointments would only increase unnecessary expenditure. “It amounts to cheating the state.” The appointments to boards and corporations came even as Yediyurappa was awaiting directions from the BJP central leadership on whether he should expand or reshuffle his Cabinet. Plus, rumours continue in political circles over a possible change in leadership.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/looks-like-bs-yediyurappa-will-go-says-congress-leader-siddaramaiah-919767.html
25-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||Am I the only to have made wealth, asks DK Shivakumar||KPCC president D K Shivakumar on Wednesday said he was not the only one in the state to have accumulated wealth, suggesting that he was being targeted.  The former minister is under the CBI lens in an alleged case of disproportionate assets (DA) case. He appeared before the agency during the day in response to summons.  “Am I the only one who has made wealth? Till now, how many people has the CBI taken up a DA case against? Is there a commission against me or is there proof, complaint or a court case against me? Have I accepted a bribe or misused government office,” Shivakumar asked while speaking to reporters prior to appearing before the CBI.  He said Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa could have got these charges probed without having to get the CBI involved. “The Advocate General, in his advice to the government, had said that this was not a case to be given (to CBI). He said the state’s Anti-Corruption Bureau could have taken it up,” Shivakumar said.  The Congress leader said he would not comment on the CBI’s style of functioning. “They have a manual that they follow. I have gone through the manual, which is what I did for 48 days (in prison). What can officials do anyway, except obeying what they’re told to do?” he said, adding that he was ready to cooperate with the CBI. On October 5, the CBI raided 14 locations across Bengaluru, Delhi and Mumbai that were linked to Shivakumar, in connection with alleged corruption cases against him. In a statement, the CBI said it had booked the former minister for allegedly possessing disproportionate assets worth Rs 74 crore.  The CBI’s raids were preceded by a preliminary inquiry in March 2020, when Shivakumar was appointed as the KPCC president.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/am-i-the-only-to-have-made-wealth-asks-dk-shivakumar-919899.html

He was 71. “I regret to announce the sad and untimely demise of my father, Mr Ahmed Patel at 25/11/2020, 3:30 a.m. After testing positive for Covid-19 around a month back, his health worsened further due to multiple organ failure,” Faisal Patel, the veteran leader’s son, said in a statement. Patel had tested positive for Covid-19 on October 1 and was admitted to Metro Hospital in Faridabad. He was shifted to the ICU of the Medanta Superspeciality Hospital in Gurgaon earlier this month. The demise of Patel, a key troubleshooter for the Congress and a trusted aide of party chief Sonia Gandhi, comes at a time when the party is facing its worst ever crisis after successive election losses. “In Sh, Ahmed Patel, I have lost a colleague whose entire life was dedicated to the Congress party. His faithfulness and dedication, his commitment to his duty, his always being there to help, his generosity were rare qualities that distinguished him from others,” Congress President Sonia Gandhi said. “I have lost an irreplaceable comrade, a faithful colleague and a friend,” she said. “It is a sad day.

25-11-2020||National||India's low-caste women are raped to be kept 'in their place'||Lower-caste Dalit women in northern India are targeted for rape by upper-caste men who usually escape justice as survivors bow to pressure to drop their cases, researchers found on Wednesday. Only 10% of 40 rape cases involving Dalit women and girls in Haryana state ended with the conviction of all those charged, and these involved murders or victims under the age of six, found two rights groups, Equality Now and the Swabhiman Society. In almost 60% of cases, the survivor withdrew her case and accepted a "compromise" settlement outside the legal system, usually after unofficial village councils, or Khap Panchayats, coerced the women to abandon their quest for justice, it said. "Survivors are threatened, face violence, their families are ostracised and there is extreme pressure to stay silent," Manisha Mashaal, founder of the Dalit rights group, Swabhiman Society, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. "To access justice, survivors have to put their lives at risk and endanger their families as well." Haryana's director general of police Manoj Yadava said that he was unaware of the report, adding that they had a "zero tolerance" policy to crimes against women in the state. The rights groups said men from dominant castes frequently use sexual violence as a weapon to reinforce caste and gender hierarchies, which place India's 200 million Dalits on the lowest rung of an ancient caste hierarchy. The report highlights the challenges Dalits face in getting justice, despite tougher anti-rape laws introduced after a fatal gang-rape in 2012, and nationwide protests last month over the alleged gang rape of a Dalit teen who later died. "Dalit women's bodies are being used to assert caste supremacy and keep women 'in their place'," Jacqui Hunt, Eurasia Director of women's rights group, Equality Now, said in a statement. "Perpetrators from dominant castes know they are likely to go unpunished because every branch and echelon of the system is weighted in their favour, and this impunity for rape creates an enabling environment that fosters further abuse." In almost 90% of cases, at least one of the accused was from a dominant caste, with men often acting in groups to carry out gang-rape and murder, the research found. 'My mother cries' The police frequently failed to record or investigate crimes when initially reported and were sometimes abusive or put pressure on survivors to drop cases, the report said, with survivors not given adequate advice about their legal rights. "I can guarantee that every complaint that is brought to the police is being registered and investigated," Yadava said. "We have 32 all-women police stations and a women's helpline number. We are not hiding any cases coming to us or brushing them under the carpet. We are proud of our record of action against these crimes." He added that out of court settlements were a social problem and awareness was being created to address it. But one 28-year-old survivor said her family were being harassed by a man who raped her in 2018 after she rejected his advances. "Even before I could recover from the trauma of what had happened, his family and other upper-caste men were at our doorstep," said the woman. "I was forced to marry my rapist and then tortured by the family. I ran away and decided to fight my case. But every day they show up to threaten us and my mother cries in fear. I hope I get justice and all this trauma will finally end."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-low-caste-women-are-raped-to-be-kept-in-their-place-919655.html

25-11-2020||National||10 things to know about Uttar Pradesh's law on 'love jihad'||Amid raging debates, Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday gave its nod to the law criminalising alleged attempts of deceitful or forced religious conversion of Hindu women to Islam in the guise of marriage. This comes in the wake of a strong campaign by the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Right parties to stop interfaith marriages, termed 'love jihad' which they believe is a move by Muslim men to lure Hindu women away from their religion, by marrying them.  As arguments and counter-arguments shroud the much-discussed and controversial topic, let us take a look at what this law entails. 1. Conversion for the alleged purpose of marriage is, however, only one aspect of the draft ordinance. 2. The state government has said that the law also aims to prohibit religious conversion done using dishonest means, such as false representation, through force, influence, torture, allurement or for the sake of marriage. 3. Under the proposed law, a marriage will be declared “null and void” if the conversion of a woman is solely for that purpose (marriage). 4. According to the ordinance, the onus to prove that conversion is not fraudulent lies both on the person carrying out the alleged conversion and the person undergoing conversion. 5. Those wishing to change their religion after marriage need to apply to the district magistrate two months in advance, according to the draft ordinance. Conversion will be allowed only after this permission is granted. 7. Uttar Pradesh Cabinet Minister and government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh said the ordinance provides punishment with imprisonment for a minimum period of one year and a maximum period of five years besides a fine of Rs 15,000. 8. In case of minor girls and women from SC and ST communities, the minimum imprisonment would be two years while the maximum imprisonment will be ten years besides a fine of Rs 25,000. 9. Three years of minimum and ten years of maximum imprisonment will be meted out for mass religious conversion. 10. A fine of Rs 50,000 may be imposed on the offenders. In cases of mass religious conversion, the registration of the social organisations will be cancelled and strong action initiated against them. In recent weeks, BJP-ruled states, such as Haryana and Madhya Pradesh have also hinted at enacting laws to counter attempts of 'love jihad'. However, distancing itself from the controversy, Shiv Sena on Tuesday said that 'love jihad' first needs to be legally defined before putting such kaws in place. The ordinance comes within days of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's warning that those indulging in 'love jihad' must prepare for their 'Ram Naam Satya' journey. "We will bring an effective law. It is my warning to those who play with the honour and dignity of sisters and daughters by hiding their real names and identities. If they do not mend their ways, their ''Ram Naam Satya'' journey will start," he had said, referring to the funeral chant, reiterating his stern threat.

25-11-2020||National||What is the definition of 'Love Jihad'?||Uttar Pradesh, one of the first states under the saffron party’s regime, declared an ordinance against the ‘love jihad’, which grants five years of imprisonment to those found guilty. The Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka governments, both under the BJP rule, followed suit and announced that a rule in principle will be brought in soon. As many states have set the ball rolling to ban ‘love jihad’, several questions loom surrounding these recent developments — What is the definition of ‘love jihad’? How can one pin down the notion of ‘jihad’ behind ‘love’? Does it cross the lines of inter-religion marriages? Love Jihad, according to the Urban Dictionary, is the act “when a Muslim male/female marries a non-Muslim and converts them”. The minister added, “Article 25 of the Constitution provides for the freedom to profess, practice and propagate religion subject to public order, morality and health. Various courts have upheld this view including the Kerala High Court.” The BJP government has, so far, not provided any said definition for the term, neither during Parliament sessions nor state legislatures. Earlier this year in October, the National Commission for Women had met the Maharashtra Governor, and said that the agency’s head, Rekha Sharma, had discussed regarding “issues related to women safety in the state including defunct One Stop Centres, molestation and rape of women patients at Covid centres and rise in love jihad cases”. Aniket Aga, a professor at the Ashoka University had filed an RTI to get NCW’s response on October 23, 2020. Later, after several other controversies adjoining the issue, Sharma alleged that her Twitter handle was hacked and filed a complaint with Twitter India for “suspicious activity” from her account, according to reports. Madhya Pradesh was the first state to bring in a law against forced religious conversion for any purpose including marriage, drafted by the then Congress government in 1954, and passed in 1968. The law was under the Madhya Pradesh Dharma Swatantrata Adhiniyam or Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act. Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday said “Love Jihad” is a term “manufactured” by the BJP to disturb communal harmony, provoking a sharp reaction from Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat.  BJP’s former Maharashtra ally Shiv Sena on Tuesday said 'Love Jihad' needs to be first defined legally, and saffron leaders should come out of the "illusion" that they can trouble the Maharashtra government by harping on the issue. With several question marks hanging over the law against this ‘social evil’, the Uttar Pradesh government may have to now soon provide the blurry concept of ‘Love Jihad’ a clearer focus.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/what-is-the-definition-of-love-jihad-919701.html

25-11-2020||National||India lashes out at Pakistan, says the country is host to largest number of UN proscribed terrorists||India has reminded Pakistan, the “host to the world’s largest number of UN proscribed terrorists and entities”, of Abbottabad, the garrison city where al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden hid for years and was killed, in a hard-hitting response as Islamabad’s UN envoy gave a “dossier of lies” to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador T S Tirumurti on Tuesday tweeted that the “dossier of lies presented by Pakistan enjoys zero credibility”. “Concocting documents and peddling false narratives is not new to Pakistan, host to the world's largest number of UN proscribed terrorists and entities. Remember Abbottabad!” he said. The Indian Ambassador’s tweet was in response to Islamabad’s UN envoy Munir Akram meeting Guterres to hand over the dossier from the Pakistan government that alleged India was promoting terrorism in the country. In his stinging tweet, Tirumurti made a reference to the Pakistani garrison city of Abbottabad, where bin Laden was hiding for years and was killed in an operation by the US Navy Seals in May 2011. Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Monday briefed top envoys of key nations, including the US, Russia, France and Japan on the planned terror attack by Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in Nagrota in Jammu which was foiled by security forces on November 19. The heads of missions were provided with a comprehensive "information docket" giving the details of the incident, and also a list of items and ammunition recovered from terrorists, clearly indicating their Pakistani origins. The envoys were sensitised about India's concerns regarding Pakistan's sustained efforts to "destabilise" the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and to "subvert" upcoming local elections and democracy in the union territory, sources said. Four suspected JeM terrorists, who were hiding in a truck, were killed by security forces near Nagrota in an encounter on Thursday morning after which the government asserted that a major terror attack was foiled by the Indian security forces. India is all set to join the powerful UN Security Council as a non-permanent member for a two-year term beginning January 1, 2021.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-lashes-out-at-pakistan-says-the-country-is-host-to-largest-number-of-un-proscribed-terrorists-919738.html
25-11-2020||National||SC stays Andhra Pradesh HC order gagging media from publishing news on FIR related to Amravati land scam||The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the Andhra Pradesh High Court's September 15 order gagging the media from reporting a case of alleged corruption and illegal land transactions in shifting of state capital to Amravati. A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah stayed the HC's interim order which prohibited publication of news with regard to the registration of an FIR in any electronic, print or social media. The top court, however, issued notice to former Advocate General Dammalapati Srinivas and others on whose plea the HC had passed the order. Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for the Y S Jaganmohan Reddy government, contended that the HC order was unprecedented as it acted on a writ petition which was "entirely of political nature against the Chief Minister and the state government". "When there were allegations against certain land transfers, should it not be investigated?" he asked. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the former A-G, submitted that as many as 25 criminal cases were pending against the Chief Minister and the present government wanted to destroy reputation of this lawyer. Dhavan said even the CBI was sent a letter on March 23 for probe, the HC, however, passed the order not only staying the probe but also publication of news regarding it. He also referred to bland allegations made in the petition like "there was utter disregard of the Constitution" which can't be the basis for relief in a criminal case. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for other parties, submitted that the HC can very well deal with the matter and the top court should not interfere. But there was a vote of no confidence against the HC and the CM made allegations against the Chief Justice. The case is about "regime revenge", he said. The court, however, said the matter required consideration and put it for hearing in January. It also sought a response from the parties in the petition. The state government, in its petition filed by advocate Mahfooz A Nazki, sought stay on the HC's order, saying "the investigation process is at a nascent stage and the stay of the investigation may lead to destruction of material documents, tampering of evidence and evasion of the investigation process". It said the HC's order, granting blanket stay, was erroneous, illegal, perverse and liable to be set aside as the accused persons did not enjoy any immunity or privilege.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-stays-andhra-pradesh-hc-order-gagging-media-from-publishing-news-on-fir-related-to-amravati-land-scam-919741.html
25-11-2020||National||IMA’s opposition against Ayush doctors is hypocrisy, says CCIM Chairman: Report||Last week, the Centre allowed post-graduate Ayurveda doctors to perform a variety of surgeries. Following which, the Ayush Ministry was accused of mixing up modern medicine with ancient Indian Ayurvedic system. “The National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) wrote to allopathic hospitals that they will not recognise Ayush doctors. We welcome this. But the fact remains that 95 per cent ICUs are manned by Ayush practitioners. It is the allopathy doctors who teach them everything about how to manage the ICY, insert central line, give IV etc. Why do they do it? For them to make money. Then these doctors go and sit in the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and object to Ayush doctors being used. It is just hypocrisy,” Deopujari told the publication. The IMA on November 24 demanded withdrawal of the notification authorising post-graduate Ayurveda practitioners to be trained to perform general surgical procedures, saying the move was a "khichadification", or a confused mix, of medical education and practice.  The November 20 notification by the CCIM, a statutory body under the Ayush Ministry to regulate the Indian systems of medicine, listed 39 general surgery procedures and around 19 procedures involving the eye, ear, nose and throat, by amending the Indian Medicine Central Council (Post Graduate Ayurveda Education) Regulations, 2016. CCIM's Jayant Deopujari added that changing the prefix of AYUSH doctors working in allopathic hospitals would make no difference. "There is a great demand for Ayurvedic practitioners and it is increasing. Some things are decided by society, When engineering colleges became too many they went empty. Neither government nor any university could do anything about it. Society decided that they want to put their children only in reputed institutes. The government decided that they cannot let Ayush treat Covid-19..." While the Ayush Ministry issued a clarification claiming that the technical terms and modern developments are a common heritage of mankind, the IMA rejected their clarification as being "deceptive camouflage of mixing the systems of medicine".  (With agency inputs)||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ima-s-opposition-against-ayush-doctors-is-hypocrisy-says-ccim-chairman-report-919747.html
25-11-2020||National||India's cumulative Covid-19 positivity rate falls as testing increases||With the total number of tests conducted for the detection of Covid-19 nearing 13.5 crore in the country, the health ministry on Wednesday said comprehensive and widespread testing on a sustained basis has resulted in bringing down the positivity rate. The progressive decline in the national cumulative Covid-19 positivity rate has demonstrated that the rate of spread of the infection is being effectively contained in the country, the ministry underlined. The cumulative positivity rate has been steadily falling and has touched 6.84 per cent as on date while the daily positivity rate stands at 3.83 per cent, it said. The country has demonstrated a consistent strengthening of its Covid-19 testing infrastructure since January, resulting in an exponential increase in the testing numbers, the ministry said. With 11,59,032 tests conducted for the detection of the coronavirus infection in a span of 24 hours, the total number of such tests is nearing 13.5 crore (13,48,41,307). "Comprehensive and widespread testing on a sustained basis has resulted in bringing down the positivity rate. The progressive decline in the national cumulative positivity rate has demonstrated that the rate of spread of the infection is being effectively contained," the ministry said. The sustained and progressive expansion of the testing infrastructure has played a crucial role in the steep rise in the testing numbers. With 2,138 testing laboratories in the country -- 1,167 government-run, 971 private -- the daily testing capacity has got a substantial boost, the ministry said. As a result, the tests per million per day figure in India is five times more than the standard set by the World Health Organization (WHO), it highlighted. The present active caseload (4,44,746) in the country accounts for 4.82 per cent of the total cases and has been sustained at below five per cent. The country registered 37,816 new recoveries in a day, taking the total number of recovered cases to 86,42,771, which exceeds that of the active cases by 81,98,025, the ministry said. It said 77.53 per cent of the new recoveries are contributed by 10 states and Union territories. Kerala leads the tally with 5,149, followed by Delhi (4,943) and Maharashtra (4,086). Ten states and Union territories accounted for 76.51 per cent of the 44,376 new cases, with Delhi reporting the highest of 6,224, followed by Maharashtra (5,439) and Kerala (5,420), the ministry said. Of the 481 case fatalities reported in the last 24 hours, 74.22 per cent are concentrated in 10 states and Union territories. Delhi reported 109 fresh deaths, while West Bengal saw a fatality count of 49 and Uttar Pradesh 33.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-cumulative-covid-19-positivity-rate-falls-as-testing-increases-919751.html

25-11-2020||National||Some judicial pronouncements gave distinct impression of overreach: VP M Venkaiah Naidu||Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday flagged his concerns over "judicial overreach" referring to the recent Supreme Court judgement on Diwali fireworks and some other judicial pronouncements including on the Collegium issue and the ban on plying of more than 10-year-old diesel vehicles and more than 15- year-old petrol vehicles. Speaking at the 80th All India Presiding Officers' Conference on "Harmonious Coordination between Legislature, Executive and Judiciary - Key to Vibrant Democracy" in Kevadia in Gujarat, Naidu said "there have been quite a few judicial pronouncements that gave a distinct impression of an overreach. These actions have resulted in an avoidable blurring of the contours demarcated by the Constitution.” Higher judiciary deciding on Diwali fireworks, banning of use vehicles of certain make after 10 or 15 years, monitoring police investigations, denying the executive any role in the appointment of judges through collegiums, invalidating the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act seeking to enforce accountability and transparency etc were some instances, he referred to being perceived as instances of judicial overreach. Naidu hailed the role of the Supreme Court and the high courts in having delivered several far-reaching verdicts since independence in furtherance of socio-economic objectives, besides making correctional interventions but flagged that occasionally, concerns have been raised as to whether they were entering the domains of the legislative and executive wings. "There have been debates as to whether some issues should have been more legitimately left to the other organs of the government," he said. Quoting some observations of the Supreme Court concerning it’s domain and powers, Naidu stressed that even the principle of ‘first among equals’ does not apply to the apex court and only the Constitution is supreme. “We consider our State to be in its best state when each of the three organs of the State perform to the best of its potential in the domains specified for each of them, in pursuit of the mandate defined and in the manner prescribed in the Constitution. It is not desirable for the judiciary to be perceived as acting as super executive or super legislature," the Vice President said. Naidu also referred to instances of other two organs - Legislature and the Executive crossing the ‘lakshman rekha’ in different degrees by encroaching into the domain of others in violation of the checks and balances provided in the Constitution, as he underlined the importance of the harmonious working of all the three organs. He said the legislature, the executive and the judiciary are bound to work within their respective domains as defined in the Constitution. Naidu expressed concern over the functioning of the legislatures. Calling the Presiding Officers as the ‘high priests of temples of democracy’, the Rajya Sabha Chairman urged them to ensure the sanctity of these temples. Talking about the public opinion turning against the law making bodies and the legislators over the year, Naidu said frequent disruptions, conduct of legislators both within and outside the chambers of the Houses, rising number of lawmakers with criminal background, rising money power in elections, flaunting of power by legislators are some of the reasons for this negative perception. "Decency, Decorum and Dignity of the temples of democracy will be upheld only through adherence to the other three Ds namely, Debate, Discuss and Decide," Naidh, who has a penchant for alliterations, said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/some-judicial-pronouncements-gave-distinct-impression-of-overreach-vp-m-venkaiah-naidu-919758.html

Use of unparliamentary language and indiscipline in the House by elected members hurts the sentiments of people who elect them, Kovind said addressing the inaugural session of 80th All India Presiding Officers' Conference at Tent City in Gujarat's Kevadia village, near the Statue of Unity in Narmada district. "It is expected from elected representatives that they remain committed to democratic values. The biggest challenge for elected representatives and democratic institutions is to fulfil the expectations of people," he said. "I believe that people of this country expect that their elected representatives to follow parliamentary norms. People get hurt when their elected representatives use unparliamentary words or indulge in indiscipline in Parliament or in the Assembly," Kovind said. He also asked Speakers to facilitate a healthy dialogue in the House to keep away unnecessary bitterness in the discussion. In a parliamentary democracy, the Opposition has an important role along with the ruling party, and so there is a need for understanding, cooperation, and meaningful exchange of thoughts between the two, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/people-expect-discipline-from-elected-representatives-president-ram-nath-kovind-919762.html

The state cabinet presided over by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had on Tuesday given its nod to the draft ordinance providing for jail up to 10 years and fine of Rs 50,000 for those violating its clauses. “The good thing is that the new ordinance does not use the term ‘love jihad’ and the forced conversion which has been termed as illegal and punishable is something that is already held as crime in the Muslim law. In the Quran also, the Allah has said force in religion is not justified and so we have no objection to punishment over it,” senior member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) Khalid Rashid Farangimahli told PTI. Love jihad is a term coined by a section of Hindu groups for Muslim men allegedly forcing women to convert in the guise of love and marriage. “We are of the opinion that for peace and communal harmony, it is needed that Muslims and Hindus marry in their own communities. We have no objection to whatever we have seen in the ordinance," Farangimahli said. The AIMPLB member stressed that whenever any law is enacted, it is based on the intention that there would not be any discrimination with anyone. “We also expect that this law will not be used wrongly. The legal expert will have to see that the law does not raise a question mark on the constitutional right to freedom of religion for all Indians. Otherwise, we have no objection to this law,” he said. Shaista Amber, president, All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board, however, said there was no need for such a law. “If anyone is getting married on the basis of deceit and forcibly getting the other person converted, there should be a stringent law for it and we already have laws for it. There was no need to bring a new law,” she said. Stressing that there are laws to check deceit in marriage, Amber said if the government has decided to bring a new law, it should also be ensured that it is not misused and people’s right to freedom of expression is not harmed. Another senior AIMPLB member Zafaryab Jilani reasoned if two adults get married, even if they belong to different castes, religions or even nations, their marriage is their private right. The apex court has also accepted this fact, Jilani, also a senior counsel, said. Muslim religious leader Sajid Rashidi, however, saw in it an attempt to polarise the society ahead of the West Bengal assembly elections. “Law already exists against forced conversion, but since the elections to the West Bengal assembly are due there is a need to prepare a political ground and create hatred between Hindus and Muslims,” he alleged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/muslims-react-with-caution-to-up-govts-ordinance-against-conversion-for-marriage-919800.html

A bench of Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna gave one week's time to the hospital to file the written compilation and related documents. The court posted the matter for consideration in December. Earlier, the bench had issued notice to the hospital, on whose plea the top court had on April 26, 2019, stayed the proceedings, including the summoning of all records by the Justice A Arumughaswamy Commission. The Tamil Nadu government, in an application, contended that the tenure of the Commission has been extended eight times since it was set up on September 27, 2017 and it was incurring Rs 4.26 lakh per month towards salary for the staff. The Commission had already examined 154 witnesses, including 56 doctors from the Apollo and five from AIIMS, 12 government doctors, including a medical board of five doctors, 22 paramedical staff and 59 other witnesses, it said. The state government also alleged the Apollo Hospitals, which readily acceded to and participated in the proceedings of the Inquiry Commission, adopted dilatory tactics to unnecessarily delay the inquiry and publication of the final report. It also asked the court to give an early date of hearing. Jayalalithaa was treated for 75 days at the Apollo Hospitals in Chennai until her death on December 5, 2016. The hospital has challenged the Madras High Court's order of April 4, 2019, whereby it had refused to stay the proceedings, including the summoning of all records by the Commission.  The high court had said though the apprehension of bias may be justified, the Commission should be allowed to continue the proceedings as its findings may not be binding but would determine the future course of action by the state government. As many as 30 volumes of medical records, CDs have been furnished before the Commission by the state government to look into the circumstances leading to the death of Jayalalithaa.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-asks-apollo-hospitals-to-respond-to-tamil-nadu-govts-plea-to-allow-inquiry-into-former-cm-j-jayalalithaas-death-919806.html

Addressing a webinar organised by realtors body NAREDCO, he said the government's Affordable Rental Housing Complex (ARHC) scheme for migrants, which was launched few months ago, has been progressing well and the programme has the potential to stop creation of slums in cities. Mishra said the housing sales have revived after unlocking of the economy on the back of several measures taken by the Centre as well as state governments. He said some states like Maharashtra and Karnataka have reduced stamp duty on registration of properties to boost sales. The secretary said the Centre had advised all States/UTs to cut stamp duty for giving fillip to the housing segment. "Model Tenancy law is ready. It has been translated into various languages as it has far-reaching implications," Mishra said. The deadline for feedback on the proposed model tenancy law ended on October 31 and now States have been asked to send those feedbacks after compiling it, he said. The secretary said the model tenancy will come "very soon". Mishra pointed out that 1.1 crore homes were vacant as per 2011 census as people fear to give their homes on rent. The model tenancy law will eliminate anomalies and give a boost to the real estate sector, he said. The Centre will send the Model Tenancy Law, after approval from the Union Cabinet, to States for its adoption. The draft model tenancy law proposes that landowners will have to give a notice in writing three months before revising rent. It advocated appointing a district collector as rent authority and heavy penalty on tenants for overstaying. On the ARHC scheme, Mishra said the initial response has been very encouraging and the already completed units have been handed over in cities like Surat and Chandigarh. "This scheme is the answer for ending slums in the country. No one wants to live in slums," he said. Talking about the Rs 25,000-crore stress fund to complete stuck real estate projects, Mishra said around Rs 13,000 crore has been committed so far in 135 real estate projects, which would benefit 87,000 homebuyers. He said the government is regularly reviewing the progress of this stress fund -- Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH). The secretary asked builders to take advantage of recent tax relief announced by the government in clearing their unsold inventories. Recently, the government relaxed income tax rules to allow primary or first sale of housing units of up to Rs 2 crore at a price that can be 20 per cent below the stamp duty circle rate. Earlier, the law restricted differential between circle rate and agreement value at 10 per cent. The secretary complimented realtors bodies NAREDCO and CREDAI for creating their own online platforms for property sales and asked them to promote them as well as take feedback from people. He said these two platforms could become Amazon of real estate with e-commerce becoming popular among young generation. Mishra said Indian real estate sector not only contributes in the country's GDP but is a major employment generator. It creates demand for 250-300 ancillary industries. He emphasized on skill improvement and use of modern technologies for faster completion of construction works. NAREDCO Chairman Rajeev Talwar and President Niranjan Hiranandani thanked the central government for helping the sector in tiding over the crisis. Rajan Bandelkar, Vice Chairman, NAREDCO West and Ashok Mohanani, President NAREDCO West also highlighted several steps taken by the Centre and Maharashtra government to boost demand.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-to-soon-come-out-with-model-tenancy-law-919810.html

States are also allowed to reduce the number of people attending social, religious, sports, entertainment, educational, cultural, religious and other gatherings to 100 in closed places from the existing ceiling of 200 based on the ground situation. The 'Guidelines for Surveillance, Containment and Caution', which was issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Wednesday against the backdrop of rising Covid-19 cases following festival season and onset of winter, will come into effect from December 1 and be in place till the month-end.  As per the guidelines, all activities, except a few, are allowed outside containment zones. International air traffic, barring those allowed by the MHA, will remain suspended while swimming pools will continue to be allowed only for training of sports persons. Exhibition halls will be allowed only for Business to Business purposes. The guidelines, which put the onus on district, police and municipal authorities under the state governments for strict implementation, comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a video conference with Chief Ministers on Covid-19 situation. Amid concerns that the tracing of contacts have taken a back-seat, the new guidelines ask the states to ensure that listing of contacts are carried out in respect of all people found positive.  The guideline sets a 72 hour deadline for tracking, identifying and quarantining 80 per cent of the people who came in contact with a person tested positive for Covid-19. The authorities should ensure quick isolation of patients in treatment facilities or their homes while clinical interventions shall be administered. Surveillance for cases of Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) should be carried out in health facilities or outreach mobile units or through fever clinics in buffer zones. States should ensure careful demarcation of containment zones, where only essential services should be allowed. Strict perimetre control should be ensured so that there is no movement in or out of these zones, except for medical emergencies and maintaining essential supplies, while intensive house-to-house surveillance and testing as prescribed should be conducted.    While allowing states to impose local restrictions like night curfew, the MHA has reiterated that the states cannot unilaterally declare lockdown outside containment zones at local or state-level without prior consultation with the Centre. With more and more offices functioning following the unlocking of restrictions, the new guidelines said the states could consider implementing staggered office timings and other measures in cities where the positivity rate is more than 10 per cent. As officials point out that there is laxity in adhering to Covid-19 protocols, the MHA told the states that they could consider administrative actions, including imposition of appropriate fines, on persons not wearing face masks in public and work spaces. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) will also be issuing a Standard Operating Procedure for social distancing in crowded places, especially in markets, weekly bazaars and public transport. An official statement said the main focus of the guidelines is to consolidate the substantial gains that have been achieved against the spread of Covid-19 which is visible in the steady decline in the number of active cases in the country.  "Further, keeping in view the recent spike in new cases in a few states/union territories, ongoing festival season and onset of winter, it is emphasised that to fully overcome the pandemic, there is need to maintain caution and to strictly follow the prescribed containment strategy, focussed on surveillance, containment and strict observance of the guidelines/SOPs issued by MHA and MoHFW," it said. The guidelines also said there will be no restriction on inter-state and intra-state movement of persons and goods including those for cross land-border trade under treaties with neighbouring countries. No separate permission/approval/e-permit will be required for such movements. Vulnerable persons -- persons above 65 years of age, persons with co-morbidities, pregnant women, and children below the age of 10 years -- are advised to stay at home, except for meeting essential requirements and for health purposes. The use of Aarogya Setu mobile application will continue to be encouraged, it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-issues-fresh-covid-19-guidelines-allows-states-to-impose-night-curfew-919811.html

25-11-2020||National||After Sushil Modi's sensational tweet, Lalu's audio clip goes viral||Rashtriya Janata Dals jailed president Lalu Prasads alleged attempts to poach MLAs of the ruling NDA in Bihar and topple the newly formed Nitish Kumar government on Wednesday stirred the political waters in the state. Sushil Kumar Modi, the Chief Ministers former deputy and trusted lieutenant in the BJP, who had made a sensational claim on the previous night that Prasad was having access to a mobile phone through which he was calling up NDA legislators, followed it up with an audio clip of a purported conversation between the RJD supremo, who is in Ranchi, and a saffron party MLA. Modi shared the one and a half minute long clip on his official Twitter handle wherein Prasad can be heard speaking, in his unique voice and distinct accent, to the Pirpainti MLA Lalan Kumar. "We will take good care of you. Just help us tomorrow in defeating the NDAs candidate for the Speakers post, Prasad can be heard saying in the audio. In the audio, the MLA can be heard mumbling about the difficulties that he may face if he voted against his own party to which Prasad replies in an assuring tone "you need not worry. We are going to have our own Speaker. We will also reward you further once we topple this government and form our own". लालू यादव ने दिखाई अपनी असलियत The BJP MLA sought to confirm the veracity of the audio clip and said the conversation took place in the very presence of Sushil Kumar Modi, apparently not in knowledge of the wily RJD supremo. "I was in a meeting with Sushil Modi when my personal assistant came to inform that there is a call from Lalu Prasad on my mobile. I was surprised but thought that like many others he might have called to congratulate me upon recent electoral victory", Lalan Kumar told reporters here.. "He is such a senior leader. So I duly greeted him with a respectful pranaam. He began to speak of toppling the government etc. I tried to reason out that I am bound by party discipline......After hanging up, I informed Sushil Modi", said the MLA. Modi, who had in a tweet on Tuesday night claimed to have called up RJD supremo and warned him against "dirty tricks", congratulated his party colleague Vijay Kumar Sinha upon election as the Speaker and remarked "Lalu Prasads conspiracy has been foiled". The RJD chief is serving sentences in a number of fodder scam cases. Deputy Chief Minister Tar Kishor Prasad strongly criticised the incident. He told reporters in the assembly premises that they would ask Jharkhand government to look into the matter and if needed would even approach the centre for a high level inquiry into it. Bihar minister Mukesh Sahni, founder of the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) who broke his alliance with the RJD just ahead of the elections and joined the NDA, indignant over the senior partners condescension in the sharing of seats, also took the opportunity to twist the knife. "Those who make calls to MLAs with the intent to topple a government have no right to speak of democratic norms", said Sahni on the floor of the assembly while congratulating Sinha on his election as the Speaker. The RJD, meanwhile, remained tight-lipped over the episode and chose not to deny the allegations levelled against its maverick chief. However, debutant MLA Mukesh Raushan, who retained for the RJD Mahua seat which was previously held by Prasads elder son Tej Pratap Yadav, made a remark in front of the state assembly that smacked of the brashness that has come to be associated with the party which was once considered invincible. "You will see a big shake up in March. This government will fall and Tejashwi Yadav will become the Chief Minister. Legislators from all parties are in touch with us. Just wait and watch", said the dental surgeon-turned-politician with a swagger. Meanwhile, Jharkhand's Inspector General,Prisons,Virendra Bhusan, said in Ranchi that Prasad is in RIM's Director's bungalow with the permission of the district administration. The Ranchi district administration takes decision about visitors to Prasad and other issues linked to it. Regarding the video doing the rounds on social media, Bhusan told PTI-Bhasha in Ranchi that "We will go through the video and if any truth is found we will ask Deputy Collector and Superintendent of Police to probe the matter and initiate lawful action." The fresh controvery has broken days before the Jharkhand High Court is expected to hear Lalu Prasad's bail plea in a fodder scam case related to Dumka treasury on Friday. That day, the court is also likely to have a look at the reports submitted by Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) on Prasad's treatment and so is the report from the jail department and the district administration on people meeting the RJD supremo there.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/after-sushil-modis-sensational-tweet-lalus-audio-clip-goes-viral-919815.html

But the decision of these parties to contest has unnerved the BJP,” the PDP chief alleged. Corroborating her allegations, she said their decision to join the poll fray was the reason that the PAGD candidates were barred from campaigning in southern districts and other parts of the valley. The People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) is an alliance of seven parties formed on October 15 to work towards restoring the special status of J&K which was revoked last August. On November 7, the alliance decided to contest DDC polls in J&K unitedly. The PDP chief said that she had come to Shopian to meet the PAGD candidate, who was not allowed for the past 15 days to come out of his home, to do his campaigning. “I am surprised that Lt. Governor Manoj Sinha and Election Commissioner KK Sharma are repeatedly saying there would be no discrimination with the PAGD candidates. But it is happening,” she added. Sharma in a presser recently denied that any candidate was prevented from campaigning. Mehbooba said that PAGD candidates will work hard for J&K’s identity that was “stolen on August 5, 2019.” Asked about the name of former PDP leader Haseeb Drabu surfacing among the 900 people who have allegedly grabbed land under Roshni Scam, the PDP president said that BJP is using ploys to divert attention. “At times, it uses DC to summon Farooq Abdullah and not Roshni scam is a new ploy. If I would be found involved in the Roshni scam, I will be the first person to choose jail,” she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/unnerved-bjp-will-use-grenades-and-guns-to-bag-seats-says-mehbooba-mufti-919817.html

25-11-2020||National||PIL filed in Supreme Court to stop the use of EVMs||A PIL was filed in the Supreme Court on Wednesday seeking a direction to the Election Commission to stop the usage of Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) for conducting polls, stating safety issues over their vulnerability to getting hacked or being tampered with. Kanyakumari-based advocate C R Jaya Sukin maintained that voting through ballot papers was a more reliable and transparent method for the electoral process of any country. Several developed countries like the US, Japan, Germany, and others have rejected EVMs during elections, and have chosen the ballot system of voting. This should indicate that EVMs are not satisfactory instruments to be used for the electoral process of a country. EVMs can be hacked. But the ballot system is extremely safe, he said. "EVM hacking is a threat that has been given not only in India but in many other countries, which is why several of them have banned it. EVMs, like all other machines, are prone to errors and malfunctioning. No machine ever made anywhere in the world is infallible," he claimed. The petitioner said out of the 31 countries that used or studied the EVMs, only four used it nationwide, 11 used it in some parts or small elections. There are five countries using it on a pilot basis, three nations have discontinued it and 11 that used it on a pilot basis decided to stop its use. He claimed that the EVMs can be tampered with during its manufacturing and in such cases, it does not even require any hacker or malware to manipulate the actual voting.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pil-filed-in-supreme-court-to-stop-the-use-of-evms-919819.html
25-11-2020||National||Centre asks states to take steps to reopen medical colleges from or before Dec 1||The Union Health Ministry Wednesday asked state governments to initiate steps for reopening of medical colleges from December 1 or before it, but with strict adherence to all Covid-19 related guidelines. Educational institutions in the country have been closed since March in view of the coronavirus pandemic. In a letter to the chief secretaries and the administrators of all states and Union Territories, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan also suggested making non-Covid beds available in sufficient numbers in affiliated medical college-hospitals to facilitate undergraduate training. The Health Ministry has obtained concurrence from the Ministry of Home Affairs for re-opening of medical colleges, the letter mentioned. “Accordingly, the states and UTs may take necessary steps to open the medical colleges on or before December 1, 2020,” the health secretary said in his letter dated November 25. “Needless to say, all SOPs/guidelines with respect to social distancing and prevention of spread of epidemic issued by Central/states and UT governments will be followed scrupulously by all the colleges,” he said. The Centre's directive comes in the wake of the National Medical Commission recommending reopening of medical colleges from December 1 or before it for the MBBS students already pursuing their courses. The NMC, which has received representations from students and medical colleges, noted that the current batch of interns (2020) have not completed their required clinical training and unless they do it, they would not be eligible for appearing for the PG-NEET exam. It also noted that the PG-NEET exam for the academic year 2021-22 has been delayed as the eligible candidates will be completing their training late. Their training is required to be completed at the earliest so that the PG -NEET exam for the academic year 2021-22 can be held accordingly, it said. "Delay in resuming the training would have a cascading effect on training of next PG and super-speciality courses in the coming years," the NMC noted. "The delayed new academic session for 2020-21 should commence from February 1, 2021. The new PG session for the academic year 2020-21 should begin from at least July 1, 2021 and therefore the PG-NEET exam for AY 2020-21 would need to be scheduled around March-April 2021," the NMC said in a communique to the Health Ministry on November 12. With opening of medical colleges and to facilitate UG training, all medical colleges affiliated hospitals would need to have sufficient number of beds for non-Covid patients and hence facilities for both outpatient and inpatient management for non-Covid patients must be re-started, if not already done, the NMC stated. Further, it noted that the students today (and would-be doctors tomorrow) should also be familiar with the inherent threats and opportunities in healthcare systems which they would eventually handle themselves. It should not become a missed opportunity for medical students to learn the skills of epidemic management as public health professional, the NMC said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-asks-states-to-take-steps-to-reopen-medical-colleges-from-or-before-dec-1-919838.html
25-11-2020||National||'My life would change forever': Ex-marine commando recalls night of 26/11||Former marine commando Praveen Kumar Teotia, who led his team during the counter-terrorist operations in the wake of the 26/11 attack in Mumbai, gives a minute-by-minute account of that deadly night inside the Taj hotel in his memoir. He suffered multiple injuries during the operation but his quick response and counter-attack saved more than 150 lives. "26/11 Braveheart: My Encounter With Terrorists That Night", published by Rupa, is the story of Teotia and how he fought the terrorists. On that fateful night, Teotia was heading towards his naval base around 8 pm. "Who would have imagined that 10 men from Pakistan would come sailing through the Arabian Sea in a small boat and would launch the most dastardly attack on the city? And hardly would have I imagined that few hours from now, I will be facing these fidayeen, inside the Taj, eye to eye, and my life would change forever," he says. Giving details of what happened inside the Taj after the marine commando team of the Navy reached there, he says, "There was information given to us earlier that there were at least four terrorists inside. Later on, the High Level Enquiry Committee confirmed in its findings the presence of four terrorists in the Taj. Two terrorists had stealthily entered from the main lobby (of the Taj Towers) while the other two, who had fired at Leopold, entered by North Cote entrance (of the Heritage Taj) and joined up with their partners. "There was no chance of a police response when terrorists had attacked Leopold Cafe at about 9:30 p.m. These two armed men had suddenly walked in and began firing indiscriminately. After creating a bloodbath there, they hastened towards the Taj." Ever since the team entered the Taj, there was death and mayhem around us - in the halls, the corridors, and the reception area. "The lazy opulence of the place had been disrupted and what stood before us was a shaken Taj. Bullet-ridden bodies were lying amidst the inferno and bloodbath. Some lucky survivors had to be pulled out with corpses lying on top of them, an experience that would torment them for life," Teotia recalls. He was badly injured while fighting the terrorists. Four bullets ripped through his body, a lung was punctured, four ribs were shattered and splinters scattered all over his chest, doctors attending to him declared that his life had been cut short, that he could never swim or run. But he proved everyone wrong. A Shaurya Chakra awardee, Teotia overcame his injury and went on to participate in several marathons and the Ironman championship. He is now a life coach and a physical trainer, and also gives special weapons and tactical training to state police commandos. In the book, Teotia also writes about the quality of counter-operation gear and weapons. When he and his team went to collect arms and gear from the armoury division, they came to know that there was no MP5 weapon (a close quarter battle weapon used in close encounters or operations) for them. They were left with no choice but to take the AK-47s that were available. For this key operation, they were given normal combat helmets that were good enough only to protect the head from stones or other objects, he says. "But we could not have possibly gone without the headgear and hence had no choice but to wear the poor substitute. I, however, became a bit agitated when we were told by the armoury division that there were no specialised bulletproof jackets available," he writes. "We were then provided with a normal buoyant bulletproof jacket. In other words, this was a jacket that had a simple plate in the front and could only take shots from a pistol. This jacket was also used to prevent someone from drowning," he adds. Each commando was also given two grenades - a stun grenade and the other a live one.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/my-life-would-change-forever-ex-marine-commando-recalls-night-of-26/11-919849.html

Tracking 80 per cent contacts of a Covid-19 patient in 72 hours and allowing states to implement staggered office timings in cities with higher positivity rate as well as imposing local measures like night curfew are among a slew of measures identified by the Centre in its new guidelines to tackle the surging pandemic. States are also allowed to reduce the number of people attending social, religious, sports, entertainment, educational, cultural, religious and other gatherings to 100 from the existing ceiling of 200 based on the ground situation. The 'Guidelines for Surveillance, Containment and Caution', which was issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Wednesday against the backdrop of rising Covid-19 cases following festival season and onset of winter, will come into effect from December 1 and be in place till the month-end.  The government on Wednesday approved merger of crisis-ridden Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) with DBS Bank India Ltd (DBIL) and removed restrictions on withdrawal of deposits by depositors. The Union Cabinet has approved the merger of the LVB with DBS Bank India Limited, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters, adding the decision will provide comfort to 20 lakh depositors and protect the services of 4,000 employees. Calling the BJP "garbage of lies" and "biggest curse of the nation", West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday dared the saffron party to arrest her and asserted she will ensure TMC victory in the upcoming elections even from the jail. Election to the 294-member West Bengal Assembly is due in April-May. Accusing the BJP of trying to poach TMC MLAs by attempting to bribe them, Banerjee, without naming anyone, said some people are acting as fence-sitters who are under the illusion that the saffron party might come to power in the state. The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved equity infusion of Rs 6,000 crore in NIIF Debt Platform sponsored by National Investment and Infrastructure Fund. This was informed by Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar after the Cabinet meeting. To support the funding of the National Infrastructure Pipeline of Rs 111 lakh crore, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget speech this year had said that about Rs 22,000 crore has already been provided. Malayalam feature "Jallikattu", directed by Lijo Jose Pellissery, has been selected as India's official entry for the International Feature Film category at the Oscars, the Film Federation of India (FFI) announced. The film, which was unanimously chosen from 27 entries across Hindi, Odiya, Marathi and other languages, follows a bull that escapes from a slaughterhouse in a hilly remote village and the entire village men gathering to hunt down the animal. Packing a punch, Cyclone Nivar increased its speed to 11 km per hour on the course to make landfall between Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts by Wednesday night or early Thursday morning packing winds to the speed of 120 to 130 km per hour gushing up to 145 km per hour.

Chennai and other coastal districts continued to receive heavy to heavy rains since Monday morning submerging many low-lying areas across the metropolis Senior Congress leader and the party's top strategist Ahmed Patel died in a Gurugram hospital on Wednesday due to multi-organ failure. He was suffering from complications related to Covid-19. Patel (71), who was critical for a few days, was admitted to the Medanta hospital in Gurugram on November 15 after he developed complications. Patel will be laid to rest at his native village Piraman in Gujarat's Bharuch district, an aide of the leader said. Patel was Congress’s master strategist and a trusted lieutenant of three generations of the Gandhi family. Patel, 71, was handpicked by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi at the age of 28 to contest the Lok Sabha elections in 1977 from Bharuch in Gujarat, which he won bucking the Janata Party wave in the post-Emergency polls. Patel was considered as the most powerful leader in the Congress, having served as a key aide to then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1985 and later as political secretary to Congress President Sonia Gandhi from 2001 to 2017. “I have lost as irreplaceable comrade, a faithful colleague and a friend,” the Congress President said in a condolence message.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-congress-leader-ahmed-patel-no-more-centre-gives-nod-to-lvb-dbs-merger-919852.html

The apparent reference was to the draft ordinance cleared by the BJP government on Tuesday to curb forcible or “dishonest” religious conversions including those for the sake of marriage, which could land violators in jail for up to 10 years. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in a rally ahead of the assembly bypolls had said those who “play with the honour and dignity of sisters and daughters by hiding their real names and identities… If they do not mend their ways, their ‘Ram Naam Satya’ journey will start”. The CM said this in reference to “love jihad”, a term used by BJP leaders to describe alleged conversion of Hindu women to Islam in the guise of marriage. Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday said as the BJP government in the state is about to complete four years in office, problems of people are increasing. People are facing hardships due to poor economy, corruption, price rise and bad law and order but the government has only “jihad” and “Ram Naam Satya” as solutions to offer. Whether a farmer dies due to the burden of debt, a girl ends her life to save honour or a youth commits suicide because of unemployment, these all do not matter to the chief minister, Akhilesh alleged. His only solution for the problems is “Ram Naam Satya, he said. How a government which all the time chants this can think good of anyone, Akhilesh added. He claimed that Adityanath is trying to divert people’s attention with his “jihad” frenzy. “To divide society by spreading hatred is an old tactic of the RSS. Everyday, a new law is framed by the government to hide its failure. No law is strict or soft but how it is implemented makes it effective or ineffective," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/up-govts-focus-only-on-jihad-ram-naam-satya-akhilesh-yadav-919879.html

President Ram Nath Kovind described Patel as an “astute parliamentarian” who had friends across party lines, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed him as a “sharp mind” and remembered his role in strengthening the Congress party. “Saddened by the demise of Ahmed Patel Ji. He spent years in public life, serving society. Known for his sharp mind, his role in strengthening the Congress Party would always be remembered. Spoke to his son Faisal and expressed condolences. May Ahmed Bhai’s soul rest in peace,” Modi said. Sonia Gandhi said she had lost a colleague whose entire life was dedicated to the Congress party. “His faithfulness and dedication, his commitment to his duty, his always being there to help, his generosity were rare qualities that distinguished him from others,” Gandhi said in her condolence message for Patel, who served as her political secretary for 16 years. “I have lost an irreplaceable comrade, a faithful colleague and a friend,” the Congress president said. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described Patel as the “undisputed leader” of the Congress. “Ahmed Patel was one of the most trusted leader of the Congress party and a great friend of mine. His passing away is an irreparable loss to the Congress party,” Singh said.

His passing away leaves an immense void,” Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said. “RIP Ahmedbhai Patel. Your contributions in strengthening the Congress Party will be remembered forever, as will your selfless dedication towards public life,” industrialist Gautam Adani said.

25-11-2020||National||India, Pakistan engage in 'dossier war' over terrorism charges||After Imran Khan’s government in Islamabad handed over to the Secretary General of the United Nations a “dossier” accusing India of sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan, New Delhi reminded on Wednesday reminded the international community that Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden had been found hiding in the neighbouring country itself. “Remember Abbottabad!” T S Tirumurti, New Delhi’s envoy to the United Nations, posted on Twitter, dismissing the dossier Khan Government presented to António Guterres, Secretary General of the international organization, accusing India of supporting terrorism in Pakistan. The “dossier of lies” presented by Pakistan enjoys zero credibility. Concocting documents and peddling false narratives is not new to Pakistan, host to worlds largest number of UN proscribed terrorists and entities. Abbottabad in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan is the place where elusive Al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden had been killed by the United States commandos on May 2, 2012. The killing of much-wanted terrorist leader at a house near Pakistan Military Academy in Abbottabad had brought to the light that he had been hiding in the country since long and it had been possibly known to the top brass of the military and intelligence agencies of the country. “The ‘dossier of lies’ presented by Pakistan (blaming India) enjoys zero credibility,” tweeted Tirumurti. “Concocting documents and peddling false narratives is not new to Pakistan, host to worlds largest number of UN proscribed terrorists and entities.” Guterres received a dossier from Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Munir Akram, who urged the Secretary General of the international organization to do his bit to persuade India to halt its terror and subversive campaign against Pakistan. The dossier, according to Khan Government, had “proofs” of India’s role in sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan. The same dossier was earlier made public by Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and the chief spokesperson of the powerful Pakistan Army, Major General Babar Iftikhar, during a press conference in Islamabad on November 15. They also played videos and audio clips during the news conference in support of their claims. They alleged that officials posted at India’s embassy and consulates in Afghanistan oversee its support to terrorists in Pakistan. New Delhi already denied the allegation by the Khan Government and dismissed the dossier as a propaganda material to malign the image of India. Islamabad’s move against New Delhi at the UN came after the Modi Government started sharing copies of a similar dossier with the United States, Japan, France, Russia and a few others – detailing about Pakistan’s continued attempts to export terrorism to India, particularly to sabotage the District Development Council (DDC) polls in J&K. Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla briefed the envoys of the US, Japan, France, Russia and a few other nations how the plan of the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) based in Pakistan to carry out a major attack in India had been foiled recently. The four JeM terrorists, who had sneaked into India from the territory controlled by Pakistan, were killed in an encounter with the security forces near Nagrota on Jammu-Srinagar National Highway on November 19. A large number of weapons, including 11 AK-47 rifles, three pistols and 29 grenades, were recovered from the possession of the slain terrorists. New Delhi suspects that the terrorists had come from Pakistan to India to carry out a major attack.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-pakistan-engage-in-dossier-war-over-terrorism-charges-919903.html
25-11-2020||National||Most imported pesticides not made in India; hike in import duty to hit farmers: Dhanuka Agritech||Most of the imported pesticides like Cartap Hydrochloride are not manufactured in India and any move to increase customs duty on them will make these products costlier for domestic farmers, Dhanuka Agritech Chairman R G Agarwal said on Wednesday. Speaking to PTI, he said new and effective pesticide molecules developed elsewhere in the world should be made available to Indian farmers at a cheaper rate rather than forcing them to use outdated pesticides, which are banned in other nations but still being used in the country. Import of new pesticide molecules should be continued to be permitted at lower custom duty when India has not done any investment in research of such products. The pesticides used in India at present are not developed here, he added. Last week, Pesticides Manufacturers and Formulators Association of India (PMFAI) had urged the government to increase the import duty on technical and finished pesticides to 20-30 per cent from 10 per cent to protect the domestic agrochemicals industry. Agarwal said, "We should not increase the cost of the molecule which is not manufactured in India by increasing the customs duties. If any product that is manufactured here but still been imported, then I agree with PMFAI an action should be taken to protect the domestic industry". In such cases, the government can think of imposing anti-dumping duties to curb such shipments, he added. The agrochemicals maker's chairman said new technologies like Halosulfuron Methyl (Sempra) -- a weedicide --- is imported from Japan that is helping farmers improve their income. For instance, a farmer has to invest Rs 1,500 per acre and will get a minimum benefit of Rs 15,000 per acre. Agarwal said there are many such new technologies developed in the world, but not reaching to Indian farmers because of delay in the registration process and high cost of registration here. However, in case of Cartap Hydrochloride molecule used in paddy pest control, the government has given 25 registrations to domestic players, but they are not manufacturing, he noted. Slamming a section of pesticide industry demanding an increase in import duty in the name of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat', Agarwal said they are doing it to protect their business. "Those demanding the hike in import duty do not have international tie-ups. They have no access to new technology. That is the reason they are opposing or want to restrict new technology by increasing import duty so that it becomes unviable and they may continue the sale of their outdated molecules in the country," he said. Asked about the industry being divided on the issue, the chairman said: "Unfortunately, agriculture speciality pesticides sector is misunderstood in the country and not supported properly by the government". Even the government says the industry is divided. "The government should listen to all stakeholders and take call in the interest of the nation and farmers," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/most-imported-pesticides-not-made-in-india-hike-in-import-duty-to-hit-farmers-dhanuka-agritech-919909.html

Vardhan, who is also the health and family welfare minister, said that as the world races to develop the vaccine for Covid-19, India is looking to be self-reliant in both its development and mass production. Addressing a virtual Global R&D Summit 2020, organised by FICCI, jointly with the Department of Science and Technology, Vardhan said, "Called as the pharmacy of the world, India has the largest capacity to produce Covid-19 vaccines. "We have now initiated to look at a robust vaccine manufacturing and delivery ecosystem to meet our demands in the coming days. That is one area where your (industry) inputs will help us in not only addressing a topical issue but also creating best practices for the future." Research and innovation, he said, are the way of life. The current pandemic has further reinforced the belief in innovation and R&D to accelerate products and services that not only are helping in disease management but in turn to make the nation resilient and self-reliant, Vardhan said. He further stated that it is time for bold decisions and bold investments, and not for conservative approaches. "This also is the time to move from a command-and-control economy to plug-and-play and to build a competitive global supply chain. We are committed to help companies invest in India and make for India and for the world," he added. Fuelled by the current pandemic, Vardhan said India is transitioning from an era of liberalisation and globalisation to one where it must reinvent itself to become a self-reliant country. "People, planet and profits are interlinked, and all three can simultaneously co-exist and flourish. With support from the government and private industry, the Indian R&D sector can reach new heights and will contribute to the nation's growth and prosperity," he noted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/robust-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing-delivery-ecosystem-initiated-to-meet-demand-harsh-vardhan-919934.html

Reforms are beneficial only when one performs, and this is the way forward to transform the country, Modi said as he chaired the meeting of PRAGATI -- an ICT-based multi-modal platform for Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation involving central and state governments. In the PRAGATI meeting, multiple projects, grievances and programmes were reviewed, the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement. In the previous 32 such meetings, a total of 275 projects worth Rs 12.5 lakh crore have been reviewed, along with 47 programmes/schemes and grievances across 17 sectors that were taken up. The projects, taken up at the 33rd such PRAGATI meeting on Wednesday, were of the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, and the Power Ministry, the statement said.

Seeking votes for BJP candidates contesting in the District Development Council (DDC) elections, Thakur, along with other party leaders, campaigned in the border belt of Akhnoor, which goes to polls on November 28. "Lawsuit should be filed on Farooq Abdullah for cheating, forgery and encroachment of public property," Thakur said while questioning the Gupkar alliance's "unlawful activities". "Nobody is above law and expressed confidence that soon all the other corruption cases and forgeries will be in the public domain," he said. Thakur held the National Conference, Congress and the PDP responsible for the "mess" in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and said "they must be held as the culprit for looting the valuable resources and vast areas of public land in J-K". "Beneficiaries of the Roshni scam were former ministers of the Gupkar gang and the Congress and their relatives, senior bureaucrats, businessmen and political leaders who were financing these parties," he alleged. He said with the abrogation of Article 370, the Modi government has opened way for an uninterrupted growth in education, healthcare, tourism, business and other sectors while also ensuring that equal opportunity is served to every person living in the UT. Thakur held election rallies in favour of Suraj Singh in Khour, Bhushan Bral in Bhalwal Brahmana and Sharda Devi in Sungal, Akhnoor. Meanwhile, BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh lambasted former chief ministers Farooq Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti for allegedly seeking help from foreign countries in restoring Article 370 in J-K. Addressing a public meeting close to the LoC in Ramgarh in Samba district, Chugh claimed, "While Abdullah was asking for a helping hand from Pakistan, people on the border areas were living in perpetual fear and distrust due to periodic shelling of missiles and bombs by the Pakistan army". "The Abdullah family has all along lived a self-centred life to build their fortunes while putting the entire population of J-K in peril," he alleged. The BJP leader claimed that the Abdullah family has no concern with the common man and his problems. "All laws and administrative orders were made not for the common man but for their family interests," he added. Both the families sent their sons and daughters abroad for studies but left the children of the common man uncared for, without schools and without food, he alleged. "Had the two families used the central government funds judiciously, the entire J-K population would have been living in a paradise today," Chugh added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/anurag-thakur-demands-lawsuit-against-farooq-abdullah-for-encroachment-of-public-property-919944.html

Earlier in the day, Raut termed the ED's raids on the premises of Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik in Thane as "political vendetta" and said he will send a list of 120 BJP leaders to the central agency to see if acts against them. "I had dared Raut to send the list. Today he said that he will send the list. We are waiting for it," Fadnavis said in a press conference here. On the ED's action against Sarnaik, he said, "The agency will work on the basis of the evidence it has. But Sarnaik should have approached the agency and put forth his side, but he chose to visit the 'Saamana' (Sena mouthpiece) office and give interviews," he added. Fadnavis also said that Shiv Sena is not Maharashtra, and asserted that it was his party which worked towards protecting the identity of the state when it was in power for five years. The Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly also accused the Sena of labelling those who levelled charges of corruption against it as being "Maharashtra-drohi" (anti- Maharashtra). "Nobody becomes Maharashtra-drohi just because someone calls that person so. When allegations of corruption are levelled against them, they call that person Maharashtra- drohi," he said. He was replying to a query whether the Shiv Sena was painting the BJP as Maharashtra-drohi in matters pertaining to actor Kangana Ranaut, Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and Shiv Sena leader Pratap Sarnaik. "It was the BJP which worked towards keeping the identity of Maharashtra intact when it was in power for five years...We made Maharashtra number one state, surpassing Gujarat in terms of investments and I am proud that I was the chief minister (at that time)," he added. "The Shiv Sena should understand that it is not Maharashtra," he said. When asked about NCP's state unit chief Jayant Patil's allegations about registration of bogus voters ahead of the upcoming graduate and teachers' constituencies elections, Fadnavis said it means that the NCP leader has accepted the defeat. "There is no EVM, so he knows that if they face defeat, they would not be able to blame on it. Which is why he is making such claims," he said. On being asked about his support to Uttar Pradesh's ordinance on 'love jihad' and whether he thinks it was possible in a progressive state like Maharashtra, he said, "How can the law on love jihad be called regressive? The terms progressive and regressive are individuals perspectives. I am surprised about Shiv Sena, which had once taken a strong position against 'love jihad'." "They wrote big editorials, sought legislation against love jihad, but now they have taken a U-turn," he added. Replying to a question about Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray telling Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the 'politicisation' of Covid-19 situation in the state by the BJP, Fadanvis said, "It is a welcome sign that the state government has taken cognisance of BJP's agitations in the state." Speaking on the Maratha reservation and a government resolution issued by the state that admissions would be done without 12 per cent Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) quota and will be done under the open category, the BJP leader said, "The government is resorting to delaying tactics on the quota issue, due to which the students are facing hardships."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/waiting-for-sanjay-raut-to-send-list-of-120-bjp-leaders-to-enforcement-directorate-devendra-fadnavis-919960.html

The former Deputy Chief Minister made the sensational assertion on his twitter handle, sharing a mobile number which, he claimed, Prasad was having access to despite serving sentences in fodder scam cases. The RJD supremo is in Ranchi, where he has been sentenced by a special CBI court in a number of fodder scam cases. Initially lodged at the Hotwar Central Jail, he was moved to the RIMS hospital in the Jharkhand capital on medical grounds. For the last few months, he has been putting up at the bungalow allotted to the Director of RIMS, which is seen as a favour extended to the ageing and ailing leader by the sympathetic Hemant Soren government in which the RJD is a partner. Modi, who has been replaced as Deputy Chief Minister but made the Chairman of Ethics Committee of the state legislative council, in what is seen as a goodwill gesture by the Bihar Chief Minister, is known to be a strident critic of the RJD supremo. He was one of the petitioners on whose PIL the Patna High Court had ordered, in the 1990s, handing over of the fodder scam to the CBI. "Lalu Yadav making telephone call (8051216302) from Ranchi to NDA MLAs and promising ministerial berths", Modi tweeted, tagging a number of media outlets. "When I telephoned, Lalu directly picked up. I said dont do (sic) these dirty tricks from jail, you will not succeed", added Modi, who has known the RJD chief since the 1970s when both were student leaders at the Patna University, actively involved in the JP movement. In the recently held Bihar assembly elections, RJD returned with a tally of 75 seats, becoming the single largest party, though the five-party Grand Alliance fell way short of the magic mark of 122. A fine performance by the BJP, which won just one seat less than the RJD, propelled the NDA to an easy victory despite a major slump in the tally of Nitish Kumars JD(U) which bore the brunt of the brinkmanship of Chirag Paswan-led NDA. The BJP-led NDA bagged 125 seats and the party kept up its promise of backing the JD(U) boss as the Chief Minister even if his party were to get drubbed. In the recently-formed council of ministers, the BJP walked away with the lion's share. In the 14-member cabinet, the saffron party has seven members as against five of the JD(U) and two of its leaders Tar Kishor Prasad and Renu Devi have been made Deputy CMs. Two smaller allies, Hindustani Awam Morcha of former CM and currently the pro tem Speaker Jitan Ram Manjhi and Vikassheel Insaan Party of former Bollywood set designer Mukesh Sahni, both having four seats each, have also been accommodated into the cabinet.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/lalu-prasad-trying-to-poach-nda-mlas-in-bihar-alleges-sushil-modi-919588.html

25-11-2020||National Politics||RIP Ahmed Patel: The Congress troubleshooter, master strategist||Ahmed Patel, who breathed his last on Wednesday morning, was Congress’s master strategist and a trusted lieutenant of three generations of the Gandhi family. Patel, 71, was handpicked by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi at the age of 28 to contest the Lok Sabha elections in 1977 from Bharuch in Gujarat, which he won bucking the Janata Party wave in the post-Emergency polls. Patel was considered as the most powerful leader in the Congress, having served as a key aide to then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1985 and later as political secretary to Congress President Sonia Gandhi from 2001 to 2017. Patel’s network of friends and well wishers was vast nurtured over the years with his personal touch, a quality that helped him steer the Congress in times of crises. A quintessential backroom operator, Patel shunned the limelight and several offers to join the UPA government between 2004 and 2014, opting to keep the coalition government safe whenever it hit a rough patch. Patel played a key role in winning the support of Samajwadi Party in 2008 when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh faced the no confidence vote after the Left parties withdrew support over differences of the India-US civil nuclear deal. Born on August 21, 1949 at Piraman village near Bharuch, Patel rose in the ranks in the Congress after being spotted by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1977. He represented Gujarat in Parliament for eight terms – three as a Lok Sabha member and five in the Rajya Sabha. The latest victory in the Rajya Sabha elections was in 2017 when the then BJP President Amit Shah had queered the pitch for him by fielding a candidate in what would have been a smooth election. From being the president of a taluka panchayat to being the trusted lieutenant of the Gandhi family for four decades, Patel had his finger on the pulse of the Congress, which gave him the ability to spot a crisis situation early on. After Rahul Gandhi became Congress President, Patel was appointed as the AICC Treasurer in August 2018, at a time when the party was passing through a financial crisis. A troubleshooter for the party, Patel’s demise comes at a time when the Congress is facing a crisis over the leadership issue and senior leaders such as Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Kapil Sibal have renewed call for a complete overhaul of the Congress organisation after the Bihar election debacle.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rip-ahmed-patel-the-congress-troubleshooter-master-strategist-919670.html

Accusing BJP of trying to pressurise TMC MLAs with the Sarada and Narada cases whenever elections were approaching, Mamata said no one should be under the illusion that BJP will come to power in Bengal. “We will once again be voted to power with a bigger majority,” said Mamata. Warning potential defectors the TMC supremo said that she was well-aware of their activities. “I know who is going where and who is meeting whom. Didi knows what they are up to,” said Mamata. “There are some people who are with the TMC but are also in touch with others. From now on I will run the party as well the government,” said Mamata. The CPI(M) was also not spared. She accused the CPI(M) of joining forces with the BJP and said that one day they will realise their mistake. “BJP, CPI(M) and Congress will be wiped out from Bengal,” said Mamata.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/even-if-bjp-arrests-me-i-will-ensure-tmcs-victory-in-assembly-polls-from-jail-mamata-banerjee-919763.html

That was Congress leader Ahmed Patel’s matter-of-fact response a few months ago when asked if he would pen his memoirs to share his experiences as the party insider with a finger on its power buttons. Patel, who died on Wednesday at a Gurugram hospital where he was admitted with Covid-19, could have been the tell-all leader offering insights and information with his inside view of the workings of the Congress and the political world. But he would have none of it. Author and journalist Rasheed Kidwai met the Congress’ trusted backroom strategist and troubleshooter at his 23, Mother Teresa Crescent residence after the lockdown and asked him the question on many a mind. “We had a freewheeling chat about the Congress and politics, and I asked him why don't you pen your memoirs as it will be a treasure trove of information to which he responded, ‘The secrets will travel with me to my grave’," Kidwai told PTI. Kidwai who has authored several books, including “24 Akbar Road: A Short History Of The People Behind The Fall And Rise Of The Congress”, added that Patel had gone too soon. Kidwai described Patel -- Rajya Sabha MP, AICC treasurer and Sonia Gandhi’s political secretary – as the man for all seasons for the Congress. He said Patel, both crisis manager and consensus builder, was never one to hold any grudges, citing how he stitched an alliance with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra despite the party making grave allegations against him in the past. He was also a devout Muslim and interestingly would switch mosques every week for Friday prayers because Congress ticket seekers would queue up outside if he went to one mosque regularly. Babubhai and AP to friends and Ahmed Bhai to colleagues, Patel remained Sonia Gandhi's most trusted lieutenant for most of her tenure as the longest-serving Congress president, standing by her side through sun and shade. Sonia Gandhi said she has lost an "irreplaceable comrade, a faithful colleague and a friend".  Patel, who kept a low profile, was the quintessential organisation man who had an unflappable temperament and was a very effective crisis manager and troubleshooter, senior party leader Jairam Ramesh said as tributes for the veteran politician and eight-term MP flowed in. Patel's importance in the Congress dates back to the days of the late Rajiv Gandhi. When Rajiv Gandhi became prime minister, he did away with the post of principal secretary to the PM which his mother Indira Gandhi had created for PN Haksar and appointed three parliamentary secretaries -- Ahmed Patel, Arun Singh and Oscar Fernandes.  The trio -- a photograph of them taking oath as parliamentary secretaries did the rounds on social media on Wednesday -- was famously referred to as ‘Amar, Akbar, Anthony’. Just three months ago, in August, Patel had stepped in to quell a rebellion. His firm rejection of the public stand taken by 23 party leaders against Sonia Gandhi helped the Congress Working Committee snub the demand for replacement of a Gandhi as party chief and repose faith in her presidency after she offered to quit.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/secrets-will-travel-with-me-to-my-grave-ahmed-patel-when-asked-about-penning-memoir-919858.html

The supplementary charge sheet was filed against former JNU student leader Umar Khalid and the varsity student Sharjeel Imam under relevant sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, rioting, sedition, unlawful assembly, criminal conspiracy, murder, promoting enmity on the grounds of religion, language, caste etc and other sections of the Indian Penal Code. “There could not have been a greater international embarrassment for the government of India than to have communal riots raging in the national capital while a visit by the US President was underway in February,” it said. It further claimed that the end objective of all the conspirators was to uproot a lawfully elected government by sheer use of “engineered, vicious and visceral” communal violence. "Had the conspirators been fully successful, the foundation of the government would have been shaken, leaving the Indian people exposed to uncertainty, lawlessness and anarchy and inducing a loss of faith in the ability of the state to protect their life and property. "The end objective of all that the conspirators had conspired to was to uproot a lawfully elected government by sheer use of engineered, vicious and visceral communal violence,” the charge sheet alleged. Communal violence broke out in North East Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/no-greater-international-embarrassment-than-delhi-riots-during-trumps-visit-says-police-charge-sheet-919660.html

25-11-2020||North and Central||PM Modi likely to lay foundation stone for new Parliament building in December||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to lay the foundation stone for a new Parliament building in the first half of December, sources said. The sources further said that around five statues, including that of Mahatma Gandhi and Bhim Rao Ambedkar, in the Parliament complex are also likely to be relocated temporarily due to the construction work and they will be reinstalled at prominent places within the new complex once the project is completed. The new building will be constructed close to the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project and it is expected to be completed in 21 months from the start of construction work. The redevelopment project of Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the 3-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate. Although the proposed date of laying the foundation stone of the new Parliament building is around December 10, the final date would depend on the availability of the prime minister, the sources said. According to the plan, the new Parliament building, which will have separate offices for all MPs, will be equipped with the latest digital interfaces as a step towards creating "paperless offices". The new building will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India's democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space. The sources said that five statues, including that of Mahatma Gandhi and Bhim Rao Ambedkar, at the existing Parliament complex are likely to be relocated temporarily and they would be reinstalled once the construction work of the new Parliament building is completed. The iconic 16-feet high statue of Mahatma Gandhi is located opposite Gate Number 1 of Parliament House. The statue greets visitors entering Parliament House and has also been the location of gatherings, protests and press interactions by MPs. According to Rajya Sabha's website, the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in a meditating posture sculpted by Ram Sutar, was unveiled by the then President of India Dr Shankar Dayal Sharma on October 2, 1993. It also said that the statue was donated by the Ministry of Urban Development. In September, Tata Projects Limited had won the bid to construct a new parliament building at a cost of Rs 861.90 crore. The existing building is a British-era building, designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker who were responsible for planning and construction of New Delhi. The foundation stone of the existing Parliament House was laid on February 12, 1921 and the construction took six years and cost Rs 83 lakh at that time. The opening ceremony was performed on January 18, 1927 by the then Governor-General of India, Lord Irwin. According to the CPWD, the existing Parliament building will continue to function during the entire period of execution of the project. Once the new building is built, the existing Parliament building will be used for other purposes. The CPWD had said, "The plinth of the new building shall match that of the existing one, which is approximately 1.8 metres above the ground level."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pm-modi-likely-to-lay-foundation-stone-for-new-parliament-building-in-december-919698.html

She got stranded in the neighbouring country while her husband and children travelled back to India in July. The woman was denied permission to board the train to India with her husband and children. A NORI visa allows Pakistani nationals holding a Long Term Visa (LTV) and staying in India to travel to the neighbouring country and return within 60 days. In September, the Union home ministry had told the Rajasthan High Court that 410 Pakistani Hindu refugees, who were stranded in Pakistan due to the expiry of their NORI visa periods, were identified. "These refugees were staying in India on Long Term Visa (LTV) and had gone to Pakistan for a short trip before the lockdown on NORI (No Objection for Return to India) visa," Sajjan Singh, an amicus curiae appointed by the court on issues pertaining to Pakistan's minority migrants, said. The home ministry had then stated that these people would be brought back to the country soon by extending their visa terms. Two shuttle services were rolled out after the lifting of the lockdown to help them return in July, but these 410 people were left out due to the expiry of their visas. Seemant Lok Sangthan president Hindu Singh Sodha said the organisation had taken up the issue with the Rajasthan government as well as the Centre. "We have urged the government to pave the way for the return of all such persons, who are stuck in Pakistan due to the expiry of their NORI visas," he said. "After six months' struggle, we succeeded in bringing back Mali, who was stuck in Pakistan due to the lockdown," Sodha added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hindu-woman-stranded-in-pakistan-reunited-with-indian-family-after-10-months-919702.html

However, Haryana saw farm fire incidents reducing by 28.6 per cent this year. Every year at the onset of winters, crop residue burning or stubble burning begins in Punjab and Haryana leading to heavy air pollution in Delhi. In its data released on Tuesday, pollution watchdog CPCB said the total count of active fire events reported in Punjab in 2020 is 76,537 while in 2019 it was 52,225 (between 21 September and 22 November).  “Stubble burning has increased by 46.5 per cent (or 24312 number of incidents) during 2020 in comparison to 2019,” the apex pollution control body said. In 2020, districts such as Sangrur, Bathinda and Firozpur continue to be highest contributor to active farm fire events in comparison to 2019, it said. In 2020, districts such as Moga, Amritsar, Fazilka, Ludhiana have shown more than 75 per cent increase in their number of fire counts in comparison to 2019. “In 2020, all the districts of Punjab except SBS Nagar have shown an upward trend in their active fire events contribution," the CPCB said, adding it showed lack of ground level implementation of the Central supported scheme. The average contribution of external biomass burning to PM 2.5 has increased from 10 per cent in 2019 to 15.63 per cent in 2020. The maximum contribution of external biomass burning to PM 2.5 at 42 per cent was observed on November 5, 2020. In Haryana, total count of fires reported in 2020 is 4,675 while in 2019 it was 6551 (between September 25 and November 22).  “With the support of central government schemes initiated to stop stubble burning, about 28.6 per cent (1876 incidents) of stubble burning reduced in 2020 in comparison to 2019,” the CPCB said. In 2020, districts such as Fatehabad, Kaithal and Karnal continue to be major contributors to farm fires but still have shown reduction by 40 per cent in comparison to 2019, it said. Districts such as Palwal and Kurushetra have shown major reduction by 50-60 per cent this year in comparison to 2019, it said. The pollution watchdog also said that under the central government scheme 'Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi', funds worth Rs 1178.47 crores were released from 2018-2020 and it has been approved for continuation during 2020-21 with Rs 600 crores. Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar had earlier said that the central government's PUSA institute has demonstrated a bio-decomposer technology which converts stubble to manure and is being experimented on a pilot basis in five states including Delhi and its trial is on.  “It will help in dealing with crop residue and is cheap as well. In the future, there will be several ways, both in-situ and ex-situ, to fight against the problem of pollution emerging out of stubble burning,” he had said.  Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai had on Tuesday said that a 15-member impact assessment committee has ascertained the effectiveness of "Pusa bio-decomposer" solution in reducing stubble burning in the capital and it was submitted to the Environment Ministry's Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas on Monda||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/punjab-sees-steep-rise-in-stubble-burning-incidents-this-year-919755.html

The Chief Minister made the request at a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), which is chaired by Lt Governor Anil Baijal. "At the meeting, the chief minister asked experts to audit death cases and suggest measures which could reduce deaths in the national capital," a source said.

25-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi riots case: HC seeks police reply on Tahir Hussain's bail plea||The Delhi High Court Wednesday asked the police to respond to a bail plea of former AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain, who is lodged in jail for his alleged role in the communal violence in northeast Delhi riots in February. Justice Suresh Kumar Kait asked the investigating officer of the case to file a status report on Hussain’s plea and listed the matter for further hearing on December 11, his lawyer said. A trial court had on October 22 denied bail to Hussain. The FIR, in which he is seeking bail, is related to looting of a shop in Dayalpur area of northeast Delhi causing a loss of about Rs 20 lakh to the owner. Hussain, represented through advocate Rizwan, sought bail on various grounds including parity and that there were general allegations in the FIR and no specific allegation against him. He contended that there were 10 accused in the case and nine have already been granted bail and only he is left in jail. He further said he was not even named in the FIR and claimed that he was falsely implicated in the case and as the charge sheet was filed in July and he was not required for custodial interrogation. While denying bail to Hussain in three cases, the trial court had observed that the violence in February this year amounted to the “worst communal riots since partition” in the national capital and that it was a “gaping wound” in the conscience of a nation aspiring to be a “major global power”. Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav had said it was prima facie apparent that he used his muscle power and political clout to act as a kingpin in planning, instigating and fanning the flames of communal conflagration. The FIR was lodged on March 4 on the complaint by Zeeshan who said he had a furniture shop at main Sherpur Chowk here and on February 23, he had closed the shop as per routine and did not open it the next day due to eruption of communal riots in the area. The complainant further stated that on February 25, he received a call that the shutter of his shop had been broken and the articles were looted by the rioters as a result of which he had to incur a loss of Rs 20 lakh. Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-riots-case-hc-seeks-police-reply-on-tahir-hussains-bail-plea-919771.html
25-11-2020||North and Central||NGT forms 5-member committee to look into pollution by industries in Jodhpur, Barmer||The National Green Tribunal has formed a five-member committee to look into pollution caused by industrial units violating environmental norms in Jodhpur and Barmer Districts of Rajasthan.  A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kunar Goel said serious damage to the environment has taken place which is continuing in violation of basic right to clean environment.  It said the contention of the state government plea that it does not have staff is self-confessed failure of governance and Constitutional responsibility of the state. “If after 56 years of enactment of Water Act, prohibiting discharge of effluent or sewage in water bodies, which is criminal offence with minimum prescribed sentence, gross violations are continuing, there is undoubted failure of the State for which lack of staff can be no excuse,” the bench said. The green panel said meaningful enforcement of law for protection of right to clean environment, which is right to life, is the undoubted Constitutional mandate.  Pressing need is to take stock of the ground situation, prepare an action plan and execute the same, it said. “For this purpose, we direct constitution of a five-member monitoring Committee to be headed by Justice Prakash Chandra Tatia, former Chief Justice of Jharkhand, (also former Chairperson AFT and Rajasthan Human Right Commission) stationed at Jodhpur, with representatives of CPCB, State PCB and District Magistrates, Jodhpur and Barmer,” the bench said. The Committee will be at liberty to associate any other independent expert or institution, the NGT said adding that the Committee may meet within one month to take stock of the situation. “The Committee may have public consultation particularly through the concerned Panchayats for the surviving grievances, including the supply of drinking water. The Committee may also identify and assess the damage to the agriculture or otherwise.  “The Committee may consider whether it is possible to augment the water flow of the Jojri River by getting water from any other source, in the manner suggested by the earlier Committee or otherwise,” the bench said. The District Magistrates may facilitate the functioning of the Committee by providing logistics and such other facilities as may be necessary, it said. The matter is listed for next hearing on April 20, 2021. The tribunal said it is true that the statutory functions are to be discharged by the statutory authorities but if they fail to do so, the NGT can certainly make them accountable and set up a credible monitoring mechanism. The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by Gram Panchayat village Araba seeking action against pollution in Jodhpur and Barmer Districts of Rajasthan by operation of industrial units in violation of environmental norms. Case of the applicant is that discharge of untreated toxic industrial effluent is taking place inter alia in Jojari River, which is flowing from Jodhpur towards Barmer District, carrying natural flow of water.  “This is in resulting in contamination of ground water.

25-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi police rejects requests for farmers’ march to city on November 26-27||The Delhi Police on Wednesday asserted that it has rejected all requests received from various farmer organisations to protest in the national capital against the Centre’s new farm laws. The police had on Tuesday said legal action would be taken against the protesting farmers if they come to the city for any gathering amid the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak. The farmers will reach Delhi on November 26 through five highways connecting the city as part of their 'Delhi Chalo’ march call. Taking to Twitter, the city police said requests have been rejected for any such gathering in the national capital. "REGARDING FARMER ORGANIZATIONS MARCH TO DELHI ON 26 & 27 NOVEMBER. All the requests received from various Farmer Organisations regarding protest in Delhi on 26 and 27 November have been rejected and this has already been communicated to the organisers," Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) tweeted. "Please co-operate with Delhi Police in ensuring no gathering in Delhi amid coronavirus, failing which legal action will be initiated as per law," it said. The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh and various factions of the Bharatiya Kisan Union have joined hands and formed a ‘Samyukta Kisan Morcha’ to press the central government to scrap the three farm laws. The protest has the support of over 500 farmer organisations. A seven-member committee has also been formed to coordinate the operations of the Morcha. Farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. They have been demanding that the laws be repealed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-police-rejects-requests-for-farmers-march-to-city-on-november-26-27-919776.html

25-11-2020||North and Central||PDP youth wing leader Waheed Parra arrested by NIA in connection with Davinder Singh case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday arrested Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) youth president Waheed Parra in connection with a militancy case related to suspended DSP Davinder Singh. Parra was being questioned by the NIA in New Delhi for the last two days and was formally arrested today, sources said. His name surfaced during the probe into the suspended Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Davinder Singh case. Confirming the arrest a spokesperson of the agency said, “Today NIA arrested Waheed Ur Rehman Parra, the youth wing leader of People’s Democratic Party, in connection with the Naveed Babu-Davinder Singh case for supporting Hizbul Mujahideen in conspiracy with the other accused persons.” On January 12, Singh was arrested while transporting two Hizb-ul-Mujahideen commanders, Naveed Babu in a vehicle to Jammu. While Singh managed to get bail on June 19, the NIA said that it was investigating another case against him. Parra’s name in the case has reportedly cropped up during questioning of another accused Tariq Mir, a former BJP leader accused of supplying arms to Naveed Babu. Reacting to Parra’s arrest, PDP president and former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti described it as part of the “Gujarat model of persecuting Muslims” adding that “the model is in full swing since August 2019 in J&K”. “I can personally vouch for Waheed’s integrity, honesty & character. It’s up to the judiciary now to dispense justice & ensure Waheed is released at the earliest,” she tweeted. Parra, who recently filed his nomination form for the upcoming district development council elections, is considered among the close associates of the PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti. He is among the leaders who remained loyal to Mehbooba in the last two years during which most of the high profile leaders left the PDP. Parra hails from restive Pulwama district and is considered as one of the leaders who had contacts with separatists when the PDP was in power from 2015 to 2018.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pdp-youth-wing-leader-waheed-parra-arrested-by-nia-in-connection-with-davinder-singh-case-919789.html

Five trains were cancelled, seven short terminated and nine trains diverted, a railways official said. Members of the Kisan Majdoor Sangharsh Morcha (KMSM) have blocked the track at the station since Tuesday morning. As the Amritsar-Delhi railway line remained blocked near Jandiala railway station, the railways authorities diverted the trains from the main line to Beas and Tarn Taran to reach Amritsar, the official said. Train services were suspended in the state since September 24 after farmers blocked railway tracks protesting against the new farm laws. After the farmers agreed to withdraw their protest, the railways started restoring both the passenger and goods train services. The railways said it suffered a loss of Rs 2,220 crore due to the blockade.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farm-laws-row-farmers-block-trains-near-amritsar-919859.html
25-11-2020||North and Central||Supreme Court dismisses plea to transfer 2015 sacrilege case outside of Punjab||The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea for transfer of pending trial in 2015 sacrilege cases against members of Dera Sacha Sauda sect from Bhatinda, Moga and Faridkot districts to a court in Delhi or to any nearby state outside Punjab. A bench of Justice Hrishikesh Roy rejected the claims of communally-charged atmosphere in Punjab and threat to life made by petitioners Jatinderveer Arora and others. "The transfer of trial from one state to another would inevitably reflect on the credibility of the state’s judiciary. Except from compelling factors and clear situation of deprivation of fair justice, the transfer power should not be invoked," the court said. It also pointed out the projection of surcharged atmosphere was not borne out by the corresponding reaction of the petitioners, who were out on bail. "Being residents of Punjab, they continue to reside at their usual place and are going about their routine affairs. If their threat perceptions were genuine, they could not have gone about their normal ways," the court said. The bench also said the sacrilege incidents occurred in 2015. Even after years of naming of the accused, there has been no complaint by the petitioners of any threat to their security or to their associates. The trial court's daily orders also do not reflect any bias faced, either by the accused or their family, the court added. The bench, however, said the Punjab government must make all arrangement to ensure safe conduct of proceedings at the trial courts and also provide adequate security to the petitioners and their associates as might be warranted from the security perspective. The petitioners claimed the accused who were members of the Dera Sacha Sauda sect, faced bias and prejudice and were unlikely to get a fair trial in the face of strong presumption of culpability. They said the alleged sacrilege of the holy book, Shri Guru Granth Sahibji in different places in Punjab, generated deep anguish and bitterness amongst a particular religious group, who formed majority of the population in Punjab. This has led to communally surcharged atmosphere, making fair trial impossible. With regard to murder of the accused Mohinder Pal Singh Bittoo on June 22, 2019 inside the Nabha Central jail, the court relied upon the Punjab government's plea that he was killed by inmates, undergoing life term, against whom a charge sheet has been filed and trial has commenced.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/supreme-court-dismisses-plea-to-transfer-2015-sacrilege-case-outside-of-punjab-919862.html

25-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality slips to 'severe' due to slow winds||After 10 days, Delhi's air quality deteriorated to the "severe" category on Wednesday due to slow winds, government agencies said. Stubble burning accounted for two per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on Wednesday. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) mobile app, SAMEER, the city's air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 401 on Wednesday morning and deteriorated to 415 in the evening. It was 388 on Tuesday. It was 302 on Monday, 274 on Sunday, 251 on Saturday, 296 on Friday and 283 on Thursday. The capital's AQI was in the "severe" category on November 15, a day after Diwali, but later improved and remained in either "poor" or "moderate" category until November 22. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". According to Ministry of Earth Sciences' monitoring system SAFAR, stubble fire counts were quite low at 63 on Tuesday with its share in PM2.5 in Delhi's air at two per cent on Wednesday.  "Effective stubble fire counts with sufficient potential as estimated from SAFAR-multi-satellite products are low (around 63). Hence, the stubble burning share in PM2.5 in Delhi's air is estimated as two per cent for today,” it said. “The AQI is forecasted to improve towards 'very poor' category by tomorrow and likely stay in the lower end of Very Poor on November 27 and 28,” SAFAR said. Stubble burning accounted for five per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on Tuesday, six per cent on Monday and 12 per cent on Sunday. It was 13 per cent on Saturday, 15 per cent on Friday and 20 per cent on Thursday. The maximum and minimum temperatures in the city on Wednesday settled at 24.4 degrees Celsius and 10.4 degrees Celsius with cloudy sky.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-slips-to-severe-due-to-slow-winds-919877.html
25-11-2020||North and Central||Madhya Pradesh proposes 10-year jail term for 'love jihad'||The BJP-led government in Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday said it is proposing a jail term of 10 years for anyone found guilty of using marriage to force someone to change religion. The announcement by state Home Minister Narottam Mishra came a day after Uttar Pradesh government approved a draft ordinance to curb forcible or 'dishonest' religious conversions including those for the sake of marriage, which could land violators in jail for up to 10 years. In recent weeks, BJP-run states like Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh have revealed plans to enact laws to counter alleged attempts to convert Hindu women to Islam in the guise of marriage, which party leaders often refer to as love jihad. Mishra told reporters that the state government has proposed a 10-year jail term for luring, threatening and forcing someone into marriage for religious conversion, in the proposed Dharm Swatantrya (Religious Freedom) Bill 2020. The bill draft will be presented before the cabinet in the second week of December and subsequently tabled in the state Assembly during its session from December 28, he added. He said the bill will provide a five-year jail term for gurus, priests, maulvis and kazis who will conduct such marriages, and registration of organisations conducting such marriages will be cancelled. On November 17, Mishra had said the BJP government in the state was planning to bring the bill in view of the rising incidents of 'love jihad' and had said it proposes a rigorous imprisonment for five years for luring a person through fraud and forcing marriage by religious conversion. "The draft of this bill has a provision of 10-year jail sentence for luring, intimidating someone into marriage for religious conversion. A provision of five-year jail term is there in the draft bill for the priests or religious gurus, who solemnise such marriages without seeking the district magistrate's nod," Mishra said on Wednesday. Mishra held a meeting with officials on Wednesday to discuss the draft of the bill. "Under this proposed law, the parties concerned will have to submit an application to the district magistrate before the conversion for marriage," the minister said. "It will be mandatory for the person converting to another religion for marriage, and the religious persons involved to obtain permission of the district magistrate concerned a month in advance," he said. "Any offence under this new proposed law would be cognizable and non-bailable. Those who help in solemnising marriages would also be treated as the main accused," he said. Those accused of marriage by conversion will themselves have to prove that this work has been done without any pressure, threat or allurement, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/madhya-pradesh-proposes-10-year-jail-term-for-love-jihad-919887.html

The Haryana police also used water cannons against the state's farmers on the national highway in Ambala and Kurukshetra to stop them from moving to Delhi. The BJP-ruled Haryana also suspended its transport bus service to Punjab with immediate effect on Wednesday because of the farmers' “Delhi Chalo” call. “We have suspended roadways service to Punjab for the next two days,” Haryana Transport Minister Mool Chand Sharma told PTI. Chandigarh Transport Undertaking too, meanwhile on Wednesday evening, suspended its bus services to Haryana for the next two days amid the farmers “Delhi Chalo” call, said officials. Braving the cold and rainy weather, thousands of farmers assembled during the day along with their tractor trolleys on the Punjab side of the inter-state border to undertake onward march to Delhi but had to stay put in Punjab amid the heavy police deployment on the border. Haryana will completely seal its borders with Punjab on November 26 and 27, the day for which farmers’ bodies have given the call for Delhi Chalo. Haryana police officials said amid the Covid-19 restrictions, they cannot allow movement of a large number of people towards the national capital. Meanwhile on Wednesday evening, a large group of farmers having gathered on GT Road near Mohra village in Ambala during the day under the leadership of Haryana BKU chief Gurnam Singh, allegedly jumped over the barricade following which the police resorted to the use of water cannon against them. Despite this, a splinter group managed to proceed to Tiyora-Tiyori village on Ambala-Kurukshetra border, where the police again used the water cannon against them to stop their onward march to Delhi. Amid the farmers blocking various stretches of roads, the vehicular traffic too was severely disrupted for several hours on the national highway. A few army vehicles also remained stranded in Kurukshetra district for some time due to the agitation, officials said. Gurnam Singh later told reporters, “Even if the police use lathis and force, nothing can stop farmers. We will continue our march towards Delhi. We will force the Centre to roll back these black anti-farmer laws”. Farmers were seen carrying food and clothes and had stocked other essentials in their tractor-trollies and planned to spend the night either in their vehicles or temporary shelters they had set up along the highway. Karnal's Superintendent of Police Ganga Ram Punia told reporters that sufficient police force has been deployed to maintain law and order because of the farmers’ protest march. Videography and photography were being done at inter-state borders and other sensitive points by the Haryana police. The Haryana police has deployed an adequate number of security personnel at roads bordering Punjab to prevent farmers from moving towards Delhi. The Haryana police put up multi-layered barricades and boulders on roads from Punjab to check farmers' entry to the state, officials said, adding the traffic would also be diverted. The police were also keeping vigil over farmers’ groups with drones hovering over them on inter-state borders. A Punjab police official on duty at Khanauri inter-state border told reporters that the Haryana police used cranes to put boulders on roads and the movement of traffic to the other side has been stopped. "We are diverting traffic to alternate routes now. We are also ensuring that the movement of essential goods is not affected," he said. A truck driver carrying some essentials from Jalandhar to Mumbai said he got stuck as vehicles’ movement towards Haryana has been stopped near the inter-state border in Fatehabad. Earlier on Tuesday, a detailed advisory was issued by the Haryana police urging commuters to modify their travel plans because of the farmers' protest march. Asserting that farmers from Punjab will not be allowed to enter the state, the Haryana police said it has deployed water cannons and riot vehicles on the borders. Restrictions have also been imposed at other inter-state border points with Punjab, including those in Ambala, Sirsa, Kurukshetra, Fatehabad and Jind districts. Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday had said the state borders with Punjab would remain sealed on November 26 and 27. On Tuesday, the Haryana police had taken many farmer leaders into preventive custody, a move which evoked strong reaction from the opposition Congress and farmer bodies. Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja on Wednesday said the Congress stands shoulder-to-shoulder with farms in their fight against the farm laws. She claimed the BJP-led government was trying to muzzle farmers’ voice and prevent them from registering their protest against the “anti-farmer” central laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/haryana-seals-borders-with-punjab-deploys-cops-to-foil-farmers-delhi-chalo-march-919939.html
25-11-2020||Oasis||Cease all exploitation||Reverence is essential—reverence for our rivers and forests; reverence for our lakes and waterfalls; reverence for trees and plants and the grass that grows beneath our feet; reverence for birds and beasts, whom I love to call our younger brothers and sisters.  My vision of unity and fellowship and brotherhood is of as in of a world in which the right to life is accorded to every creature that breathes the breath of life! How can wars cease until we stop all killing? How can we claim to seek world peace when we continue to slaughter sentient creatures? Have you ever spared a thought for the atrocities that are perpetrated on the animals day after day, in laboratories and in slaughterhouses? Have you thought of these creatures imprisoned in their tiny cages, deprived of light, fresh air and free movement, compelled to stand and live in their own filth? Let me tell you, we cannot speak of dharma, we cannot speak of creation as one family until we stop the exploitation of animals—until we stop all killing!  We cannot have a world family built on the exploitation of the poor, and on the blood of the dumb, defenceless creatures! Such a ‘family’ will only crumble beneath the burden of its own weight. If civilisation is to endure, it must be built in a new spirit of reverence, in a new religion of reverence for all life. Animal welfare is not enough! We must speak of animal rights! I believe the time has come when all animal lovers must get together and formulate a charter of animal rights—a charter of man’s duty towards the animal kingdom. I hope and pray that India—the country of the Buddha, Mahavira, Mahatma Gandhi and Sadhu Vaswani—will be first among nations to pass an enactment giving rights to animals. The time is come when we must decide once and for all that all types of exploitation must cease. We must recognise the moral inviolability of individual rights—both human and non-human. Just as the poor do not exist as resources for rich, just as women don’t exist as resources for men, even so animals don’t exist as resources for human beings.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/cease-all-exploitation-919621.html
25-11-2020||Oasis||Let love in||After several years we crossed the Atlantic again to go to the USA. One of the first things we did was visit family we had not met in quite some time. After the pleasantries were exchanged, I commented on the distance and time it took for us to drive down to their place. The response was rather interesting and forms the basis of this article. “It’s good to have this distance, this way we keep in touch and also do not encroach upon each other’s lives”. I smiled, the conversation immediately brought back a poem I had studied in school. ‘Mending Wall’ by Frost is relevant even today as the thin line that separates endearment and civility still remains an interesting point of discussion. The poem entails two country neighbours who meet along the wall that separates their properties to mend it where needed; hence the title mending wall. The irony of their coming together to build the wall is not lost on the readers. The speaker in the poem is rather progressive and questions the very need for such a wall, the neighbour, however, is a traditionalist and insists that good fences make good neighbours. Love knows no barriers, no distance, no fences. It does not understand the need to be civil and does not reveal itself from neat, planned distances. Love can get messy, it mocks imposed conditions and does not stay within the tidy picket fences. It encroaches but also grants you intimacy and bliss that restrain cannot even begin to fathom. Two people get lost in a desert and just when they are about to give up, they come across a high wall. They can hear faint sounds of life from the other side, water, birds and people! At a distance, they can also see green branches, laden with what seems like delicious fruit. One of them somehow manages to climb over the wall and disappears. The other, however, break the wall to help other lost travellers find their way to the oasis. Walls; metaphoric, self-imposed and or otherwise can separate suburb from suburb, city from city, country from country, people from people and eventually family from family. Break them to find the oasis within, to let love in.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/let-love-in-919922.html
25-11-2020||Opinion||Calls to regulate dubbed content on Kannada TV and films need to be resisted||After watching the excellent dubbed Kannada version of Tamil superstar Suriya’s Soorarai Pottru, a dramatised biopic on the life of Captain GR Gopinath, the Air Deccan founder, I am certain that every Kannadiga watching it had the same question on their minds: ‘Why didn’t the Kannada film industry make this film?’ Captain Gopinath was, after all, born in the Hassan district of Karnataka.  This perfectly captures the great divide between what the Kannada viewer wants and what s/he is being served regularly by the Kannada film and television industry. In this context, it becomes important to look at the role of dubbed content in films and TV.  To begin with, a cursory search reveals that the serial in question was stopped because of the coronavirus pandemic and that its stopping had nothing to do with dubbing. Although Ms Bhat does say that the existing situation of job losses in the Kannada film and television industry, in conjunction with the pandemic, has led to many series being scrapped and also led tp loss of jobs for technicians and artists, the overall impression is that dubbing has directly led to stoppage of native content. This argument is disingenuous.  Dubbing and job losses  The coronavirus pandemic has shattered the lives of many daily wage labourers and this includes technicians of film and TV industries of all languages. The Kannada TV industry is not an exception. Sumanth Bhat, who is earning laurels for his brilliant performance as Suriya’s voice in the Kannada version of Soorarai Pottru has said in an interview that he lost his job as an announcer on TV just before the pandemic. If not for dubbing, Bhat would have remained unknown and unemployed, as was the case until sometime ago.  The same holds true for many existing and aspiring voice artists, writers and other technicians for whom opportunities were few because of the unofficial dubbing ban that persisted for over 50 years.  Winston Churchill once said that a pessimist sees a threat in every opportunity whereas an optimist sees an opportunity in every threat. Thousands of jobs are made redundant every year in the technology sector due to automation. This crisis is only going to get aggravated in the future with widespread use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Workers in those sectors upskill themselves and end up earning a higher paycheck instead of asking the government to regulate the use of automation or AI.  Similarly, the Karnataka TV industry, for its own good, has to stop asking for regulation of dubbed content and should start competing in the open market for the viewer’s attention and appreciation. In this age of OTT content, the TV industry must indeed think out of the box by telling new stories and strive harder to provide its technicians better livelihood opportunities and, wherever possible, upskill them.  Government intervention in free markets inevitably opens up a Pandora’s Box where every sector will start queuing up for government support when things start going downhill.  A gateway to newer horizons  While Telugu and Tamil film industries opened up for all kinds of dubbed content, widened their markets and embraced competition, it’s only with the 2018 release of the blockbuster, KGF, that came out in various languages, that the Kannada film industry realised the potential of its reach. For over 50 years, the Kannada viewer was forced to watch good content produced in other languages. Only in the past decade, with the arrival of new and talented filmmakers, did the Kannada film industry seem to  make an attempt at reclaiming the ground ceded to film industries of other languages.  Films like Bahubali, serials like Mahanayaka, channels like Discovery, are now available in Kannada for crores of Kannadigas who know no other language except Kannada.Their choices were restricted in the past citing various reasons, but not anymore.’ Whither consumer protection?  Further, Ms. Bhat in her article writes that when “DD was the only accessible channel, the telecast of Ramayan eventually manufactured consent for the Ram Mandir movement,” and that “at least five dubbed serials in Kannada television tell stories from Hindu mythology.” The Kannada dubbed version of Mahabharata was among the most watched shows through its run. Ms. Bhat’s statement about ‘manufactured consent’ is condescending and seems to indicate that the general public is ignorant and have to be educated about their choices.  Due to social media awareness campaigns by organisations like Kannada Grahakara Koota (KGK) things seem to be turning around for Kannada consumers. As the phrase goes, 'Badalavane Jagada Niyama’ or change is the order of the world.

25-11-2020||Opinion||What we don’t talk about when we talk about ‘Big Tech’||Soon, India too will have to wrestle with the issue of regulating these Big Tech companies, which present not only economic challenges but also pose uncomfortable questions about democracy, freedom, and privacy. In addition to the aforementioned ‘global’ Tech Giants, India is likely to face the challenge of ‘domestic’ Big Tech, given the unprecedented rise of Jio. While the economics and politics of regulating Tech firms is a quagmire that India must tread carefully, it should start by contemplating language. Ferdinand de Saussure, the father of modern linguistics, was the first to articulate the now obvious insight that human language is not merely a passive carrier of information, like radio waves, but is, in fact, an active interplay of signs and symbols that contaminates the information it carries. Language does not merely communicate the reality we experience but also shapes our perception of that reality, often reinforcing stereotypes and implicit biases. This is precisely why terms like “terrorist”, “insurgent”, “militant” and “freedom fighter” are fraught with political and ideological subjectivity. Therefore it is difficult for those who are used to thinking of certain people as freedom fighters to even begin to consider that that same person could be a terrorist for others. Yet, for a policymaker, journalist, or researcher, it is important to identify these implicit biases and avoid letting them influence their decision making.  Thus, when thinking about regulating ‘Big Tech’, it is necessary to recognize the implicit assumptions at the heart of the term. To my mind, in addition to being a restrictive term that paints select companies as public enemy number one while ignoring grave challenges posed by other platforms like Twitter, 4chan, and Reddit, there are two misleading implicit assumptions at the heart of ‘Big Tech’: 1) That these tech firms are ‘Big’ monopolies and 2) That they are somehow similar and equal to each other.  Stop moaning about monopolies The first implicit assumption, that these tech firms are monopolies, stems from the ‘Big’ in ‘Big Tech’. Perhaps the greatest challenge for policymakers thinking about technology is to avoid thinking about novel technologies and business models as an extension of past and present frameworks of thought. In Future Politics, a brilliant book that marries political theory with technology, author James Susskind presents the following quote from Henry Ford talking about cars: “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” This “faster-horses” thinking repackages the century-old “break up a monopoly” intervention that was enforced on Standard Oil in 1911 as a solution for the less-than-ideal business practices of tech firms. Indeed, it isn’t self-evident that these companies are really monopolies. Consider Facebook. If we were to think of Facebook simply as a “social networking” site, it can appear to be a monopoly, since it owns Instagram, and is several times larger than Snapchat and Twitter. Yet, this is untrue. Unlike Standard Oil, Facebook does not compete for your money. It competes for your attention. Seen in this way, everything from your spouse to the dozens of unread books in your library are Facebook’s competitors. Facebook, therefore, does not see itself as a monopoly and is rather insecure about its primacy as a social networking giant. I am sure if one were to plot a graph of various products that require our attention, Facebook will not come out on top.  Facebook’s business model is predicated on keeping the user hooked to the app for as long as possible, and yet, given the blessing of capitalism, there are just far too many things today that demand our attention. In order to better regulate Facebook, policymakers must first understand the insecurity at the heart of its business model. All of Facebook’s problems are a product of this insecurity, and thinking of it as a monopoly solves none of them. But even if one were to consider narrow categories and use analogue modes of thinking, TikTok’s spectacular rise in 2018-19 is enough evidence for the fact that Facebook does not enjoy a monopoly even within the narrow category of social networking/social media platforms.  Similarly, Google’s search engine is perhaps closer to a classical monopoly. But the same cannot be said of YouTube. While Youtube is much bigger than Vimeo, it is also in competition with Facebook, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and whatnot.  Big Tech is not a singular entity For instance, Amazon and Facebook are fundamentally different companies, presenting very different kinds of regulatory challenges. The only thing they have in common is our inability to comprehend the millions of lines of code that enable their near-magical functionalities. That is not sufficient reason to shove them into the same ‘Big Tech’ bucket.  The major challenge present by Amazon is the lack of platform neutrality as it is both a platform that connects buyers and sellers and a seller on the platform (through AmazonBasics). This is a business problem. On the other hand, the challenge presented by Facebook is rooted in business but has political implications. As I have pointed out in the previous section, Facebook’s business model is contingent on keeping a user on the app for as long as possible.  Its algorithms create echo chambers, and reward increasingly extreme content, feeding into base human instincts of tribalism and black-and-white thinking in order to keep the user engaged. While Amazon’s problem can still be characterised as an antitrust one, it is near impossible to do so for Facebook. If anything, bringing an antitrust case against Facebook, and breaking it into several companies is likely to accentuate its insecurity and push it to reward more extreme content in order to keep users engaged.  If we begin thinking critically about the language we use to describe our worldviews and communicate our opinions, it will become clear that at the heart of polarisation and poor policy decisions, are the failure of communication, and the ambiguity of language. Perhaps too much damage has already been done in other areas, but in technology policy at least, there is still time to mend them. Let us start by not sorting tech companies by their size and using a one-term-fits-all approach to describe them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/what-we-don-t-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-big-tech-919796.html
25-11-2020||Opinion||Even in a pandemic, the billionaires are winning||When I called up Chuck Collins on Tuesday afternoon, I found him glued to one of the grimmest new metrics documenting America’s economic and social unraveling. Collins is a scholar of inequality at the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank, and since March he has been tracking how the collective wealth of American billionaires has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. In previous recessions, Collins said, billionaires were hit along with the rest of us; it took almost three years for Forbes’ 400 richest people to recover losses incurred in 2008’s Great Recession. But in the coronavirus recession of 2020, most billionaires have not lost their shirts. Instead, they’ve put on bejeweled overcoats and gloves made of spun gold — that is, they’ve gotten richer than ever before. On Tuesday, as the stock market soared to a record, Collins was watching the billionaires cross a depressing threshold: $1 trillion. That is the amount of new wealth American billionaires have amassed since March, at the start of the devastating lockdowns that state and local governments imposed to curb the pandemic. On March 18, according to a report Collins and his colleagues published last week, America’s 614 billionaires were worth a combined $2.95 trillion. When the markets closed Tuesday, there were 650 billionaires and their combined wealth was now close to $4 trillion. In the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, American billionaires’ wealth grew by a third. It is difficult to think of a more succinctly obscene illustration of the unfairness of the American economic and political system. “The economy is now wired ‘heads you win, tails I lose,’ to funnel wealth to the top,” Collins told me. Billionaires amassed their new billions just as millions of other Americans plunged into dire financial straits. More than 20 million people lost their jobs at the start of the pandemic. As Congress lazily contemplates whether or not to bother to continue to provide economic assistance to America’s neediest, as many as 13 million people are at risk of losing the expanded benefits that keep them just beyond the grip of hunger and homelessness. Food banks across the country are bracing for another surge in demand. If a federal moratorium on evictions is allowed to expire at the end of the year, millions of Americans will have to pay months of back rent — making them vulnerable to what housing advocates warn will be a wave of evictions. Why are American billionaires doing so well while so many other Americans suffer? Part of the story is garden-variety American inequality. Stocks are overwhelmingly owned by the wealthy, and the stock market has recovered from its early-pandemic depths much more quickly than other parts of the economy. But some billionaires are also benefiting from economic and technological trends that were accelerated by the pandemic. Among these are the owners and investors of retail giants like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Dollar Tree and Dollar General, which have reported huge profits this year while many of their smaller competitors were clobbered as the coronavirus spread. Then there are companies that have bet on the rapid digitization of everything. Eric Yuan, the chief executive of Zoom, became a billionaire in 2019. Now he is worth almost $20 billion. Apoorva Mehta, the founder of the grocery-delivery company Instacart, was not a billionaire last year; this year, after a spike in orders that led to a new round of investment that pumped up the value of his company, he’s safely in the club. Dan Gilbert, the chairman of Quicken Loans, was worth less than $7 billion in March; now he commands more than $43 billion. But like in the rest of the economy, there is a great deal of stratification even among billionaires — richer billionaires got even richer in 2020 than the poorer ones did. Some of the numbers are staggering. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, was worth about $113 billion at the start of the pandemic. Now he is worth $182 billion — an increase of about $69 billion. Jim, Alice and Rob Walton, three of the largest shareholders of Walmart, saw their combined wealth grow by $47 billion during the pandemic. Two years ago, Bezos was the only “centibillionaire” on Earth — the trendy neologism for people whose wealth exceeds $100 billion. Now there are five — in addition to Bezos, there’s Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Bernard Arnault, the French luxury tycoon. Arnault’s wealth plummeted early in the pandemic, but demand for some luxury goods has rebounded in recent months, and his fortune is once again secure. The political scene has also been kind to billionaires in 2020. A year ago, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren appeared to have a good shot at capturing the Democratic nomination for president, and pundits like myself were suggesting extreme measures like the abolishment of billionaires. Billionaires can breathe much easier now. Joe Biden, not Sanders or Warren, is going to be the president. As he told a gathering of donors last year, Biden believes that rich people are “just as patriotic as poor people,” and he suggested that “nothing would fundamentally change” for the wealthy when he’s in charge. The possibility that the Senate will remain in Republican hands — or, if not, will be closely divided — is also good for billionaires. Some of the most ambitious liberal efforts to combat inequality — like a repeal of Trump’s corporate tax cuts, a new wealth tax or a tax on financial transactions — look unlikely to pass. The political results point to the continuing danger to our democracy of the rise of superbillionaires — that they will use their wealth to build a political fortress around themselves, allowing them to gain even more wealth and influence. “I do think we’re at risk of the oligarchic death spiral,” Collins told me. “Wealth concentrates and power concentrates, and the wealthy use their power to rig the rules to get more wealth and power.” Collins is hopeful that we can avert the death spiral. He suggested that extreme inequality could prompt a political backlash. Perhaps, seeing the pandemic’s toll on nonbillionaire Americans, our leaders will be moved to fight for greater benefits for workers, more affordable and accessible health care and child care, and progressive taxation that can reduce some of the disparities between people at the top and everyone else. In the absence of such reforms, Collins said, we may be staring down an uglier future. “The knot that we’re in is a tough one to unravel in a peaceful way,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/even-in-a-pandemic-the-billionaires-are-winning-919845.html
25-11-2020||Panorama||Allowing large industrial houses into banking is unwise||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to issue final guidelines for licensing private sector banks shortly, allowing large corporate houses into banking. Industrial houses are, of course, bound to love the initiative. The same proposal had come up over a decade ago, in 2010-11, when the RBI had considered issuing additional banking licences to private sector players. RBI had placed a discussion paper titled “Entry of New Banks in the Private Sector” in August 2010 on its website to “marshal the international practices, the Indian experience as well as the extant ownership and governance guidelines,” and invited comments. The discussion paper had looked into several issues such as foreign shareholding in the new banks; whether industrial and business houses should be allowed to promote banks; whether Non-Banking Financial Companies be allowed conversion into banks or to promote a bank; and the appropriate business model for the new banks. At the time, the RBI had commented on their website that “the range of comments received has been very wide and did not indicate consensus on any of the issues,” and the dialogue had gone on well into 2015, before 23 new licences were granted to new players for payments banks and small finance banks aimed at deepening financial inclusion. But at the time, allowing industrial houses for setting up banks was a definite no-no. If the current business environment has necessitated the need to have industrial houses set up banks, one is not aware of any new discussion paper circulated by the RBI or invitation for any public comments. It is therefore not clear exactly what may be the reason for considering the entry of large industrial houses into banking once again. I do not think a discussion on the number of banks, branches and ATMs spread between public and private sector banks or between urban and rural areas is likely to settle this question. To my mind, the most important issue is that the quality of corporate and regulatory governance in India today does not augur well for the initiative. It is not as if the RBI is not aware of this risk. That’s why, according to RBI itself, “Large corporate/industrial houses may be allowed as promoters of banks only after necessary amendments to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (to prevent connected lending and exposures between the banks and other financial and non-financial group entities); and strengthening of the supervisory mechanism for large conglomerates, including consolidated supervision.” While that rider may sound reasonable, RBI can hardly deny that the quality of banking oversight in the country is far from adequate, if their extremely poor asset quality (NPAs), balance-sheet management and crony-lending -- rampant in public and private sector banks alike -- is any evidence. Clearly, it is too early to allow more industrial houses into the banking sector. For starters, such a move is bound to concentrate political and economic power in the hands of a handful of industrial houses. Worse, our standards of corporate governance in corporate houses, banks and NBFCs alike – if recent examples are any evidence – are far from comforting. Some of the troubling developments at Café Coffee Day, Jet Airways, Zee TV, Yes Bank, ICICI Bank, IL&FS, DHFL, etc., are well known. Moreover, the sunny days of infrastructure companies already seem to be under a cloud. Six of the top 10 infrastructure companies – all of them with unsustainably enormous debts -- have either gone bankrupt or are nearly there. Most of them, virtually unknown entities some two decades ago with barely Rs 100 crore of net worth to their name, today have debts of the order of Rs 25,000 crore or more – mostly from banks, including private banks. Many of them funded the operations of literally hundreds of subsidiaries, only by constantly promoting new and seriously over-invoiced projects from bank financing, thus perpetually funding their operations and profligacy from the cash flows of new projects – an obfuscated Ponzi-like scheme, if there was one, making the tracking of funds utilisation nearly impossible. Corporates have been known to divert funds in plain sight, without a banker ever enquiring into the source of funding of their huge unproductive assets and capital expenditure on planes, luxury homes and yachts. A corporate house wishing to finance a jet with bank funding may not be a problem in itself, provided the jet could be justified as being cost-effective for the CEO-promoters, given their supposedly huge opportunity cost of time. The profitability of the business could make such loans justifiable, even sustainable. But if the profits are zero or entirely inadequate even to service their debt, isn’t the opportunity cost of such corporate czars zero? Where then is the case for financing such assets? Allowing corporate houses into banking may well encourage circular banking, where the house of A banks the projects of B, B that of C, and C that of A, in a tight cartel-like mutual understanding not unknown in the corporate world. Allowing corporate houses into banking may well make the plight of the depositors much riskier. Besides, shouldn’t capital frugality be an important consideration whether the capital in question is equity capital or debt capital, whether at the hands of a corporate house or a bank? Poor corporate governance implies greater Principal-Agency costs which erode shareholder value. Allowing corporates into banking may increase these agency costs. Capital frugality is sadly wanting among Indian corporates. Time and again, we have seen boards, internal auditors, statutory auditors, credit-rating agencies and CFOs closing their stable doors only after the horses have bolted. I, for one, am convinced that unless we tighten our corporate and regulatory governance standards a good deal more, industrial houses ought not to be allowed even a 26% stake in the banks. The old ceiling of 15% should be adequate. After all, no amount of auditing and RBI’s regulatory skill prevented the motivated lending mishap at ICICI, did it?

25-11-2020||Right in the Middle||The stuff of dreams||You would be surprised if I told you what I missed most during the lockdown. I missed evenings at furniture or arts and crafts exhibitions! Yes, I am serious. When the wife would ask me to take her there, I was not one of those brave men who could turn her down. I was almost enthusiastic to a fault, though there is not an inch of place in my home to put new furniture in nor do I have an eye for art. The good news is that such exhibitions have opened up now. We were the early birds. You have guessed it right, I had ulterior motives. On reaching the ground, I urge the wife to go and buy the entrance ticket so that I could get a little breather for myself. The first item on the agenda was to get those delicious cones filled with roasted peanuts, beckoned by the beautiful sound of bells announcing the location of the vendor. After shoving a couple of them in my pocket, I join her for the great expedition into the vast bays of furniture display. There was a festive look and a dance program was on organised by young girls and some not that youngwhose laboured movements made me quip that perhaps they were out of practice. There were the usual sofas, dining tables of sorts, but it was easy to give the slip and move toward the real highlights of the exhibition. It generally starts with the guy with a chappathi maker. Showing interest in the contraption, you may gobble up a piece or two of the fresh from thava chappathi. If you are lucky you may have stuffed parathas that day. Next in line is the griller with a skewer of paneer and capsicum. But they all know me and I don’t have to pretend to be a serious buyer. With a conspiratory grin, he signals me to help myself.  But who takes the cake is the fellow with a giant frying pan making bajjis, vadas and such absolutely divine low cholesterol, low triglyceride(???) irresistibles. After all, so many flies cannot be wrong. These are not for free and you have to buy them, not that I would have minded giving a share of my property for such forbidden goodies. I was yet to explore the giant-size papad fellow and several other well-meaning diversions when the wife shakes me from morning nap. I promise myself I shall catch up tomorrow, but now for the unfinished vegetable cutting.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/the-stuff-of-dreams-919619.html
25-11-2020||Right in the Middle||Conversations before Covid-19||A group of us were sitting around the dining table when suddenly someone asked, “what did we talk about before Covid-19?” There was shocked silence. It was hard for any one of us to believe that there was anything before Covid-19 worth talking about. “Didn’t we talk about protests against CAA/NRC and Shaheen Bagh?“ one of the men asked. “I think we did,” said one of the ladies, “ but I can’t remember what we said about them.” “I believe it had to do with the rising tensions the society,” someone chimed in. “That is correct,” the lady said, “But surely we talked about other things besides...” We all started thinking hard, trying to recall something before Covid-19. “Wait a minute,” a friend said. “Wasn’t there something about economy?” “You mean how we can increase our GDP to 5 trillion dollar by 2025?” asked someone else. “Yes, but also about how to create more jobs for our young population,” said another. “I remember we talked about the upcoming IPL,” someone remembered. “Yeah we were all so excited” “In our family, we talked about where to go for our next vacation .” “That reminds me of our trip together to Goa in January. What fun we had.” “Say, I just remembered something. In our condominium, we talked about infighting in our RWA.” “What about the election results in Delhi and upcoming elections in Bihar and West Bengal. “ “Not to mention the American presidential election in November 2020.” “I think we also talked about how to eradicate poverty and bridge the gap between the rich and poor.” “Kashmir engaged public attention too.” said someone else. “Those were great days,’’ someone said. “ I hope they are back soon .” “Let us make a pact of not to talk about the Covid-19 for rest of the evening.” Everyone agreed. We ate our food silently. Finally, someone asked, “has anyone read ‘Talking to Strangers’ by Malcolm Gladwell?” No one had. We returned to our food. Every guest tried to think about another subject besides Covid-19, but no one could come up with one. We all left hurriedly after coffee.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/conversations-before-covid-19-919920.html
25-11-2020||Second Edit||Attempts to curb free speech must stop||The Kerala government has done well to put on hold the retrograde ordinance, which was modelled on the infamous Section 66A of the IT Act and Section 118(d) of the Kerala Police Act itself, both of which the Supreme Court had struck down in 2015 for their “chilling effect’’ on free speech. Under the garb of curbing online abuse of women and children, the ordinance criminalises a wide swathe of speech in any forum. The amended Section 118(a) mandates a three-year jail term for anyone sending offensive, humiliating or threatening messages to others. The offences are as vague and inadequately defined as those struck down by the court for being constitutionally ultra vires and detrimental to free speech. And being vague, they could well be misused. The definition of the offence can even be stretched to include speech on other media, too.  The claim that these stringent provisions are needed to tackle crimes against women and children is questionable. These can be dealt with under existing laws like the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the POCSO Act. Often, offences of that nature are not even registered and investigated under these laws. The validity of the ordinance is in doubt not only on the constitutional ground of violation of the right to free speech, but also because it is repugnant to existing laws. The offences under it are cognisable while criminal defamation under the IPC is non-cognisable. It empowers a police officer to register an FIR while defamation law calls for a complaint from an aggrieved party. It prescribes a prison term of three years while the IPC prescribes a two-year term. The ordinance, in effect, makes amendments to central laws, which states are not empowered to do.  The ordinance is a blunt weapon that can be used arbitrarily by police, which means the government, against “anyone who expresses, publishes or disseminates ‘false views’ that threaten, abuse, humiliate or defames another person or class of persons causing injury to the mind, reputation or property’’. The government has claimed that it is well-intentioned, but the road to jail for many may also be paved with those intentions. It is unfortunate that the political class, left or right, instinctively reaches for the law’s gun to silence free speech, under pressure sometimes but even otherwise. The Left Front government is under pressure from investigations by many central agencies and may have succumbed to the authoritarian temptation. But it responded to public opinion and followed the CPM central leadership’s view to put a hold on the ordinance. It should drop it altogether.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/attempts-to-curb-free-speech-must-stop-919615.html
25-11-2020||Second Edit||Lingayat board: A self-serving move||The recent decision by Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa to set up two development corporations, one for Marathas and the other for Veerashaiva-Lingayats, has more to do with political exigencies than with the uplift of these communities, which are by no means backward. The Maratha Development Board, political observers have noted, seems to have been set up to entice members of this community who form a sizeable population in Basavakalyana Assembly constituency where by-polls are due, following the death of the sitting MLA. It is no secret that Yediyurappa is lobbying for the BJP ticket for his son B Y Vijayendra and would like to leave no stone unturned to ensure his victory. The formation of the Karnataka Veerashaiva-Lingayat Development Corporation (KVLDC) appears to be part of a larger strategy to woo this dominant community to which Yediyurappa belongs, in the backdrop of intense speculation that the BJP wants him to step down as Chief Minister. While the stated objective of KVLDC, which is being registered under the Companies Act, is to help economically, socially and educationally backward people from the community, it is intriguing that a whopping Rs 500 crore has been allotted, without any budgetary sanction, even before the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association have been framed. While it is true that there are poor even among the Lingayats, allocating a huge sum without a proper study of the community’s socio-economic conditions is wrong. Indeed, it is wrong to set up caste-based corporations for political gains. Worse, it has opened the floodgates to similar demands from the other dominant community, the Vokkaligas, too. Previous Chief Ministers like HD Kumaraswamy and Siddaramaiah too are guilty of having set up such boards, but Yediyurappa’s decision appears to have been largely motivated by the need to consolidate his own position within his community, which is said to constitute about 17% of the state’s population. If push comes to shove in the party on the matter of his continuation in office, he may be forced to make a tough call, in which case community support will come in handy. At a time when the government is forced to borrow an additional Rs 33,000 crore to bridge the revenue deficit arising out of the Covid-19 situation, it is unfortunate that the resources of the state are being stretched to meet political ends. Most importantly, setting up of such caste-based development boards goes against the concept of equitable distribution of resources and inclusive growth of the entire society, especially the socially disadvantaged sections, who have a legitimate claim to a larger pie of the finances.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/lingayat-board-a-self-serving-move-919915.html

Confusion over where Cyclone Nivar will make landfall||Very severe cyclonic storm Nivar is expected to make its landfall between Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts on Wednesday night or in the wee hours of Thursday. However, there was confusion over the cyclone's landfall area with the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) projecting it to be around Puducherry and independent weather bloggers suggesting that the very severe cyclonic storm will cross between Mamallapuram and Kalpakkam, 70 km from Chennai. While the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) predicted that Cyclone Nivar packing winds to the speed of 120 to 130 km per hour gusting to 145 km per hour will make its landfall near Puducherry on Wednesday night, the European model says the Cyclone will cross between Mamallapuram and Kalpakkam, which houses a nuclear power station. The Madras Atomic Power Station in Kalpakkam had on Tuesday said it has activated the cyclone protection machinery and that all preparedness measures including placing sandbags on the coastal side, clearing of storm drains, and inspection of plant buildings and structures have been done. In its latest bulletin issued at 8.30 am, the IMD said Cyclone Nivar lay 290 km east-south-east of Cuddalore, and 350 km south-south-east of Chennai at 5.30 am on Wednesday.   “It is very likely to intensify further into a very severe cyclonic storm during the next 12 hours. It is very likely to move north-westwards and cross Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts between Karaikal and Mamallapuram around Puducherry during mid-night of November 25 and early hours of November 26 as a very severe cyclonic storm,” the IMD said. It said squally wind will gradually increase to 120-130 km per hour gusting to 145 km per hour along and off coastal districts of north Tamil Nadu and Puducherry (Nagapattinam, Karaikal, Mayiladuthurai, Cuddalore, Puducherry, Villupuram and Chengalpattu), while the wind speed in Tiruvarur, Kanchipuram, Chennai, Tiruvallur districts will be 80-90 km per hour gusting to 100 km per hour. Independent weather blogger Pradeep John, who is credited with rightly predicting landfall of cyclones, said Cyclone Nivar will cross between Pondicherry and Chennai near Mamallapuram and Kalpakkam. “So the conclusion is that Cyclone Nivar is expected to cross between Pondy and Chennai near Mamallapuram-Kalpakkam areas with some + or – some km on the night of November 25 to November 26 morning. The difference is not much between Mamallapuram and Chennai. If some little deviations occur, there are slight chances that a cyclone might even land over Chennai,” he wrote. The Weather Channel reported that different model projections still show a significant deviation in the trajectory of the storm. “According to the US Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), Cyclone Nivar will travel north-west while developing to the strength of Very Severe Cyclonic Storm (VSCS) on Thursday dawn. Other Numerical Weather Prediction models forecast landing times much earlier, similar to that of IMD GFS,” The Weather Channel reported.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/puducherry-or-mamallapuram-confusion-over-where-cyclone-nivar-will-make-landfall-919682.html
25-11-2020||South||Cyclone Nivar: Excess water from Chembarambakkam to be released||Around 1,000 cusecs of water will be released from the Chembarambakkam Lake, one of the reservoirs that supply water to Chennai, on Wednesday afternoon, authorities said and appealed to the people not to “fear” due to opening of the lake. The Public Works Department (PWD) said according to protocol excess water will be released once the water level reaches 22 feet as against the full reservoir level of 24 feet. “Since the water level is about to reach 22 feet, we have decided to release 1,000 cusecs of water from Chembarambakkam Lake at 12 pm on Wednesday,” the PWD said in a circular. The release of water will be regulated as per the inflow into the reservoir. It also asked people living in low-lying areas across the Adyar river to be alert and vigilant. Authorities also appealed to people not to fear the release of water from Chembarambakkam. The announcement that the Chembarambakkam Lake, located close to Poonamalle on the outskirts of Chennai, brought back the scary memories of the 2015 floods during which the city was swamped for days together. It is widely believed that discharge of excess water from Chembarambakkam Lake at “one go” led to unprecedented floods in Chennai in the first week of December 2015. Drainage congestion, encroachments in lakes and river channels, and large releases from storage reservoirs like Chembarambakkam, besides heavy rainfall were some of the reasons cited by a Parliamentary Committee for the 2015 floods that left a permanent scar on the residents. Over 300 people died and the economic losses are estimated to be anywhere between Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 1 lakh crore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cyclone-nivar-excess-water-from-chembarambakkam-to-be-released-919687.html

Meanwhile, water will be released from Chembarambakkam lake, one of the key drinking water sources to the city, since it was nearing capacity, by noon, the government said. In its latest bulletin on Wednesday, the IMD said NIVAR over southwest Bay of Bengal moved west-northwestwards with a speed of 07 kmph during past six hours and lay centred at 0530 hrs of today at about 290 km east-southeast of Cuddalore, about 300 km east southeast of Puducherry and 350 km south southeast of Chennai. "It is very likely to intensify further into a very severe cyclonic storm during next 12 hours. It is very likely to move northwestwards and cross Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts between Karaikal and Mamallapuram around Puducherry during mid-night of November 25 and early hours of November 26 as a very severe cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 120-130 kmph gusting to 145 kmph," it said. Chennai and its suburbs received heavy overnight rains, with low-lying areas getting inundated and water entering houses in such localities. Civic body officials were involved in clearing the roads of stagnant water, even as many city residents recalled the damage caused during the 2015 deluge. A holiday has been declared in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday in view of the cyclone's expected landfall while transport services have been suspended. Meanwhile, PWD officials announced that 1000 cusecs of water will be released from the Chembarambakkam lake, as the level stood at 22 ft of the total 24ft. Water will be released from 12 noon onwards and the discharge will be stepped up depending upon the inflow, they said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cyclone-nivar-to-cross-coast-between-tamil-nadu-and-puducherry-on-wednesday-night-or-thursday-morning-imd-919700.html

25-11-2020||South||Cyclone Nivar increases speed, to cross Puducherry coast Wednesday night or early Thursday||Packing a punch, Cyclone Nivar increased its speed to 11 km per hour on the course to make landfall between Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts by Wednesday night or early Thursday morning packing winds to the speed of 120 to 130 km per hour gushing up to 145 km per hour. A little before 5 pm, Cyclone Nivar intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm, Dr S Balachandran, Deputy Director General, Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai, said. “The cyclone will begin its landfall between Wednesday night and Thursday morning around Puducherry. The approximate landing time would be two hours,” he told Deccan Herald. Cyclone Nivar, which was moving at 7 kmph at 5:30 am on Wednesday, gradually increased its speed through the day and at the time of writing, it was travelling at 16 kmph. It lay about 90 km east-south-east of Cuddalore, 150 km east-south-east of Puducherry, and 220 km south-east of Chennai at 2:30 pm. “It is very likely to move west north-westwards and cross Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts between Karaikal and Mamallapuram around Puducherry during mid-night of November 25 and early hours of November 26 as a very severe cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 120-130 kmph gusting to 145 kmph,” the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said in its latest bulletin at 5.00 pm. However, independent weather blogger Pradeep John and weather portals forecast the landing area between Mamallapuram and Kalpakkam, which houses an atomic power plant. A clear picture of the landfall area is expected to emerge Wednesday evening. The government extended a public holiday announced on Wednesday to Thursday as well in 16 districts. Due to the severity of the cyclone, Chennai Airport suspended operations for 12 hours from 7 pm on Wednesday. Chennai receives 16 cm rainfall in 24 hours Chennai and other coastal districts continued to receive heavy to heavy rains since Monday morning submerging many low-lying areas across the metropolis. The city's average rainfall in the last 24 hours ending at 8.30 am on Wednesday was 16 cm, the IMD said, adding this was the highest in the state. The intensity of rain in Chennai was increasing every hour with a majority of the areas drenched since Tuesday. The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) said it was prepared to face any eventuality and has set up 169 relief centres across the city to house people who are being evacuated from low-lying areas. With rains set to intensify in Chennai, GCC Commissioner G Prakash asked officials to remove all hoardings and banners to avoid any danger. Revenue Minister R B Udhayakumar said as many as 24,166 persons, including 10,270 women and 3,948 children, were evacuated from low-lying areas and lodged at 315 relief centres in 13 districts across the state. The state has kept 4,733 relief centres ready that will be able to accommodate nearly 13 lakh people. He also said the NDRF has already pre-positioned 12 teams across the state, while the Indian Army will deploy 12 Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Teams and two Engineer Task Force. The Indian Navy and the Indian Coast Guard have made elaborate arrangements by keeping ships and Dornier aircraft on stand-by. Water released from Chembarambakkam Lake In Chennai, people living in low-lying areas on the banks of Adyar River were asked to be vigilant and move to safety as the Public Works Department (PWD) released 1,000 cusecs of water from the Chembarambakkam Lake, one of the reservoirs that supply water to the city. Release of water from the lake caused much fear among people as it is widely believed that discharge of excess water from Chembarambakkam Lake at “one go” led to unprecedented floods in Chennai in the first week of December 2015. However, authorities asked people not to panic. Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami visited Chembarambakkam Lake to take stock of the situation, while the Leader of Opposition hit the streets by visiting flood-affected areas in his constituency, Kolathur in Chennai, and other areas of the city. The Public Works Department (PWD) said according to protocol excess water will be released once the water level reaches 22 feet as against the full reservoir level of 24 feet. Health Minister visits hospitals in Mamallapuram With power supply likely to be snapped during the landfall time, the government asked hospitals to ensure that their generators are in working condition and that they have enough fuel in reserve. Tamil Nadu government has kept 465 ambulances ready in the seven districts, while setting up control rooms set up in all 36 revenue districts. Health Minister C Vijayabaskar and Health Secretary J Radhakrishnan visited the government hospital in Mamallapuram, one of the areas to be affected, and checked the preparedness. The IMD also forecast heavy to very heavy rains for the next two days in Chennai, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, and Chengalpattu districts and warned of flooding, disruption of electricity and water services, possible damage to roads, and some areas getting inundated. Rains will continue across coastal Tamil Nadu. Public transport remains suspended in Pudukkottai, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Cuddalore, Villupuram, and Chengalpattu districts, and in Puducherry, and Karaikal till further orders, while sub-urban trains in Chennai will not run beyond 10 am on Wednesday.   Measures in Puducherry With the cyclone likely to make landfall around Puducherry, Chief Minister V Narayanasamy held a review meeting on Monday night and asked all departments to open control rooms to attend to complaints from people relating to the cyclone. Elaborate precautionary measures have been taken in Karaikal, an enclave attached to the UT which is around 150 km from Puducherry, as well with one team of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) pre-positioning in the district. Two NDRF teams are in Puducherry, while six have been deployed in neighbouring Cuddalore district in Tamil Nadu, just 20 km away. With the cyclone likely to uproot trees, the UT government has asked the Public Works Department (PWD) to prune the tree branches and keep ready the machinery needed to remove trees if they are uprooted during the landfall. “Elaborate precautionary measures have been taken in the Union Territory because Cyclone Nivar is likely to make its landfall here. Imposition of Section 144 will help us control people from stepping out. Our aim is to minimise damage due to the cyclone as much as possible,” Narayanasamy told DH.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cyclone-nivar-increases-speed-to-cross-puducherry-coast-wednesday-night-or-early-thursday-919721.html
25-11-2020||South||Cyclone Nivar: Here are tips to protect your vehicles||In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the protagonist Harry Potter and his close friend Ron Weasley took the flying Ford Anglia to go to Hogwarts after missing the train. While the car flew because of Arthur Weasley's magic in the realm of enchantment, there are several instances in the muggle word where cars have repeated that feat and decided to take the aerial route, thanks to the cyclones. Very severe cyclonic storm Nivar is expected to make its landfall between Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts on Wednesday night or in the wee hours of Thursday. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Cyclone Nivar is gradually intensifying. It could cause structural damage, uproot trees, destroy thatched or tin houses, and damage crops. The IMD estimates that while crossing the coasts between Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, the average wind speed will be 120-130 kmph and maximum wind speed can be 145 kmph.   In such a scenario, owners must protect their cars or the damage inflicted on them will be severe. Here are some tips to protect your vehicles amid cyclones: > It is best to park the vehicle in a covered area, preferably a secured garage. Keeping it in an open space means that trees and poles can fall on its roof, damaging the car. Activate the handbrake to thwart the vehicle's movement. In case of two-wheelers, it will be easier to probably tie it to something to avoid it from being swept away by strong winds.   > If you're parking your vehicle in an open area, avoid low-lying areas as flooding or waterlogging in the basement could cause major damages to the vehicle. A vehicle, if kept in a low-lying area, can be damaged as those areas are most prone to waterlogging. If water inside enters inside the car, then it usually brings trouble with it. So make sure to park the vehicle in a place which is high and moderately dry. And if the water rises above the bonnet or the grill, contact your insurance company on priority. > Before starting the car, check for any fluid leakage and most importantly, for any damage in the electrical system. Also, check the oil indicator as it will give a hint of moisture in the engine. > Lastly, take care of insurance. If the car is heavily damaged or submerged completely, call the agent of your insurance company and check the extent of the damage. For if the car is deemed to be irretrievable, the money will offer some solace. But do not try to start the vehicle before repairing it, as it will only aggravate the damage and insurance may not cover it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cyclone-nivar-here-are-tips-to-protect-your-vehicles-919729.html

The Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (Economic Offences), Ernakulam, granted the Customs (Preventive) Commissionerate five day custody of the bureaucrat considering its argument about his alleged role in the sensational case through diplomatic channel. In the remand report filed in the court on Tuesday, the Customs had claimed that the key accused in the gold smuggling case, Swapna Suresh, has revealed that Sivasankar was in the know and has also abetted the smuggling activities. The Customs said Suresh made this claim during her interrogation at the Attakkulangara Vanitha jail in Thiruvananthapuram, on November 18. Sivasankar was formally arrested by the customs on Tuesday at a jail where he is currently lodged. Earlier, a special court for PMLA cases had granted the customs permission to arrest Sivasankar. He was sent to judicial custody last week following his custodial interrogation by the Enforcement Directorate probing the money trail in the gold smuggling case. The Customs has said it has arrested around 15 people, including prime accused Swapna Suresh, Sarith PS and Sandeep Nair, in connection with the seizure of 30 kg smuggled gold illicitly imported as diplomatic baggage of UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. The agency has claimed that it has now come to light that Sivasankar, who has been arrayed as fifth accused in the case registered by the ED, is also involved in the issue. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), the ED and the Customs are conducting separate investigations into the racket that was busted with the seizure of gold on July 5. The IAS officer was suspended after his links to Suresh, a former employee of the consulate surfaced.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-court-grants-customs-custody-of-m-sivasankar-in-gold-smuggling-case-919754.html

According to TDB officials, pilgrims can pay a deposit of Rs 200 to receive a steel bottle in which they can collect medicinal drinking water from the Anjaneya auditorium in Pamba, the base camp. When the steel bottle is returned to the counter after the darshan, the deposit amount would be refunded, they said. Besides this, water is also distributed in disposable paper glass at various points like Pamba, Charalmedu, Jyothinagar and Malikappuram in the trekking route, as part of Covid-19 precautionary measures, they added. The medicinal drinking water, distributed among Lord Ayyappa devotees during every pilgrim season, is prepared by boiling herbal articles like 'chukk' (dried ginger), 'ramacham' (vetiver) and 'pathimukham' (sappanwood). Used paper glass, abandoned by devotees, is collected and disposed of in an eco-friendly manner. Medicinal drinking water is prepared at the distribution centres itself, they said adding that the employees who distribute it wear masks, face shields and gloves, adhering to Covid protocols. Currently, there are three to four employees working on a shift basis at the four medicinal water distribution centres at Sabarimala. A total of 55 temporary employees were working eight hours a day there, the officials added. Dhanu S Krishnan is the Special Officer for the medicinal drinking water programme. The annual two-month-long Mandala-Makaravilakku season at Sabarimala began on November 16, adhering to strict Covid- 19 guidelines. It is the first annual pilgrimage season at the hill temple after the coronavirus outbreak.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sabarimala-pilgrims-get-medicinal-drinking-water-in-bottles-amid-covid-19-919759.html

Chief Minister K Palaniswami, meanwhile, declared Thursday a public holiday for 13 districts including Chennai, Vellore, Cuddalore, Villupuram, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Chengelpet and Kancheepuram considering the safety of people in view of the cyclone. Wednesday has already been declared a holiday. In its latest bulletin, the IMD said Nivar would cross over between Karaikal and Mamallapuram "during the midnight of November 25 and early hours of 26 November." The storm, 250 km off Chennai and 190 km and 180 km from Puducherry and Cuddalore respectively is very likely to move northwestwards and cross coasts as a "very severe cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 120-130 kmph gusting to 145 kmph." Under the influence of the cyclone, coastal and north interior Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal regions are likely to receive rainfall on Wednesday at most places with heavy to very heavy showers at a few places and extremely heavy rains at isolated places. South coastal Andhra Pradesh is also likely to witness showers at most places today. Rainfall is expected to continue in many places in these regions Thursday too with heavy rainfall at some places. Surplus water was released from Chembarambakkam lake, one of the key drinking water sources to the city since it almost neared its capacity, the government said. PWD officials said 1000 cusecs was released from the lake as the level stood at 22 feet of the total 24 feet. Chennai and its suburbs, which received heavy overnight rains, continued to witness intermittent showers coupled with strong winds with low-lying areas getting inundated and water entering houses in such localities. Civic body officials were involved in clearing the roads of stagnant water. The Tamil Nadu government appealed to people living in coastal districts to not venture out of their homes and requested those living in low lying areas to reach the cyclone shelters in their respective regions.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cyclone-nivar-likely-to-cross-coast-tonight-tamil-nadu-cm-declares-one-more-day-holiday-919793.html

The kits, including food packets, clothes and other materials, sent to Nilambur in Malappuram district which is part of the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency represented by Rahul, were found unused in a room when a few people arrived to rent the space on Tuesday. The kits were believed to be sent by Rahul during the last year's flood. Nilambur and nearby areas witnessed major landslides and flood that even claimed many lives. CPM local leaders alleged that the Congress workers tried to black-market the flood relief kits. The DYFI, youth wing of the ruling CPI-M, staged a protest march against the Congress and asked its leaders to tender an apology to the people. Nilambur MLA P V Anwar (independent supporting LDF) on Wednesday sought a probe by the District Collector K Gopalakrishnan. He claimed after the matter came to light, Congress leaders allegedly destroyed other such stocks from across the constituency. "This is not an isolated matter from Nilambur. They (Congress party) had stocked food materials at many other places to influence voters in the upcoming local body elections. After this came to light, the Congress leaders removed or destroyed the food kits from other places," Anwar told reporters in a video message. "The district collector should probe the matter. The food kits were for the people suffering from a natural calamity. KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran should reply," he said. District Congress president V V Prakash said a probe would be initiated into the matter. The state leadership is yet to respond to the matter. The kits were found in covers inscribed with 'MP Wayanad' on them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/flood-relief-kits-from-rahul-gandhi-found-unused-trigger-stir-919801.html

Banks shall credit the loan amount of Rs 10,000 to the beneficiaries’ accounts within 10 days. “From now on, small, petty vendors, artisans need not approach private money lenders for loans and be burdened with heavy interest, as they can avail loans from banks under the Jagananna Thodu scheme to use as their working capital,” Reddy said during the programme's launch on Wednesday. The Chief Minister said that the programme was designed in view of the plight of small vendors and artisans he witnessed during his 3,648-km padayatra in the state before the 2019 elections. Officials said that the government will be paying interest of about Rs 100 crore annually on the beneficiary behalf, under the scheme. The beneficiaries will also be provided with a QR-based smart ID card and if they repay the loan amount within time, the government shall reimburse the interest amount once every three months directly to the beneficiaries’ accounts, and further, they become eligible for another loan. “These vendors cater to the needs of the public in rain or sun, selling vegetables, flowers etc, essentials on the streets to survive. As they fall under the unorganised sector, banks also decline loans. So they end up approaching private parties, take loans at high interest rates to run their businesses, and often fall into huge debts,” the CM said. Reddy said that Jagananna Thodu will bring a positive change in the lives of such vendors. Volunteers and welfare assistants of village/ward secretariats would assist in identifying beneficiaries, accepting applications and arranging loans. Any eligible person left uncovered can apply through volunteers, and upon verification, they will also be provided with the scheme's benefits in a month or two. They can also call on the 1902 toll-free number for enrollment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/andhra-pradesh-cm-jaganmohan-reddy-launches-support-scheme-for-street-vendors-919848.html

The ruling CPM-led Left Democratic Front that had been alleging that the central agencies like CAG and Enforcement Directorate were acting as per the political ploy of BJP by finding faults with state's key development initiatives also launched public protests from Wednesday to campaign against the central agencies. CPM Kerala secretary in-charge A Vijayaraghavan even termed the central agencies as 'Kar Sevaks' of the BJP. However, the open attack of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan against CAG on Tuesday is likely to snowball into a controversy as the Chief Minister referred to contents of a CAG report that was yet to be tabled in the Assembly. The CAG had pointed out flaws in Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), an agency under the state government, for raising foreign investments by issuing Masala Bonds. While leader of opposition Ramesh Chennithala alleged that the Chief Minister violated the Constitution, BJP state president K Surendran said that the state government could be dissolved as the Chief Minister and Finance Minister accessed the CAG reports before being tabled in Assembly. Already, Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Isaac was caught up in a controversy for publicly criticising the CAG for finding faults with the KIIFB in its report, which was yet to be tabled in Assembly. The opposition also sought a breach of privilege motion notice against him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-oppn-targets-pinarayi-vijayan-over-revealing-cag-report-contents-ahead-of-tabling-it-in-assembly-919853.html

Though releasing of water from a reservoir is common, Chennaiites fear Chembarambakkam, as it is widely believed that huge amount of water released from the lake, located 30 km away from the city, was responsible for the floods that swamped the city five years ago. The fear was compounded as a circular from the Centre warned that the catchment areas of the lake might receive 20 cm rainfall in the next two days. The news that the gates of the lake were being opened brought back the chilling memories of 2015 floods that cut off the city from the rest of the state for a few days in December that year. Over 300 people died during the flood, which was unprecedented as road, rail and air traffic came to a standstill for days together. However, the government assured there was no need to panic as authorities from the Public Works Department (PWD) will regulate the release of water and make periodic announcements about the amount of water being released. To instil confidence in people, Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami drove to the lake and conducted an inspection. In the morning, authorities released 1,000 cusecs of water, which was gradually increased to 5,000 cusecs at the time of going to press. Palaniswami also assured people there was no need to panic over the release of water from the lake, but asked people living in low-lying areas on the banks of Adyar River to move to safety.  Greater Chennai Corporation asked people living in the aforementioned areas to come to relief centres. The Public Works Department (PWD) said according to protocol excess water will be released once the water level reaches 22 feet as against the full reservoir level of 24 feet. Chief Secretary K Shanmugam said the level of water released from the lake will depend on the inflow. “If the inflow is less, there will be less outflow or no outflow,” he said. Drainage congestion, encroachments in lakes and river channels, and large releases from storage reservoirs like Chembarambakkam, besides heavy rainfall were some of the reasons cited by a Parliamentary Committee for the 2015 floods that left a permanent scar on the residents.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/memories-of-2015-floods-return-to-haunt-chennai-as-excess-water-from-chembarambakkam-released-919868.html
25-11-2020||South||Cyclone Nivar: Chennai floats as rains batter city; residents evacuated using boats||As torrential rains under the influence of powerful Cyclone Nivar pummelled the city for the second consecutive day without any respite, several residential areas and arterial roads in the southern metropolis went under the water, raising questions about the administration's preparedness. The city received an average rainfall of 16 cm in just 24 hours ending at 8.30 am on Wednesday, making it difficult for authorities to pump out water from roads and sub-ways. Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) said water-logging was reported from 58 places across the city and complaints of uprooting of trees were received from 52 localities. Due to the impact of the cyclone, tree branches fell on the road in several areas, while the Traffic Police closed down all major routes at 5 pm on Wednesday to avoid any damage. Traffic on the East Coast Road that connects Chennai with Puducherry and Nagapattinam was also closed for traffic. People living in some parts of Velachery, a residential area in south Chennai, were evacuated from their houses using rubber boats as water continued to rise in the locality owing to continuous rains. In Maduvankarai, water entered a few apartment buildings, while many roads witnessed knee-deep water. “The water in my area is knee-deep and we are staying indoors. It is scary as rains have not stopped since Wednesday morning. We are just hoping that there will be no repeat of 2015 floods,” Maheswaran, a resident of Velachery, told DH over the phone. North Chennai, a densely-populated area in the city, was worst-affected. Police and fire and rescue personnel fanned out across the city to clear trees that were uprooted or the branches that fell due to the wind. Over 1,200 persons, including children, were evacuated from their homes and were lodged at various relief centres in which health camps were also conducted due to Covid-19 scare. Complaints of water-logging and inundation were received from across the city and its suburbs, especially, those located in the neighbouring Chengalpattu district, due to their vulnerability to flooding. Villages like Mudichur, and Varadharajapuram were marooned due to rains and excess water being released from Chembarambakkam Lake, major water source for the city. In the heart of Chennai, roads and streets in posh and residential areas like Kalaignar Karunanidhi Nagar (K K Nagar), Ashok Nagar, Egmore, Ekkaduthangal, Jafferkhanpet, Nungambakkam, Kodambakkam were full of water, making it difficult for vehicles to pass through them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cyclone-nivar-chennai-floats-as-rains-batter-city-residents-evacuated-using-boats-919871.html
25-11-2020||South||Storage almost full, key Chennai reservoir opened ahead of cyclone Nivar landfall||The gates of Chembarambakkam reservoir were opened Wednesday for the first time in five years as a precautionary measure, releasing a torrent of surplus water into the Adyar river here after its storage was just 20 per cent short of its capacity due to heavy rainsahead of an incoming cyclone, officials said. About 1,000 cusecs (cubic feet per second) of water was released from the dam, a major source for the city's water requirements, into the river that flows through the metropolis before draining into the Bay of Bengal. The decision to open the shutters of sprawling dam was taken as its storage level touched 3,000 million cubic feet against its full capacity of 3,645 Mcft amid forecast of heavy rains in the next two days under the influence of the severe cyclone 'Nivar' set to cross the coast before dawn on Thursday. As the surplus waters gushed forth with the opening of shutters after about five years, Chief Minister K Palaniswami inspected the dam premises and reviewed the precautionary measures and the outflow. Palaniswami said he advised the officials to "carry out their work cautiously and without causing any inconvenience to the people." On the dam's water level, the Chief Minister told reporters that it has reached 21.5 feet as against its maximum of 24 feet. "The reservoir is receiving about 4,000 cusecs and from noon 1,000 cusecs is being released," he said adding surplus water of about 2,000 cusecs from Aadhanur lake in the suburbs was also being let into the Adyar River. "The Adyar River could carry up to 60,000 cusecs and people need not have any apprehensions. All precautions have been taken," he said and pointed out that approximately, only 6,000 cusecs now flowed in the river. The delayed opening of the reservoir in 2015 after very heavy rains was seen as a trigger for the devastating floods that hit the city then, though the government had rejected it. A flood control official of the Public Works Department said the water level was close to 22 feet as against the maximum of 24 feet. As per norms, inflows from now onwards should be released 'as it is' and it would be done in a phased manner, the official said. The storage has increased in view of inflows from the Krishna River coupled with the monsoon rains and the current inflow stood at 4,027 cusecs, he said in a communique. An alert, already sent by the PWD to local authorities said, "the outflow will be increased step by step based on the inflows." The Chembarambakkam reservoir, among the four very important drinking water sources to Chennai, is spread across 25.51 square kilometers and is located in Kancheepuram district's Kundrathur taluk. Poondi, Cholavaram and Red Hills are the other reservoirs. The Adyar River empties into the sea, traversing city localities like Kotturpuram and suburban neighbourhoods including Sirugalathur and Kundrathur. People, who gathered eagerly to witness the water release along the river bank were advised by the authorities to move away considering their safety while intermittent rains lashed the city and suburbs. The Greater Chennai Corporation said it has cleaned up the Adyar creek besides other canals and lakes like Mambalam and Velachery respectively. The GCC said it has already advised people living close to the river like those in Jafferkhanpet to move to its shelters adding "169 shelters are open and ready." For assistance, people may contact them at 044-25384530 and 044-25384540, the GCC said. Palaniswami said all precautionary measures have been taken in view of the cyclone and so far 400 people have been accommodated here in relief shelters here. Waterlogging has been reported from 30 low lying areas and GCC has deployed heavy-duty motor pumps to drain the rain water, he said. Also, electricity poles that were affected in city localities have been set right immediately by electricity corporation personnel, he said and appreciated government employees for their work. City police said 12 teams, led by sub-inspectors of Armed Reserve, with necessary equipment and boats have been deployed for relief work. Police appealed to the people to seek their assistance, if needed by contacting the temporary control room at 9498181239. As many as 38 uprooted trees were removed by them with the assistance of GCC and disaster relief workers, they said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/storage-almost-full-key-chennai-reservoir-opened-ahead-of-cyclone-nivar-landfall-919874.html

The Chandrayangutta MLA, known for his acerbic remarks over communal and other sensitive matters, said so while speaking at his party rally for the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation elections. The AIMIM accuses former PM Rao of connivance resulting in the Babri Masjid demolition in December 1992. The comments come at a time when the K Chandrasekhar Rao government is celebrating Narasimha Rao's birth centenary, and has demanded Bharat Ratna for the son of the soil. CM Rao also appealed to the Centre for installation of a statue of the former PM in Parliament. Akbaruddin was speaking in support of the people dwelling on encroached water bodies, drains etc areas in the old city, where his party has strong influence. “The government authorities target such poor people's homes stating rules, regulations. But what about the Hussain Sagar lake which was actually spread over 4,700 acres but has contracted to just 700 acres now? Necklace Road was built and samadhis of PV Narasimha Rao and NT Rama Rao came up in the lost space,” Akbaruddin said on Wednesday. The firebrand legislator, younger brother of Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi, added that the GHMC headquarters building was also constructed on the tank's bund. The MLA challenged the TRS government to demolish the mausoleums, which are on either side of the lake in the heart of the city, and are developed as public parks by the successive state governments. Both TRS and BJP objected to the statements seen as disrespectful towards the iconic leaders. “We strongly condemn Akbaruddin Owaisi's disdainful comments made on the two illustrious Telugu legends, who, as PM and CM, were dedicated in public service for a long time,” municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao said. Telangana BJP reacted strongly, saying that they will raze the AIMIM headquarters to the ground. “Owaisi says that the PV and NTR samadhis should be demolished. If you have such guts, do it. Within two hours, our BJP karyakartas will tear down your (party head office) Darussalam,” state BJP chief Bandi Sanjay said while alleging that the AIMIM leaders were reciting the script handed by the TRS.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/akbaruddin-owaisi-goads-trs-to-tear-down-pv-narasimha-rao-nt-rama-rao-memorials-919876.html
25-11-2020||South||With wind speed of up to 145 kmph, Cyclone Nivar on course to make landfall near Puducherry, Tamil Nadu||Powerful Cyclone Nivar packing winds with the speed of 120 to 130 kmph gushing up to 145 kmph, was on course to make landfall between Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts by early Thursday, as heavy rains continued to pound the city and other coastal districts of the state for the second straight day. Besides massive efforts by the governments of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, two warships – INS Sumitra and INS Jyoti – are on stand-by for assistance in the aftermath of the cyclone, while the Indian Army and the Indian Coast Guard also made elaborate arrangements to provide succour to the people after the landfall. Apart from state disaster response teams, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has pre-positioned 19 teams in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, while over 465 ambulances were kept ready in the state. With the landfall area likely to be around Puducherry, focus is now on the UT and Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, which is prone to cyclones. Over 1 lakh people living in low-lying areas and places vulnerable to flooding were evacuated and lodged in 1,455 relief centres across Tamil Nadu, while 2,000 were moved to such camps in neighbouring Puducherry. Road traffic between Tamil Nadu and Puducherry also came to a halt. The city of Chennai looked like a ghost town on Wednesday as major roads witnessed heavy water-logging due to torrential rains that began early Tuesday. As the city was on the edge, Chennai Traffic Police closed down all major roads in the city and asked people to remain indoors. The Chennai International Airport also suspended its operation for 12 hours – from 7 pm on Wednesday to 7 am on Thursday, while Southern Railway cancelled close to 30 trains. Tamil Nadu government extended the public holiday to Thursday in 16 districts as it kept ready equipment and personnel to clear the roads as the cyclone is expected to uproot trees. Cyclone Nivar also increased its speed from 7 kmph at 5:30 am to 16 kmph at 5:30 pm and intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm Wednesday evening, with the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting the landfall to be around Puducherry. However, independent weather bloggers and weather portals said the cyclone will cross between Mamallapuram and Kalpakkam, which houses an atomic power station. Authorities at the Madras Atomic Power Station (MAPS) said they were prepared for any eventuality. “The cyclone will begin its landfall on Wednesday night. It would take more than two hours for Cyclone Nivar to complete its landfall. It will cross the Tamil Nadu-Puducherry coast as a very severe cyclone,” he told Deccan Herald. As per IMD bulletin released at 5 pm, the cyclone was moving at a speed of 16 km per hour and will pack winds with the speed of 120 to 130 km per hour gushing up to 145 km per hour. Commissioner of Revenue Administration K Phanindra Reddy told DH that 1.21 lakh people across the state have been lodged in 1,455 relief centres. “We have kept 4,733 relief centres ready across the state that can house nearly 13 lakh people. We are prepared to tackle the cyclone and at this moment we also want people to stay indoors,” he said. Officials said physical distancing is being maintained at all relief centres while Covid-19 testing will be done for people who display symptoms. With power supply likely to be snapped during the landfall time, the government asked hospitals to ensure that their generators are in working condition and that they have enough fuel in reserve. Tamil Nadu government has kept 465 ambulances ready in the seven districts, while setting up control rooms set up in all 36 revenue districts. Health Minister C Vijayabaskar and Health Secretary J Radhakrishnan visited the government hospital in Mamallapuram, one of the areas to be affected, and checked the preparedness. The IMD also forecast heavy to very heavy rains for the next two days in Chennai, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, and Chengalpattu districts and warned of flooding, disruption of electricity and water services, possible damage to roads, and some areas getting inundated. Rains will continue across coastal Tamil Nadu. Public transport remains suspended in Pudukkottai, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Cuddalore, Villupuram, and Chengalpattu districts, and in Puducherry, and Karaikal till further orders, while sub-urban trains in Chennai will not run beyond 10 am on Wednesday. Chennai and other coastal districts continued to receive heavy to heavy rains since Tuesday morning submerging many low-lying areas across the metropolis. The city's average rainfall in the last 24 hours ending at 8.30 am on Wednesday was 16 cm, the IMD said, adding this was the highest in the state. Intensity of the rain in Chennai was only increasing every hour with the majority of the areas getting drenched since Tuesday. The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) said it was prepared to face any eventuality and has set up 169 relief centres across the city to house people who are being evacuated from low-lying areas. Release of water from the lake caused much fear among people as it is widely believed that discharge of excess water from Chembarambakkam Lake at “one go” led to unprecedented floods in Chennai in the first week of December 2015. However, authorities asked people not to panic. Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami visited Chembarambakkam Lake to take stock of the situation, while Leader of Opposition M K Stalin too hit the streets by visiting flood-affected areas in his constituency, Kolathur in Chennai, and other areas of the city. The Public Works Department (PWD) said according to protocol excess water will be released once the water level reaches 22 feet as against the full reservoir level of 24 feet. With the cyclone likely to make landfall around Puducherry, Chief Minister V Narayanasamy held a review meeting on Monday night and asked all departments to open control rooms to attend to complaints from people relating to the cyclone. Elaborate precautionary measures have been taken in Karaikal, an enclave attached to the UT which is around 150 km from Puducherry, as well with one team of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) pre-positioning in the district. Two NDRF teams are in Puducherry, while six have been deployed in neighbouring Cuddalore district in Tamil Nadu, just 20 km away. With the cyclone likely to uproot trees, the Public Works Department (PWD) has pruned tree branches and has kept ready the machinery needed to remove trees if they are uprooted during the landfall. “Elaborate precautionary measures have been taken in the Union Territory because Cyclone Nivar is likely to make its landfall here. Imposition of Section 144 will help us control people from stepping out. Our aim is to minimise damage due to the cyclone as much as possible,” Narayanasamy told DH.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/with-wind-speed-of-up-to-145-kmph-cyclone-nivar-on-course-to-make-landfall-near-puducherry-tamil-nadu-919884.html
25-11-2020||South||Kerala CM's staff hospitalised soon after ED summoning for second time||A personal staff member of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was hosptialised citing post-COVID ailments, incidentally after ED summoned him for the second time. The opposition parties had earlier raised doubts even over the Covid infection of the CM's additional private secretary C M Raveendran just ahead of the ED summoning him earlier this month. However, sources in the Chief Minister's office said that he was having genuine post-Covid ailments and there were no deliberate attempts to evade appearing before ED. The Chief Minister's former principal secretary M Sivasankar earlier faced allegations of trying to delay arrest by getting hosptialised. Raveendran was initially summoned by the ED earlier this month. But he was tested Covid positive. Afterwards the ED summoned him again and asked to present on Friday. But he was admitted to the Thiruvananthapuram medical college hospital on Wednesday citing post-Covid ailments. Raveendran has been a close confident of Vijayan as well as to other CPM leaders over the last many years, and the opposition Congress and BJP have been alleging the ED summons to Raveendran was causing anxious moments to the CM and the CPM leaders. He was learnt to be summoned by ED to seek details regarding various major projects of the government that were directly handled by the CM. Meanwhile, an additional chief judicial magistrate court for economic offences in Kochi on Wednesday allowed customs to quiz Sivasankar, who is arraigned as 23rd accused, for five days. The court pointed out that from the affidavit filed by customs, it was not clear why the accused allegedly sought Sivasankar's help for clearing the diplomatic baggage containing smuggled gold. The court also asked why the customs did not mentions the official position held by Sivasankar in the affidavit and expressed dissatisfaction over these. Sivasankar who initially arrested by the ED, was arrested by the Customs also on Tuesday citing that he was directly involved in the gold smuggling involving former employees of UAE consulate in Kerala.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-cms-staff-hospitalised-soon-after-ed-summoning-for-second-time-919890.html
25-11-2020||South||Court grants Customs 5 day custody of Sivasankar in gold smuggling case||A local court on Wednesday granted Customs five days custody of suspended IAS officer M Sivasankar, arrested by it in connection with the gold smuggling case. The Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (Economic Offences), Ernakulam, granted Customs (Preventive) Commissionerate five day custody, considering its argument on his alleged role in smuggling through diplomatic channel. In a related development, the court granted Customs five day custody of two key accused, Swapna Suresh and P S Sarith, arrested by it for allegedly assisting a former employee of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram for smuggling USD 1,90,000 to Muscat from the capital city. In its order, the court observed that forensic evidence collected after retrieving data from Sivasankar's mobile phone led the Investigating Officer to conclude he was involved in the smuggling operation by way of abetting the mastermind. It noted that after retrieving deleted Whatsapp chats and other history, his previous statements were cross-checked and the IO concluded that Swapna Suresh purposefully gave the statement to exonerate Sivasankar for reasons known to her. "In this context,the Investigating Officer has justifiable reason to arraign Sivasankar as accused" the court said. It observed that the alleged offence was serious in nature since the smuggling of huge quantities of gold through diplomatic channel was unprecedented. "The intensive probe is required to find out all stakeholders of the deal. Admittedly,at the time of alleged commission of offence,M Sivasankar was admittedly holding the post of Principal Secretary", the court said and observed that the mode of abetment and quid pro quo of smuggle-deal has to be probed. It observed that an effective interrogation on all aspects relating to his previous statements and that of other accused in the backdrop of the retrieved mobile data was extremely essential for the successful progress of future investigation. The court pulled up Customs for the absence of fundamental elements from the application,seeking his custody. It noted that the personal or professional details of the accused other than his residential address were not disclosed in the application for remand and affidavit. The court said it is not discernible from the primary records why accomplices like Swapna Suresh and Sarith chose Sivasankar for using his influence to clear the smuggled gold. "Nothing is stated in the affidavit to the effect that under what capacity Sivasankar could successfully abet the commission of smuggling through diplomatic channel," it said. In its remand report filed on Tuesday, Customs had claimed that Swapna Suresh has revealed that Sivasankar was in the know and has also abetted the smuggling activities. The Customs said Suresh made the claim during her interrogation at the Attakkulangara Vanitha jail in Thiruvananthapuram on November 18. Sivasankar was formally arrested by the customs on Tuesday at a jail where he is currently lodged. Earlier, a special court for PMLA cases had granted the Customs permission to arrest Sivasankar. He was sent to judicial custody last week following his custodial interrogation by the Enforcement Directorate probing the money trail in the gold smuggling case. Granting Customs five day custody of Suresh and Sarith in the dollar smuggling case, the court said it is essential to extend the probe to another country with which India has diplomatic relationship. It noted that the source of Indian currency, the modus- operandi of its accumulation and its conversion to US Dollars are under probe for the successful progress of investigation. "It is highly essential to find out the other key person involved in the deal", the court said in the order. Earlier, the Customs (Preventive) Commissionerate, which is probing the Kerala gold smuggling case, claimed that ex- finance head of UAE consulate, Thiruvananthapuram, Khaled Mohamed Ali Shoukri, had taken out USD 1,90,000 (equivalent to Rs 1.30 crore) concealed in his handbag. Shoukri, an Egyptian national, was accompanied by Suresh and Sarith till Oman during his travel from Thiruvananthapuram international airport by Oman Airways on August 7, 2019. The Customs said the issue came to light during the course of investigation in the case of seizure of 30 kg gold through Air Cargo Complex, Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. Suresh,in her voluntary statement given under Section 108 of the Customs Act, 1962, stated and admitted she and Sarith had accompanied Shoukri from Thiruvananthapuram to Muscat on August 7, 2019, the agency said in its report.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/court-grants-customs-5-day-custody-of-sivasankar-in-gold-smuggling-case-919901.html
25-11-2020||South||Kerala Governor signs ordinance repealing controversial amendment to Police Act||Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan on Wednesday signed the ordinance repealing the controversial amendment of the Kerala Police Act, which had triggered a political storm with concerns being raised over its possible misuse. The CPI(M)-led Left government had on Tuesday said it would bring in an ordinance to withdraw the amendment. "The Governor has signed the ordinance, withdrawing the amendment," Raj Bhavan sources told PTI. A special cabinet meeting on Tuesday had decided to recommend to Governor Arif Mohammed Khan to promulgate an ordinance to repeal Section 118-A. Khan had on Saturday signed the Kerala Police Act Amendment ordinance brought in by the Left front government, envisaging addition of Section 118-A to prevent cyber attacks against women and children. A political outcry had erupted across the country over the amendment, providing for upto five years jail term to those making defamatory social media posts, with opposition parties and even Left sympathisers saying it was against the freedom ofspeech and media. On Monday, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury told reporters in Delhi that it would be reconsidered, after which the LDF government decided to put it on hold, saying further action would be taken after discussions in the Assembly. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the government decided to withdraw it as many have opined that the amendment would give too much authority to police and there were chances of the Act being misused. Vijayan had said on Tuesday that the amendment would be withdrawn and a new law passed only after detailed discussions in the Assembly and duly considering the opinions from all quarters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-governor-signs-ordinance-repealing-controversial-amendment-to-police-act-919935.html

Days ahead of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation elections scheduled on 1 December, the CM held a high-level review meeting on the law and order situation in the state with senior officials and top cops. “During the GHMC polls, certain leaders are trying to get political mileage through several conspiracies. They are stooping low to create communal clashes in Hyderabad and get political mileage from it. They want to create communal clashes in Karimnagar, Warangal, Khammam and other places and campaign about such incidents in Hyderabad,” Rao said in the meeting on Wednesday. The CM's statements come amidst an intense campaigning for the civic polls by the TRS and BJP and some sensational remarks made by the BJP and AIMIM leaders. On Tuesday, Telangana BJP chief Bandi Sanjay said that they would launch surgical strikes in the old city to drive out the Rohingya and illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and Pakistan when elected to the GHMC mayor position. On Wednesday, AIMIM legislator Akbaruddin Owaisi goaded the TRS government to raze the memorials of PV Narasimha Rao and NT Rama Rao in Hyderabad. “Out of deep despair, they want to create communal issues in Hyderabad, by fomenting trouble at places of worship. By whipping up such communal passions, they want to create disturbances so that the GHMC polls are suspended. The government has definite information about this plan,” the CM said, according to a CMO press statement. The CM said that the police are given a free hand to deal sternly with “anti-social, anarchic forces” trying to disturb the city's tranquility. “Do not spare even if they belong to the ruling party,” the CM instructed the cops. Rao said that because of his government adopting a non-compromising stand on anti-social elements to maintain peace, prosperity, people are living happily in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/some-leaders-conspiring-to-create-communal-tensions-in-hyderabad-says-cm-rao-days-ahead-of-ghmc-polls-919957.html

Determined to avoid a repeat of the 2015 scenario when scores of four-wheelers were filled with flood waters, several residents of Madipakkam in the southern part of the city left their vehicles on the margins of the bridge overlooking the Mass Rapid Transit System railway station in nearby Velacherry. With the owners one after the other parking their vehicles, the bridge was lined up with swanky cars on both sides of the overpass presenting a never before seen spectacle, civic workers said. In 2015, several cars parked in the city localities like Madipakkam and Kotturpuram were either partially or wholly submerged which depreciated their value to a great extent besides affecting the performance of such vehicles. The Greater Chennai Corporation, meanwhile said nil water stagnation has been ensured in all the 22 subways in the city and water logging in low lying areas being drained swiftly by using heavy duty motors and in about 52 locations, uprooted trees were removed quickly. Over 1,200 people living in low-lying areas in addition to the homeless have all been accommodated in safe shelters, the GCC said. The city and suburbs were lashed by heavy intermittent rains through the day. The severe cyclonic storm Nivar over southwest Bay of Bengal moved west northwards, intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm, lay about 160 km off Chennai and likely to cross the coast before dawn on Thursday, the India Meteorological Department said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cyclone-nivar-once-bitten-twice-shy-wary-chennai-residents-park-cars-on-flyover-919958.html

The company would produce home appliances like refrigerators, washing machines, air-conditioners, heaters, mixers, grinders, iron boxes, ovens and electronic goods like mobile phones, computers, laptops, printers, personal care devices, cameras and televisions in the cluster of industries. Speaking to DH, Shettar said this would be the first fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) production cluster in the country. Shettar said, through this cluster, North Karnataka would witness a Rs 25,000-crore business. Some more companies were eager to set up units in the region. There was enough land in the district for the establishment of industries. Local people would get jobs if more industries came here, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/aequs-to-invest-rs-3540-crore-for-home-appliances-cluster-in-karnatakas-dharwad-919893.html

Speaking after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s video conference on Tuesday with the Chief Minister to chalk out the vaccination strategy, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said the government is planning to replicate arrangements made during elections to administer the vaccine to the population. “Prime Minister Modi has said that arrangements for vaccination centres must be similar to preparations at the booth level for elections. These centres should be formed and workers should be trained for the exercise,” Bommai said. Besides the state-level steering committee, district and taluk-level steering committees will also monitor vaccination drives at the local level. A digital platform will be developed to collate inoculation data, as people who are vaccinated might require two or three doses to achieve resistance to the Covid-19 virus, the minister informed. The vaccine will be distributed on priority to 30 crore people in the country, which will include one crore health workers, two crore corona warriors, 26 crore citizens aged above 50 and the remaining for those with comorbidities, Bommai pointed out.  As many as 50 vaccines are undergoing clinical research throughout the world. Of them, some 25 vaccines are in an advanced trial stage and five are undergoing trials in India. Companies such as Bharat Biotech, Dr Reddy’s Lab, PharmaGenica are ready to manufacture different vaccine candidates when they are cleared by regulatory bodies, Bommai said. Since the exact date for vaccination is still unclear, people should be wary of the disease as the battle against Covid-19 will continue, he added. Meanwhile, Health Minister K Sudhakar said the government has identified 29,451 vaccination sites and 10,008 vaccinators in keeping with the Universal Immunisation Programme norms. Karnataka has around 2,855 cold chain points for vaccine storage and distribution, Sudhakar said. “Three new regional vaccine stores — Bengaluru Urban, Shivamogga and Ballari — have been proposed. These newly proposed stores will require additional walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers,” he said, adding that the state already had 10 walk-in coolers and four walk-in freezers. “The Centre will supply three walk-in coolers and two walk-in freezers for which necessary civil works are being initiated,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-cm-b-s-yediyurappa-led-panel-to-monitor-covid-vaccination-process-in-state-919597.html

25-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Will cooperate with CBI probe in DA case: D K Shivakumar||Ahead of appearing before the CBI in connection with a disproportionate assets (DA) case on Wednesday, Congress Karnataka unit president D K Shivakumar said he will cooperate with the officials of the country's premier investigating agency. The Kanakapura MLA told his supporters that there was no need to worry and he has done nothing that will bring a bad name to them. "On the day of my daughter's engagement, CBI had come to issue me summons, as we were not available, so they waited and served it to me asking to appear on November 23, but as I had a pre-scheduled tour to Maski (where assembly bypoll is likely soon), I had requested for November 25," Shivakumar said. Speaking to reporters here, he said he had planned to go and pay last respects to veteran Congress leader Ahmed Patel, but had to appear before the CBI, and would travel immediately after that. "...as I had told them (CBI) that I will appear, it will not be right to skip.I have always cooperated with officials, even with ED and Income Tax. Now I will also cooperate with CBI," he said, as he requested his supporters not to come to the CBI office when he appears. On November 19, Shivakumars daughter Aishwarya had got engaged to senior BJP leader S M Krishnas grandson and late Cafe Coffee Day founder V G Siddharthas son Amartya. Responding to a question about CBI summons to him despite his claims of having shared all information to officials, Shivakumar said he will not question the agency's style of functioning. The officials have not troubled him during raids and have only done their duty,the congress leader said. "They (CBI) have a manual, they will go by it. I have gone through the manual...what will officials do? they go by the instructions given to them," he said, adding that he was ready to cooperate with the CBI in every way. To a question about recent claims of political vendetta against him, Shivakumar wanted to know against which politician in the state permission was granted to the CBI to investigate in a disproportionate assets case. ".....have I taken bribe or indulged in any misuse during my tenure as Minister? What was the need to give to CBI (probe).. Yediyurappa (CM) could have got it investigated," he said. The Advocate General too had advised the government it was not a case to be given to CBI for inquiry, and the state's Anti-Corruption Bureau could investigate, but there was pressure, he claimed. The CBI on October 5 had conducted searches at 14 locations, including in Karnataka, Delhi and Mumbai at the premises linked to Shivakumar and others. The investigating agency had said the searches have led to recovery of Rs 57 lakh cash and several documents, including property documents, bank related information, computer hard disk etc, and that the investigation is continuing. The CBI had also registered a case against Shivakumar and his family members on the allegations of possession of disproportionate assets worth Rs 74.93 crore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/will-cooperate-with-cbi-probe-in-da-case-d-k-shivakumar-919773.html

25-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Will get to know about Karnataka cabinet expansion or reshuffle in 2-3 days: CM B S Yediyurappa||With several ministerial aspirants continuing their efforts to secure berths in the much awaited cabinet expansion/reshuffle, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Wednesday said he was awaiting a communication from the BJP high command in two or three days to carry out the exercise. "We will get to know in 2-3 days," he told reporters in Mysuru in response to a question on the matter. Yediyurappa had met BJP national president J P Nadda in New Delhi last week to discuss expansion or reshuffle of his cabinet, but was asked to wait for clearance from the central leadership to go ahead with the process. Following this, BJP National General Secretary (Organisation) B L Santosh on Monday had met the Chief Minister, and both leaders reportedly held discussions on it. Soon after BJP's victory in the November 10 bypolls to two assembly constituencies, the CM had hinted at a cabinet reshuffle by dropping or inducting some ministers, in consultation with the high command. One of the ministerial aspirants, BJP MLC C P Yogeshwar, met Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi at the latter's residence today and held discussions. Jarkiholi, who recently met BJP central leaders, told reporters he will bat for Yogeshwar to be made the Minister "till the last moment", though he was advised by some in BJP not to back one who lost the election for the ministership. Yogeshwar, who lost the 2018 assembly polls, reportedly played a key role in managing Congress-JD(S) rebel MLAs of which Jarkiholi was a part, during their stay in Mumbai ahead of the collapse of the coalition government in 2019. Recently, several BJP MLAs, including the CM's political secretary M P Renukacharya had met Jarkiholi and requested him not to lobby for Yogeshwar as he was not elected by people directly and his induction would scuttle their chances. Renukacharya, an MLA from Honnali, highlighted the importance of those elected directly by voters in a democracy and said none can accept the claims that the party has come to power because of someone. "....if about 105 of us had not got elected in the 2018 assembly polls, the party could not have come to power. People have to understand this," he said. In a veiled attack on those claiming that the sacrifice of 17 Congress-JD(S) rebels, whose resignation and subsequent disqualification had led BJP to come to power, he said it has grown into a strong organisation due to its leaders' contributions and it was not right to give that credit to someone else. Most of these legislators who subsequently joined BJP and contested and won tby-polls on it's ticket, are now Ministers. The cabinet expansion or reshuffle is expected to be a tightrope walk for Yediyurappa, considering that there are too many aspirants. While several of the old guard like Katti are awaiting a chance to be inducted into the Ministry, Congress-JD(S) rebels like A H Vishwanath,R Shankar and M T B Nagaraj, who helped BJP to come to power and are now party MLCs, are also aspiring for slots. As per the agreement, Yediyurappa will also have to keep space for Munirathna, following his win from Rajarajeshwari Nagar seat in the November 3 bypoll and also for Pratap Gowda Patil who needs to win the Maski bypoll that is yet to be announced. The cabinet currently has 27 members and seven berths are still vacant.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/will-get-to-know-about-karnataka-cabinet-expansion-or-reshuffle-in-2-3-days-cm-b-s-yediyurappa-919955.html

Rupani in a tweet said he was saddened by the demise of the senior Congress leader. "His role in strengthening the Congress party and his social work will always be remembered.

"His absence will be profoundly felt. My heartfelt condolences to his family, friends and party workers. May his Soul Rest in peace," he tweeted.

He was in Karad in Satara district after paying tributes to former Deputy Prime Minister Yashwantrao Chavan on the latter’s 36th death anniversary on Wednesday. Pawar, who is also the state’s Finance and Planning Minister, said while the concept behind GST is “one nation, one tax”, the pending amount from the Centre is a matter of concern. He also said that so far the Centre has not sent teams for assessment in wake of recent floods in Western Maharashtra and Marathwada. According to him, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Relief and Rehabilitation Minister Vijay Wadettiwar and Chief Secretary Sanjay Kumar had sent letters to the Centre. “However, so far teams have not come,” he said adding that during Tuesday’s weekly Cabinet meeting the issue was discussed. “The Chief Secretary has been asked to send letters to the NDRF,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/rs-29000-crore-gst-dues-pending-from-centre-ajit-pawar-919724.html
25-11-2020||West||Covid-19 survives on surfaces within thin films, according to researchers at IIT Bombay||The Covid-19 virus survives on surfaces by clinging to thin liquid films, according to a study by researchers at IIT Bombay which provides insights into how the novel coronavirus sustains for hours or days on solid surfaces under ambient conditions. The study, published in the journal Physics of Fluids, attributes the long survival time of the novel coronavirus on a surface to the slow evaporation of a thin nanometre liquid film remaining after the evaporation of the bulk droplet. The ability to predict the survival of the novel coronavirus on different surfaces can help prevent and contain the spread of Covid-19, the researchers said. While the typical respiratory droplets dry within seconds, the survival time of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on different surfaces within recent experiments has been found to be on the order of hours, they said. This discrepancy suggests an order of magnitude difference in the time between droplet drying and the survival time of the Covid-19 virus on surfaces, according to the researchers. The researchers described how a nanometres-thick liquid film clings to the surface, due to London-van der Waals forces, which allows the Covid-19 virus to survive for hours. Van der Waals forces include attraction and repulsions between atoms, molecules, and surfaces, as well as other intermolecular forces. "Our model for the thin film transport shows that survival or drying time of a thin liquid film on a surface is on the order of hours and days, similar to what has been observed in measurements of the virus titer," said Amit Agrawal, professor at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. "It captures the relatively longer survival time on plastic and glass compared to metals," Agrawal said. A titer is the lowest concentration of virus that still infects cells. The nanometric film is assumed to be like a pancake deposited onto a surface. The researchers briefly examined changes in drying time as a function of contact angle and surface type. "Our biggest surprise was that the drying time of this nanometric film is on the order of hours," said Rajneesh Bhardwaj, a professor at IIT Bombay. "It suggests the surface isn't completely dry, and the slowly evaporating nanometric film is providing the medium required for the survival of the coronavirus," Bhardwaj said. Since a longer survival time of the virus corresponds to increased chances of being infected, the researchers said it is desirable to disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as door handles or hand-held devices, and within hospitals and other areas prone to outbreaks. "We also recommend heating surfaces, because even short duration high temperatures, at which the surface is at a higher temperature than the ambient, can help evaporate the nanometric film and destroy the virus," Bhardwaj added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/covid-19-survives-on-surfaces-within-thin-films-according-to-researchers-at-iit-bombay-919732.html
25-11-2020||West||Centre has not sent assessment team for Maharashtra floods, said Ajit Pawar||Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Wednesday said despite sending multiple correspondences to the central government, no team from there has arrived in the state to assess losses caused due to floods following heavy rains in the past few months. The Centre should provide help to the states during natural calamities without thinking about party and ideology, Pawar told reporters after paying tributes to Maharashtra's first CM Yashwantrao Chavan on his death anniversary at Pritisangam at Karad in Satara district. "When the state faced floods caused due to heavy rains, the chief minister, rehabilitation minister and chief secretary wrote to the Centre. However, till date, no team from the Centre has come (to assess losses)," he said. Pawar said during the previous (Congress-led) Manmohan Singh government, if such a calamity happened, a team used to come immediately to inspect the losses and then package was announced. "Today, after so many days, the central team has not turned up...states should get help from the Centre, considering that all the states are part of India," he said. Pawar said if there is any natural calamity, the Centre should not differentiate on the basis of a party or ideology, "but it is not happening". "The issue was once again raised during the state cabinet meeting and the chief secretary has been asked to follow up on the same," he added. Pawar also said the state was yet to get a GST compensation worth Rs 29,000 crore from the Centre. When asked about the opposition BJP making statements that the state's Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, may fall soon, Pawar said such "carrots" are usually shown to keep the party workers and leaders intact. The MVA was formed by (NCP president) Sharad Pawar, (Shiv Sena chief) Uddhav Thackeray and (Congress head) Sonia Gandhi and till they are standing strong behind the alliance, nothing will happen to this alliance, he asserted. "The real pain of the opposition party is that despite having 105 MLAs, they have not got the opportunity to work in the government and that is why such statements are being made," he added. Notably, senior BJP leader and Union minister Raosaheb Danve on Monday said his party will form a government in Maharashtra in the next two to thee months for which it has made preparations. Asked about the issue of outstanding power bills in the state, Pawar said currently electricity bills worth Rs 60,000 crore are outstanding. "Due to some decisions taken by the previous BJP government, the MSEDCL plunged into crisis," he alleged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/centre-has-not-sent-assessment-team-for-maharashtra-floods-said-ajit-pawar-919739.html

The team was headed By Dr Tanveer Abdul Majeed, a surgical oncologist. The patient, a resident of Khed in Chiplun, who was diabetic and obese, encountered swelling in the left leg since 2012 and that made his life miserable. He initially neglected and did not consult a local doctor, but when the swelling began to grow in size and cause discomfort, he consulted a local doctor who advised him to get evaluated but he deferred the evaluation due to Covid-19. Things turned awry when he developed dull aching pain and redness over the swelling causing noticeable difficulties in his day to day activities and needed assistance for even his routine activities. “On admission, he complained of discomfort, swelling in the thigh, and pain which was aggravated due to movement. He weighed about 81 kgs and had undergone preoperative biopsy suggestive of Atypical Lipoma, the cause of which is unknown. On examination, there was a huge mass occupying the whole of the front and lateral aspect of left thigh occupying the whole thigh from the hip to the knee joint with dilated veins over it, however, redness and warmth were more pronounced over the lower end swelling just above the knee joint,” said Dr Majeed. The patient said: “My life was disrupted once there was swelling in the left leg and it kept on increasing. I couldn’t perform day-to-day activities such as walking or even sitting. I was hoping for some miracle to happen and happy that the hospital came to my rescue. I thank the doctors for helping me get back on track.” He said that after the tumour extraction, the swelling has disappeared and I am able to wear a trouser of my actual size now. “Earlier, the left side of my trouser was bigger than the right one. I urge people not to ignore any changes occurring in the body and seek immediate medical attention,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/four-kg-tumour-removed-from-a-64-year-old-mans-leg-in-mumbai-919777.html
