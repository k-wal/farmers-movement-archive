29-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Hunsur MLA, Mysuru DC in bitter war of words||The criticism of Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, by Hunsur MLA H P Manjunath during the KDP meeting on November 24, is snowballing into a serious political issue, over the past few days. Now, Manjunath, who is engaged in a bitter war of words with the DC, has found allies in MLC Raghu Achar of the Congress and MLA S R Mahesh of the JD(S). While MLA Manjunath described the DC as a ‘maharani’ and ‘dictator’, the MLC doubted if she has cleared the UPSC exam, as she has no understanding of the protocol. Mahesh challenged the DC to contest elections. He also said that he will move a privilege motion in the Assembly. Manjunath, during the KDP meeting, had said: “We need a DC who can respond to the grievances to the people rather than a one who acts like a Maharani. She is not responding to my letters, probably because I belong to the Congress. She is not showing the minimum courtesy due to an MLA.” in the KDP meeting. Sindhuri in a letter to Manjunath said: “The statement of the MLA in the KDP (meet) was far from the truth. He should verify the facts before speaking in future. I have not received any letter regarding the development of Hunsur constituency. Only a few applications for land conversion at Kergalli are pending. It will be processed asper law.” MLA mulls legal action Meanwhile, Manjunath on Friday, in a press meet defended his comment at the KDP meeting saying, “I commented in the KDP meeting, in my capacity as a representative of the people. She should have answered to it there itself or in the next meeting. But, she has written a letter, which I have not received yet. However, it is circulated on social media. She is acting like a ‘dictator’. I will consult legal experts. The DC is trying to blackmail me, by mentioning my personal land documents, in the letter,” he charged. The Hunsur MLA further said, “The DC might have the support of two chief ministers, of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. I wonder if the CMs are supporting her or if the DC controls them.” MLC Raghu Achar, who accompanied Manjunath in the media conference, said, he has a doubt if Rohini Sindhuri has cleared the UPSC examination. “She has defamed the MLA by releasing the letter on social media. She should apologise within two days. Otherwise, I will raise the issue in the Council on December 7,” he said. Protocol MLA Mahesh said, “Mysureans are a self-respecting populace and we will not tolerate insult. If the DC holds meetings without the presence of the MLAs concerned, she will have to face the consequences. She is not following protocols during meetings.” Meanwhile, District Minister S T Somashekar said that he would resolve the issue between the DC and the legislators.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/hunsur-mla-mysuru-dc-in-bitter-war-of-words-921146.html

The DyCM was addressing the gathering during the ‘Gram Swaraj’ convention on BC Road in Bantwal. He urged the BJP workers to strive for the victory of BJP-supported candidates in the GP elections. State BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel said that the Congress had ignored its partry workers and had cheated people in the name of Gandhi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is taking up many initiatives to realize the dream of ‘Rama Rajya’. The Centre has introduced many pro-people programmes for the benefit of the people. The government will come out with a separate sand policy for Coastal Karnataka, he said and added that the government is working towards drug-free campuses. MP Shobha Karandlaje said the Congress had no achievements to its credit worth mentioning, when compared to the contributions of PM Narendra Modi and former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. District In-charge Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary said that the BJP aims to win at least 90% of the Gram Panchayats in DK.

29-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||Bid to replace BSY part of BJP’s plan for Gen Y leaders||While the Karnataka unit of BJP has now ruled out plans for leadership change in the state, the pattern reflects the BJP setting up the stage for Gen-Y to take leadership in many states since Narendra Modi came to power in 2014. The BJP has had young new leaders as chief ministers in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and changed leaderships in states including Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan since 2014. Biplab Kumar Deb, at the age of 47, became the youngest BJP CM in Tripura in 2018 while 55-year-old Sarbananda Sonowal scripted the party’s victory in Assam in 2016. In Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis was made a chief minister in 2014, ignoring many seniors. In Karnataka, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, who brought the BJP to power in the state way back in 2008, is still the party’s tallest leader. The BJP may find it tough to find a formidable replacement or to ignore his popularity among the dominant Lingayats. However, given the trend of BJP politics since 2014, a change of guard in Karnataka seems just a matter of time. The BJP has nurtured the third generation of leaders in many states recently, some of them with RSS affiliation while taking caste and community affiliations in mind. Yogi Adityanath (45 then), an aggressive Hindutva face, was the surprise choice for the chief minister in Uttar Pradesh in 2017. Before his name was announced, the guessing game was going on around the names of veterans Rajnath Singh, Uma Bharti and Manoj Sinha. In Bihar, sidelining former Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumari Modi and former BJP Minister Nandkishore Yadav, the two leaders who represented the BJP for the last two decades, the party named two relatively politically lightweight leaders as deputy chief ministers. After the 2017 Assembly polls in Himachal Pradesh, the BJP named Jairam Thakur as chief minister, ignoring veteran Prem Kumar Dhumal from the same community, who was declared the CM candidate before the polls. In Uttarakhand, the BJP chose 53-year-old Trivendra Singh Rawat, a long-term RSS activist but a relatively unknown face then to lead the government, ignoring the claims of three former chief ministers, veteran B C Khanduri (83), Bhagat Singh Koshiyari and Ramesh Pokhariyal Nishank. In Gujarat, Anandiben Patel was made the chief minister but when it appeared that the party was tottering, immediately after the 2017 state polls, she was asked to take a backseat. The BJP chose a low-profile Vijay Rupani (then 61), who was the choice of Amit Shah. Post the 2018 Assembly poll defeat, the BJP is up to create a new leadership in Rajasthan. Former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje’s detractors have been promoted. In Chhattisgarh, three-term CM Raman Singh is on the margins after the poll loss, while the party is building a new leadership.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/bid-to-replace-bsy-part-of-bjp-s-plan-for-gen-y-leaders-921371.html

Singh emphasised that renewable energy (RE) is a must not only for the Island States but also for the world. The minister was speaking at the Country session of Maldives during the third Global Re-Invest, a statement by the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy said. "This realisation has dawned on everybody that we need to reduce our carbon footprints to preserve the planet," he added. He echoed the sentiments that Island States/territories are more vulnerable to global warming. "India has also prioritised to have its Islands fully on green energy Islands. We have given a target to our Islands (Andaman & Nicobar Isalands, Lakshadweep) to become totally green, that means their energy needs should be met from Renewable Energy." Singh also reiterated India as one of very few countries to have met its commitment of keeping climate change within 2 per cent. He also said that India has installed about 136000mw of RE capacity with capacity addition of another 57000mw under implementation. Singh also informed that India has a robust energy efficiency programme under which more than 11 million LED street lights have been installed, adding, “you will have to work very hard to find a bulb which is not LED.” He also said reducing CO2 emission with the addition of more green energy resources high on priorities. He also said that Maldives being a beautiful country need to maintain and enhance its beauty as an attractive tourist destination. He, therefore said, it is absolutely essential that renewable energy is given centrality in Maldives. Speaking about large RE capacity addition through open bids and open competition Indian RE sector, Singh said, "We have not had to invest, adding that the investments have come from across the world. "We have a set up", he added, a mechanism to resolve issues, removing hurdles in project execution through a group in renewable energy ministry, payment security, separate/neutral body to decide if there are contract disputes. All that has helped, he said. The Minister further said that for us the environment is an article of faith. "Therefore we are taking steps to reduce our carbon Footprints,” he added. Singh said that India's target is now to achieve 450GW RE capacity by 2030. While speaking at the event , Minister Hussain Rasheed Hassan (ME), Government of Maldives, emphasised on their need to reduce oil import dependence. He recognised the importance of Renewable Energy for his Island country which faces a major threat in terms of adverse climate changes. He also elaborated the investor-friendly measures/policies taken to promote RE. Since 2013, the Government of Maldives has been proactively pursuing renewable energy goals that support strengthening the ecology, as well as the economy. Starting with the Maldives Energy Policy and Strategy 2016 that seeks to promote renewable energy in the country and encourage private sector renewable energy development as one of its nine key policies, all the way to the recent National Strategic Action Plan for the Maldives (2019-2023) (SAP), which includes a specific pillar for Clean Energy with renewable energy targets to increase the share of renewable energy by 20 percent by 2023. The opportunity for scaling up renewable energy across the Maldives is immense as it can provide the government budgetary relief by saving millions of dollars each year, that is currently used for diesel imports and subsidy. The signing of the 5 MW PPA (power purchase agreement ) under the World Bank Accelerating Sustainable Private Investments in Renewable Energy (ASPIRE) project is a historic moment in the renewable energy history of the Maldives. The project is the first of its kind in scale for the Maldives and achieved a tariff of USD 10.9 cents. This is one of the lowest tariffs for a Small Island Developing State (SIDS) like the Maldives and helps them gain the pole position in trying to achieve their RE goals. Moving ahead, World Bank is working closely alongside the Government of Maldives through the upcoming Accelerating Renewable Energy Integration and Sustainable Energy (ARISE) project in achieving their dream for a fossil fuel free future.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/power-minister-assures-full-cooperation-to-maldives-to-promote-clean-energy-projects-921101.html

Jaishankar, who arrived here from the United Arab Emirates, also visited Bahrain as part of this three-nation tour which began on Tuesday. During his visit, he called on Seychelles' newly-elected Indian-origin President Wavel Ramkalawan on Friday and congratulated him on his recent electoral victory. Jaishankar and Ramkalawan discussed the historical neighbourly relationship strengthened by shared belief in values of democracy and rule of law. He "iterated India's resolve to further enhance the India-Seychelles strategic partnership in the post-COVID era," the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement on Saturday. The minister also "spoke of the centrality of Seychelles to India's vision of SAGAR (Security And Growth for All in the Region) that characterised India's policy towards the Indian Ocean Region. As a neighbour across waters, Seychelles was very much a part of the Neighbourhood First policy as well," it said. Jaishankar also carried a personal message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and conveyed an invitation from the Indian leadership to the Seychelles President to visit India in 2021. "Discussed our close security cooperation, strong development partnership and long-standing people-to-people contacts," Jaishankar said in a tweet after the meeting with Ramkalawan. "Assured him that Seychelles had a particular priority, both under the Neighbourhood First policy and the SAGAR outlook. Look forward to further strengthening our ties under his leadership," he said. The minister also recalled Ramkalawan's visit to India in January 2018 and expressed the confidence that under his leadership, the close ties between the two countries would develop even further, it said. President Ramkalwan appreciated the assistance provided by India during the pandemic in the form of medical supplies and critical drugs and valued the development and security partnership between the two countries. He also spoke of its positive impact on nation building in Seychelles. Jaishankar emphasised India's commitment to support the interests and aspirations of Seychelles and take this cooperation to a higher level. The discussions underscored the need to further expand and deepen bilateral engagement, and to coordinate and cooperate to counter the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the press release. They stressed the need to strengthen shared efforts to combat drug trafficking, IUU (Illegal, unreported and unregulated) fishing, piracy and climate change while protecting the ocean ecosystem. They also talked about a wide range of regional issues that impacted on their respective interests. Jaishankar also met Seychelles' Minister of Foreign Affairs and Tourism Sylvestre Radegonde and discussed various aspects of bilateral relations including development partnership, capacity building, defence cooperation, people to people and cultural ties, trade, tourism and commerce and health, it said. Jaishankar's visit assumes significance as India is developing infrastructure in the country to expand its footprint in the strategically-key region in the Indian Ocean where China has been trying to enhance its military presence. Indian-origin President Ramkalawan won the presidential election on October 25 this year, the first such victory for an Opposition candidate since Independence. Born in Mahe, the principal island of Seychelles, Ramkalawan was ordained as a priest in 1985 following theological studies at St Paul's Theological College in Mauritius, and thereafter at Birmingham University. His grandfather was from Bihar.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/external-affairs-minister-s-jaishankar-concludes-visit-to-seychelles-stresses-on-enhancing-bilateral-ties-in-post-covid-era-921140.html

Addressing a virtual press conference on the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the company's Pune facility, Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla said: "We discussed the plan, the implementation plan which will happen only after the emergency use licensure, that is granted based on the data that will have to be submitted. We are in the process of submitting that officially to the drug controller of India...". When asked if the company has applied for the emergency authorisation, Poonawalla said: "We are in the process of applying in next two weeks for an emergency use licensure." The vaccine will be distributed initially in India and then the company will look at Covax countries, which are mainly in Africa, he added. Serum Institute of India (SII) is conducting clinical trials of AstraZeneca-Oxford's Covid-19 vaccine candidate in India. Poonawalla also said it was a special day for the company with the Prime Minister visiting them to go into details on the manufacturing status not only its plants in Pune but on various partnerships and the impact the vaccine industry is going to have to India and the globe. In a tweet, the prime minister said: "Had a good interaction with the team at Serum Institute of India. They shared details about their progress so far on how they plan to further ramp up vaccine manufacturing. Also took a look at their manufacturing facility." Poonawalla said, "Worldwide everybody is now dependent and is looking forward to the vaccines coming out in large volumes and at affordable price from India as everybody already knows that more than 50 to 60 per cent of all vaccines are made in India." With the Aatmanirbhar Bharat vision in mind, Serum Institute has built the largest pandemic level facility in Pune in its sister campus at Manjri and that was showcased also to the Prime Minister, he added. Earlier in a tweet, Adar Poonawalla said: "Thank you @narendramodi for visiting @SerumInstIndia. We share your vision and continue to work towards ensuring a safe and secure India". In another tweet, he said: "Sri @narendramodi  Ji, it was a great honour for you to have spared the time, to visit us here at @SerumInstIndia to discuss in detail, the complex challenges yet to come and review the vaccine production status. @PMOIndia". Earlier in the day, Modi visited Zydus Biotech Park in Ahmedabad, and Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad to review the development and manufacturing process of Covid-19 vaccines. Emphasising the importance of the visit, Bharat Biotech said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the company's manufacturing facility in Genome Valley in Hyderabad further reinforces its commitment towards scientific discovery and solving public health issues. Modi visited Bharat Biotech's facility located at Genome Valley and reviewed the progress of Covaxin, a vaccine candidate for Covid-19 being developed by the company. "The prime minister's visit serves as a great inspiration to our team, and further reinforces our commitment towards scientific discovery, solving public health issues, and the nation's fight against Covid-19," Bharat Biotech said in a statement. Currently, the phase-3 clinical trial of Covaxin is being conducted across India involving 26,000 participants. The vaccine will be produced in the Biosafety Level 3 production facility of the company, it added. "We take this opportunity to thank the Government of India, regulators, our vaccine development partners, medical fraternity, medical investigators including hospitals for their relentless assistance and cooperation in the development of vaccines, also phase-3 clinical trials for Covaxin," Bharat Biotech said. Expressing similar sentiments, Zydus Cadila said the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at its Zydus Biotech Park will motivate the company to scale greater heights in its pursuit to bridge unmet healthcare needs. Modi visited Zydus Cadila's manufacturing facility near Ahmedabad, as he began his three-city visit to review ongoing coronavirus vaccine development work. "His inspiring presence will motivate us to scale greater heights in our quest to bridge unmet healthcare needs," Zydus Cadila said in a regulatory filing. The Zydus family comprising 25,000 Zydans stands committed to the ''Atmanirbhar Bharat'' mission and offering the nation safe and efficacious vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics to fight Covid-19, it added. Zydus Cadila had earlier announced that the phase-I clinical trial of its vaccine candidate ZyCoV-D is over and it commenced phase-II clinical trials from August.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sii-in-process-to-seek-emergency-use-licensure-for-covid-19-vaccine-in-two-weeks-adar-poonawalla-921190.html

He further said that the motive of the three new farm laws is exactly the opposite of what the protesting farmers have understood. In an interview to PTI, Chand said, "The way, I am reading these farmers, who are protesting, it looks like that they have not fully or properly understood these three laws." "If these new farm laws are allowed to be implemented, there are very high chances of big increase in income of the farmers and in many states, it may even double," he said while replying to a question on whether the government is still confident of doubling farm income by 2022. The Narendra Modi-led NDA government has set a target of doubling farmers' income by 2022. On September 27, President Ram Nath Kovind gave assent to the three farm bills -- The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020; The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020. Elaborating further on farmer contentions, the Niti Aayog member said protesting farmers are saying that the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) has been removed and full freedom has been given to stockists, black marketers, etc. "If you look at what actually has been done is, there is a modification done in the Essential Commodity Act. According to that modification, a criterion has been laid when Essential Commodities Act can be imposed, and that is if there is a 50 per cent increase in prices of cereals, oil seeds and pulses, then it can be imposed," Chand explained. "Or if there is 100 per cent increase of price of onion and potato then Essential Commodities Act can be imposed," he added. Citing an example, the Niti Aayog member said that on October 23, the Centre had invoked the Act when onion prices were rising. It was required, he said adding “states were told to put stock limit". Similarly, allaying fears of protesting farmers about contract farming, he pointed out that there is a big difference between corporate farming and contract farming. "Corporate farming is not allowed in any states in India... and contract farming is already happening in many states and not even a single incidence has come where land of farmers has been taken over by private companies,” Chand said. The Niti Aayog member asserted that the new Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act has been tilted in favour of farmers. To a question on farm sector growth, Chand said," In this fiscal year (2020-21), I expect the growth of agriculture to be slightly more than 3.5 per cent." Agriculture and allied sector's growth stood at 3.7 per cent during the 2019-20 fiscal year. On frequent ban on exports of onion, he said whenever prices go beyond a band, the government intervenes and it happens everywhere in India, the US and the UK. Noting that prices are always maintained within a band, Chand said in some situation, the government protects interests of farmers by stopping imports, and sometimes, it protects interests of consumers by banning exports. "We can't allow onion prices to go to Rs 100 that too when farmers are not selling onions. 60-70 per cent of onions reach market in the month of April and May and it does not reach market at this time," he said. Chand argued it is not that by imposing ban on exports the government is doing something terribly wrong against the producers. "It is done only in a particular situation, never in normal situation," he explained. Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against the three new laws. They say the intention of these laws is to dismantle the minimum support price system.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/protesting-farmers-havent-fully-understood-new-farm-laws-niti-aayog-member-921223.html

According to the report, the Centre aims to vaccinate around 30 crore people on priority in the early months of 2021, with the rest of the population being vaccinated in the following months. The public sector vaccinators are part of the Universal Immunisation Programme, and a majority of them are expected to be used in the initial waves of vaccination, which will target priority groups such as front line workers. Vaccine major Serum Institute of India (SII) on Saturday said it is in the process of applying for an emergency use licensure for the AstraZeneca-Oxford's Covid-19 vaccine candidate in India in the next two weeks.

The searches were carried out at 16 premises in Chennai, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Cuddalore on November 27, it said. "The searches, so far, have resulted in the detection of undisclosed income of more than Rs 450 crore," the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said in a statement. The Board is the administrative authority for the tax department. In the case of the ex-director of the information technology special economic zone (IT SEZ), the taxman unearthed evidences of about Rs 100 crore "accumulated by the person and his family members in the past 3 years." "The search further unearthed that the IT SEZ developer claimed bogus work-in-progress expenses of about Rs 160 crore in an under-construction project," the statement said. "The entity had also claimed capital expenses of around Rs 30 crore on account of bogus consultancy fees in an operational project and inadmissible interest expenses to the extent of Rs 20 crore was also claimed by the entity," it said. It was found, the CBDT said, that share purchase transactions were undertaken by the developer and the shares were sold by its erstwhile shareholders, a resident and a non-resident entity, which routed its investment through a Mauritius intermediary for about Rs 2,300 crore in financial year 2017-18 but capital gains out of this sale transaction were "not disclosed" to the department. "Investigation is in progress to determine the undisclosed capital gains in the hands of both the shareholders. Other land transactions involving cash payments and an issue relating to Compulsory Convertible Debentures (CCDs) are also under examination," it said. In the case of the Chennai-based stainless steel supplier, it was found that the group has been conducting three sets of sales: accounted; unaccounted and partly-accounted.  "The unaccounted and partly-accounted sales amount to more than 25 per cent of the total sales each year. The group has provided sales accommodation bills to various customers and received commission of more than 10 per cent on these transactions," it said. "While the quantification of unaccounted income is being carried out currently, it is estimated to be around Rs 100 crore," it said. The related concerns of the group are involved in financing, money lending and real estate development.  "The unaccounted transactions conducted by these entities and the unaccounted capital/loan infusion in these entities are estimated to be around Rs 50 crore," the CBDT said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/i-t-dept-detects-rs-450-crore-undisclosed-income-after-raids-in-tamil-nadu-against-two-groups-921251.html

He was speaking at an event organised at the Dhigawara railway station in Rajasthan's Alwar district to mark the inauguration of the newly electrified Dhigawara-Bandikui section under the North Western Railway. "At present tea is given in 'kulhad' at nearly 400 railway stations in the country. The railway is working on a plan that tea will be sold only in 'kulhads' at all railway stations in the country. This will be the contribution of Railways towards plastic-free India," he said. Kulhads save the environment and lakhs of people can get employment from it, Goyal added. In 2004, then Railway Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav had introduced 'kulhads' to keep railway stations clean and provide large scale employment to kulhad makers. However, gradually, 'kulhads' were replaced with plastic and paper cups. This was mainly due to short supply of 'kulhads' and also higher cost compared to cheaper plastic and paper cups. Last year, Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari had written to Goyal to make 'kulhads' mandatory in 100 railway stations. Gadkari also suggested airports and state transport undertakings having tea stalls at bus depots to make the use of 'kulhads' mandatory. Gadkari who also holds MSME portfolio earlier also took initiative through Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) to supply electrical equipment to potters for production of 'kulhads'.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/now-sip-your-garam-chai-in-kulhad-instead-of-plastic-cup-at-railway-stations-921253.html

Aggregators, like cab hailing companies, will have to ensure a tracking mechanism on their apps to clock the drivers' working hours (even if they work with multiple aggregators at the same time) to see that they get at least ten hours of rest. To ensure safety, the guidelines also mandate five-day trainings before attaching vehicles to drivers and two-day annual refresher courses. Drivers who have very low scores from riders will also have to undergo compulsory remedial training. The guidelines, issued on Friday, also cap surge pricing and the minimum amount the driver must get from each ride. "The aggregator shall be permitted to charge a fare 50 per cent lower than the base fare and a maximum surge pricing of 1.5 times the base fare," said the Motor Vehicle Aggregators Guidelines, 2020 issued by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. The driver of a vehicle integrated with the aggregator shall receive at least 80 per cent of the fare applicable on each ride and the remaining charges for each ride shall be received by the aggregator, the guidelines added.

Thousands of farmers continued to protest at the Singhu and Tikri borders on the fourth consecutive day on Sunday. Union Home Minister Amit Shah had on Saturday appealed to the farmers to shift to the Sant Nirankari ground in Burari that was offered to them for peaceful protests and said the Centre was ready to hold discussions with them as soon as they move to the designated place. “We have decided that we will stay put at the Delhi borders. We will not go to Burari,” Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda) president Buta Singh Burjgill said over the phone. The decision was taken by representatives of several farmers organisations, he said. Farmer leader Harmeet Singh Kadian, who is the president of BKU (Kadian), too said that the protesters will not shift to the Burari ground. Reacting to the Union home minister's appeal, Kadian told reporters near the Singhu border that the Centre should not impose any condition for holding talks with the farmers. “We do not want any pre-condition. We want a meeting be held without any condition. We are ready for talks,” Kadian said. Meanwhile, thousands of farmers are likely to join the protesters at the Delhi borders soon, a farmer leader said. The All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh and various factions of Bharatiya Kisan Union had given the call for the 'Delhi Chalo' march. Farmers protesting against the Centre's three farm laws have expressed apprehension that these will pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. The Centre has invited several Punjab farmer organisations for another round of talks in Delhi on December 3.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/agitating-farmers-decide-to-stay-put-at-delhi-borders-921267.html

It is up to the Centre to step in and help them," the Rajya Sabha member said. Replying to a query, Raut claimed farmers were being dubbed as "divisive" because they come from Punjab.

The prime minister narrated three instances where farmers have benefited from the innovation in the field of agriculture as well as the recently enacted farm sector reforms. He narrated the incident where a Maharashtra-based farmer Jitendra Bhoi sought action under the new farm laws to recover the dues owed to him by traders who had bought his corn crop. He said if the payment is not made to the farmer, the new law has a provision that asks the SDM of the area to address the complaint within a month. “This correct and complete knowledge of the law became the strength of Jitendra ji. Whichever field, correct knowledge, free from misconceptions and rumors can act as a force multiplier for every individual,” the prime minister said. Modi also narrated the stories of Mohammad Aslam, who runs a farmers’ producer organisation in Rajasthan and Virendra Yadav, who returned to his village in Haryana from Australia to start a stubble management firm. The prime minister said Aslam shares updates on prices of farm commodities with farmers on WhatsApp and helps them make an informed choice on selling their produce, while Yadav has traded farm stubble worth Rs 2.5 crore, earning a decent profit for himself and helping farmers as well. Modi urged students of agriculture to visit farmers and make them aware about the innovations in farming and the recent agricultural reforms. “This way, you will become stakeholders in major reforms underway in the country,” the prime minister said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/new-farm-laws-gave-new-rights-and-opportunities-for-farmers-pm-cities-success-stories-of-agri-reforms-amid-delhi-chalo-march-921283.html

"We do not accept the condition of their (govt) proposal. We are ready to talk but will not accept any condition now," said Gurnam Singh Chadhoni, Haryana unit president for the Bhartiya Kisan Union. Darshan Pal, Punjab President of Krantikari Kisan Union, said, "The government has invited us to talk with conditions. The environment should be created for a conversation. We will not talk if there are any conditions". After spending another night in the cold, thousands of farmers continued to protest against the Centre's new agri laws on the fourth consecutive day on Sunday, staying put at the Singhu and Tikri border points, even as their leaders deliberated upon their future course of action about the proposed talks with the government. Union Home Minister Amit Shah had appealed to the farmers to shift to the Burari ground and had said the Centre was ready to hold discussions with them as soon as they move to the designated place. A delegation of the farmers has been invited for a discussion on December 3, he said, adding now that some of their unions have demanded that talks should be held immediately, the central government is ready to do so as soon as the protesters shift to the ground in Burari. "If the government is serious about addressing the demands of the farmers, it should stop laying down conditions, should stop assuming that the dialogue can be about an explanation to farmers about the benefits of the Acts," said a representative of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), an umbrella body of farmers' groups. Joginder Singh, President, Bhartiya Kisan Ektagrah, "We are sitting at the borders. Our demand is that the government take back the farm laws and we will not accept anything less than that". Raising slogans against the government, the farmers staged protest at the border amid heavy police presence. The Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee (DSGMC) offered food to the agitating farmers. "There is a crucial meeting today to decide the future course of action. We will stay put till then and decide accordingly. In any situation, we will not call off the protest till our demands are met," Brij Singh, one of the farmers at Singhu border said. Meanwhile, farmers who had reached Nirankarai Samagam Ground in Burari on Saturday continued to stage protest there. "Our leaders are holding a meeting. We will follow whatever they decide. IF the government wants to talk, they should hold the talks immediately without any conditions," an agitating farmer said. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has also termed Shah's offer to hold discussions at the earliest as the best in the interest of the farming community and the nation at large. On Saturday, he had urged the farmers to accept the appeal and shift to the designated place for their protest. The farmers have come prepared for a long haul, their vehicles loaded with rations, utensils, quilts and blankets for the cold and equipped with even charging points for their phones. "In last few days, a lot of protesters have come here from far places and the supply with them is getting reduced. In order to facilitate them so that they do not starve, they should get their proper requirements and their daily needs should be met. We are facilitating those vehicles. In fact our own staff have joined them and helping them in distribution. "Burari DDA ground has already been designated as the protest site and when they want to move, we will be facilitating their movement," said Gaurav Sharma, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer North). On Friday, police used teargas shells, water cannons and multi-layer barriers to block the protesters while some farmers pelted stones and broke barricades in their determination to push through as part of their 'Delhi Chalo' march, but Saturday remained quiet. But the tension persisted with restless crowds milling around the city's edges and beyond and settling down from another night out in the cold.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ready-to-talk-with-govt-but-will-not-accept-any-conditions-say-agitating-farmers-921286.html

29-11-2020||National||NIA rejects reports of seizing Stan Swamy's sipper as 'false and mischievous'||The NIA on Sunday dismissed as "false, incorrect and mischievous" reports which alleged the premier investigation agency has seized human rights activist Father Stan Swamy's straw and sipper, and that it has sought 20 days from a court to respond to his plea for the drinking aid. The 83-year-old was arrested from his residence in Ranchi on October 8 for his alleged involvement in the Elgar Parishad case and is lodged at the Taloja Jail in Mumbai. A National Investigation Agency (NIA) spokesperson said Swamy is a hard-core activist of the banned CPI(Maoist) and was charge-sheeted on October 9 along with seven other accused for his involvement in the Bhima Koregaon Elgar Parishad case. The case relates to an Elgar Parishad event of December 31, 2017 organised at Shaniwarwada in Pune where alleged provocative speeches were made, leading to violence resulting in the loss of life and property and a statewide agitation in Maharashtra. The NIA never took his police custody, and all the necessary legal formalities such as his medical examination were duly observed, the spokesperson said, adding that since then, he has been in judicial custody at the Taloja Central Jail. Nearly after a month on November 6, Swamy filed an application at the NIA court in Mumbai for getting back his straw and sipper, which he falsely claimed to have been kept by the NIA, the official said. The court asked the NIA to file its reply on the next date on November 26. The NIA duly filed its reply in the court on the scheduled date, stating that it had conducted his personal search in the presence of independent witnesses and no such straw and sipper were found, the spokesperson said. The court then rejected Swamy's application and issued necessary direction to the jail authorities on November 26 to provide him straw and sipper. As the accused was in judicial custody, the matter was between him and the jail authorities, which come under the Maharashtra state administration, the NIA official said. "The reports claiming that the NIA recovered straw and sipper from accused Swamy and sought 20 days' time from the court to respond to his plea to allow him a straw and sipper in Taloja Central Jail are false, incorrect and mischievous as the NIA neither recovered any straw and sipper from the accused nor sought 20 days' time to file reply in the said application," the official added. According to the NIA, Swamy was propagating among other cadres that the arrest of the urban CPI(Maoist) cadres from different parts of country, particularly in Maharashtra, has caused an irrevocable damage to the outlawed organisation. It has alleged that he received funds from other Maoist cadres for furtherance of the activities of the CPI(Maoist). Swamy is the convener of the Persecuted Prisoners Solidarity Committee (PPSC), a frontal organisation of the CPI(Maoist), the official said. Incriminating documents related to communications for furthering the activities of the CPI(Maoist) were seized from his possession, the NIA official added. The Bhima Koregaon case was taken over by the NIA on January 24 this year. Pune Police has alleged that the violence was caused following speeches given by members of the group Elgar Parishad a day before.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nia-rejects-reports-of-seizing-stan-swamys-sipper-as-false-and-mischievous-921297.html

Alleging that the candidate vaccine was not safe, he has also sought cancelling approval for its testing, 'manufacture and distribution', failing which legal action would be taken. The legal notice has been sent to Pune based Serum Institute of India (SII), which has collaborated with Oxford University and Astra Zeneca, a pharmaceutical company, in connection with the making of the vaccine, 'Covishield. The Indian Council of Medical Research, one of the sponsors besides SII, and Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, which administered the vaccine to the man, have been served with the notice. The man, it alleged,suffered acute encephalopathy,damage or disease that affects the brain, following vaccination and all tests confirmed that the setback in his health was due to the test vaccine. The trauma he underwent after taking it 'cleary proves' that the vaccine was not safe as made out to be and all the stakeholders were trying to hide the adverse effect that the vaccine has had on him, the notice claimed. An electroencephalogram (EEG) test showed that the brain was affected partially (dysfunction involving both hemispheres and the ascending sensory pathways on both sides from both the lower extremities). A pyschiatric evaluation revealed mild deficit in verbal and visual memory functions and an under functioning in overall cognitive functions, it said. "He has gone through extreme sufferings, both neurologically and psychologically. The vaccine had led to a virtual neurological breakdown in him." The notice said it is impossible to "quantify monetarily, the sufferings, trauma, pain and humiliation (of hands, legs and body being tied and fastened firmly to the bed), which he and his family have undergone and are likely to undergo for a long time to come". When contacted, a spokesperson for Ramachandra said," we also have got the notice," but declined to elaborate. According to the legal notice, the information provided in the 'Participant Information Sheet (PIS)' was absolutely certain that Covishield, the vaccine developed by Oxford University, is safe and the man was hence led to believe it. Hence, he decided to become a volunteer and signed the informed consent on September 29 and the test result for antibodies against coronavirus turned negative the same day. On October 1, he was administered the vaccine. Though there was no side effects for the first 10 days, he subsequently had episodes like severe headache and vomitting. A doctor suggested investigations like a CT-scan as the man was oblivious of what was happening around him and could not respond to questions. Detailing the sequence of events since October 11 when he was admitted to the Ramachandra Hospital and as narrated by the man's wife, the notice said he showed behavioural changes. He could neither recognise anyone nor speak and was totally disoriented and was shifted to the ICU and was on October 26, "discharged at our (family's) request." At home, he seemed quite disoriented at times and was unable to relate to things or work. He would not have volunteered for the test vaccine if all the potential risk factors of the test vaccine had been known to him. But on the other hand, there was a clear assertion of the safety nature of the test vaccine in the PIS which made him to become a volunteer, the notice said. The legal notice has also been addressed to the Drugs Controller General of India, Professor Andrew Pollard, chief investigator, Oxford vaccine trial, The Jenner Institute Laboratories of the University of Oxford and Astra Zeneca UK. "For all the trauma he is undergoing and with an uncertain future in his health, he should be given a financial compensation of Rs five crore within a period of two weeks." Though he suffered severe adverse reaction to the vaccine, the stakeholders failed to follow any of the guidelines mandated by World Health Organisation, it said. The notice also said the testing, manufacturing and the distribution of the vaccine should be stopped immediately failing which the man would have no other option except to take legal action against all the parties concerned. The Drugs Controller General of India and the institutional ethics committee at the implementationsiteare investigating if the adverse event as claimed to have been suffered by a Covid-19 vaccine trial participant are related to the shot administered to him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covishield-vaccine-trial-participant-alleges-neuro-breakdown-demands-rs-5-crore-compensation-from-serum-institute-921300.html

Among states other than those from the north-east, Karnataka has the least number of beneficiaries for the scheme from the general category. Punjab has just 22 beneficiaries from the Scheduled Castes despite Dalits accounting for 31% of the population while the Union Territories of Ladakh and Lakshadweep do not have a single Dalit beneficiary. This information is gleaned out from an RTI response received by transparency activist Venkatesh Nayak, which also reveals that only 24.25% (2.46 crore) of the 10.16 crore beneficiaries are women. It also shows that around 1.47 crore beneficiaries out of the total were added to the list across the country during the Covid-19 pandemic in the past six months. Launched in February last year, the PM-KISAN scheme, an income support scheme, provides farmers Rs 6,000 per annum in three instalments. Initially, it was meant for small and marginal farmers but now its scope has been expanded to all farmers, numbering around 14 crore. The RTI showed that 41.51% or 4.22 crore beneficiaries belonged to the OBCs while 11.96% or 1.21 crore belonged to the Scheduled Casts and 9.89% (one crore) belonged to the Scheduled Tribes. The rest 3.72 crore or 36.64% belonged to the general category. Among the OBCs, Uttar Pradesh had the highest number -- 1.33 crore or 57.46% of 2.32 crore beneficiaries followed by Karnataka with 45.08 lakh. Karnataka, however, has the highest proportion of OBC beneficiaries compared to total beneficiaries in the state -- as 86.05% of the 52.38 lakh beneficiaries belonged to the OBCs. The southern state has 4.44 lakh (8.49%) Dalit beneficiaries and 2.68 lakh tribal beneficiaries. However, the beneficiaries from the general category stand at 17,732 or 0.34% of the total beneficiaries. Other than Karnataka and UP, there are nine other states -- Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Odisha and Chhattisgarh --that have more than 10 lakh beneficiaries each from the OBC category. OBCs account for the single largest segment of beneficiaries in Rajasthan (48.74%), Andhra Pradesh (45.93%), Madhya Pradesh (45.48%), Chhattisgarh (42.03%) and Odisha (41.51%). Interestingly, Telangana has listed 87 communities, including four belonging to the Islamic faith, among the OBCs but it does not have a single beneficiary, which Nayak says requires "deeper probing". Kerala, which has 33.46 lakh beneficiaries, also has a very low proportion of OBCs in the list – 2,220 beneficiaries or 0.07%. When it comes to Scheduled Castes, Uttar Pradesh has the largest number of beneficiaries at 43.94 lakh followed by Rajasthan (9.73 lakh), Madhya Pradesh (9.50 lakh), Bihar (8.23 lakh) and Maharashtra (7.19 lakh). Madhya Pradesh accounted for the largest number of PM-KISAN beneficiaries belonging to Scheduled Tribes (16.52 lakh) followed by Odisha (10.57 lakh), Gujarat (9.59 lakh), Rajasthan (8.61 lakh), Chhattisgarh (8.16 lakh) and Maharashtra (7.03 lakh). In the general category, Uttar Pradesh stood on top of the list with 52.65 lakh followed by Maharashtra (51.07 lakh), Bihar (35.53 lakh), Kerala (31.01 lakh), Telangana (26.94 lakh) and Gujarat (21.99 lakh).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/obc-farmers-account-for-86-pm-kisan-beneficiaries-in-karnataka-general-category-at-034-921307.html

A 40-year-old man who took part in the 'Covidshield' vaccine trial in Chennai has alleged serious side effects, including a virtual neurological breakdown and impairment of cognitive functions and has sought Rs 5 crore compensation in a legal notice to Serum Institute and others, besides seeking a halt to the trial. "The allegations in the notice are malicious and misconceived. While the Serum Institute of India is sympathetic with the volunteer's medical condition, there is absolutely no correlation with the vaccine trial and the medical condition of the volunteer," Serum Institute of India said in a statement. The volunteer is falsely laying the blame for his medical problems on the Covid vaccine trial, it added. "It is evident that the intention behind the spreading of such malicious information is an oblique pecuniary motive. The Serum Institute of India, will seek damages in excess of 100 crore for the same and will defend such malicious claims," Serum Institute said. Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) has collaborated with Oxford University and pharmaceutial company Astra Zeneca for making the Covid-19 vaccine, 'Covidshield', and is conducting trials in India.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/serum-institute-rejects-charges-levelled-by-covid-19-vaccine-trial-participant-threatens-to-seek-damages-921350.html
29-11-2020||National||Manohar Lal Khattar will hold Punjab CM 'responsible if farmers’ gatherings aggravate Covid-19 in Haryana'||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday said he would hold his Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singh responsible if farmers' gathering on the state's borders with Delhi leads to an aggravation of the Covid-19 situation in the state. Khattar made the assertion while pointing out that the Haryana government had only recently decided to limit the number of people attending social gatherings like marriages, religious and political functions to contain the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in Haryana. “In view of the rising coronavirus cases, we had decided to limit indoors gatherings to 100 and outdoor ones to 200 for all types of functions including family, political and religious ones,” Khattar told reporters in Hisar on the sidelines of an event. Referring to the Hisar event, he said, “Even today for this function here, we permitted only 200 people.” With thousands of farmers from Punjab having reached Delhi borders forcing their way through Haryana on the call for protest against the three central farm laws, Khatar said he was surprised why Punjab government encouraged the movement of such big gatherings amid the pandemic. “Who will be responsible if this disease has an impact here?” he asked, adding: “I will hold Punjab government responsible if the (Covid) situation (in Haryana) aggravates.” Khattar, who has been engaged in a war of words with Amarinder Singh, reiterated that he had tried to talk to him on many occasions over the telephone on farmers' “Delhi Chalo” march, "but the latter is not accepting it now." “And now when the record has been shown as to how many times I tried to speak to him, he (Amarinder) had no answer,” he added. "Since this is a sponsored programme of Congress and Punjab government, they now want to escape from accepting things,” he said. On Saturday, Khattar had alleged some political parties and organisations were sponsoring the farmers' stir against the Centre's farm laws. Justifying why Haryana authorities initially stopped farmers from Punjab at inter-state borders, Khattar said, “We stopped them and told them no one will allow such big gatherings in Delhi, but they did not listen and went forcibly ahead. "We said we will not use force. And I don't consider the use of water cannons and tear gas shells as the use of force,” he said, referring to their use by the Haryana police to stop Punjab farmers from entering Haryana. Hitting out at Amarinder Singh, he said the Punjab CM did not use even appropriate language for him. “He does not behave a Chief Minister. At least the way he has behaved, I am not going to do that,” he added. On thousands of farmers laying siege at Haryana's Sonipat border with Delhi, he said the Centre has already told farmers that it is ready to talk with them if they move to the ground designated for their protest in Burari in Delhi. Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij too urged farmers to shift to Burari ground in Delhi following the Centre’s assurance that it would talk to them. “But their insistence on protesting at inter-state borders indicates their purpose is something else,” Vij said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/manohar-lal-khattar-will-hold-punjab-cm-responsible-if-farmers-gatherings-aggravate-covid-19-in-haryana-921351.html

In addition to nine warships and 14 aircraft engaged in the search efforts, Indian Navy's Fast Interceptor Craft are also deployed to search waters along the coast, a defence release said. "Indian Navy's search and rescue effort to locate the second pilot of the MiG-29K trainer aircraft which ditched off Goa on November 26 continues with extensive deployment of naval ships and aircraft," a defence release said. "Some debris of the aircraft, including landing gear, turbocharger, fuel tank engine and wing engine cowling have been located," it said. The Marine Police and Coastal Police are on the lookout and nearby fishing villages have been sensitised, the release added. The Russian-origin jet had taken off from aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya and went down at around 5 PM on Thursday, officials had said, adding that one pilot of the aircraft had been rescued. The MiG-29K is an all-weather carrier-based multirole fighter aircraft developed by Russian aerospace company Mikoyan (MiG). The Indian Navy had procured a fleet of 45 MiG-29Ks from Russia over a decade back at a cost of around USD 2 billion to operate from INS Vikramaditya. INS Vikramaditya was part of the second phase of the Malabar exercise involving navies of India, the US, Australia and Japan.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-navy-finds-some-debris-of-crashed-mig-29k-in-arabian-sea-921360.html

Bhalerao, who was posted with the 206th CoBRA battalion, sent the message over Whatsapp around noon on Saturday to a batch-mate posted in an another CoBRA unit who, like him, was planning a field operation. The Commando Battalions for Resolute Action (CoBRA) was raised by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in 2009 as a special guerrilla combat unit for undertaking anti-Naxal operations as well as combating insurgents in the northeast. The assistant commandant-rank officer succumbed on Sunday to injuries from the improvised explosive device (IED) blast, which took place in the Arbajmeta area of the Chintalnar forests around 9 pm on Saturday. "He was a daring and talented officer and one of the best in the CoBRA. He volunteered to join the special unit last year after he had a stint with the special duty group that secures the Parliament in Delhi," a senior CRPF officer told PTI as he remembered the commando. Bhalerao had joined the Chhattisgarh unit in June. He was a decorated officer as he won combat competitions and participated in all-India police commando duty meets. He was very close to his mother who raised him after he lost his father very early, the officer said. Bhalerao, who would have celebrated his 34th birthday on December 21, was very fond of his six-year-old daughter Vedangi, he said. "Bhalerao was a very committed trooper and this was evident from the fact that he joined the CRPF in 2010 as a sub-inspector but he worked hard and cleared exams to be appointed as a gazetted officer in 2018," the officer added. His last rites will take place on Sunday at his home town in Nashik in Maharashtra. A total of 10 commandos including Bhalerao were injured in the blast, including the team leader and second-in-command rank officer Dinesh Kumar Singh. While seven personnel are under treatment at a hospital in Raipur, two are being treated at a field hospital at Chintalnar in Sukma, about 450 kms from the Chhattisgarh capital. The officer said that all nine are out of danger. A joint team of the CoBRA and the local police was out for an area domination exercise when the blast took place. The team was scouting the area for the proposed induction of some new battalions of the CRPF and establishment of new camps when the IED went off, official sources said. Five fresh CRPF battalions are expected to be inducted in the south Bastar region of Chhattisgarh for anti-naxal duties after the Union home ministry recently gave its approval.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kill-the-beast-crpf-commandos-last-message-to-his-colleague-921362.html

The proposal is in line with the government's plan to commercialise NavIC user receivers to promote an indigenous positioning technology. "MeitY (Ministry of Electronics and IT) seeks proposals from bidder to design, manufacture, supply and maintain Integrated NavIC and GPS chips and ensure deployment of Integrated NavIC and GPS receivers," the request for proposal document said. The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System, known as Navic, is the country's navigation satellite built to provide accurate position information service to users in India as well as the region extending up to 1,500 kilometres from its boundary. "Integrated NavIC and GPS receiver chips will improve overall signal availability and position accuracy in urban areas and will also support additional messaging facilities unlike GPS-only receiver chips. Also, the NavIC system is totally under Indian control, which is a major requirement for a sovereign country," the document said. The government will also provide subsidies to qualified bidders. "The bidder/s should design, manufacture, supply and maintain awarded quantities of Integrated NavIC and GPS receivers; and ensure deployment of Integrated NavIC and GPS receivers. The total awarded quantity is 10 Lakh. MeitY reserves the right to place parallel contracts on two or more vendors/bidders based on the pricing of the lowest technically compliant offer,” the document said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-invites-proposals-for-design-manufacturing-of-indigenous-gps-chips-921363.html

The plea filed by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay has also sought directions to restrict the contesting candidates from taking part in the fresh election, who have participated in the nullified election. "The Court may declare that if ‘none of the above’ (NOTA) gets maximum votes, then election to that constituency shall be nullified and a fresh election shall be held within six months; and the contesting candidates rejected in the nullified elections, shall not be allowed to participate in the fresh election," the plea filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey said. The petition contended that political parties choose contesting candidates in a very undemocratic manner without consulting electors, that is why, many times people in the constituency are totally discontented with the candidates presented before them. "This problem can be solved by holding a fresh election if maximum votes are polled in favour of NOTA. In such situation, the contesting candidates should be considered as rejected and not be allowed in the fresh election. "Right to reject and elect new candidate will give power to the people to express their discontent. If voters are dissatisfied with the background of the contesting candidate, they will opt NOTA to reject such candidate and elect a new candidate," the plea said. The plea said the percentage of candidates with criminal antecedents and their chances of winning has actually increased steadily over the years. "The injury caused to public is extremely large and continue till date, as the right to reject is an integral part of Article 19, but the Centre and ECI did nothing to declare the election result invalid and hold fresh election if maximum votes are polled in favour of NOTA," it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/plea-in-sc-to-nullify-election-results-if-maximum-votes-in-favour-of-nota-921377.html

The manufacturers have, however, vouched for the safety of their vaccines. The most recent incident of such an adverse effect has been reported from the Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Chennai, where a volunteer was given a shot on October 1 as part of the Serum Institute of India’s (SII) clinical trial of the Covid-19 vaccine, but developed complicated neurological conditions 10 days later, necessitating hospitalisation. While a Chennai-based neurologist linked the disorder to the Covid-19 vaccine and the recipient sent a legal notice to the SII seeking Rs 5 crore compensation, the company in a statement on Sunday strongly refuted any such linkage and demanded Rs 100 crore from the volunteer in damages for maligning the company. "The allegations are malicious and misconceived. While the SII is sympathetic with the volunteer's medical condition, there is absolutely no correlation with the vaccine trial and the medical condition of the volunteer. The volunteer is falsely laying the blame for his medial problems on the Covid-19 vaccine trial," the company said. "The claim is malicious because the volunteer was specifically informed by the medical team that the complications he suffered were independent of the vaccine trial he underwent. In spite of specifically being made aware of the same, he still chose to go public and malign the reputation of the company." Health Ministry sources told DH that an institutional ethics committee that probed the adverse events within 48 hours found no causal link between the vaccine and the neurological complications that the Chennai recipient developed. But the DCGI, which was informed by the hospital within seven days, is yet to release the findings of its probe even after six weeks. "The initial investigations by the institutional ethics committee did not show any causal link. The DCGI is looking into it and will release its observations. It will inform the ICMR and SII," Samiran Panda, head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at ICMR, told DH. The SII incident is the second case of serious adverse reaction seen in Covid-19 vaccine trials in India. For the last three months, the regulator is also keeping mum on another case of adverse effect reported in August during Bharat Biotech’s vaccine trial. "The adverse event during phase I clinical trials was reported to the DCGI within 24 hours of its occurrence and confirmation. It was investigated thoroughly and determined as not vaccine-related," the Hyderabad-based vaccine-maker had stated.   In contrast, the DCGI promptly paused the Astra-Oxford-SII vaccine trial for about a week when two cases of serious adverse reactions were reported in the UK and Astra suspended the clinical trial all over the world to review the data. "In the absence of any formal and authoritative statements on the adverse events, scepticism begins to sound reasonable. The trouble, of course, is that this bureaucratic opacity is common to Indian regulatory processes in every area. It is based on the paternalistic assumption that 'authority knows best', which is a familiar attitude of any 'authorities' in India," commented Satyajit Rath, a visiting professor at the IISER Pune.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dcgi-silent-on-covid-19-vaccine-effects-serum-seeks-rs-100-crore-damages-from-tamil-nadu-volunteer-who-sued-company-921380.html

The protesters are now set to intensify their agitation by blocking all the entry points to the national capital. The announcement by farmers' organisations came a day after Shah offered to advance the talks with agitators provided they moved to the Burari Grounds site marked for their agitation. “The conditions put for talks is an insult to farmers. We will never go to Burari. It is an open jail,” Surjeet Singh Phul, President of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Krantikari) told reporters at the Singhu borders, where a large number of farmers have staged sit-in protests for the past four days. The farmers’ leaders also declared that they will not allow political parties to associate with the agitation and deny them a platform to speak on their behalf. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar reiterated the offer of talks, saying a delegation of Union Ministers would meet them at Vigyan Bhawan on December 3. The farmers’ unions were also irked at the Home Minister making the offer for talks. “The attempt to invoke the Home Ministry only acts as a threat to farmers instead of instilling confidence,” the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) said in a statement. The AIKSCC also gave a call to farmers’ organisations to immediately mobilise more farmers to march to Delhi and intensify the protests. “We have decided to lay a siege to Delhi by blocking five main entry points,” Phul said. Activists of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Tikait), hailing from parts of western Uttar Pradesh, blocked the NH-24 at the Delhi-UP border at Ghazipur in East Delhi in support of the farmers’ agitation. Community organisations in Haryana – khap panchayats – announced support to the farmers’ agitation and declared that they would proceed towards the national capital on Monday to join the protests. “Khaps will gather tomorrow (Monday) and proceed towards Delhi.

A 40-year-old man said in a complaint seen by Reuters that he had suffered serious "neurological and psychological" symptoms after receiving the vaccine in a trial being run by the British drugmaker's partner Serum Institute of India (SII).

The Social Security Branch (SSB) of Nagpur police took the action on Saturday, he said. The six accused were identified as Surendra Yadavrao Patale, his wife Pooja, Sharmila Vijay Khakse, Shaila Manoj Manchalwar, Laxmi Amar Rane and Manorama Anand Dhawale, police said. "Based on a tip-off that the accused operated a child trafficking gang, the police decided to take action against them. They contacted Sharmila last week, pretending that they were a rich couple who wanted to buy a child. Sharmila assured the couple that she would arrange a newborn baby for them and fixed the deal at Rs 2.5 lakh," the official said. "However, Sharmila later offered a four-year-old girl to the couple at the same amount," he added. The decoy couple arrived at the Medical Square on Saturday evening, where Sharmila and Surendra brought the girl. "They accepted Rs 2.5 lakh from the couple and handed over the girl to them. Soon after, a police team arrived at the spot and arrested the accused duo," the official said, adding that other four accused were held within an hour. A local court remanded all the accused in seven days of police custody. All of them have been booked under IPC section 363 (kidnapping), 370 (trafficking of person) and others at Imambada police station. "The rescued minor girl is from Siroha village in Madhya Pradesh.

Launching a scathing attack against the government over the ongoing protest by farmers, RLD president Jayant Chaudhary accused the BJP dispensation at the Centre of wanting to suppress the voice of the farmers with "brute force". Rejecting the Centre's offer to hold talks once they move to the Burari ground, the farmers who are protesting at Delhi's borders for four days against the new farm laws on Sunday said they will not accept any conditional dialogue and threatened to block all five entry points to the national capital. "Farmers across the country are demonstrating against the anti-farmer policies of the Modi government. But instead of dialogue in democracy, the central government wants to suppress the voice of the farmers with the crude use of force and on the strength of sticks," Chaudhary said in a statement. "By using sticks, water canons and tear gas shells at the farmers coming to Delhi to protest peacefully against the new 'anti-farmer' laws, the BJP government has once again shown its anti-farmer mindset," he claimed. Over some people, chiefly on social media, alleging a link between the protestors and a separatist movement, Chaudhary said the government should leave its "dictatorial attitude" and listen to the farmers instead of seeing them as “terrorists”. "The Rashtriya Lok Dal salutes the bravery and passion of the farmers of Punjab and Haryana who have reached Delhi braving the water canons, barbed wires, tear gas shells and batons of the Modi government and the BJP-led government of Haryana," he said. "Busy in campaigning in Hyderabad, the Modi government has delayed the date for talks with farmers to December 3. This shows that farmers are not a priority for the BJP but only elections and votes matter to it," Chaudhary alleged. The RLD chief also highlighted that the farmers in western Uttar Pradesh were "worried" over the minimum support price (MSP) of crops, among other issues. "Today, the plight of farmers of western Uttar Pradesh is not hidden from anyone because of dues in sugarcane payments, increase in electricity prices and rising cost of cultivation,” he said. "Farmers are worried about the minimum support price and they are not getting fair prices for their produce in markets," Chaudhary said. He, however, said that the Centre would give a seriously hearing to the farmers over the new farm reform laws and resolve all their issues. "The country will never develop with communal polarization. Ultimately, the real issues related to farmers and villages will have to be resolved on priority," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-busy-in-poll-campaign-farmers-not-priority-rld-921444.html

Along with his tweet attacking the government, Gandhi tagged the media report which said a key central scholarship scheme to help over 60 lakh Scheduled Caste students of classes 11 and 12 to complete their schooling has nearly shut down across more than 14 states after the Centre ended funding to states under a 2017 formula. "In BJP/RSS vision of India, Adivasis and Dalits should not have access to education," Gandhi alleged. "Stopping scholarships for SC-ST students is their way of ends justifying their means," the former Congress chief said in the tweet.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/in-bjp-rss-vision-of-india-adivasis-and-dalits-should-not-have-access-to-education-rahul-921210.html
29-11-2020||National Politics||Maha Vikas Aghadi government natural, will stay on: Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday slammed the BJP for calling the MVA government in Maharashtra as "unnatural", and said a government is natural till it exists. In his weekly column 'Rokthok' in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana, Raut recalled that during alliance talks last year, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge had a heated argument over the Assembly Speaker's post. "He (Pawar) collected his papers and left the room in anger. I have never seen Pawar so angry," he said. Raut said the situation changed after that and the next day at dawn (on November 23) BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis and NCP's Ajit Pawar took oath in a ceremony at Raj Bhavan. Their government collapsed within 80 hours. Last week, former Maharashtra chief minister Fadnavis termed the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), which comprises the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, as an "unnatural alliance", and said the day this tie-up breaks, his party will give a strong government to the state. Reacting to it, Raut said, "The BJP has been predicting the government's downfall and how it will be done depends on the secret activities and the central investigating agencies. Whatever the ED does, I say with responsibility that the MVA government will stay on." In politics, "no one is a saint" and no government is natural or unnatural, the Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson said. "A government is natural till it is there. To destabilise it, agencies like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) are being used. Those doing illegal constructions and accused of abetment to suicide are being protected," he alleged. "If these political pressure tactics are natural, then the 'Thackeray sarkar' is also natural. The government has proved its majority on the floor of the House and is within constitutional norms," Raut said. He said if there were no Covid-19 outbreak, floods, cyclones and lockdown difficulties, the situation in the state would have been different in the last one year. After the Maharashtra Assembly polls last year, the Shiv Sena snapped ties with long-term ally BJP over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post in the state. Recalling last year's hectic parleys between the Sena, NCP and Congress to form a non-BJP government in the state, Raut said Sharad Pawar and Kharge had a heated argument over the Assembly Speaker's post in a meeting at Nehru Centre here. "Khargeand others were firmthat the post shouldn't go to the NCP. I have never seen Pawar so angry. He collected his papers and left the room in anger. Myself and (NCP leader) PrafulPatel followed him," the Rajya Sabha member said. Raut recalled that Pawar had earlier in the meeting said Uddhav Thackeray will be the chief ministerial candidate of the alliance. "But after his argument with Kharge, the situation changed." "Ajit Pawar was chatting on his mobile for a long time in the room and later left. His mobile was switched-off and he was seen the next day at the swearing-in at the Raj Bhavan," Raut said. The Sena leader rejected Fadnavis's claim that Sharad Pawar and Union Home Minister Amit Shah had a meeting in Delhi where it was decided that the NCP will support the BJP following which the early morning swearing-in took place. "There was a meeting at Amit Shah's place where a top industrialist and NCP leaders may have been present. But, Sharad Pawar was in no mood to have any deal with the BJP," the Sena leader claimed. "He (Sharad Pawar) told me that 'offers are being made for a BJP government from various quarters. I will be meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and will tell him that an alliance with the BJP wasn't possible'," he said. Later, Sharad Pawar met Modi on farmers' issues and also clarified his position on the government formation in Maharashtra, he said. "The real script of the political drama is still under cover and will always remain like that," Raut added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/maha-vikas-aghadi-government-natural-will-stay-on-sanjay-raut-921256.html

The Lok Sabha MP from Sivaganga, referring to the seven convicts said, "do not make them heroes, they are not heroes," and asked whether the 15 other victims were not Tamils. Also, he sought to know, "what about justice for them?" Tagging a clip of his interview to News18 Tamil Nadu channel on his Twitter handle, Karti regretted that the so-called pro-Tamil outfits- that support the release of the seven convicts- have never spoken about the victims. Rajiv Gandhi and 15 others were killed in a blast triggered by a woman suicide bomber Dhanu at an election rally in Sriperumbudur near here on May 21, 1991. The ruling AIADMK, main opposition DMK and almost all other parties support the release of the convicts, V Sriharan alias Murugan, T Suthendraraja alias Santhan, A G Perarivalan alias Arivu, Jayakumar, Robert Payas, Ravichandran and Nalini. The AIADMK government recommended their release in 2018 and the matter is pending with Governor Banwarilal Purohit. The Tamil Nadu Congress Committee had said political parties demanding their release was unacceptable.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-mp-karti-chidambaram-flays-hero-worship-of-rajiv-gandhi-case-convicts-921264.html

"We will free Hyderabad from the Nizam culture and work towards constructing a modern and new city with democratic principles.

Who takes their side in Parliament?" Owaisi had targeted Shah earlier asking What is the Home Minister doing if there are illegal Rohingyas in Hyderabad. Further slamming the Opposition Shah said, "Hyderabad has the potential to become an IT hub. Infrastructure development has to be done by the municipal corporation even though funds are given by State and Centre.

29-11-2020||National Politics||PM hailing farm laws shows Centre 'drunk with power', 'rigid' in face of protests: Congress||Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for reiterating that the new agri laws are beneficial for farmers, the Congress on Sunday said the insistence in support of the legislations shows that the government is "drunk with power" and is rigid even in reconsidering the laws. The Opposition party also demanded that Prime Minister Modi should immediately announce the suspension of the three "anti-agriculture" laws. "The prime minister's obduracy, arrogance and rigidity in dealing with 62 crore farmers and farm labourers of India is writ large by his insistence today in the 'Mann ki Baat' that the three anti-farmer, anti-agriculture laws, forcibly passed in an illegal and unconstitutional manner, by Parliament, are correct," Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said at a press conference at the AICC headquarters here. "For the prime minister to say that these three laws are absolutely right when lakhs and lakhs of farmers are sitting around Delhi agitating, demanding their withdrawal, shows that the Modi government is drunk with power and Prime Minister Modi does not care about the welfare of the farmers and farm labourers of India," he said. It shows that a government "drunk with power" is rigid even in re-contemplating and reconsidering the three "anti-agriculture black laws". Surjewala's remarks came hours after Prime Minister Modi, in his monthly 'Mann ki Baat' broadcast, asserted that these reforms have opened doors of new opportunities for farmers and bestowed on them new rights. Modi also said the farm laws have begun mitigating the troubles of farmers in a short period of time since their enactment in September as he cited the example of a Maharashtra farmer who used their provisions to get the money a trader had promised but not paid to him in time. Surjewala also hit out at Union Home Minister Amit Shah for attending a political event in Hyderabad but not reaching out to farmers immediately. "If the home minister of India has time to travel 1,200 km to Hyderabad to attend a public meeting, why does Amit Shah does not have the time to go 15 km to the borders of Delhi and talk to the agitating farmers, why is it that the agriculture minister has taken out a date of December 3 before which no conversation can be held, have they consulted an astrologer for this purpose," the Congress leader said. Posing several questions to the Modi government, Surjewala asked why "12,000 FIRs have been lodged against farmers" and why is that that no dialogue is taking place with them. He accused the BJP leaders and chief ministers of branding farmers as "terrorists" and asked why is it that select TV channels "aided and abetted by the Modi government are out to prove 62 crore farmers are anti-nationals". Surjewala alleged that the three farm laws tantamount to finishing the minimum support price mechanism which he said "will be a death knell for the interest of the farmers". "Prime Minister Modi wants to barter the interest of the farmers at the alter of four to five crony capitalist friends of his and ensure that Rs 20-25 lakh crore commodity market is controlled by his four to five crony capitalist friends," he alleged. "But prime minister has bitten more than he can chew because when 62 crore farmers rise in unison, the 'Delhi darbar' will be unseated and that is not a warning, that is a challenge to the prime minister," he said. The Congress demands that Prime Minister Modi should immediately announce the suspension of the three anti-farming laws and all the "12,000 cases" against farmers be unconditionally withdrawn, Surjewala said. He said the prime minister and Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar should apologise for the treatment meted out to farmers and the PM should personally speak with the delegation of farmers. After spending another night in cold, thousands of farmers continued to protest against the Centre's new agri laws on the fourth consecutive day on Sunday staying put at the Singhu and Tikri border points, with farmer leaders deliberating upon their future course of action about proposed talks with the government. The three farm laws are - The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation); The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance; and Farm Services and The Essential Commodities (Amendment). Farmers say they are apprehensive that the laws will pave way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/pm-hailing-farm-laws-shows-centre-drunk-with-power-rigid-in-face-of-protests-congress-921325.html

His remarks come a day after Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala's sharp attack at Prime Minister Modi over his visit to vaccine facilities amid farmers' protests. Sharma also urged the Prime Minister to ensure that an efficient and equitable platform is functional as the vaccine arrives, asserting that this alone will lift the morale of frontline Covid warriors and reassure the nation. Sharma put out a tweet in the night saying he regrets the error in his earlier tweets "where the lines got misplaced, resulting in some avoidable confusion". "Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi visit to Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila was a recognition of Indian scientists and their work to produce the vaccine for Covid-19. This is acknowledging and respecting the institutions that India has built over decades that have expertise and potential making India world's largest vaccine manufacturer (sic)," Sharma said, according to the revised content of the tweet posted by him. "Urging PM to ensure that an efficient and equitable platform is functional as the vaccine arrives. This alone will lift the morale of frontline Covid warriors and reassure the nation (sic)," he said. Earlier, Sharma's tweets read: "Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi visit to Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila was a recognition of Indian scientists and their work to produce the vaccine for Covid-19 That alone will lift morale of frontline warriors and reassure the nation (sic)." "Also respecting the institutions that India has built over decades that have expertise and potential, making India world's largest vaccine manufacturer. Urging PM to ensure that an efficient and equitable platform is functional as the vaccine arrives (sic)." Also respecting the Institutions that India has built over decades that have expertise and potential making India worlds largest vaccine manufacturer. Urging PM to ensure that an efficient and equitable platform is functional as the vaccine arrives. Prime Minister Modi on Saturday visited Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Pune to review the development and manufacturing process of coronavirus vaccines at facilities in these cities. He visited the Zydus Biotech Park in Ahmedabad, Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad and Serum Institute of India in Pune. Hitting out at Modi, Surjewala accused him of getting pictures clicked in corporate offices while farmers are protesting on roads of Delhi. "Wish the PM talks to farmers on the road instead of flying in the aircraft," he had said in a tweet. "Coronavirus vaccine will be developed by scientists, farmers will feed the country and Modi ji and BJPites will handle television," Surjewala had said. Sharma's remarks struck a slightly divergent tone than the strong attack by Surjewala. Congress leaders have been found airing differing views on key issues of late. Earlier this month, Sharma had described India's decision of not joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) as "unfortunate and ill advised", asserting that it was in the country's strategic and economic interests to be a part of the process of Asia-Pacific integration. His view was at variance with senior leader Jairam Ramesh and the party which had last year, after India had decided not to join the RCEP, claimed victory. The Congress had said its forceful opposition ensured that the BJP government backs out from bartering the interests of farmers, dairy producers, fishermen and small and medium businessmen. Congress president Sonia Gandhi has set up three separate committees for discussing policy issues related to economic affairs, foreign affairs and national security, with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh part of all the three panels. The committee on foreign affairs has Sharma as a member along with Shashi Tharoor, Salman Khurshid and Saptagiri Ulaka. Khurshid is the convener of the panel. Incidentally, among those nominated in the committees include senior party leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Veerappa Moily and Shashi Tharoor, who were part of the 23 letter-writers seeking an organisational overhaul of the Congress.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/pm-modis-visit-to-vaccine-facilities-acknowledgement-of-institutions-built-over-decades-anand-sharma-921365.html

Delhi chief secretary and DDMA executive committee chairman Vijay Dev, in an order, said all Delhi government offices, autonomous bodies, public sector undertakings, corporations, local bodies will function with officers of grade-one level or equivalent and above to the extent of 100 per cent. "The remaining staff will attend up to 50 per cent as per requirement to be assessed by heads of the departments concerned (remaining 50 per cent of the staff will work from home) till December 31, 2020, or till further orders whichever is earlier," stated the DDMA order. Private offices are advised to stagger the office timings and also presence and quantum of staff with an objective to reduce the number of employees attending office at the same time. They are further advised to follow the practice of work from home as for as possible, it said. In a tweet, Delhi Revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said, "DDMA has decided to reduce number of government employees attending office at the same time, it has been decided that in respect of officials lower than Grade 1, only 50% of the strength shall attend office. Private offices are also advised to stagger timings & presence of staff." The proposal from the Delhi government's revenue department to reduce presence of non-essential services staff in offices to 50 per cent was sent to the Lt Governor on Friday who is also chairman of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) for approval, Gahlot said. L-G Anil Baijal on Saturday approved the proposal. "The heads of departments will decide about how to implement it according to requirement of staff at their disposal," Gahlot told PTI. According to officials, the move, applicable to all Delhi government employees except grade-one and above officers, aims to bring down number of non-essential services staff in the offices in view of Covid-19 pandemic. The proposal was made in line with an order of Union Ministry of Home Affairs on November 25 for considering steps to reduce the number of employees in government offices through various measure to ensure social distancing, an official said. The proposal does not cover departments concerned with essential services, including health, police, home guards and civil defence, district administrations, fire, electricity and water, municipal services among others, the officer said. However, other Delhi government offices, autonomous bodies, public sector units, corporations and local bodies, associated with non-essential services, are covered by the proposal. The heads of departments and agencies concerned will prepare a schedule for assigning office timings and employees to be required for work purpose, the officer said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-govt-issues-work-from-home-orders-for-50-non-essential-services-employees-921100.html

He also said terrorism emanating from across the border continues to be a serious threat and that it was not abating despite all the efforts being made to check it. In the first electoral exercise in Jammu and Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370, nearly 52 percent voter turnout was recorded on Saturday in the staggered polls to district development councils. Days after a 150-metre-long underground tunnel suspected to be used by four Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorists for infiltration from Pakistan was detected by the BSF at the International Border in Jammu and Kashmir's Samba district, the Army Chief also said the terrorists, with the onset of winters, have started "moving southwards." They "are now attempting to infiltrate through lower regions including to tunnels across the international border." "With the ongoing situation on our western borders, terrorism continues to be a serious threat, and that is not abating in spite of all the efforts that we have made", the Army chief told reporters at Ezhimala Naval Academy in the district. "They (the terrorists) are making desperate attempts to infiltrate into the Union Territory of J&K, trying to create as much problem as possible and to disrupt normal democratic processes that we cherish," he said. General Naravane was in the Academy to review the Passing out Parade and award medals to meritorious midshipmen and cadets of the Indian Navy at the end of their "Course Completion Ceremony".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/terrorists-making-desperate-attempt-to-disrupt-ddc-polls-in-jammu-and-kashmir-says-army-chief-921123.html

They said the improvised explosive device explosion took place in the Chintalnar forest area of the district at around 9 PM and the injured personnel were evacuated by an IAF helicopter at around midnight. Assistant Commandant Nitin P Bhalerao, 33, succumbed to injuries in the early hours of Sunday. Nine commandos, including the team leader second-in-command rank officer Dinesh Kumar Singh, were injured in the incident, they said. Seven commandos are being treated at a hospital in Raipur, while two are being given medical care at a unit hospital at Chintalnar, located in the south Bastar area of the state, they said. Sukma district is located at a distance of about 400 km from here. The injured troops belong to the 206th battalion of the Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA). A joint team of the CoBRA and local police was out for an area domination exercise when the blast took place, the officials said. The team was scouting the area for the proposed induction of some new battalions of the Central Reserve Police Force and establishment of their new camps in this area and that is when the IED went off, official sources said. Five more CRPF battalions are expected to be inducted in Chhattisgarh for anti-Maoist duties after the Union home ministry recently gave its approval. CRPF director general A P Maheshwari, who took a morning flight from Delhi to reach Raipur, laid a wreath and paid tributes to the officer at a force camp here. "CRPF stands shoulder to shoulder with the family. The sacrifice won't go waste. We would carry forward the mission with more vigour and synergy and not let adversaries succeed in their dastardly acts," he said on his Twitter handle. Bhalerao, a resident of Nashik in Maharashtra, was a decorated commando and had been adjudged the best in various combat competitions, a senior officer of the force said. He joined the CRPF in 2010 and had come to CoBRA last year. He is survived by his mother, wife and a six-year-old daughter, they said. His mortal remains will be taken by an aircraft that is expected to land in Nashik this evening, a CRPF spokesperson said. The CoBRA was raised by the CRPF in 2009 as a special guerrilla combat commando unit for undertaking anti-Naxal operations as well as combating insurgents in the northeast.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/cobra-officer-killed-9-commandos-injured-in-ied-blast-triggered-by-naxals-in-chhattisgarh-921193.html

In Delhi, the average minimum temperature for the month of November is 12.9 degrees Celsius. From November 1 to November 29, the city has recorded a mean minimum temperature of 10.3 degrees Celsius, which is the lowest in at least a decade, according to IMD data. The mean minimum temperature was 15 degrees Celsius last year, 13.4 degrees Celsius in 2018 and 12.8 degrees Celsius in 2017 and 2016. On Sunday, Delhi recorded a minimum of 7 degrees Celsius. This is the seventh day this month that the minimum temperature remained below 10 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature is likely to settle around 7 degrees Celsius on Monday as well, according to IMD. On November 23, Delhi recorded a minimum of 6.3 degrees Celsius -- its lowest minimum temperature in the month since November 2003, when the city recorded a minimum of 6.1 degrees Celsius, according to Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre. The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degrees Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover on most days, according to IMD officials. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground. The month of October was the coldest in 58 years in the national capital. The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-set-to-record-coldest-november-in-at-least-a-decade-imd-data-921202.html

29-11-2020||North and Central||Madhya Pradesh loses 26 tigers in 2020; government says birth rate more than deaths||Madhya Pradesh, which is known as the 'tiger state' of India, has lost 26 striped animals so far this year, as per the National Tiger Conservation Authority. Reacting to it, Madhya Pradesh Forest Minister Vijay Shah told PTI that the average death rate of tigers was less compared to their birth rate in the state in last six years. According to the National Tiger Conservation Authoritys (NTCA) website, out of the 26 tiger deaths reported since April this year, MP lost 21 felines inside the tiger reserves, including 10 in the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve. No tiger death was reported in the first three months of this year, as per the data. In 2019, the state lost 28 tigers while three cases of seizures of body parts due to poaching were also reported. Karnataka, which is on the second position in the number of tigers in the country, registered eight deaths and two seizures of tiger body parts this year, as per the data. The southern state lost 12 big cats last year. "Right now, MP has 124 tiger cubs. The cubs were not counted during the last census (in 2018). In the next count, we are going to have more than 600 tigers," Shah said. "We have more tigers than the area for them. Take the example of Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve-it has 125 tigers whereas it has the territory to house only 90," he said. The minister attributed the big number of tiger deaths in Bandhavgarh to the territorial fight among the big cats for space and dominance. Earlier, MP had lost the 'tiger state' tag to Karnataka in the all India tiger estimation exercise for 2010, primarily due to alleged poaching in the Panna Tiger Reserve. That time, MP had 257 tigers compared to 300 in Karnataka. In the 2014 tiger census, MP slipped to no.3 position in the country with 308 striped animals after Uttarakhand (340) and Karnataka (408). However, MP regained the tag in the 2018 census with 526 big cats, two more than in Karnataka. Wildlife activist Ajay Dubey said Madhya Pradesh lacks a special tiger protection force. "We have filed a petition in the high court for the formation of the special force which is pending. Karnataka has such a special force, thus tigers there are protected," he said. The Centre in 2006 asked states to form the special force and offered to bear its expenditure, but MP has not formed it, he noted. Karnataka has five tiger reserves and the number of striped animals there (as per the last count) was just two less than Madhya Pradesh, which has around six tiger reserves. "MP should learn from this," he said. A tiger was allegedly killed and buried in Shahdol district earlier this month, he said, noting that some people have been arrested in the case. The recovery of a severed tiger head in the Panna Tiger Reserve last month suggests that poachers are operating in the wildlife areas, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/madhya-pradesh-loses-26-tigers-in-2020-government-says-birth-rate-more-than-deaths-921209.html
29-11-2020||North and Central||Farmers' march: Protesters stay put at borders, to decide on future course of action||After spending another night in cold, thousands of farmers continued to protest against the Centre's new agri laws on the fourth consecutive day on Sunday staying put at the Singhu and Tikri border points, with farmer leaders deliberating upon their future course of action about proposed talks with the government. With many roads and entry points being blocked, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had appealed to the farmers to shift to the Burari ground and said the Centre was ready to hold discussions with them as soon as they move to the designated place. A delegation of the farmers has been invited for a discussion on December 3, he said, adding that now that some of their unions have demanded that talks be held immediately, the central government is ready to do so as soon as the protesters shift to the ground in Burari. "There is a crucial meeting today to decide future course of action. We will stay put till then and decide accordingly. In any situation, we will not call off the protest till our demands are met," Brij Singh, one of the farmers at Singhu border said. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has also termed Shah's offer to hold discussions at the earliest as the best in the interest of the farming community and the nation at large. On Saturday, he had urged the farmers to accept the appeal and shift to the designated place for their protest. The farmers have come prepared for a long haul, their vehicles loaded with rations, utensils, quilts and blankets for the cold and equipped with even charging points for their phones. After a restive Friday that saw police using teargas shells, water cannons and multi-layer barriers to block the protesters and some farmers pelting stones and breaking barricades in their determination to push through as part of their 'Delhi Chalo' march, Saturday was quiet. But the tension persisted with restless crowds milling around the city's edges and beyond and settling down from another night out in the cold.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-march-protesters-stay-put-at-borders-to-decide-on-future-course-of-action-921225.html
29-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality remains 'poor'; likely to deteriorate further||Delhi's air quality remained "poor" on Sunday and is likely to deteriorate further amid a dip in the mercury and the wind speed. The city's air quality index (AQI) was 245 at 9 am. The 24-hour average was 231 on Saturday, 137 on Friday, 302 on Thursday and 413 on Wednesday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". The maximum wind speed was 15 kmph on Saturday. It is likely to be 8 to 12 kmph on Sunday and Monday, according to the India Meteorological Department. Winds are predicted to slow down on Sunday. Therefore, Delhi's air quality is likely to deteriorate further and remain in the "poor" to "very poor" category over the next two days, it said. The minimum temperature was 7 degrees Celsius on Sunday and the maximum is predicted to settle around 26 degrees Celsius, the weather department said. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. The share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution has also reduced significantly as the harvesting season has ended. The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring states to Delhi's PM2.5 levels was 4 percent on Saturday, 2 per cent on Friday and just 1 per cent on Thursday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-remains-poor-likely-to-deteriorate-further-921234.html
29-11-2020||North and Central||New farm laws have begun mitigating farmers' problems in short span of time: PM Modi||Amid ongoing protests by a section of farmers against new farm laws, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday asserted that these agriculture reforms have not only freed peasants from various shackles but have also bestowed on them new rights and opportunities. Addressing his monthly Mann Ki Baat radio programme, Modi said the recent agriculture reforms have begun mitigating the troubles of farmers in a short span of time as he cited the example of a Maharashtra farmer who used the provisions of the new laws to get the money promised to him by a trader. "Since ages, these demands of farmers which at one point of time or the other all political parties had promised to them, have now been fulfilled. After deep deliberations, Parliament recently passed farm reform laws," he said. "These reforms have not only freed the farmers from various shackles, but have also given them new rights and opportunities. In such a short span of time, these rights have started reducing the problems of farmers," he said. His remarks come at a time when thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, have dug in their heels at Delhi's border points and hundreds have gathered at the city's Burari ground, united in their determination to hold protests against the new farm laws. In his radio broadcast, Modi touched upon various other topics ranging from the idol of goddess Annapurna, stolen in 1913 from Varanasi, being brought back to India from Canada, to emphasising that educational institutions should harness the strengths and talents of their alumni. Remembering Guru Nanak Dev, whose birth anniversary is on Monday, Modi lauded his noble ideals and added that he considered himself to be fortunate for his involvement in various works related to Sikh gurus and gurudwaras. He also hailed the opening of the Kartarpur Sahib corridor in November last year as historic. In his remarks, Modi also talked about a gurudwara in Kutch, which is considered very sacred and special. In the broadcast, he remembered the work of Dr Salim Ali, an Indian ornithologist and naturalist. "There are many clubs and societies that are passionate about bird watching. I hope you all discover more about them," Modi said. The culture of India is gaining popularity all over the world, he noted. "One such effort is by Jonas Masetti, who is based in Brazil and popularises Vedanta as well as the Gita among people there. He uses technology effectively to popularise our culture and ethos," Modi said. The prime minister also lauded Gaurav Sharma, the MP for Hamilton West, New Zealand, for taking his oath of office in Sanskrit.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/new-farm-laws-have-begun-mitigating-farmers-problems-in-short-span-of-time-pm-modi-921237.html

According to police sources, the case was registered on Saturday based on the complaint of parents of a girl, a resident of a village under Deorania police station in the district. Police said that the parents of the girl alleged that a Muslim youth, who also hailed from the same village, had been trying to 'force' the girl to convert and 'marry' him. The youth, identified as Uvaish, who was a classmate of the girl, also threatened her parents with serious consequences if they did not allow their daughter to convert and marry him. Police said that the parents, fearing that Uvaish might 'kidnap' their daughter, got her married elsewhere. ''Uvaish, however, continued to stalk her and even threatened to shoot us and also her in-laws,'' the father of the girl alleged. ''We have registered a case under the new law and the matter is being investigated,'' said a senior police official in Bareilly.  Police said that the accused was absconding. The new law provided for a maximum imprisonment of ten years and also a fine for religious conversion through deceit, force, allurement or any other fraudulent means or for the purpose of marriage.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/uttar-pradesh-registers-first-case-under-anti-conversion-law-in-bareilly-district-921240.html
29-11-2020||North and Central||Security alert along border after drone movement in Jammu and Kashmir||A security alert has been issued after the fresh movement of a drone from the direction of Pakistan on Saturday evening along the International Border (IB) in Arnia sector of Jammu on Sunday. Officials said that the Border Security Forces (BSF) noticed the movement of a drone along the IB in the Arnia sector. “The drone was chased by the BSF personnel but it retreated towards Pakistani side,” they said and added a security alert was issued and searches were launched in the area. This is not the first incident of a drone being spotted along the IB or the Line of Control (LoC). On November 21, a drone movement was noticed in the Mendhar sector along the LoC amid a surge in ceasefire violations by the Pakistani Army. A day earlier, two drones were spotted from the direction of Pakistan and crossed the IB in the Samba sector. On October 24, a surveillance drone of Chinese make was shot down by the Army shortly after it crossed into this side of the LoC in north Kashmir’s Kupwara district. In June, an attempt to drop weapons through drones was scuttled by BSF personnel when they shot down a Hexa-copter along the International border in Kathua district. Sources said Pakistan is using drones to airdrop weapons along the LoC and the IB in its desperate measures to sustain militancy and create unrest in Jammu and Kashmir. “The dropping of weapons through drones is a big challenge for security agencies as in hilly terrain drones just bypass the deployment of the force,” they added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/security-alert-along-border-after-drone-movement-in-jammu-and-kashmir-921243.html
29-11-2020||North and Central||Farmers defiant against reform as Modi tries to calm anger||Thousands of Indian farmers, angry over reform of the agriculture sector, held a third day of protests on the outskirts of the capital on Sunday, blocking roads into the city and defying a government appeal to move to a designated site. The government on Saturday invited farmers' union leaders for talks on new legislation to deregulate agricultural but that has not calmed farmers' anger over what many see "anti-farm laws", and their action appeared to be spreading. "We will stay put here today," said Rakesh Tikait, spokesman of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, one of more than 30 protesting unions, as he and his members blocked a road on the eastern approaches to Delhi. The farmers object to legislation introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in September that would let farmers sell their produce anywhere, including to big corporate buyers like Walmart, not just at government-regulated wholesale markets where growers are assured of a minimum price. Small growers worry they will be left vulnerable to big business and could eventually lose price support for staples such as wheat and rice. Modi sought to allay farmers' concerns on Sunday. "From these reforms, farmers will get new rights and opportunities," he said in his monthly radio address. But one farm union leader said many protesters were demanding that the government withdraw the laws. "The farmers' leaders will meet later on Sunday to decide their response to the government," he said, referring to the government's call for talks. The protests began with farmers from the northern states of Haryana and Punjab on the outskirts of New Delhi on Friday, when police fired tear gas and water cannon in a bid to disperse them. But instead farmers from the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh joined in over the weekend, blocking roads to the east of the capital. Media reported protests by farmers in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala on Saturday. Prices of fresh produce prices at wholesale markets in the city began to tick up and commuters have faced travel disruption.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-defiant-against-reform-as-modi-tries-to-calm-anger-921248.html
29-11-2020||North and Central||BJP releases manifesto in Urdu for DDC polls in Kashmir||The BJP on Sunday released its election manifesto in Urdu for the ongoing District Development Council (DDC) polls in Kashmir. Former MLC Vibhod Gupta released the manifesto in presence of senior party leaders from the Valley such as Sofi Yosuf and Darakhshan Abdrabi. The manifesto claims that while the BJP has unified the country by abrogating provisions of Article 370 and Article 35A that provided special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration – an amalgam of several mainstream political parties, including NC and PDP – was working against the national interest for vote bank politics. It further says that after reorganisation, Jammu and Kashmir has been put on a track of development and peace. The party claimed that stone-pelting was ended and terrorism was being dealt with an iron hand. In the manifesto, the BJP also claimed credit for reserving 100 per cent of government jobs in the union territory for its residents only and framing a policy that will spur industrialisation. The party said it has launched a war against corruption and land grabbing in the union territory. It has said basic amenities like electricity, water supply and road networks in the union territory have been improved as well. The BJP also claimed credit for doing away with SRO-202, a policy brought in by the PDP-BJP government in 2015 under which newly recruited government employees in Jammu and Kashmir were paid a paltry remuneration for seven years before being paid full salary. The first round of polling in the eight-phase maiden DDC elections was held on Saturday. This is the first electoral exercise in Jammu and Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370 last year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bjp-releases-manifesto-in-urdu-for-ddc-polls-in-kashmir-921269.html
29-11-2020||North and Central||Farmers' protest: Five leaders at the forefront of the agitation||As protests continue for the third straight day on the borders of Delhi, farmers have relentlessly agitated demanding the government withdraw the new farm laws implemented in September.  Farmers from mostly Punjab and Haryana marched to Delhi where they were met with water cannons and tear gas from Delhi and Haryana police but have stayed put at the capital’s border. The protestors include a number of groups that look out for the interest of the farmers.  Jagmohan Singh (64) He is the General Secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda) and one of the most active farmer leaders in Punjab. Owner of 5-acre farming land, he became a full-time activist three decades ago and is the go-to person for farming issues and policies.  In 1993, he left his government job in the Department of Cooperatives and joined Bharti Kisan Ekta (BKU). A postgraduate and diploma holder, he is an expert in acupuncture therapy and is able to dedicate all his time to activism because his wife has a job in the postal department. Gurnam Singh Chaduni (64) Known for his unique ways of protesting (like throwing potatoes on the state highway), farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni, is one of the first to have started mobilising farmers against the newly passed farm laws. He led a successful agitation in 2008 for farm loan waiver. In 2019, he and other farmers climbed an eighty-feet water-tank demanding that the state purchase their sunflower crop. He came down only after the government agreed to purchase the entire produce. Mahinder Singh (50) Mahinder Singh has 18 cases against him in connection with farmer protests such as rail roko, jail bharo. A farm activist for 23 years and a farmer himself, he has dedicated his life to farmer activism. He and his two brothers farm in a 21-acre-land in Bhiani Bagh, Mansa district, Punjab. Satnam Singh Pannu (65) A staunch opposer of the farm laws, President of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangarsh Committee continued protesting on the tracks near Amritsar even after other groups called off their dharnas. The committee formed in 2000 is active in 10 districts of Punjab and welcomes both farmers and farm labourers.  Bhupinder Singh Longowal (35) Representing the younger generation, Longowal has reeled in youth in the ongoing protests. With a postgraduate in Political Science, he has been a farmer activist since his student days and has been a member of Punjab Students Union. He later joined Kirti Kisan Union. As a small farmer with 2 acres of land and a family debt of 7.5 lakh, he is dedicated to the farmers’ cause.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-protest-five-leaders-at-the-forefront-of-the-agitation-921279.html
29-11-2020||North and Central||MP: Farmers dump guavas in garbage vehicle as prices crash||A video showing a group of farmers dumping freshly-harvested guavas into a civic garbage collection vehicle here has gone viral on social media, with the experts saying that a bumper crop of the fruit this year has resulted in its prices falling. The wholesale prices of this vitamin C-rich fruit at Devi Ahilya Bai Holkar Fruit and Vegetable Market in Indore currently ranges between Rs 4 and Rs 10 per kilo, sources in the market said on Sunday. Farm sector experts said the prices of guava have nosedived due to its abundant crop, which is ultimately causing losses to the cultivators. Due to the falling prices, disappointed farmers are leaving behind the fruits in the market after finding that they are not getting enough returns. The farmers know that transporting the fruits back was not beneficial due to the costs involved, they added. Talking to PTI, Rajesh Patel, who grows this fruit in Madhya Pradesh's Ratlam district, said, "The bumper guava harvest in Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and other states has sent its prices crashing." The wholesale market of guava in Delhi, which supplies this fruit to the northern part of the country, has been hit hard due to the coronavirus situation there, he said. Country guavas perish in three-four day after being plucked, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/mp-farmers-dump-guavas-in-garbage-vehicle-as-prices-crash-921285.html
29-11-2020||North and Central||HIV positive person can't be prosecuted for attempt to murder for having intercourse: Delhi HC||An HIV positive person cannot be prosecuted for an offence of attempt to murder, if he had sexual intercourse with a woman with or without her consent, the Delhi High Court has held. A bench of Justice Vibhu Bakhru set aside the conviction of a man under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC but upheld his conviction under Section 376 for raping his stepdaughter. In cases of sexual assault or rape, the court said it is widely accepted that the HIV positive status of the offender is an aggravating factor to be considered while sentencing the convict. The court, however, said this reasoning is persuasive and cannot be faulted that unprotected sexual engagement by an HIV positive person, aware of the nature of his disease, can be termed as a negligent act, which he knows is likely to spread the infection of a disease that endangers life, and is thus, liable to be punished under Section 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the IPC.  The court said that the assumption that penetrative sexual assault would in all probability lead to transmission of the disease, which would result in the death of a healthy partner, is not established.  "In the facts of the present case, no evidence whatsoever was led to establish the probability of the prosecutrix being transmitted the said disease," the court pointed out, adding even the police did not invoke charges under Section 307 but the trial court went ahead to hold the man guilty. The court further said, "the decision of the trial court is largely based on surmises and impressions, without analysis of any scientific data to assume that sexual intercourse by an HIV positive patient would in all probability lead to the demise of his partner." It also said most countries that do not have specific laws to prosecute offences relating to HIV but try such offenders under their pre-existing laws. The person, who is inflicted with the said disease, does suffer bodily harm and if the act is done recklessly and with mal-intent.  "In certain cases where an HIV positive person fails to disclose his status and engages in any sexual activity, he or she may be prosecuted for sexual assault as in such cases, the consent of the other person to engage in sexual intercourse is vitiated and the sexual act can be construed as one without consent," the court said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hiv-positive-person-cant-be-prosecuted-for-attempt-to-murder-for-having-intercourse-delhi-hc-921287.html
29-11-2020||North and Central||North India likely to have harsher winter: IMD||North India is likely to expect a harsher winter and the possibility of cold waves occurring could be more this season, India Meteorological Department (IMD) Director General Mrutunjay Mohapatra said on Sunday. The IMD, in its winter forecast for December to February, said below normal minimum temperatures are likely over north and central India. "The winter is likely to be harsher in north India this season. The probability of occurrence of cold waves is more," Mohapatra said. He added that the night temperatures in north India are likely to be below normal, while the day temperatures are expected to be above normal. The west coast and south India are likely to witness above normal minimum temperatures.  "During the upcoming winter season (December to February), below normal minimum temperatures are likely over most subdivisions of north, northwest, central and few subdivisions over east India," the IMD said in its winter forecast. Scores of people die every year due to cold waves that sweep across the north Indian plains.  In a webinar last month, Mohapatra had hinted that winter could be more severe this season due to the prevailing La Nina, a phenomenon associated with the cooling of Pacific waters and an antithesis to El Nino.  "Currently, Sea Surface Temperatures are below normal over central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and moderate La Niña conditions are prevailing over the equatorial Pacific Ocean. "The latest forecast indicates that the moderate La Niña conditions are likely to continue at least till the end of winter season," the IMD said.  The IMD started issuing winter forecasts from 2016. This is probably the first time that the country's weather agency has said the winter will be severe. The forecast for previous years had predicted warmer winters.  The country also recorded above normal rainfall this year and an extended monsoon season. One of the reasons cited for this is the La Nina phenomenon. Mohapatra said parts of north India have recorded breaking low temperatures in October.  The IMD has four meteorological divisions – northwest India, south peninsula, east and northeast India and central India. The northwest division comprises states of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.  Central India covers a vast stretch with states like Gujarat, Goa, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha while the southern peninsula division encompasses all the southern states and Union Territory of Puducherry.  The east and northeast India division comprises Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and all the northeastern states.  "Most of the subdivisions of northeast India, few subdivisions of west coast and south peninsular India are likely to experience above normal minimum temperatures. "The probability forecast for maximum temperature indicates that above normal maximum temperatures are likely over most subdivisions of northwest, north, east and northeast India and a few subdivisions of central and peninsular India. Most of the subdivisions of south peninsular India are likely to experience below normal maximum temperatures," the IMD added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/north-india-likely-to-have-harsher-winter-imd-921291.html
29-11-2020||North and Central||Deliberate attempts on to vitiate peaceful atmosphere in Jammu region: J&K Muslim activists||Several Muslim activists, including a former bureaucrat, of Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday alleged that "some elements" are making deliberate attempts to harm the communal harmony of the union territory's Jammu region and sought the intervention of Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha. Though they did not identify the "elements" but claimed that their attempts intensified after the announcement of the District Development Council (DDC) polls, the first elections after Jammu and Kashmir was reorganised into a union territory last year. Former bureaucrat Khalid Hussain and advocate Sheikh Shakeel Ahmad at a press conference said that Muslims of the Jammu region are nationalist to the core and do not need a certificate from anyone to prove their nationalism. "Deliberate attempts are being made by some elements to vitiate the peaceful atmosphere of Jammu (region) by peddling lies about Muslims being land grabbers even as the fact of the matter is that there are only a handful of Muslims who have availed land under the Roshni Act," Hussain said. The Jammu and Kashmir High Court last month had ordered a CBI probe into an alleged scam in the Roshni land scheme, following which the union territory administration said it would annul all actions taken, cancel mutations and retrieve the entire land in six months. Since then, the Jammu and Kashmir administration has released lists of those who have either illegally availed land under the Roshni Act, popularly referred to as the Roshni land scheme, or encroached state land. Prominent members of the community such as businessman Javed Iqbal, social worker Abdul Majid and Bathindi sarpanch Hafizullah were also present at the press conference, among others. Hussain, who is a former deputy commissioner, alleged that there are "elements who are spreading hatred against Muslims by accusing them of trying to change the demography of Jammu". "My family is living in Jammu for generations and so are the others who are present here (at the presser)… Gujjars and Bakerwals have rendered numerous sacrifices and helped the security agencies to ensure that terrorism is uprooted from the Jammu region," he said. "The lieutenant governor must invite all communities for a discussion on the issue to clear any misgiving among the locals," Hussain said. During the press conference, Ahmad said that "there are certain elements that are playing politics to divide the people and they became hyperactive after the government announced the DDC elections." He also spoke about protests that had taken place in Bathindi, and said that security personnel should be deployed in strength in Bathindi, Chuwadi, Sunjiwan and Gujjar Nagar areas of the (Jammu) city as the minority community is feeling "oppressed and depressed". Ahmad highlighted the need for maintaining communal harmony and brotherhood by all citizens of Jammu.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/deliberate-attempts-on-to-vitiate-peaceful-atmosphere-in-jammu-region-jk-muslim-activists-921320.html
29-11-2020||North and Central||Elections no solution to Kashmir problem: Mehbooba Mufti||PDP president Mehbooba Mufti on Sunday said elections are no solution to the Kashmir problem and called for a dialogue between India and Pakistan to address the issue. She also accused the BJP-led government at the Centre of “murdering the democracy” in the name of District Development Council (DDC) polls as alliance candidates were being confined to homes while others enjoyed full freedom to campaign. "Election is no solution to the Kashmir problem. There should be a dialogue between the two countries. If we are talking to China, which has taken our land, why not with Pakistan? Is it about being a Muslim country because everything is communal now?" Mehbooba told reporters at her Gupkar residence. The former chief minister was not allowed to address a press conference on Friday after police prevented her from visiting PDP youth chief Waheed Para's residence in Pulwama district following his arrest over alleged connections with Hizbul Mujahideen. Asked about the significance of Saturday's poll percentage, Mehbooba said poll percentages have been huge before also, but that is not a solution to the Kashmir issue. "India has around nine lakh security forces here. Which other state has so much of security forces in the civilian areas? If (abrogation of) Article 370 has resolved all issues, why is the army still stationed in Kashmir? They should have gone to the border. "Participation in elections has no bearing on the Kashmir issue. It is there and it will be there as long as it is not resolved through dialogue with Pakistan and the people of Kashmir," she said. The PDP chief said the alliance candidates were not allowed to freely campaign for the DDC polls. "Our people do not have security. They have been confined to their homes and not allowed to run poll campaign while BJP candidates are freely roaming around. This is not done? Will this country run on the BJP's agenda? "They tell us not to talk about Article 370. BJP ministers visit Kashmir and nine out of 10 times, they talk about the revocation of Article 370. I fail to understand that when they are confident that Article 370 is gone and will not be restored, why do they get rattled so much when I speak about it," she said. Mehbooba said there was no freedom to talk about issues. "Whosoever tries to raise voice is booked under UAPA. There is no greater a peace-loving person than Waheed, but he has been booked under the UAPA. This is very unfortunate what is happening here," she said. Referring to her house arrest on Friday, Mehbooba said fiction was being portrayed as reality in Kashmir. "It is unfortunate that after I was detained, the Election Commission and other officers said I was not under detention. It tells you what is happening in J&K, what is fiction and what is reality. Fiction is portrayed as reality and reality is not shown," the PDP chief said. She said the repression has increased in J&K since "we decided to contest the polls". "They have made a joke of democracy. There is andha kanoon (blind law) across the country. Muslims are dubbed as Pakistanis, Sikhs as Khalistanis, activists as urban Naxals, students, including girls, as anti-nationals. Women protests are also termed anti-nationals. I want to ask BJP that if everyone is anti-national and terrorist, then who is Hindustani in this country? Only BJP? They are dividing this country like anything,” she said. On the Roshni issue, Mehbooba said it was not a scam but a scheme for the poor. “The real scam is the electoral bonds. Let them investigate it. If BJP is so serious about the land grab issue, it should go after big fish, not the poor who have not even five marlas of land in their possessions. Notices are being sent to the poor. One such notice is with me,” she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/elections-no-solution-to-kashmir-problem-mehbooba-mufti-921324.html
29-11-2020||North and Central||Gupkar gang leaders on mission to loot and bleed J&K: UT's BJP chief||Accusing the PAGD and its leaders of being on a mission to “destroy, loot and bleed” Jammu and Kashmir, J&K BJP chief Ravinder Raina on Sunday asserted that the people of the Union Territory have rejected them. Alleging that the Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration leaders have “only sucked the blood of commoners for the last 70 years”, Raina claimed there is a wave in favour of the BJP in the ongoing district development council polls. The chief of the BJP’s UT unit made the assertions shortly after PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, in a news conference in Srinagar, said the elections are no solution to the Kashmir problem and batted for dialogue between India and Pakistan to resolve it. “The people of J&K have rejected Mehbooba, Farooq Abdullah and other leaders of the Gupkar gang in the ongoing district development council polls as there is a wave in the favour of BJP in every nook and corner,” Raina said in a video message, hitting back at the PDP president. “Mehbooba and other leaders like her are worried as they have been rejected by the people,” he added. “The only mission of Mehbooba, Farooq and other leaders of the Gupkar gang is to destroy, loot and bleed J&K but we will not allow this to happen anymore. Anyone who betrays the nation will find himself behind the bars,” he said. Dubbing PAGD leaders as “political crocodiles”, Raina recalled some the alliance leaders’ alleged statements praising China and Pakistan, and asserted that the people of J&K are nationalist with India and the tricolour in their heart. “Mehbooba and the likes of her have been praising China and Pakistan. But those who are praising Pakistan are feeling the pain when they see the youths holding the tricolour,” said Raina. “They are political crocodiles who have encroached thousands of kanals of land but (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi has unveiled their black deeds before the public,” he added. Alleging that PAGD leaders only “sucked the blood of commoners for the last 70 years”, he said, “They have suppressed the people and are worried when they see the people getting their legitimate rights, justice and are happy under the Modi government.” “These Gupkarians are worried which we can understand very well,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/gupkar-gang-leaders-on-mission-to-loot-and-bleed-jk-uts-bjp-chief-921340.html

The Aam Aadmi Party has supported the farmer's protest and its national convenor Kejriwal asked the Centre to immediately meet the farmers. "The central government should talk to farmers immediately (and) unconditionally," he said in a tweet. केंद्र सरकार किसानों से तुरंत बिना शर्त बात करे। At a press conference on Sunday, senior AAP leader and chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said his party believes that Home Minister Amit Shah has shown "utter irresponsibility" by leaving Delhi to campaign for Hyderabad municipal elections when lakhs of farmers were waiting at the Delhi border to talk to him. Bhardwaj said that on one hand, Amit Shah was telling farmers that coronavirus cases might increase due to their protest and on the other, he was claiming that in his Hyderabad roadshow there was massive public participation which shows "no social distancing was maintained". "The Aam Aadmi Party believes that this is the utter hypocrisy of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and we condemn such irresponsible act. The Aam Aadmi Party believes that such a home minister is very dangerous for India," he said. "In this serious situation, the Home Minister of our country is not in Delhi but in Hyderabad and he is holding a press conference regarding the issues related to Hyderabad municipality. The Home Minister of our country is doing an election campaign for the councillors of Hyderabad and taking out massive roadshows. He is talking about Hyderabad city's waterlogging problem and the problems of potholes," Bhardwaj said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/centre-should-hold-talks-with-farmers-immediately-unconditionally-arvind-kejriwal-921344.html

29-11-2020||North and Central||'Delhi Chalo': Protesting farmers reject 'conditional' dialogue; threaten to block all entry points to city's borders||Rejecting the Centre's offer to hold talks once they move to the Burari ground, the farmers who are protesting at Delhi's borders for four days against the new farm laws on Sunday said they will not accept any conditional dialogue and threatened to block all five entry points to the national capital. As the standoff showed no signs of easing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi again batted for the new laws in his monthly radio address, saying these reforms have given the farmers “new rights and opportunities” and have started mitigating their problems in a short span of time. The Home Ministry too assured the farmers' organisations that a high-level team of Union Ministers will talk to them once the protesters move to the designated site. A meeting of over 30 farmer groups was held to discuss Union Minister Amit Shah’s offer for talks before the scheduled date of December 3 once they move to Burari in the city, but the thousands of protesters refused to budge and prepared for spending another night in the cold at the Singhu and Tikri border points. Their representatives said Shah’s condition that they shift the protest is not acceptable and claimed Burari ground is an "open jail". Opposition parties too pressed the government to initiate an unconditional dialogue with the farmers. "The condition laid down by Home Minister Amit Shah is not acceptable to us. We will not hold any conditional talks. We reject the government's offer. The blockade will not end. We will block all five entry point to Delhi," Surjeet S Phul, Bhartiya Kisan Union's Punjab president, told reporters. "The condition put for talks is an insult to farmers. We will never go to Burari. It is not a park but an open jail," he added. Gurnam Singh Chadhoni, Haryana unit president for the Bhartiya Kisan Union, said they were ready to talk "but will not accept any condition now". Farmers who had reached Nirankarai Samagam Ground in Burari on Saturday also continued their protest there. Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla in a letter to 32 farmers organisations sent on Saturday cited the cold conditions and the Covid-19 outbreak and said the farmers should move to the Burari ground where adequate facilities have been made for them. "As soon as you shift to the ground at Burari, the very next day a high-level committee of union ministers will hold talks at Vigyan Bhavan with the representatives of all farmers unions, with whom dialogue had taken place earlier,” he said in the letter. Union Home Minister Amit Shah had on Saturday said that a delegation of the farmers has been invited for a discussion on December 3 but as some of their unions have demanded that talks should be held immediately, the central government is ready to do so as soon as the protesters shift to the ground in Burari. The central government has reached out to the farmers underscoring its willingness to hold talks with them. It has also asserted that concerns expressed by some farm bodies about the new laws are misplaced, asserting that existing support measures like the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and state-run 'mandis' will remain in place. In his monthly 'Mann Ki Baat' broadcast, Prime Minister Modi said "correct information, away from rumours and confusion of any kind" is a big strength for people in any field, as he spoke about a couple of farmers involved with innovative practices in the field. "The demands, which were made by farmers for years and regarding which every political party at some point of time had made promises, have been fulfilled... These reforms have not only freed them of various shackles but also given them new rights and new opportunities. These rights have begun mitigating farmers' problems in a very short span of time," he said on the new farm laws. Farmer leaders, however, claimed that more protesters will join them from Haryana and Punjab. Several Khaps or caste councils from Haryana have extended support to the farmers' ongoing protest and will march towards the national capital, Independent MLA from Haryana's Dadri constituency Sombir Sangwan, who also heads the 'Sangwan Khap', told PTI over phone. Raising slogans against the government, the farmers staged protests amid heavy police presence on the Delhi borders. The Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee (DSGMC) provided food to the agitating farmers. A war of words has also broken out between Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar over the movement of protesting farmers to Delhi. Singh and his Congress party have supported the farmers’ agitation and criticised the Khattar government which had tried to stop the protesters from crossing the BJP-ruled Haryana to enter Delhi. Khattar said on Sunday he would hold Amarinder Singh responsible if farmers' gathering on the state's borders with Delhi leads to an aggravation of the COVID-19 situation in the state. He alleged that it was programme sponsored by the Congress and the Punjab government. The Congress, which has been targeting the government over the farm laws issue, said the insistence on support to the legislations shows that the government is "drunk with power". "Those who are still defending the black farm laws, what solution will they find in favour of farmers?" party leader Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi, adding that, "Ab hogi (now there will be) #KisaanKiBaat". Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal asked the Centre to immediately and unconditionally hold talks with the farmers. BJP’s former ally Shiv Sena said farmers protesting against the Centre's new agri laws are being treated as if they are "terrorists", and it is sad that they are not being allowed to enter Delhi. The government should consider the farmers' demands sympathetically, Sena MP Sanjay Raut said. The protesting farmers have come prepared for a long haul, their vehicles loaded with rations, utensils, quilts and blankets for the cold and equipped with even charging points for their phones. "In any situation, we will not call off the protest till our demands are met," Brij Singh, one of the farmers at Singhu border, said. Gaurav Sharma, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer North), said they are allowing vehicles carrying food and other necessities for farmers to pass. "Burari DDA ground has already been designated as the protest site and when they want to move, we will be facilitating their movement," he said. On Friday, police used teargas shells, water cannons and multi-layer barriers to block the protesters. Some protesters pelted stones and broke barricades. No untoward incident was reported on Saturday and Sunday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-chalo-protesting-farmers-reject-conditional-dialogue-threaten-to-block-all-entry-points-to-citys-borders-921375.html
29-11-2020||North and Central||BJP government has no sympathy for farmers, only worried about corporates: Akhilesh Yadav on 'Delhi Chalo'||Hitting out at Uttar Pradesh chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday alleged that developmental works have stalled and the farmers were feeling agitated while the state government has its "head bowed down before criminals". "Instead of discharging constitutional duties, his (Adityanath's) mind is more engaged in going to other states as a star campaigner (for polls) and changing the name of cities," a statement issued by the Samajwadi Party quoted Yadav as saying. Addressing a rally for Hyderabad municipal elections, Adityanath on Saturday said that if Faizabad and Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh can become Ayodhya and Prayagraj Hyderabad can again become 'Bhagyanagar'. The Samajwadi Party chief claimed the BJP government does not care for the farmers. "The government does not have any sympathy for the farmers. It is only worried about the corporate houses and how to fill their coffers and hold hostage the resources of the state," Yadav said. "Insulting farmers by calling them terrorists shows the narrow mindset of the BJP. The BJP, which favours the rich, is conspiring to mortgage farms, farming, small business, trading, roads, transportation and everything else to the rich," he said. If farmers are terrorists for the BJP, the BJP leaders and workers should pledge not to consume the food grown by them, Yadav added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bjp-government-has-no-sympathy-for-farmers-only-worried-about-corporates-akhilesh-yadav-on-delhi-chalo-921395.html

It also put all the 20 districts, 10 each in Kashmir and Jammu regions, in the ‘orange ‘category but said the Lakhanpur -- the gateway to J&K bordering Punjab on National highway 44 -- with a buffer of 500-metre radius and the Jawahar Tunnel, which connects Kashmir with the Jammu region, on either side have been classified as ‘red ‘zones. “All schools, colleges, higher educational institutions (including anganwadi centres) etc will continue to remain closed till December 31, except training institutions run by the central and state government, “read an order issued by Chief Secretary and Chairperson, State Executive Committee, B V R Subrahmanyam. The order was issued Sunday evening after a detailed review of the current Covid situation in Jammu and Kashmir for regulating activities within the Union Territory for effective containment of the infection. “No fresh permission or passes are required for activities which were already permitted under earlier orders. All instructions relating to safety, health precautions and social distancing continue to apply,” the order said. However, the order said the coaching centres, institutions would be permitted to run classes, outside the containment zones only, with up to 50 per cent capacity of the centres, strictly as per the SOP issued by the union ministry of education.

29-11-2020||Opinion||We can’t stay out of trade arrangements like RCEP forever||When one door closes, another opens,” is an adage good enough as a philosophical outlook, but in international relations that’s not always true. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement (RCEP) door is closed for India. Or rather, New Delhi closed the door to the 15-member trade body on itself. India’s presence would have added 1.3 billion people more to the world’s largest trade arrangement, but it will still represent more than two billion people and account for about 30% of global trade. The RCEP countries are also part of other regional and global trade and non-trade blocks. Ten of the 15 are also members of the ASEAN, trading with India under the ASEAN–India Free Trade Area Agreement. India also has a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Japan and Australia, who are also part of the four-member Quad with India and the US, and who play major roles in the emerging Indo-Pacific architecture. India has a flourishing bilateral trade with South Korea, guided by the successful CEPA with that country since 2009. A month before the global lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic, an India-New Zealand bilateral trade agreement was in its final stages of negotiation. India’s faith and confidence in the time-tested bilateral trade paradigm, increasingly through Free Trade pacts, seems to be one of the main reasons New Delhi chose not to rush into RCEP. It would be fair to expect the trade negotiators to take stock of the situation and weigh the pros and cons of giving up or compromising on the terms and conditions of FTAs with existing trade partners for the sake of a much wider but uncharted multilateral trade avenue. On the flip side, it should be noted that India has a $24 billion trade deficit with the ASEAN countries and unresolved trade-related differences, which if resolved can take the trade to over $300 billion. The reality is that all these FTAs put together have not been able to accrue the advantage of export revenues to Indian industries due to a number of reasons, including business-unfriendly regulations from the government besides stiff competition from China and other emerging economies. Although bilateral FTAs have increased trade in volume, trade under FTAs and with ASEAN has resulted in enormous deficit, too. If India had joined RCEP, this trade deficit would have reached a level over $93 billion. With tariff reduction and other conditionalities, the trade situation would have turned to our disadvantage, seriously impacting local industry and the MSME sector. India’s decision not to join the RCEP for now, therefore, seems to be largely motivated by New Delhi’s apprehensions on mounting trade deficits with RCEP countries. And the 800-pound gorilla of trade deficits is the one with China, which is estimated to be $48.66 billion in 2020, down from over $50 billion in pre-Covid years. Indeed, one of the reasons advanced by India for opting out of the RCEP was its inability to withdraw or even lower tariff in some or all of the areas as it would result in dumping by the Chinese. This, at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic is being blamed on China and the ongoing stand-off in Ladakh has vitiated the atmosphere. But China, on the other hand, has committed to scrapping tariffs in goods and services where it has a competitive edge. But this should be seen in perspective: For one, China is engaged in and wants to focus on capacity-building in some key and relevant industries of the future, such as electric vehicles, defence ancillaries, etc. It has been granted a 16-year grace period to reap the long-term benefits of these industries before allowing tariff reduction in them. By the end of that period, China would have squeezed every possible advantage to grow its indigenous industry. If China could negotiate for a long-term grace period, there is no reason why New Delhi could not have bargained for a similar concession. One can only believe that our negotiators did their best but failed to secure concessions. It is intriguing that the uneasiness over the not-so-peaceful rise of China, which ideally should have goaded our Quad partners Australia and Japan to keep out of the RCEP, seems to have had little effect on these countries. Their economic considerations seem to have prevailed over the collective strategic objectives of some of the countries in the Indo-Pacific. Will this be interpreted as a substantial diplomatic victory for China? Will China, the largest economy in the RCEP, link the flagship Belt and Road Initiative with RCEP and be able to draw more countries into its economic and strategic orbit? The strengthening of the view that RCEP is a China-led project will serve very little purpose for India in the ongoing perception battle. In the emerging world order, decentralised supply chain mechanisms and free and open trade regimes will get increasingly integrated with strategic objectives and security considerations. India needs to play this game smartly. To begin with, New Delhi may have to encourage and support the fledgling CPTPP and work on the idea of an Indo-Pacific trade platform, anchored on democratic principles of collective growth as against China’s hegemonic approach. Meanwhile, while it may not be prudent for India to decouple national security considerations and economic advantages of RCEP, the Prime Minister’s Atmanirbhar Abhiyan will have to be put on a fast track, ease of business indices improved, indigenous manufacturing and exports should be encouraged to get equipped for an entry into RCEP or other trade arrangements from a position of strength.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/we-can-t-stay-out-of-trade-arrangements-like-rcep-forever-921105.html
29-11-2020||Opinion||Monetising public and private spaces||IT is everywhere, and the euphoria IT has generated in the Indian populace is palpable. After all, who could argue against more well-paying white-collar jobs at MNCs, a plethora of cheap consumer goods on Walmart/Flipkart and Amazon, instant Facebook/WhatsApp communication with family and friends, free medical advice, Uber/Ola rides and Airbnb accommodations? Well, I for one would be very concerned about the rapid erosion of commonly held distinctions between what is public versus what is private. Public as in public spaces such as schools, stadiums and streets, parks and playgrounds. Private as in private spaces such as your home, your car and motorcycle, and your body and brain expressed through movement, emotions and thought processes. Both types of spaces are being assaulted on a scale, the likes of which we have not witnessed before. All in the name of more jobs, efficiency, convenience and security. Municipalities bend over backwards to attract IT companies by offering cheap land and taxpayer-subsidised incentives but very often these same companies leave town when the subsidies run out. This type of company behaviour is nothing new. For example, any number of special export zones (SEZ) have been set up in the past by many small countries in South East Asia to attract investment and boost exports, only to be shut down when the foreign companies left after taking advantage of all the benefits that SEZs had to offer. In most countries, information in the public domain include mundane things such births, deaths, court proceedings involving convictions and bankruptcies, property transactions, and motor vehicle registrations. Much of this data is available freely on the internet. However, private companies, the so-called data brokers, package this information and sell it to the general public. The packaged information is rarely vetted for correctness or completeness. What was public has now been monetised by private parties. With the advent of ride-sharing companies such as Uber and Ola, private vehicles are made available to the general public, but a significant portion of the revenue goes to these private companies. The consequences of increased congestion on the roadways and the resulting pollution, and the impact on mass transit, have been blithely ignored. In a similar vein, search engines and social media such as Google and Facebook take the general public’s web activities such as surfing, emailing and private postings and sell them to private companies for advertisement purposes. What was private has now been monetised by private parties. In the case of accommodation-sharing companies such as Airbnb, what was private, i.e., one’s home, has now been made public but the accommodation-sharing company reaps substantial profits. What was private has been made public and monetised by a different private party. If you are sitting on a valuable piece of real estate and have it expropriated by the government under eminent domain laws for the ‘greater common good’, only to learn later that the property has been sold off to developers for commercial purposes, you would be furious, I am sure. A transaction which can be best described as private (you) to public (government), and then back to another private (commercial developer). Over and above all this, when data breaches of companies and government entities occur, and such breaches do occur on a fairly regular basis, what was private ends up becoming public and sold to the highest bidder. Private musings on diverse issues such as politics or religion either get posted on the internet or held for ransom and blackmail. What had been private has now become public and monetised in many cases. With onset of the coronavirus pandemic, if you have been working from home, dressed or not, using Zoom or whatever teleconferencing facility, your employer, irrespective of whether they are a public or private entity, has successfully intruded into your very private space. Be it meagre or substantial, this space has been made somewhat public for your colleagues to behold. No need to fret since you can see their possessions and accoutrements as well. With the proliferation of surveillance cameras, AI-enabled face recognition algorithms and image databases, even one’s face has been privatised without the face owner’s permission or, more importantly, their awareness that it is happening. IT companies have given a whole new meaning to the concept of public-private partnership. No wonder you hear the phrase ‘a win-win situation’ being bandied about all the time. To quote the 20th century Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Upton Sinclair, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/monetising-public-and-private-spaces-921106.html
29-11-2020||Opinion||Sankhya: Counting on philosophy||It is said that a hunter named Jara accidentally killed Krishna while Krishna was deep in meditation in the forests. Since Jara means “decay” or “aging” in Sanskrit, I speculate that Krishna actually died of old age, meditating in the forests. The Yadava tribes had reached such a state of cultural nadir due to their prosperity that they killed each other in large numbers in a drunken brawl. The Yadavas who survived the carnage dispersed and reached different parts of the Asian sub-continent. These events, albeit mythological, put things in perspective -- the mutability of all discrete things as expounded by the Indian philosophical school, Sankhya. Sankhya is attributed to Kapila (mid-6th century BC), but it is more than likely that Sankhya had roots in the distant past, with several unknown seers contributing to its development. By the time of the Bhagavad Gita (2nd to 4th century BC antiquity), it is theorised that there were at least two Kapilas: One who wrote the original agnostic Sankhya Sutras, and the other whose theistic version of Sankhya is found in the Bhagavad Gita, the mythological conversation between Krishna and Arjuna. Irrespective of the exact date of the founding of the Sankhya school, it is accepted to be the oldest school of Indian philosophical systems. Sankhya has greatly influenced the atheistic viewpoint of Jainism and the agnostic viewpoint of Buddhism. Although not openly acknowledged, it is apparent that the Upanishads are closer to Sankhya rather than the Vedas they are supposed to summarise. Note that neither ethics nor rituals are given any importance in the Sankhya school -- in direct contrast with the Vedic religion and in more contrast with any Western religion. Sankhya is a school of philosophy which teaches discrimination of matter and energy, and of cause and effects. The word Sankhya itself means counting or discriminating. All creation is matter and energy. Matter and energy are neither created nor destroyed and are inert in isolation. Matter is governed by the three gunas (satva, rajas, tamas), which cancel out each other in the absence of energy. When matter and energy come together, consciousness is created. While energy tends to remain unchanged through this union, the balance of the three gunas, which govern matter, is upset. This results in matter undergoing change from its inert state to produce intellect, senses, and action. Intellect, senses, and action are in turn temporary. Matter eventually returns to its inert state. Sankhya does not judge. The guna or quality of satva is illuminating and buoyant, rajas is of love and progress, tamas is the heavy-handed teacher (verse 13 of Sankhya Karika of Ishwara Krishna). All three gunas are required in the right mix to accomplish an outcome. In a corporate setting, I have translated this to create with freedom (satva), nurture with passion (rajas), and change with detachment (tamas). So also, in daily living, prescribing only sattvic ingredients is not, in my opinion, correct. The appropriate mental, food, and exercise choices should be based on the individual and his/her setting. Significant physical and mental harm is done by proponents of ‘sattvic is superior’ and that the rajasic and tamasic qualities are for lesser mortals. Specifically, the goal of Sankhya is to attain the knowledge to discriminate between the self (energy), and the body (matter); the goal is to also understand the cause and effect relationships between the gunas, the intellect, the senses, actions, and final outcomes. This knowledge will liberate the self by virtue of knowing that it is the gunas that cause action, and the results of action are a systemic combination of a multitude of actions from various sources. So, the self develops a detachment from the results. The actions continue since the body is driven by the gunas into action. This is also Krishna’s message in the Bhagavad Gita.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/sankhya-counting-on-philosophy-921107.html
29-11-2020||Opinion||Netflix and chilling effect||As a good sickular libtard, I have taken in a huge amount of Netflix and other OTT platforms since March. That’s where the planet has not screeched to a halt, in which life does not skulk around behind masks and a six-foot distance, in which the breath that keeps us alive does not kill us. But lockdown only threw the lure of a good story into sharper relief — it has always been irresistibly powerful, from the time when we huddled in caves and told stories around the fire to keep the nameless horrors of night at bay. Storytelling, dance, art, music, are atavistic human impulses. Plot, imagination, nuance, humour, beauty, wisdom, truth, that thing about someone else’s journey that finds resonance with your own, as well as that thing about someone else’s journey that you wouldn’t have known otherwise. The most powerful stories reflect some truth, perhaps challenge received wisdom, introduce you to other ways of being, move you. They push the envelope of your own thought and experience. They expand your humanity. That is why art is so often uncomfortable and thrilling, and why we have so many forms of it, whether visual, textual, or performed. That is also why authority and orthodoxy doesn’t like art that challenges its worldview. Modi’s government, always eager to take the country a giant step backwards, wants to bring Netflix and other digital content under government regulation. That’s taking things far beyond the usual individual crank lawsuit. It naturally sets the ground for rank abuse of power targeting some of the best independent journalism and commentary in today’s India (that’s a whole other column). But it also opens storytelling to the censorship of two kinds of powerful bonehead: one whose idea of art and entertainment is a kind of sanitised playpen filled with shiny plastic toys and religious pap; and a second who can whip up “antinational” intentions, religious malice, sedition, or moral depravity in art, and use it to further a political ideology. The furore about a Hindu woman kissing a Muslim man near a temple in A Suitable Boy is less because of a carnal moment in a sacred space, and more because it suits the BJP to push the fabricated idea of “love jihad” to regulate love, whip up hate, divide, and dominate. Censorship does not expand, it limits. It does not protect, it punishes. It does not lift society, it crushes its voices. It’s one thing to have a vigorous debate about art, to dislike and disagree with it. But to clip its wings when it is not physically hurtful to anyone, is to clip spirit and possibility. The Modi government loves ideological and moral policing, and the mere idea of getting embroiled in lawsuits has a chilling effect on creativity. Remember the Tanishq ad? The Supreme Court recently said, of Arnab Goswami, that if you don’t like him, don’t watch him. If that can apply to a news channel whose daily endeavour is to foment social division, that same element of self-preserving choice applies to arts and entertainment. Adults live lives full of grit, imperfection, sex, disagreement, violence, dissent, swearing, pluralism, moral and ethical greyness, and ideological heterogeneity. Art should be free to reflect that, and adults should be free to experience it. Indian audiences have taken to Netflix like ducks to water because while they might also enjoy television and movie theatre releases in which words like ‘ass’ are censored, most adults have an ability—and the right—to watch something in which people swear, or conduct intercaste or interfaith, or non-heteronormative relationships, or plot to overthrow a government, or gamble, without their heads exploding. If the non-paid social media response to the idea of regulating OTT platforms says anything, it is this: Stop infantilising adults.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/netflix-and-chilling-effect-921110.html
29-11-2020||Opinion||A 15-minute post-Covid city||As multiple vaccines move closer to the finish line, the possibility of an end seems finally to be in sight. Year 2020 has been defined by the pandemic, a true annus horribilis. But it has also been a time when the more fortunate have been able to slow down, to work from home, to spend more time with their family, and less time on the road. It would be a sad pity to waste this time of reflection and dive straight back into the hectic, unhealthy frenzy of modern urban life. The C40 Cities, a coalition of cities across the world that includes a few Indian cities – Jaipur, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai and Namma Bengaluru – has an ambitious plan for post-Covid economic recovery in a manner that is more sustainable, climate-friendly and healthy. A key part of this plan is a move towards ’15-minute cities’. This follows the idea that each city should be designed as a mix of self-sufficient neighbourhoods. Within each neighbourhood, at a distance of 15 minutes travel by foot, cycle or bus, people should be able to shop for basic necessities, take and pick up their children from school, visit parks and outdoor spaces, go to the local doctor, and – most importantly – get from home to office. A number of city mayors – prominent amongst them Anne Hidalgo, the Mayor of Paris – have taken the lead on this idea. The city of Paris created 650 km of pop-up cycle lanes which were used in peak Covid-times by people seeking to avoid metro and bus travel. They now plan to make those lanes that people have shown that they prefer the most, i.e. the lanes with maximum cycle traffic, permanent. Along with this, Paris will reduce traffic speeds in cycle-friendly areas to keep the cyclists safe. Paris has also come up with a number of innovative ways to create new public spaces in a crowded city. They have planted trees in 41 large school grounds, opening them to the public after school hours as parks and sports grounds. Inspired by similar experiments, the C40 cities network seeks to create different approaches to public planning that encourage the development of liveable neighbourhoods, allowing the flexible use of spaces – just in the way they have created pop-up cycle lanes and converted schools into multi-use areas. Does this seem impossible for Indian cities? Perhaps. The C40 website shows that Bengaluru, along with Jaipur, is a ‘currently inactive’ member of the coalition. I can’t imagine that Delhi NCR is doing much to transform its urban spaces to make them more liveable, given the soaring levels of air pollution witnessed this winter. But if we look at this another way, much seems possible. Across Indian cities, 60% of all trips are made on foot or cycle, for short distances less than 5 km. Our cities are already 15-minute cities! Especially so for women, most of whom move around the city on foot, as data shows. We don’t realise this because the men and women who make up the 15-minute city are the urban poor, or from low-income families. Just as they are invisible to us, so are they invisible in our plans. Indian cities spend close to half of their transport budget on road-widening and planning for cars, and long commutes. Yet only 15% of the people in our cities usemotorised transport. Bengaluru is one of the worst cities in this regard, with very little spent on making roads safe places for women, children and the elderly to walk. It is no wonder that this city is an inactive member of the C40 coalition! This is a time for serious redesign. Indian cities are much better than European cities in the fact that they are already mixed neighbourhood, residential plus commercial spaces. But we need to plan for the majority of the residents we have, not in ways that will return our city back to a place of choked roads and polluted air.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/a-15-minute-post-covid-city-921111.html
29-11-2020||South||After Central agencies, Kerala CPM leaders are now suspecting state agencies as well||The ruling CPM in Kerala that has so far suspected the central investigation agencies is now mistrusting even the state's own investigation agency, with a section of senior leaders flaying the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) at a state-owned financial institution. Triggering a political row, Kerala Finance Minister T M Thomas Isaac termed the VACB's action as a mad one. This has caused much embarrassment to the government, especially since the VACB is under Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the Kerala State Financial Enterprises, where the raids were carried out by VACB, is under the finance minister. Adding further to the row, another CPM senior leader Anathalavattom Anandan raised suspicions of a conspiracy involving private-sector financial institutions to tarnish the credibility of KSFE by initiating the raids. Many CPM leaders are quite upset since the raids took place at a time when the local body election campaigns are at its peak. The opposition parties have already launched an attack against the government over the issue, citing Isaac's comments about VACB. The fresh development comes close on the heels of Kerala government alleging of a political ploy by Enforcement Directorate and Comptroller and Auditor General. While ED initiated a probe into some flagship projects of the Pinarayi Vijayan government in connection with a probe against gold smuggling accused Swapna Suresh and M Sivasankar, CAG pointed out flaws in Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board. The finance minister said on Sunday that the VACB did not follow the norms for conducting raids at KSFE and it would affect the firm's credibility. "Hence it was a mad act," he said. Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said that the finance minister should clarify who was acting madly. He also said that the finance minister was concerned whether the irregularities would be exposed. "The Vigilance investigation into the irregularities should continue," he said. BJP state president K Surendran said that by flaying the Vigilance action as a mad one, the finance minister is targeting the Chief Minister itself and the state government has now lost faith in own investigation agencies.  He also alleged of corruption in the much-hyped chitty scheme for NRIs initiated by KSFE. KSFE, which is a non-banking finance institution, is mainly into monthly deposit schemes, popularly known as chitty. The raids on Saturday were learnt to be on the basis of complaints of irregularities in the conduct of the monthly deposit scheme. The Vigilance is learnt to have recovered evidence for manipulations in allotting funds on the monthly investment scheme, which is generally done through draw of lots or bidding.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/after-central-agencies-kerala-cpm-leaders-are-now-suspecting-state-agencies-as-well-921259.html
29-11-2020||South||Bhagyalakshmi Temple becomes cynosure of Hyderabad civic poll narrative||The Bhagyalakshmi temple located adjacent to the historic Charminar here became the cynosure during the December 1 Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections with Union Minister Amit Shah offeringprayers after he landed here for the poll campaign. The monument located in the southern part of the city popularly called "old city area" which once considered as communally sensitive given its large population of a particular community. This part of the city is a stronghold of the Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM party. During the beginning of the poll campaign, the State Election Commission ordered the government to stop receiving applications from rain affected people for Rs 10,000 relief. Subsequently there were social media posts suggesting that it was at the behest of the State BJP chief B Sanjay Kumar's letter to the SEC, the aid was stopped. Later, Kumar challenged that the Chief Minister should come to the Bhagyalakshmi temple, saying he is ready to take oath in the name of goddess in the presence of the CM. Subsequently, the BJP leader went to the temple as part of the challenge. TRS leaders alleged that the BJP leader ostensibly took up Bhagyalakshmi Temple as it is located in a communally sensitive area. Political analyst and former MLC Prof Nageshwar said that by frequently visiting the temple the BJP is trying to polarise votes which unfortunately MIM also wants. "The Bhagyalakshmi Temple is a controversial shrine. MIM is also opposing it (the temple) and number two is it is located in the Old City. The BJP wants to create a narrative of Bhagyanagar (for Hindus) versus Hyderabad (for Muslims). BJP does not have any agenda of governance. They just want to polarise votes. MIM does not have alternate agenda of governance. They want to polarise votes," Nageshwar said. Telangana BJPs chief spokesperson Krishna Sagar Rao said it was the TRS which has made an issue out of Sanjay Kumar's visit to the temple in the old city. KTR's repeated mockery of choosing that temple has raised questions in the minds of citizens of Hyderabad, Rao said. "Does Hindus need MIM permission to visit temples in the old city? Will KTR and his father KCR decide which temple our party president should visit? The height of Muslim appeasement by TRS has led to Bhagyanagar Temple becoming the epicenter of this campaign," Rao, told P T I. When asked about Amit Shah's visit to the temple, he said it was to make a statement, that Hindus can't be suppressed or insulted for minority appeasement by parties like TRS. When contacted, a senior leader of MIM said no temple existed at Charminar before 1969. By visiting Bhagyalakshmi Temple, the BJP is trying to polarise voters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/bhagyalakshmi-temple-becomes-cynosure-of-hyderabad-civic-poll-narrative-921274.html

Shah said wherever the BJP has won no communal riots have happened there. Shah, who offered prayers at the Bhagyalakshmi Devi Temple in Old City here, said the people of Hyderabad want good governance and they have belief in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership and the BJP. "The way the people of Telangana have supported Modi ji during the Lok Sabha polls (BJP won four seats from Telangana in 2019 Parliament elections)...I feel the beginning for change has begun and Hyderabad Municipal Corporation is the next stop," Shah told TV news channels, participating in a roadshow in Secunderabad on the last day of campaigning for the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections. Exuding confidence that the BJP's candidate will become Mayor of the city, Shah alleged Hyderabad lacked even basic amenities for the past several years. "...the way Hyderabad was flooded in the recent rains. ...the way encroachments are increasing and growing due to blessings of a party...The people here are angry and upset with TRS and Owaisi's alliance," he alleged. Shah said the presence of a large number of people shows Hyderabad is going to have a BJP Mayor. Asked about allegations by TRS leaders that no central aid was given for relief work in Hyderabad which was hit by heavy rains and flood during October, Shah claimed the Centre has given the maximum amount to Hyderabad. "Water entered houses of 7 lakh people...Where was Shri Owaisi (All India Majilis-e-Ittehadul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi) and Shri KCR (Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao). They were not to be seen. Our party workers, our MPs were among the people to help them out," he said. "Why the water entered the houses was because of the way encroachments were encouraged on Owaisi's behalf. We want to assure the citizens of Hyderabad if BJP wins the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation then all encroachments will be removed and Hyderabad will be made a global IT hub and modern city," Shah added. Polls for GHMC will be held on December 1 and counting of votes will be taken up on December 4.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/people-angry-with-trs-aimim-alliance-when-bjp-won-no-communal-riots-happened-in-hyderabad-claims-amit-shah-921282.html

The actor might convey his thoughts about his political plunge, which seems unlikely if one goes by hints thrown by him in the past few months.  The meeting of district secretaries of Rajini Makkal Mandram will take place at 10 am on Monday at the Raghavendra Kalyana Mandapam owned by the actor. Sources in the actor’s camp told DH that Rajinikanth is likely to have a frank discussion with the district secretaries on his thoughts about his political plunge.  “He will tell them about his plans vis-a-vis his political entry and the current situation owing out of Covid-19. He will also listen to what his fans say because they have stood with him for about 40 years. This is likely to be a frank discussion,” a source said.  “Whether he will convey his decision whether or not to enter politics on Monday is a million-dollar question. Only Rajinikanth can answer that question. But he will open his mind to his fans when he meets them on Monday. This is the sense that we have got,” the source added. The source further said Rajinikanth is also likely to brief his fans about his health condition and the precautions that doctors treating him have told him to take given the pandemic.  Rajinikanth had announced that he will launch a party and contest Assembly polls on the last day of 2017. However, the actor did not take any serious step in the past three years towards building his party and had put the onus on the people to show “resurgence” towards a change for him to launch a party.  The meeting assumes significance as it comes over a month after Rajinikanth dismissed as “fake” a letter doing rounds in his name which talks about him not taking the formal political plunge. However, the actor admitted that the “fake letter” was partially true as things related to his health mentioned in it were “true.” In the statement issued last month, the actor dropped ample hints that he may not take the formal political plunge as doctors have clearly told himself could be vulnerable to catching the Covid-19 infection due to co-morbidities. This was for the first time that the actor admitted that he underwent a renal transplant at a US hospital in 2016. After Rajinikanth issued the statement, RSS ideologue S Gurumurthy met the actor twice and is understood to have prodded him to launch his party or at least give a voice for the BJP in the assembly elections in Tamil Nadu due in 2021. However, the actor is said to be non-committal on supporting any political party in the event of him not launching his own party.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-superstar-rajinikanth-to-meet-fans-on-november-30-to-discuss-politics-921328.html

Kanimozhi is the second DMK leader after youth wing president Udhayanidhi Stalin to tour the state as a prelude to party chief M K Stalin's formal launch of election campaign in January next year. Udhayanidhi launched his campaign last week from Thirukuvalai, the birthplace of his grandfather and late DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi. Titled Vidiyalai Nokki Stalinin Kural (Stalin's Voice Towards A New Dawn), the campaign will take Udhayanidhi, Kanimozhi, and 13 senior leaders of the party across the state to highlight the “failures of the AIADMK Government.” Kanimozhi, one of the most charismatic leaders of the DMK, launched her campaign from Edappadi, from where Palaniswami has been elected to the Tamil Nadu Assembly. After launching her campaign, she tore into the AIADMK dispensation for not “learning anything” from the 2015 floods that swamped the city of Chennai. “Edappadi K Palaniswami has not fulfilled the promises he made to the people of his constituency. Moreover, he has surrendered the rights of Tamil Nadu before the Centre only to save his position,” Kanimozhi said during her campaign. The DMK Lok Sabha MP also accused him of not heeding to the demands of weavers from Salem district on issues related to GST. As part of her campaign, Kanimozhi interacted with farmers and weavers in Salem and Edappadi and met party leaders in the district. The campaign has been devised in a way it sets the tone for Stalin's electioneering, which is expected to begin in January. DMK, which has occupied the Opposition benches in the Tamil Nadu Assembly since 2011, is leaving no stone unturned to win the assembly elections due in the first half of 2021. Four of the five deputy general secretaries – K Ponmudi, I Periyasamy, Subbulakshmi Jagadeesan, and Anthiyur Selvaraj -- MPs Tiruchi N Siva, Dr S Senthilkumar, and Tamizhachi Thangapandian, are some of the prominent leaders who have been made part of the campaign. The leaders will travel in a specially-designed propaganda vehicle and distribute pamphlets that will speak in detail about the “failures of the AIADMK government,” another leader said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kanimozhi-launches-campaign-from-tamil-nadu-cm-palaniswamis-home-constituency-921331.html

Sneha is taking on mainstream political parties by highlighting the lack of development and issues affecting society. For that reason, she is also facing resistance. Sneha, who is contesting from Ward No 36 of Kannur corporation, is a local resident and a familiar figure there. Sneha told DH that it was her own decision to contest the election as an independent candidate as the mainstream political parties are not sincere in addressing the plight of the people. Many houses do not have proper water supply and many houses lack proper approach roads. There are families living in pitiable condition owing to dues in welfare pensions from the government, she said. While seeking votes, Sneha assures the voters that whether or not she wins, she will stand with people for the development of the locality. "I suffered a lot over these years. Hence I can very well understand the sufferings of people," said Sneha. Sneha, who underwent sex reassignment surgery about a year back, said that she faced harassment from workers of mainstream political parties. A section even tried to oppose her candidature citing different names in her election identity card and voter list after she changed the name after the surgery. But she managed to overcome it by proving her identity. Though another transgender person, Sherin Antony, filed nomination to contest in the local body polls in Kochi, it was rejected citing technical issues. Sherin alleged that her name was deliberately removed from the voter's list even though she cast her vote in the last Lok Sabha polls. Of the 2,76,56,579 voters for the local body polls, 282 are from the transgender community.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/lone-transgender-person-in-kerala-local-body-poll-fray-921341.html

This comes days after cyclone Nivar made landfall between Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts in the wee hours of November 26. Even before the state assesses the damages caused by the cyclone, Tamil Nadu will get more rains from November 30. The low-pressure area has been formed over south Andaman sea and adjoining areas of south-east Bay of Bengal and Equatorial Indian Ocean. “It is very likely to concentrate into a depression during the next 36 hours and likely to intensify further thereafter. It is likely to move west-north-westwards and reach near south Tamil Nadu coast around December 2,” Dr N Puviarasan, of the Area Cyclone Warning Centre, Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai, said. He added that light to moderate rain is likely to occur at isolated places over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal area from November 30 to December 2. Earlier, at least four persons lost their lives due to cyclone Nivar but the damage was not as heavy as it was expected due to the wind speeds that the cyclone packed with it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/low-pressure-likely-to-intensify-tamil-nadu-and-puducherry-to-receive-rain-921345.html

The Union Home Minister was the last of the BJP top guns who blazed against the K Chandrasekhar Rao government, leading a roadshow in the city on the final day of campaigning for the Hyderabad corporation elections on Tuesday. The electioneering for the city polls saw an aggressive BJP taking on the TRS-AIMIM, making an unprecedented pitch to the voters along communal lines. While Telangana BJP chief Bandi Sanjay said they would launch “surgical strikes” on the old city to flush out the Rohingyas, illegal immigrants; UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath backed Hyderabad's name change to Bhagyanagar. BJP also alleged that Rohingya refugees have been made voters in the old city. The ruling TRS combated the onslaught by appealing to electors to choose between a peaceful, prosperous city or one suffering in communal strife. On Sunday, Shah replied, “We won't appease nor discriminate against anyone. Sab-ka saath, sab-ki vikas is our motto.” Shah challenged the AIMIM to write to the centre for the eviction of the Rohingyas, illegal Bangladeshis from the old city so that he can act. “The nation knows who takes their side when we debate in Parliament to deport them. They cry and object,” Shah said in reaction to AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi's remarks that “what was the Home minister doing if there are 40,000 Rohingyas in the city as alleged by the BJP.” Shah also dared the TRS-AIMIM to make their alliance public. “We have no problem with your connection with AIMIM, why keep it a secret?” With the BJP's focus on consolidating Hindu votes, the TRS has distanced itself from the AIMIM.   “And where was KCR when Hyderabad was flooded? He did not visit the affected areas when the people were in distress. This is a big question from Hyderabadis which has to be answered by the CM,” Shah said while addressing reporters at the BJP office. Shah who did not make any speeches in his roadshow at Warasiguda in Secunderabad told reporters that the “immense public support witnessed shows BJP is fighting not to increase its seats but will occupy the Mayor seat.” “We do not see an election as small or big. The party calling this Gali ka chunav does not bother to keep the bylanes clean,” Shah said in reference to TRS minister KT Rama Rao's potshots that “BJP has brought Delhi leaders for galli elections.” When asked about KCR's plans to assemble anti-BJP parties one plank and Delhi ideas, Shah, considered the saffron party's chief election strategist, said that KCR is free to roam across the country. “We know what happened to his such efforts in 2019,” Shah said in reference to KCR's non-starter federal front idea. BJP chief JP Nadda and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath were in Hyderabad before Shah. The BJP leaders accused chief minister Rao of running a corrupt, family dominated government and denying Telangana people benefits of the Narendra Modi government schemes.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/let-aimim-ask-for-eviction-of-rohingyas-ill-act-says-union-home-minister-amit-shah-921347.html

The session is expected to be conducted till December 5, but the exact dates will be decided by the Business Advisory Committees of the respective Houses, Legislature sources said. The Question Hour, however, is being dispensed with in both the Council and the Assembly in view of the prevailing Covid-19 situation, though the main opposition Telugu Desam Party has been demanding that it be conducted. Interestingly, at a preparatory meeting on the eve of the Legislature session, both the Chairman of the Council M A Shariff and Assembly Speaker T Seetaram stressed on members' right to raise questions on various issues concerning the people and asked the bureaucrats to furnish answers promptly. The TDP also wants short duration discussions taken up on various issues of public importance like payment of MGNREGP dues, distribution of PM Aawas Yojana houses, new sand policy, installation of meters to agricultural power connections, indiscriminate borrowings by the government, conduct of elections to local bodies and others. The government, however, is coming up with a heavy agenda as it has to replace at least 11 Ordinances, promulgated since August 4, with fresh laws. Also, an amendment to the AP Motor Vehicles Taxation Act is being brought in to enhance various transport taxes. The government is seeking to rake in an additional revenue of Rs 400 crore through this measure. The Government of India returned two crucial Bills, including the Disha Bill for women's protection, earlier passed by the Legislature, suggesting modifications and they need to be enacted afresh for securing the Presidents assent, Legislature sources said. "In all there could be some 15-17 Bills that need to be passed in the winter session," they added. Speaker Seetaram directed the officials concerned to keep all Bills ready on the opening day of the session. But the TDP, which is in a majority in the 58-member Legislative Council, could once again seek to thwart the government's efforts to push through certain legislations. Government Chief Whip G Srikanth Reddy said they were ready to discuss whatever issue the TDP wished to raise in the Legislature. "Its Chandrababu Naidu and his son Lokesh who shied away from discussing peoples problems. But we are prepared because the Jagan Mohan Reddy government distributed Rs 70,000 crore to the people in the times of distress," the Chief Whip pointed out. "We are ready to conduct the session for any number of days, but they should first say how long they are ready to sit," Reddy said, reacting to TDP's demand that the session be conducted for at least 10 days.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/winter-session-of-andhra-legislature-likely-to-be-a-stormy-one-921404.html
29-11-2020||South||BJP centres Hyderabad poll campaign around small disputed shrine at Charminar||A small, disputed shrine contiguous with one of the four iconic minarets of the Charminar has become the cornerstone of the BJP's Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) election campaign. On Sunday, the last day of canvassing for Tuesday's polls, Home Minister Amit Shah's election tour in the city began with an aarti-pooja at the Bhagyalakshmi temple. The party's GHMC electioneering began from here ten days ago, with Telangana BJP Chief Bandi Sanjay's visit. Bandi had invited Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao to take a truth pledge there over the allegation of a letter sent in his name to the election authorities to stop the Rs 10,000 flood relief distribution in the city, as claimed by the TRS leaders. Sanjay, who alleges a nefarious connection between the TRS and the AIMIM, even asked KCR to prove his Hindu credentials by visiting the temple. The temple, dedicated to Goddess Bhagyalakshmi (the one bestowing prosperity), stands across the road from the Mecca Masjid in the communally sensitive old city. The police, a perennial presence here, are deployed in extra numbers, with eyes peeled on Fridays. The BJP's unprecedented focus on the temple now is seen by analysts as the party's attempt to challenge the AIMIM in its bastion, while furthering a communal divide across the city by appealing to the Hindu voters. The Archaeological Survey India, which supervises the Charminar, maintains that the temple is an intrusion on the monument's premises. While there is no documented evidence to show that the shrine is older than six decades, BJP leaders claim it is at least 200 years old. Some Hindu groups say the temple site predates Charminar which was built in 1591. The AIMIM, led by Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi, has made its opposition to the Hindu shrine and its expansion public several times in the past. In November 2012, when the temple management restored the roof as per the Andhra Pradesh High Court orders, the party legislators had gathered in protest. The MLAs' arrest and sporadic violent acts had then kept the old city tense for a few days. Last November, during the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case verdict in the Supreme Court, Owaisi, reacting to a question, wondered if the “ASI under the BJP government can take action” on the disputed Bhagyalakshmi temple site. While ordering against further expansion of the temple, the HC had earlier reportedly asked for status-quo maintenance at the site. Devotee darshans and daily rituals go on.  This November, the temple is in the political spotlight. The Telangana BJP blames the ruling TRS for making the Bhagyalakshmi temple an election issue. “TRS leaders, including KT Rama Rao, questioned why Bandi went to the old city temple when there are several famous shrines in the city. Do Hindus need KTR or CM KCR or the AIMIM's permission to visit a temple?” questions Krishna Saagar Rao, Telangana BJP's chief spokesperson. “The TRS which has failed in city's administration is now selling fear to the voters, making baseless charges of the BJP attempting communal disturbances,” Rao told DH. On Sunday, Home Minister Amit Shah said he went to the temple “to pay respects to the goddess as per my faith, nothing else.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/bjp-centres-hyderabad-poll-campaign-around-small-disputed-shrine-at-charminar-921407.html

Tamil Nadu Fisheries Minister D Jayakumar said in view of the forecast, steps have been taken by the government for the safe return of 200 plus Tamil Nadu boats -engaged in deep sea fishing- with the help of Coast Guard, who have also been provided with the location of the vessels. Of the total 218 boats, eight have returned safely, he said. Authorities in Kerala, Karnataka, Goa and Lakshadweep have been requested to allow Tamil Nadu boats in their fishing harbours and to render them assistance, the Minister said. The low pressure area on Saturday over south Andaman sea and adjoining areas of southeast Bay of Bengal has organised into a well marked low pressure area, the Regional Meteorological Centre here said. An updated RMC bulletin said the well-marked low-pressure area "is very likely to concentrate into a depression during next 24 hours and likely to intensify further thereafter. It is likely to move west northwestwards and reach near south Tamil Nadu coast around December 2." Under the influence of the system, light to moderate rainfall or thundershower is likely over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal starting from Sunday and it could continue upto December 3 in the state and till December 1 in the regions falling under the union territory. The showers, in such regions, starting with isolated places, could extend to many areas and then spread to most places during the next four days, the bulletin said. On December 1, heavy to very heavy rain is likely to occur at isolated places over Tirunelveli, Tuticorin and Kanyakumari districts. The next day, southern districts including Tirunelvei and Ramanathapuram could experience extremely heavy showers and the following day, heavy rainfall is likely over the same regions. The IMD tweeted, "Scattered to widespread rainfall activity very likely over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry & Karaikal, Kerala & Mahe, Lakshadweep, south coastal Andhra Pradesh and south Rayalaseema during 01st-03rd December, 2020." Also, the department said, "Isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall with moderate thunderstorm & lightning very likely over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry & Karaikal during December 1-3 and isolated extremely rainfall likely over south Tamil Nadu and south Kerala on 02nd December 2020." In Kerala, a red alert has been sounded for Idukki district on Wednesday and fishermen restrained from putting out to sea from the midnight of November 30. An Orange alert has been issued for Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Pathanamthitta districts on December 2 anda yellow alert for Alappuzha, Kottayam and Ernakulam districts on the same day. Red alert indicates heavy to very heavy rainfall of over 20 cm in 24 hours,an Orange alert (6 cm to 20 cm) and yellow alert (6-11 cm). Jayakumar said a virtual meeting of fisheries officials of south Tamil Nadu was held and they were also advised to contact the fishermen involved in deep sea fishing through means like satellite phones to coordinate their safe return to nearest locations. Control rooms at Kanyakumari and Tuticorin districts (04651-226235 and 04612320458 respectively) and at the headquarters here (044-29530392) are functional 24 x 7, the Minister said in a statement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/rains-likely-in-tamil-nadu-kerala-coastal-andhra-pradesh-low-pressure-to-become-depression-soon-921414.html

Sources from KSEEB told DH that they have received instructions from the Department of Primary and Secondary Education to prepare the time table. “The minister for primary and secondary education is likely to convene a meeting in this regard in a day or two,” the sources said. The instruction came as a surprise for the KSEEB officials as there is still no clarity over reopening of schools amid rising complaints about online classes. “There are discussions to increase the multiple-choice questions for board exams this year, considering the absence of offline classes. The direction to prepare the time table was a surprise for us also,” the sources said. The timetable is likely to be announced in the third week of December. However, officials of KSEEB refused to reveal details about the same.  The school managements have demanded that the department provide the final syllabus, after deducting portions from it, considering the current situation. “The syllabus needs to be reduced considering the current scenario. About 30% has already been cut and there is a need to reduce it further,” said D Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka. “The online classes are not effective and there is no attendance monitoring tool, no clarity about the reach in rural areas and among government school kids. When this is the scenario, how can we conduct exams based on online classes?” Kumar said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/sslc-exam-time-table-may-be-out-in-december-921143.html

The MBBS exams were scheduled to be held in the month of January 2021, but following the directions from the National Medical Commission (NMC) and also demand from students, the university has postponed the exams. Speaking to DH, Dr S Sachidananda, vice-chancellor of the university, said that while the first year examinations will be held in February as scheduled, the second, third and fourth year examinations, scheduled in January, will be held in March and April. “This was done as per the orders by the National Medical Commission,” he said. The students had demanded the postponement of exams. Medical and dental colleges are set to reopen in the state on December 1. As the students will get less time for practical classes and hands-on experience in the medical colleges, the postponement was seen as necessary. A survey, conducted by All-India Democratic Students Organisation Medical Students’ Struggle Committee which reached around 9,500 MBBS students in Karnataka, showed that 97.6% of the respondents were not ready to appear for the examination in January. The absence of offline classes, it was opined, will make it difficult for students to face the exams. RGUHS officials had told DH that they had planned examination in January to save academic days. “We had announced the time table to conduct exams in the month of January to save some academic days, at least a month, for the next academic year,” said a senior official. It is yet to be seen how the first year MBBS students will respond to the university’s decision to go ahead with the examination in January.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/medical-dental-exams-postponed-by-2-months-at-rajiv-gandhi-university-of-health-sciences-921144.html

The court said that the Commission has no jurisdiction to entertain petitions seeking restoration of the land and also cannot play the role of an appellate authority. Justice M Nagaprasanna observed this while passing the order in a petition filed questioning the proceedings initiated by the Commission for resumption of land. The petitioner Ganganna and another person Jayappa H (one of the respondents in the petition before the High Court) were involved in long-standing legal proceedings over a particular land in Shivamogga district. In the recent proceedings initiated by the assistant commissioner, it was held that both were grantees of land and also held that there was no violation of the provisions of Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands) Act. Instead of approaching the appropriate forum, Jayappa had moved the Commission for the restoration of land in his favour without even making Ganganna a party. Though Ganganna filed an application to implead in the proceedings, the Commission went ahead with the proceedings to restore the land without passing any order. Ganganna moved the high court challenging the proceedings initiated by the Commission. The court held that under the provisions of Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands) Act, the authority empowered to entertain an appeal against the order passed by the assistant commissioner is the deputy commissioner. The court also said that though the Commission has powers of a civil court under Section 10 of the Karnataka State Commission for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act, 2002, it is for the welfare and protection of the SC/ST. "A reading of the provisions would lead to an unmistakable interpretation that the functions entrusted to the Commission are in the nature of investigation and examination of various safeguards provided to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The provisions of the Act do not clothe the Commission with such powers to entertain the petition that is filed by a grantee seeking restoration of land and investigate into the matter," the court said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/sc/st-panel-has-no-powers-to-restore-land-rules-karnataka-hc-921147.html

Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) officials said sculptors from Chennai, who arrived on November 23, stayed in the village and repaired the idol. “CCTV cameras will be installed in the temple and it will be opened for visitors, in a fortnight,” they said. Some treasure hunters had entered the 800-year-old temple by breaking open the door and had damaged the idol. The incident had come to light on November 20. It is suspected that the idol was damaged when the miscreants tried to lift it from the pedestal while searching for a treasure. A priest used to leave the temple after puja, every day, and it was taken care of by the ASI. There was none to guard the temple, during the night.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mahakali-idol-of-hassan-s-hoysala-era-temple-restored-921148.html

Congress party, because of issues like leadership void, anti-people policies, compromise with nationalistic interests, has become irrelevant in politics. He said the BJP government is committed on the Gram Swaraj concept, by according more powers and implementing decentralisation effectively. The Congress has failed to implement Gram Swaraj and decentralisation of system, effectively. The BJP is keen on emerging stronger from the panchayat to the national-level. Every party worker should work in an organised way and strengthen party units in villages by being in close contact with villagers. “We want BJP-backed candidates to win GP elections by 100% and help in the concept of Gram Swaraj from the GP-level to Lok Sabha,” DyCM said. “Efforts will be made to inform people about the welfare programmes, achievements of Centre and State governments through Gram Swaraj conventions,” he said. He said owing to the tough stand taken by the prime minister, Pakistan remained isolated and imports from China was reduced. To a query on NEP (National Education Policy), Dr Ashwath Narayan said reforms will be introduced in the education sector. The formal education will begin at the age of three instead of six years. It has given scope for flexibility and decentralisation. “More autonomy, financial empowerment will be given for universities and educational institutions. Decentralisation will be the focus area in higher education. A structured reforms will be launched in the form of curriculum to improve quality of education,” he said. BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel said the gram panchayat elections in Karnataka will not give any place for ‘Operation Kamala’ as the BJP-supported candidates will win at least 80% of the total gram panchayat seats. BJP district president Sudarshan Moodbidri, Kolar MP Muniswamy, MCC Mayor Diwakar, MLAs Vedavyasa Kamath, Dr Bharath Shetty, Umanath Kotian, MLC Prathap Simha Nayak, Mahila Morcha state president Geetha Vivekananand, among others, were present.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/bjp-committed-to-congress-mukt-villages-gram-swaraj-karnataka-dycm-921214.html

Staging a protest against MDA, Vatal Nagaraj and supporters blocked the Mysuru-Bengaluru Highway, at Columbia Asia Hospital junction, in the city, on Sunday. The Police took him into custody and cleared the traffic. Nagaraj alleged that Yediyurappa is not only stubborn but also illusory. The CM planned MDA to lure voters in Basavakalyan region, which has 40,000 Maratha voters, he commented. Yediyurappa never concentrated on developing the land of Basavanna, the social reformer. The Kannadigas at Talawadi, on Karnataka-Tamil-Nadu border and Kasaragod, Karnataka-Kerala border, are facing difficulties. But, the CM never bothered to resolve their issues. Now, he is playing a drama of including the Veerashaiva-Lingayats community in the central OBC list. “Why Bharat Ratna was not conferred on late Shivakumara Swami of Siddaganga Mutt in Tumakuru? Why Basavanna statue was not installed?", he asked. However, Nagaraj refused to react to the statements of MLA M P Renukacharya and Basavanagouda Yatnal. Dec 5 bandh Nagaraj said, more than 1,500 organisations have assured to extend support to the Karnataka bandh called on December 5, against the establishment of MDA. He also urged JD(S) and Congress to extend support to the bandh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/vatal-nagaraj-opposes-mda-blocks-highway-921382.html

Speaking to reporters after visiting the monuments in Srirangapatna taluk, he said, “A section of the people have been eyeing Tipu Sultan with suspicious eyes, because he belongs to Islam religion. They have been lying that the Tipu had killed around 90,000 Hindus in Kodagu. Besides, they have been claiming him as traitor, after the government started celebrating Tipu Jayanti from 2015. Tipu, who was once hailed as the ‘Tiger of Mysuru’ is now seen as a Muslim”, he said. “If Tipu had been a Hindu, the same people would have demanded a ‘Bharat Ratna’ for him. Tipu should be seen as a ruler of that period. A British author, who was a part of the Anglo-Mysuru war had registered the facts about Tipu Sultan. Some have been demanding that Muslims be sent to Pakistan. These are not good developments”, he lamented.

As per estimates, a total of 2 lakh out of the 2.28 lakh applicants appeared for the exam in all three slots, each spanning two hours. ‘No surprises’ Amid the Covid pandemic, CAT-2020 took off on a good note, addressing the students’ apprehensions positively. Most of the students expressed happiness that the test did not have any surprise pertaining to the number of questions and level of difficulty.  An examination official said, “Following a change in the number of slots and reduction in the duration of the exam, many students had expected a change in the pattern. The number of questions in the exam was reduced, although not exactly in proportion to the reduced duration of the exam. The usual 100 questions format was reduced to 76.”  Philip Thomas, product head at TIME Bengaluru, reviewed the paper as easy compared to previous years. “The first section, VRC, was as tough as last year while quants and verbal ability sections were comparatively easier. Maybe due to Covid, the sections were kept at a level where someone with a basic understanding could also solve a couple of questions. This could make the cut-off go higher,” he said. A student said, “The overall difficulty level of the section was high. There were a total of four sets of reading comprehension. Compared to last year, this section was tough. Two passages were moderate and two were difficult. Questions were not straightforward as they were based on inference.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/smooth-sail-for-cat-moderately-difficult-say-students-921447.html

Most of those who defected are seen as loyal to Yediyurappa as they joined the BJP based on his assurance that their interests would be safeguarded.  It is said that the group expressed displeasure with the behaviour of Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi. Jarkiholi, who was one among 17 rebels who defected to help the BJP come to power, spent a few days in Delhi and is learnt to have lobbied for the inclusion of MLC C P Yogeeshwar into the Cabinet.  This has left a section of “native” BJP MLAs fuming, leading to a “native vs migrants” narrative within the BJP.  Also, Jarkiholi’s moves made it look like he had the ‘migrants’ support, which could send a wrong signal and put Yediyurappa in a spot, it was discussed at the meet.  Further, it is said that MLCs M T B Nagaraj and H Vishwanath made their disgruntlement clear.  Jarkiholi said he wanted “all those who made sacrifices to help the BJP come to power” to be made ministers. “I have never claimed leadership of the group. I have always said ‘we’ and not ‘me’,” he said. Asked about the Friday night meeting, he said: “Such meetings should happen only in the party’s office and with the CM.”  Jarkiholi, upon returning from Delhi, met Yediyurappa. He said he discussed department works. Yogeeshwar said many were “troubled” with his political growth.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/bjp-s-migrants-huddle-in-show-of-support-for-karnataka-cm-bs-yediyurappa-921126.html

"I knew about this two months ago. Santhosh had given some ‘personal’ video to one MLC and a minister," claimed Shivakumar, the KPCC president, a day after the sensational incident. "That video reached Delhi leaders in the last 1-2 days through this MLC and minister, because of which Santhosh was feeling low." Shivakumar said the incident needed to be "probed". "There are secrets and the CM himself was being blackmailed by that MLC and the minister. This is all I know," he said. Santhosh was hospitalised on Friday evening allegedly due to an overdose of sleeping pills. He is currently recuperating. The police have registered a suo motu case against him and are waiting for the doctor's green signal to question him.  It is being said that the so-called video had something to do with Yediyurappa’s family. The ruling BJP said the government would order a probe if Shivakumar handed over the mysterious video or prove his claims.   "A probe will be carried out if Shivakumar hands over the video clip," Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said. Rural Development & Panchayat Raj Minister K S Eshwarappa was more blunt. "If Shivakumar knew about this, why didn’t he prevent (Santhosh) from taking his own life? Was he waiting for him to die? He should either release the video, or name the MLC and minister instead of indulging in low-level politics," he said.  Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, who was in Delhi along with MLC C P Yogeeshwar, was quick to keep distance from the video story. "I know nothing about this,” he said. When pointed out that he was the one minister in Delhi over the last few days, as insinuated by Shivakumar, he said: “I wasn’t the only one. (Revenue Minister) R Ashoka was there, too. We Belagavi people don’t do all this. We’re straightforward.”  Apparently, Yediyurappa was angry with Santhosh over the video allegation, and that he was misusing his access to pressurise officials. Santhosh was asked to quit as the CM’s political secretary before November 26. It is also said that there were family issues, but Santhosh’s wife Jahnavi denied this.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/dk-shivakumar-talks-video-after-santhosh-suicide-bid-921134.html

Santosh was rushed to a private hospital after he attempted suicide by consuming calmpose tablets on Friday night, giving rise to speculations. Though B S Yediyurappa expressed shock over the incident, the Congress raked up the issue again saying a detailed probe was a must. "Being the Congress state unit president, can I turn a blind eye to it? I have to tell the people of Karnataka. I have said that there should be an investigation and the Home Minister (Basavaraj Bommai) has also said that he would get the matter investigated," state Congress Chief D K Shivakumar told reporters in Udupi. Hinting that all was not well with the ruling BJP, Shivakumar said the media advisor to the CM, Mahadeva Prakash had resigned recently and the new development has come to fore. "The political secretary is not an ordinary pedestrian or a party worker. He is a political secretary. His name was emerging on many occasions, Shivakumar, the Kanakapura Congress MLA, said. He added that Santosh's name had surfaced at the time of the fall of the coalition government led by Congress and the JD(S) in mid-2019 and the formation of the BJP government subsequently. Shivakumar claimed that no one committed suicide for the heck of it, especially the one who has got such a position. He underlined that Santosh was not under any debts. "His (Santosh's) wife says there was nothing wrong in the family and cites politics as the reason behind the incident. What politics she is referring to? Shouldn't people know this?" Shivakumar asked. BJP state chief Nalin Kumar Kateel slammed the KPCC President for 'playing politics' at the expense of someone's life. "It doesn't look good to play politics at the expense of someone's life. Instead of consoling the person, the Congress leaders are playing with a life," said Kateel. He said if Shivakumar respects law then he should cooperate with the CBI. Kateel was referring to the CBI probe into D K Shivakumar's disproportionate assets case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/congress-demands-fair-probe-into-suicide-bid-by-karnataka-cms-secretary-n-r-santosh-921329.html

The six seats include three Graduates' constituencies, two Teachers' constituencies and one Local Bodies' seat. While the polling is scheduled for December 1, the counting would be held on December 3. For Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray, who heads the tri-party alliance, it is a litmus test while for BJP it is a prestige issue. However, Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis and his counterpart in Council Pravin Darekar and state BJP President Chandrakant Patil are leaving no stones unturned. The polls are being held at a time when the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government has just completed one year in office amid mounting problems of Covid-19 pandemic and fiscal management. Thackeray and his friend-turned-bete noire are engaged in a bitter war of words – with both firing salvos at each other. The six seats are Pune Division Graduates’ Constituency, Nagpur Division Graduates’ Constituency, Aurangabad Division Graduates’ Constituency, Amravati Division Teachers’ Constituency, Pune Division Teachers’  Constituency and Dhule-Nandurbar Local Bodies’ Constituency. While BJP is contesting all the six seats, the Sharad Pawar-led NCP  is contesting two seats and Congress three and Shiv Sena one seat. It needs to be mentioned that the Dhule-Nandurbar polls were to be held on 1 April, however, it was postponed in the wake of the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic and the Lockdown. The fight here is between Amrish Patel (BJP) and Abhijeet Patil (Congress). Patel, who was earlier a Congress legislator had switched over to the BJP. A politician, educationist and social worker, Patel hails from the family of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first Deputy Prime Minister. On the other hand, three MLCs from Graduates’ constituencies — Satish Chavan (NCP), Chandrakant Patil (BJP) and Anil Sole (BJP) while two MLCs from Teachers’ constituencies — Shrikant Deshpande (Independent) and Dattratray Sawant (Independent) retired on 19 July – and now with the Unlock having started the polls are being held.

Swamy, 83, who is suffering from various health issues including Parkinson's disease, was arrested on October 8 and has been lodged at the Taloja prison near here in Navi Mumbai. Talking to PTI, a senior prison official said the allegation that prison authorities were not providing sipper and straw to Swamy were "baseless". "Not just sipper and straw, we are providing him other facilities too like wheelchair, walking stick, walker, and two attendants were also provided to him," the official said. "We know he is a patient, he suffers from Parkinson's disease. Why would we not provide him things which he requires?" the official said. Meanwhile, some Delhi-based lawyers have also sent straws and sippers for the activist in a parcel along with a letter to the Taloja prison on Saturday. "As lawyers, we were pained by the situation as all jail manuals provide for special facilities for inmates who have special needs," said Nandita Rao, one of the advocates who have signed the letter sent to the jail. "We felt if someone does not even have a right to dignified drinking water in judicial custody, then the basic values of our Constitution and humanity are being disrespected," she added. Swamy had earlier filed a plea in a special NIA court here, seeking that he be provided a straw and a sipper. The court on Thursday rejected his previous application seeking a direction to the National Investigation Agency to return the straw and sipper allegedly seized from him during the arrest. Swamy had said he needs a straw and sipper as he has trouble eating and drinking because his hands shake due to the Parkinson's disease. On Thursday, the National Investigation Agency, which is probing the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links' case, denied that it had confiscated Swamy's straw and sipper. Swamy's lawyer Sharif Shaikh then filed a fresh application to obtain these things, besides winter clothing. The activist on Thursday also filed a bail plea in the special NIA court. As per the NIA, Swamy was involved in the activities of the banned CPI (Maoist), and had received funds through an associate for furthering Maoist agenda. He was also the convener of the Persecuted Prisoners Solidarity Committee (PPSC), a frontal organisation of the CPI(Maoist), the NIA claimed. Swamy in his bail plea denied the allegations and said that the prosecution had failed to bring on record any evidence.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/we-are-providing-sipper-straw-to-stan-swamy-taloja-prison-authorities-921252.html

In 2018, when the BJP-Shiv Sena government was in power, the Maharashtra legislature had unanimously resolved to provide 16 per cent reservation in jobs and education. The Bombay High Court had upheld the decision but asked the state government to ensure that the quota does not exceed 12 per cent in employment and 13 per cent in admission in educational institutions. The Supreme Court had stayed the law in Maharashtra that provided for reservation to the Maratha community under the specially-created Socially & Economically Backward Class (SEBC). Talking to reporters, Bhosale, a former NCP MP, targetted Pawar. “During the Mandal Commission implementation, the Maratha community was overlooked. The party which ruled the state during the period overlooked the problems faced by the community, ‘’ he said in a veiled attack on Pawar, who headed the Congress government. “All communities except Marathas were given reservations during the Mandal Commission implementation. The people who trusted you and voted you to power will pull you down,’’ Bhosale said. He also expressed surprise over how during the recent Supreme Court hearing, the state government’s counsel was absent. “The state government lawyer doesn’t attend the hearing on a date given by the Supreme Court and the people in government have no answer...he is paid for it from tax-payers' money....and he remains absent?  The community will react to such tactics,’’ he said, in a reference to Thackeray. “(Then chief minister and now Leader of Opposition) Devendra Fadnavis took initiative and enacted a law to give quota to Marathas. Now you are in power why are you not taking the issue ahead,’’ he asked.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/chhatrapati-shivaji-s-descendent-targets-thackeray-pawar-over-maratha-quota-921290.html
29-11-2020||West||MVA govt is completely 'anti-Vidarbha', alleges former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis||BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday accused the MVA government in Maharashtra of being "anti-Vidarbha" and neglecting the region by not providing funds for its development. The only development works underway in the Vidarbha region are those approved by Union minister Nitin Gadkari, Fadnavis claimed while addressing BJP workers ahead of the December 1 MLC poll for the East Vidarbha graduates' constituency where the party has fielded Sandip Joshi. "This government is completely anti-Vidarbha and its approach is the same towards Marathwada and other backward regions," alleged Fadnavis, who hails from Nagpur in Vidarbha. The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has "contempt and anger" towards Vidarbha, the former chief minister said commemorating the first anniversary of the MVA dispensation. "That is why it has discontinued the Vidarbha Statutory Development Board (the term of which expired in April this year) and other projects and did not provide any funds for Vidarbha," he said. The farmers of Vidarbha affected by floods and other natural disasters are also left in the lurch, he said. The works pertaining to roads, flyovers, railway over-bridges and other projects in Vidarbha are initiated by Union minister Gadkari, he claimed. "There is not even one work underway in Vidarbha which can be attributed to this government," the leader of opposition in state Assembly claimed and accused the ruling dispensation of not fulfilling its promises made to people. "Is this a government or a drama?" he asked. Fadnavis also said the previous BJP-led government had initiated the 'MahaJyoti' scheme (a training and career guidance institute) for the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), but the MVA government has stopped all various welfare measures under it. Similarly, the Rs 500 crore fund which had been granted to the 'OBC Mahamandal' under the BJP rule has not being spent by the MVA government for welfare of the community, he claimed. "When we passed the law on reservation for the Maratha community, we had included a section which clearly mentioned that no one can touch the OBC community reservation," he said. Some people in the current government are creating confusion on the issue of OBC reservation for "political purpose", he claimed. Reacting to Fadnavis' criticism, NCP leader and minority affairs minister Nawab Malik told PTI that the Centre was sitting on Rs 33,000 crore dues payable to Maharashtra. "The BJP has no right to criticise the state government. It is the BJP which is anti-Maharashtra. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected development works not just in Vidarbha but in the entire state. "Our government is doing its best to overcome the situation, but the Centre is not cooperating and not releasing Rs 33,000 crore in dues," he said. State Congress president and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said the Opposition was making allegations against the MVA government out of desperation. "Even people will not take them seriously", he added. Energy Minister and Congress leader Nitin Raut, who hails from the Vidarabha region, said the state government's focus remained on saving lives during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and helping farmers affected by natural calamities. "As far as Vidarbha is concerned, two ministers from the region hold important portfolios in the state government," he said. "We took oath on November 27, 2019, but our actually work started only in January this year. After that we had to prepare for state legislature sessions which were held in Nagpur and Mumbai, and then Covid-19 struck," the minister said. He said the BJP was trying to compare the work done by them in five years before 2019 to just one year of the MVA government. "We prioritised checking the spread of coronavirus. We faced all these challenges and worked towards providing relief to the people. You will see the results soon as the state government has undertaken various development works," Raut added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/mva-govt-is-completely-anti-vidarbha-alleges-former-maharashtra-cm-devendra-fadnavis-921336.html

Described as a 'must-visit' place by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the town, nestled amid Satpura and Vindhayachal ranges along the banks of the Narmada river, has a number of small and big tourist spots. Gujarat's Additional Chief Secretary Rajiv Gupta, who has been associated with the project since its beginning, said it was the Prime Minister's vision to develop this place as a model tourist destination for the entire family. "Under the guidance of Prime Minister Modi, the town has been developed as a tourist destination for the entire family while preserving its ecology and local heritage," Gupta told PTI. He said the main attraction of the town, the Statue of Unity, ideated by Prime Minister Modi himself, attracts more tourists than the Statue of Liberty in the United States. Development in the town generated direct employment for 3,000 tribal boys and girls, and indirect employment to 10,000 more, Gupta said, adding it has also opened up new avenues of micro-entrepreneurship for women. About the various tourist attractions in Kevadia, Gujarat's Tourism Secretary Mamta Verma said there is variety, something for every member of a family in Kevadia. "If there is Arogya Van for elders, there is a children nutrition park for kids, then there are options for camping and river rafting for youngsters," she said. For nature lovers, Verma said there are Sardar Patel Zoological Park and Geodesic Aviary Dome, which is home to more than 1,100 birds and animals and five lakh plants. Under the guidance of Prime Minister Modi, this place has been developed with least commercialisation, so that its natural beauty remains intact, she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/statue-of-unity-attracts-more-tourists-than-statue-of-liberty-gujarat-official-921346.html
29-11-2020||West||Maharashtra BJP MLA heard in clip admonishing cop over gutkha raid||Two audio clips in which BJP MLA Babanrao Lonikar can purportedly be heard admonishing a probationary IPS officer and a local police station official in Jalna in Maharashtra over a failed gutkha raid went viral on social media on Sunday. Probationary IPS officer Gahur Hasan and Partur police station in-charge RP Thackeray had raided the premises of a trader in Partur on November 25 after getting information that he was hoarding gutkha, a substance banned in the state, officials said. However, the information turned out to be false and no gutkha was found, following which Lonikar, MLA from Partur, called up Hasan, admonished him over the failed raid, and said he would raise the issue in the state Assembly and ensure the officer is subjected to action for harassing an innocent citizen. Lonikar also told the officer to take action against the person who fed police wrong information. In the clip, the officer can be heard saying police had apologised to the trader for the lapse. Queried on the audio clips, Gahur told PTI the raid was carried out on the basis of details given by an informant and the police had apologised after it turned out to be false.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-bjp-mla-heard-in-clip-admonishing-cop-over-gutkha-raid-921348.html
29-11-2020||West||Goa CM weeping crocodile tears over depleted Mahadayi river basin, says Congress||Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant is merely weeping crocodile tears by admitting regret about the waters of the Mahadayi river being already diverted by Karnataka, Goa Congress President Girish Chodankar said on Sunday. Addressing a press conference in Panaji, Chodankar also said that the Congress, the main Opposition party in Goa, would stand "shoulder-to-shoulder" with the ruling BJP to "fight for justice" for Goa in its battle for its rightful share of water from the Mahadayi (Mhadei in Goa). "By merely accepting that water in the Mahadayi river basin has reduced because Karnataka has already diverted the water, the Chief Minister is only weeping crocodile tears. We have been saying this for years already," Chodankar said.  Last week, Sawant, while ruling out an 'out of court' settlement over the dispute, had said that the water in the Mahadayi river basin had depleted because Karnataka had already begun diverting water into its territories. Chodankar also said that former Defence Minister and ex-Chief Minister of Goa late Manohar Parrikar had already compromised Goa's position vis-à-vis the river water dispute.  Ahead of the 2018 state assembly elections in Karnataka, Parrikar, who was then chief minister of Goa, had written a letter to BJP's chief ministerial candidate BS Yediyurappa which said that Goa was willing to consider Karnataka's request for drawing drinking water from the Mahadayi river basin "on humanitarian grounds". Chodankar said that the Congress was willing to back the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in Goa to put a collective front in order to protect Goa's interests in the inter-state river dispute. "We are willing to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the BJP. We are willing to travel to Karnataka or host dharnas outside the prime minister's house or outside Parliament for the cause," Chodankar said. Goa and Karnataka are battling out a two-decade-long dispute over the sharing of the Mahadayi river in the Supreme Court, after both parties expressed reservations about the award by the Mahadayi Water Dispute Tribunal in 2018. Goa has also opposed the diversion of water from the Mahadayi river basin through the Kalasa-Banduri project claiming it would cause “ecological devastation” in Goa. Last month, the Goa government had filed a contempt petition in the Supreme Court against Karnataka for illegal diversion of water from the Mahadayi river. Both the states have already filed special leave petitions in the Supreme Court against the award given by a central government tribunal which allowed Karnataka to divert 13.42 TMC water from the river basin.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/goa-cm-weeping-crocodile-tears-over-depleted-mahadayi-river-basin-says-congress-921349.html

Speaking with reporters after holding a state-level meeting in Pune, Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM) coordinator Rajendra Kondhre said an action plan will be finalised soon. "In the event of the state government deferring the legislature session, we will organise a long march to Mumbai," he said. The MKM has been demanding restoration of the Maratha quota in education and jobs, which was stayed by the supreme court in September. Earlier this month, the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) decided to hold the winter session of the state legislature in Mumbai from December 7 instead of the traditional venue Nagpur in view of the Covid-19 situation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/quota-row-maratha-outfit-to-take-out-morcha-on-assembly-in-mumbai-921445.html
