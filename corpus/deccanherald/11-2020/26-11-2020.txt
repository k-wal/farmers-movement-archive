He has picked people with significant experience and expertise, who have worked either with him previously, including during the Obama administration. Importantly, their past work reflects cooperative and inclusive approaches. Anthony Blinken, a long-time Biden adviser on foreign policy issues who will be the new Secretary of State, is a strong advocate of global alliances. He will lead the new administration’s effort to rebuild ties with US allies and re-enter global agreements and institutions from which it withdrew under President Trump. Biden has appointed former Secretary of State John Kerry as his special envoy on climate change. This signals the priority Biden accords the climate change issue as Kerry’s full attention will be devoted to the matter. Additionally, Kerry will be part of the National Security Council, which means that for the first time, the US will tackle climate change as a threat to its national security. This a welcome change in the US government’s understanding of national security, and one that should inspire other governments to follow suit. The Biden team announced so far is inclusive in terms of gender, race and ethnicity. There are several women in it, including Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a career diplomat, who will be ambassador to the UN. In addition to re-entering organisations like UNESCO, UNHRC and WHO, which Trump pulled out of, Thomas-Greenfield faces the challenge of convincing the world that the US is indeed committed to multilateralism and to discharging its responsibilities as the pre-eminent founder-member of the UN. The first hurdle that the new team faces is securing Senate approval for the appointments. This may not be easy, given the hostility Democrats will face from Republican Senators. The Biden team faces formidable challenges ahead. In addition to bringing together a bitterly divided nation, the team has to undo the enormous damage that the Trump administration did to American institutions, processes, the economy and society. These tasks will be all the more daunting given that the work will have to be done amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which continues to rage in the US. Biden will take charge as President only on January 20. There are no signs of Trump engaging in a course correction with regard to the pandemic in the coming weeks. Hence, the new team will be taking charge of a country even more deeply mired in the pandemic. An inclusive team, such as Biden has put together, gives hope in such a time.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/after-four-years-of-donald-trump-joe-biden-s-team-is-cause-for-hope-920270.html
26-11-2020||In Perspective||RCEP: More was needed||Jawaharlal Nehru’s dream of a united Asia and India’s role in it was shaken when South East Asian countries drifted towards the liberal economic system. It was the era of the Cold War, and India saw ASEAN as an American attempt to contain the Soviet Union. But the Cold War is long over, and the containment of China seems to be the objective of the West and India. The new political-economic scenario has swung the pendulum in the other direction, and India has stayed out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Whether India joins in the two-year window that is still open is to be seen. It is noteworthy that RCEP became possible with the collapse of the Trans-Pacific Partnership because the US pulled out of it under President Trump. India participated in the RCEP negotiations but opted out due to its concerns about increased imports that may affect its manufacturing, agricultural and dairy sectors. But such agreements are a two-way process. They liberalise imports and, at the same time, provide markets for exports. India realised this and has been eager to review the ASEAN-India Free Trade Agreement in goods. The need is to strengthen the competitiveness of Indian producers and manufacturers with adequate legal infrastructure. India is preparing amendments in its trade remedy laws to prevent dumping and surge in imports. The problem with RCEP is its primary concern with reducing tariffs. The Comprehensive Partnership Agreement is comprehensive about the subject matter but limited in scope. It adopts WTO norms on many vital issues. For example, for sanitary and phytosanitary measures, it largely focuses on mechanisms for recognition and cooperation agreements and equivalence procedure, the procedure for declaring pest-free areas. For competition, it again focuses on cooperation and transparency between competition authorities. It is left to the parties to design their competition laws according to their national policies. Investment is an important issue. But again, the agreement has limited coverage. There are some important limitations on investor protection. It has clearly defined ‘Fair and Equitable Treatment’ at the minimum standard of protection recognised in customary international law. Apart from other protections, the investment part does not have any other important provision, except expropriation and compensation. But the agreement has MFN provision, and the scope of investment provision would depend upon the bilateral investment treaties parties have with other countries. We see an effort to curtail the investor protection provision, but also a missed opportunity to include a substantial provision on obligations of investors. In trade in services, RCEP replicates WTO provisions, with one important exception. The positive list approach for trade in services includes MFN treatment also. Under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), the positive list approach, titled ‘specific commitments’, extends only to market access and national treatment. MFN is a general obligation. In RCEP, MFN treatment is also a specific obligation. For trade in goods, RCEP incorporates MFN treatment, only the applied rate of duty is lower than the rate committed in the RCEP schedule. Tariff schedules of China, Indonesia, Korea, Philippines and Vietnam discriminate between ASEAN countries and the five non-ASEAN countries. The Exceptions clause is again based on Articles XX and XXI of GATT 1994, and parties missed the opportunity to make substantial provision for small and medium enterprises. National treatment violation claims cannot be made against measures taken to protect SMEs. The provision relating to corruption is also not substantial. The legitimacy of investments made by exploiting corruption in the host state should have been subjected to scrutiny. In sum, RCEP has followed the WTO framework. On important issues associated with trade, such as environment, labour, culture and competition, it has either remained silent or has followed WTO norms. Tariff reduction is a short-term outcome of a trade deal. For a mega-deal like RCEP, it is under-performance. If the goal is to make Asia the economic centre of the world, RCEP should move further and create alternative norms on trade-related regulatory issues. Intellectual leadership on these issues is with the West. A more comprehensive investment pact, provisions for environment, labour and competition that address the concerns of developing countries would help the WTO develop its rules and jurisprudence to reflect divergent interests. This would help build a more inclusive multilateral trade regime. More intensive work on investment was especially needed, given the ongoing negotiations on investment facilitation. Regional trade and investment agreements and their institutions in Asia should make an effort to build norms and jurisprudence on WTO-plus issues to be able to play an effective role in the multilateral trading system of the future. The adoption of the WTO framework on basic issues was no doubt required to maintain consistency in the international regime, but mere tariff reduction is not enough to “pull the economic centre of gravity towards Asia.” (The writer is Professor of Law, NLU, Odisha)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/in-perspective/rcep-more-was-needed-920271.html

He directed the officials to prevent gathering of people in the towns and to ensure social distancing. “People should not visit public places, without wearing masks. All precautionary measures should be taken to prevent the second round of pandemic. The Police and Revenue department officials should join hands. Taluk hospitals should be upgraded to treat Covid patients. Assistant commissioners should ensure that the people visiting the court are subject to Covid tests,” Naveen Raj Singh said. Covid vaccines may reach the district soon, and the authorities should make all arrangements to stock the medicines and streamline their distribution, he said.

26-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||Speculation rife in Karnataka as CM B S Yediyurappa convenes meeting of cabinet, MPs||Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa has convened a meeting of his cabinet and party MPs on Friday as he awaits approval from the BJP central leadership to carry out the much-awaited expansion or reshuffle of his cabinet. The cabinet meeting is slated for 10.30 am at the 'Vidhana Soudha', the seat of power in the state, and that of party MPs at his home office 'Krishna' at 4 pm, official sources said on Thursday. There have been rumours in some quarters in recent times that the BJP is weighing the option of leadership change in Karnataka considering the age of Yediyurappa, who is 77. The state BJP has repeatedly rejected such speculations, but some within the party including senior MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal have openly talked about his replacement. Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan on Thursday said Yediyurappa will continue in his post. "...we are saying repeatedly that there is no leadership change in Karnataka, Yediyurappa will continue as Chief Minister. There will be no change, he (Yediyurappa) is our leader and he will continue," Narayan told reporters. The Chief Minister's political secretary M P Renukacharya too said, "our national leaders and state president have said that Yediyurappa will continue as CM". He hit out at the Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly Siddaramaiah, who had claimed the BJP will change the Chief Minister citing "information from sources in Delhi". The meeting with MPs has come in the backdrop of, Chamarajanagar Lok Sabha member V Srinivas Prasad on Wednesday making no secret of his "disenchantment" with the Chief Minister, by stating that Yediyurappa "doesn't need us anymore". Confirming about the MPs meeting on Friday, Gulbarga Lok Sabha member Umesh Jadhav said, "I have received a WhatsApp message and a phone call from the CM's office informing about the MPs meeting at 4 pm tomorrow. Subject has not been specified; it may be about development and issues pertaining to the state that are pending before the Centre," he said. The Chief Minister making a flurry of political appointments to various statutory bodies in the state in the last two days has also fuelled speculation. Also, Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi is camping in Delhi, and Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi and Revenue Minister R Ashoka travelling to the national capital despite cabinet meeting on Friday has tongue wagging in political circles. Jarkiholi has made it clear he was batting for MLC C P Yogeshwar to be inducted into the Ministry along with a couple of Congress-JD(S) rebels who joined the BJP with him and are now party legislators. Savadi and Ashoka have said that they are going to Delhi to attend BJP national General Secretary C T Ravi's office inauguration. According to sources, senior national BJP leaders are likely to attend Ravi's office event and the Ministers are expected to meet them regarding developments in the state. Yediyurappa on Wednesday said that he was expecting communication from the BJP high command in 2-3 days regarding expansion or reshuffle of his cabinet. He had met Nadda in this regard in Delhi last week, but was reportedly asked to wait for clearance from the central leadership to go ahead with the process. BJP National General Secretary (Organisation) B L Santosh on Monday met the Chief Minister and both leaders reportedly held discussions in this regard. Political activities have intensified within the ruling BJP camp in the state after Yediyurappa on November 10, soon after the party's victory in bypolls to two assembly constituencies, had indicated that cabinet reshuffle is on cards. The exercise is expected to be a tightrope walk for Yediyurappa, considering that there are too many aspirants. While several of the old guards like Umesh Katti are waiting for a chance to be inducted into the Ministry, Congress-JD(S) rebels like A H Vishwanath, R Shankar and M T B Nagaraj, who helped the BJP to come to power last year and are now party MLCs, are also aspiring for slots. The cabinet currently has 27 members and seven berths are vacant.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/speculation-rife-in-karnataka-as-cm-b-s-yediyurappa-convenes-meeting-of-cabinet-mps-920169.html
26-11-2020||Main Article||MSP Procurement: Real freedom for farmers||Amidst continuing protests by Punjab and Haryana farmers against the Centre’s new farm laws, about 3-4 lakh tonnes of paddy arrives every day in Punjab mandis from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. As the paddy marketing season comes to an end, it is estimated that more than three million tonnes of paddy has already reached Punjab mandis in the kharif marketing season this year. This is because in the Punjab mandis, the entire paddy harvest that is made available for sale is procured at the Minimum Support Price (MSP). Unscrupulous traders purchase paddy at prices varying between Rs 800 to Rs 1,200 per quintal from Bihar and UP farmers and transport it all the way to Punjab, where it is sold at a MSP of Rs 1,888 per quintal. While numerous FIRs have been lodged against such traders, this is not the first year when truckloads of paddy (and wheat) have been routinely carried all the way from Bihar/UP to Punjab. For several years now, newspapers in the region have been reporting on the illegal marketing channels being explored by commodity traders to seek a higher price in Punjab. In other words, farmers and traders realise that MSP for paddy is the real price discovery. In neighbouring Haryana, the High Court is looking into complaints questioning the rationale of barring UP farmers from selling their paddy harvest in Haryana mandis. In a similar case, the court has made it clear that traders can bring and market paddy from other states but cannot sell in the APMC mandis in Punjab. A significant proportion of paddy procurement is confined to Punjab and Haryana. More than 95% of paddy growers in Punjab and 70% in Haryana get the benefit of MSP. But for other rice-producing states, their share is low, almost negligible. Only 7.3% of paddy growers in West Bengal and 3.6% in UP are able to sell at the procurement price. For instance, in the North-East states, only 1.1 lakh tonnes of paddy were procured against the production of 7.3 million tonnes in 2018-19. At the same time, 2.7 million tonnes of paddy were distributed through the PDS and other welfare schemes. If only paddy procurement within the region had been higher, the pressure to transport paddy from other states would have been far less. This clearly points to the crying need for expanding and strengthening the procurement operations. Even the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), acknowledging the lapse, recommends: “Majority of farmers in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and other Eastern and North-Eastern states, being marginal and small and having poor access to government procurement, resort to distress sale. Therefore, there is a need to bring more farmers in these states under the ambit of procurement operations.” This is not only true for the North-East states but is applicable for the entire country and for all crops for which MSP is announced. After all, it is not the fault of farmers if adequate procurement infrastructure has not been laid out in most states, as it has been done in Punjab and Haryana. Just because only 6% of farmers in the country are able to sell their crops at MSP does not mean that the remaining 94% are happy with the markets. A majority of farmers do not understand the MSP system. Former agriculture minister Sharad Pawar had informed Parliament in 2009 that 71% of farmers are either unaware of or do not understand the concept of MSP. Unfortunately, ignorance is being cited as a virtue as far as the delivery of MSP is concerned. Perhaps this also explains why farmers’ protests against the new farm laws are predominantly confined to Punjab and Haryana. Farmers need to know how an initiative taken by T N Prakash, a former chairperson of the Karnataka Agricultural Prices Commission, has over time been able to significantly enhance farm incomes for small and marginal farmers growing nutritionally-rich crops -- ragi and tur. Instead of following ‘one MSP, one nation’ philosophy, Karnataka provided a bonus of Rs 450 per quintal for ragi in the 2014-15 cropping season, thereby transferring an average additional income of Rs 15,725 to each of the farmers who came for procurement. Similarly, for tur legume, it provided a bonus of Rs 450 per quintal, resulting in a record procurement, providing an average additional income of Rs 22,500 in the bank accounts of all those who registered for tur procurement. This clearly shows that just by providing MSP for crops grown in marginal areas, farm incomes were substantially enhanced. For farmers living on the edge, this comes as a big succour. Drawing from the Karnataka experience, Andhra Pradesh has issued a notification directing the state agencies to procure six other predominantly cultivated crops of the state, which are not covered under the 23 crops that the Centre announces MSP for every year. To give impetus to millets cultivation, Odisha government had procured 18,000 quintals of ragi from producers in the 2018-19 cropping season. Chhattisgarh had announced that it would procure paddy from farmers at a price of Rs 2,500 per quintal for 2018-19 kharif season. In addition, Karnataka had also provided deficiency payments for crops like onion, potato, tomato, chilli and mango. Haryana, too, had introduced deficiency payments, but it didn’t succeed as expected. A mechanism therefore needs to be established to make MSP a legal right for farmers. Farmers need a vast network of regulated mandis like in Punjab and Haryana. That will be the real freedom for farmers, when they are assured of getting MSP wherever they sell their crop.

The tenets of the Constitution disallow fraudulent and illegal coercive action against a woman, she told reporters here when asked about AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi's comments that such laws would be a gross violation of Article 14 and 21 of Constitution. "If a state government, takes within the ambit of the Constitution, steps to ensure that women are not criminally and fraudulently coerced into a relationship, should not the right and the protection of that women be supported by Indians across the country, irrespective of our political ideology?" she asked. When the intent of the state, under the ambit of the Constitution, was to ensure that fraudulent and criminal coercions were dissuaded to protect the rights of women, it should be looked from that perspective, she added.

26-11-2020||National||Explained | Why are farmers marching to Delhi?||With enough ration, vegetables, wood, clothes, and other essentials, the farmers from across the country are set to lay an “indefinite siege of Delhi” on Thursday against the three farm laws and Centre's plan to amend the Electricity Act. Over hundreds of farmers have started gathering at the Delhi border along with Haryana despite barricades. The BJP-ruled Haryana has imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC in several parts of the state to prevent assembly of protesters. On the other hand, the Delhi police have said that they would not allow any protests by farmers. The capital has suspended metro services to neighbouring cities till 2 pm.  Why are farmers agitated? The farmers have opposed the three contentious farm laws that were enacted by the Centre on September 27. They have been demanding to repeal the farm laws, alleging that none of the stakeholders was consulted before the enactment of the laws. Their biggest fear is the end of minimum support prices (MSP) procurement because of these laws. However, the Centre has denied any uncertainty regarding MSP. The Centre has time and again, asserted that the laws will transform the agriculture system in India and will let farmers sell their produce anywhere in the country. Amid the ongoing protests, the Central government has also invited farmer unions from Punjab for the second round of ministerial talks on December 3 to resolve differences over the new agriculture laws. Talking about the end of MSP, the food secretary said, "Earlier laws too did not have any mention of MSP. Even the new agri-laws do not mention it. MSP is mentioned only in the National Food Security Act (NFSA) which has not been changed. Till Public Distribution System (PDS) is there, MSP will continue". States like Punjab and Haryana have been witnessing a major showdown after these laws were enacted. Last week, the farmers lifted the 60-day 'rail roko' agitation for 15 days starting on November 23 and agreed to let all goods and passenger trains to operate across Punjab. Present situation Farmer leaders were arrested in Haryana on November 24th and 25th with intention of preventing them from traveling to Delhi. Even after giving undertaking of peaceful conduct and offering of bail bond, the farmer leaders were kept in custody. Water cannons were used against farmers near Kurukshetra, despite which the farmers continued to move towards Delhi. Haryana has decided to completely seal its borders with Punjab on November 26 and 27. The Punjab-Haryana border has not only been barricaded but fortified with boulders and barbed wire fence. The CRPF has also been deployed. Farmers’ convoy led by Medha Patkar, Pratibha Shinde, Kavita Srinivasan and others, traveling from Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh was stopped at the Rajasthan-UP border between Dholpur and Agra, and not allowed to enter into Uttar Pradesh, resulting in a partial blockade of national highway for several hours. Farmers’ convoys from Uttarakhand have been blocked at points within Uttarakhand as well as in Uttar Pradesh. Supporting the protests, Shiromani Akali Dal President, Sukhbir Singh Badal said, "By stopping Punjabi farmers from peacefully exercising democratic rights, Centre is repeating 1982 when the Akalis were stopped from entering Delhi to protest. Painful history must not be forced to repeat itself." (With inputs from agencies and Sagar Kulkarni)||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/explained-why-are-farmers-marching-to-delhi-920028.html

26-11-2020||National||Delhi chalo protest: Farmers brave water cannons, tear gas on way to national capital||Braving water cannons and tear gas shells, thousands of farmers on Thursday staged protests and marched towards the national capital to protest against the Modi government’s farm sector reforms and the proposed changes to the electricity act. Farmers clashed with police at the Punjab-Haryana border in Shambhu near Ambala, about 200 km from here, where the farmers marching from Punjab to Delhi were stopped by the Haryana Police. Dramatic visuals on television channels showed farmers lifting barricades set up by the police and throwing them off the bridge into the Ghaggar river as they marched ahead. Farmers' organisations from across the country had announced plans to march to the national capital on November 26-27 to lay an indefinite siege, demanding roll back of the farm sector reforms that allow farmers to sell their produce to traders even outside the APMC markets and allow them to pursue contract farming. The organisations claim that the reforms approved by Parliament in September would allow the corporate sector a greater say in the farm sector and harm the interests of the farmers. Delhi Police in coordination with the Haryana Police was seen checking vehicles entering the capital, and have even put cement barricades and sand trucks to stop the protesting farmers who are marching towards Delhi in large numbers in their tractors and trolleys. “We will force the Centre to roll back these black anti-farmer laws,” Gurnam Singh, chief of the Haryana unit of the Bhartiya Kisan Union said, adding that the farmers were carrying enough supplies that would last them six months as they planned to lay siege to the national capital. In Delhi, a group of farmers blocked traffic at the Majnu ka Tilla in North Delhi to protest against the farm sector reforms.   The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee and the Samyukt Kisan Morcha claimed that farmers’ convoys led by activists Medha Patkar, Pratibha Shinde, Kavita Srinivasan and others were stopped at the Rajasthan-Uttar Pradesh border near Agra leading the blockage of the highway. The Delhi Police have already rejected the protest requests from the farmers citing the Covid-19 pandemic. “All the requests received from the various farmer organisations regarding protest in Delhi on November 26 and 27 have been rejected and this has already been communicated to the organisers,” Eish Singhal, Delhi Police PRO was quoted as saying.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-chalo-protest-farmers-brave-water-cannons-tear-gas-on-way-to-national-capital-920050.html

Shringla's was accorded a warm welcome on his maiden visit to Nepal which is happening at the invitation of Nepal Foreign Secretary Bharat Raj Paudyal, amid a strain in bilateral ties following a bitter border row between the two countries. "I would like to thank the government of Nepal, the foreign secretary for the warm hospitality extended to us. We have some very good meetings ahead of us and we will look forward to how that goes. My first meeting will be with the Nepalese Foreign Secretary and then I will meet Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali. I will also hold meetings with high dignitaries in Kathmandu," he said. Shringla's visit will be a continuation of the regular exchange of high-level visits between the two friendly neighbours, the Nepalese Foreign Ministry said in a statement this week. Shringla is also scheduled to call on Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli and President Bidya Devi Bhandari on Thursday. On Friday, he will give a lecture on India-Nepal relations at Hotel Soaltee Crown Plaza in Kathmandu and will inspect three schools built under Indian assistance at Gorkha, the epicentre of the 2015 earthquake, it said. He will also hand over Covid-19-related support to the Government of Nepal before wrapping up his two-day visit on Friday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had pledged to construct 50,000 houses in Gorkha, the epicentre of the 2015 earthquake. The construction of forty thousand houses has already been completed there. "We have also focused in education sector. India has also rebuilt school buildings in Gorkha district. He will inaugurate three school buildings built in Gorkha under India’s assistance," he said. Shringla will also inaugurate a Buddhist monastery in Manang district situated in remote mountainous region of Nepal near Tibetan border, which was renovated under India's assistance. Earlier this month, Indian Army chief Gen. M M Naravane travelled to Nepal on a three-day visit during which he held talks with Nepal’s top leadership and discussed bilateral relations. During the visit, he called on Prime Minister Oli, who is also the Defence Minister of Nepal. Oli told him that problems between Nepal and India would be resolved through dialogue. Gen Naravane's three-day visit to Nepal was largely aimed at resetting bilateral ties that came under severe strain following a bitter border row between the two countries. The ties between the two countries came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8. Nepal protested the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through its territory. Days later, Nepal came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories. After Nepal released the map, India reacted sharply, calling it a "unilateral act" and cautioning Kathmandu that such "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it. In its reaction, after Nepal's lower house of parliament approved the bill, India had also termed as untenable the "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims by the neighbouring country. India had said Nepal's action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks. Meanwhile, Chinese Defence Minister Gen. Wei Fenghe is scheduled to visit Nepal shortly after Shringla returns home, according to Foreign Ministry sources here. Wei is likely to arrive here on Sunday on a four-day official visit, though the date of the trip is yet to be officially announced.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-nepal-share-very-strong-relationship-harsh-vardhan-shringla-920072.html

Haryana put up road barricades along its border with Punjab on Wednesday as farmers in the adjoining state massed with their tractor-trailers for their "Delhi Chalo" march to protest against the laws. Water cannons were used at least twice to disperse them and stop them from going to Delhi. Taking to Twitter, the Delhi chief minister said peaceful demonstration was a constitutional right of the farmers. "All the three farming bills of the central government are anti-farmer. Instead of withdrawing them, farmers are being prevented from holding peaceful demonstrations, water canons are being used on them. This is absolutely wrong. Peaceful demonstrations are their constitutional right," he said in a tweet in Hindi. केंद्र सरकार के तीनों खेती बिल किसान विरोधी हैं। ये बिल वापिस लेने की बजाय किसानों को शांतिपूर्ण प्रदर्शन करने से रोका जा रहा है, उन पर वॉटर कैनन चलाई जा रही हैं। किसानों पर ये जुर्म बिलकुल ग़लत है। शांतिपूर्ण प्रदर्शन उनका संवैधानिक अधिकार है। The Haryana government on Thursday completely sealed its borders with Punjab. Police personnel have been deployed in large numbers along the state's borders with Delhi as well. The BJP-ruled Haryana government has suspended bus services to Punjab. The three laws -- the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 -- took effect from September 27 after President Ram Nath Kovind's assent. Protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the Centre's farm laws would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. The government has maintained that the farm laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/absolutely-wrong-to-prevent-farmers-from-holding-peaceful-demonstrations-kejriwal-920079.html

On November 4, the court had reserved its order on the petition by the company against the Allahabad High Court's order rejecting their plea to quash the FIR. The court had then asked why Skoda Volkswagen India Pvt Ltd should not face the trial against it in Uttar Pradesh over alleged cheat emission devices.   Senior advocate A M Singhvi, representing the German car-maker, submitted that in March 2019, a penalty was imposed by the National Green Tribunal, which was stayed by the top court.  To this, a bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde replied, "I know, I was party to that order. But what that has to do with the criminal prosecution?"  The bench also said prima facie the court does not agree with him.  Singhvi maintained that the criminal prosecution was not fair at this stage. They have also accused officers outside India, he added.   He said that vehicle was bought in 2018, and for nearly two and a half years there were no complaints.  “While the NGT matter was pending, this FIR was lodged where the allegations are same as the application before the NGT,"  Singhvi said.  "But, why should the trial not go on? NGT will not determine the correctness of your action," the bench said. The bench noted that a criminal complaint was filed by a citizen while the NGT passed a general order on cheat devices.  "We are admirers of the company as it is a legendary motor vehicle manufacturer, and we have had the highest respect for it since World War II," the bench said. Senior advocate Senior Maninder Singh, representing the complainant, had then submitted that the investigations in the FIR should go on. He also said that High Court has already granted a stay against the arrest of the company officials.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-dismisses-skoda-volkswagens-plea-to-quash-fir-for-alleged-use-of-cheat-device-in-car-920085.html

Haryana has completely sealed its borders with Punjab to prevent farmers from entering the state for their 'Delhi Chalo' protest march against the Centre's farm laws. “Why is @mlkhattar govt in Haryana stopping the farmers from moving to Delhi? The tyrannical use of brute force against peacefully protesting farmers is totally undemocratic & unconstitutional,” said Singh in a tweet. He said farmers have been peacefully protesting in Punjab against the farm laws for two months. “Why is Haryana govt provoking them by resorting to force? Don't the farmers have the right to pass peacefully through a public highway?", Singh asked. The Haryana Police on Thursday used water cannons and tear gas to disperse a group of farmers from Punjab who allegedly tried to jump police barricades to enter Haryana as part of their 'Delhi Chalo' march. The Punjab chief minister said it was a “sad irony” that the constitutional right of farmers were being “oppressed” on the Constitution Day. "It's a sad irony that on #ConstitutionDay2020 the constitutional right of farmers is being oppressed in this manner. Let them pass @mlkhattar  ji, don't push them to the brink. Let them take their voice to Delhi peacefully," Singh said.      He also appealed to the BJP to direct the Manohar Lal Khattar led government not to indulge in “strong arm tactics” against the farmers. "Urge @BJP4India  to direct their state governments not to indulge in such strong-arm tactics against the farmers. The hands that feed the nation deserve to be held, not pushed aside,” he said. Farmers are marching towards Delhi to protest the Centre's new farm laws.

26-11-2020||National||India will keep global spotlight firmly on cross-border terrorism: S Jaishankar||India said on Thursday that it will keep the global spotlight "firmly" on cross-border terrorism and on the epicentre of the global menace, in an apparent reference to Pakistan on the 12th anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar applauded the courage of India's security forces for continuing to defend the country "so resolutely". "Will keep the global spotlight firmly on the menace of cross-border terrorism against India. And on the epicentre of global terrorism," he said in a tweet. Jaishankar is currently visiting the United Arab Emirates (UAE). He arrived here on Wednesday night on the second leg of his six-day three-nation tour to Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Seychelles, which began on Tuesday. The visit is seen as important as it comes in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic that has wreaked havoc across the world. "12 years since the horrific 26/11 #MumbaiTerrorAttacks. Pay my homage to its victims. Applaud the courage of our security forces, who continue to defend our nation so resolutely," he said. Will keep the global spotlight firmly on the menace of cross-border terrorism against India. And on the epicentre of global terrorism. On November 26, 2008, a group of 10 Pakistani terrorists went into a rampage, carrying out coordinated attacks on a railway station, two luxury hotels and a Jewish centre, after they sneaked into India's financial capital using the sea route in the Arabian sea. Over 166 people, including 28 foreigners from 10 nations, were killed in the nearly 60-hour assault that sent shock waves across the country and even brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war. In November 2012, Ajmal Amir Kasab, the lone surviving gunman among the Pakistani group, was hanged to death in Yerawada Jail in Pune. India has been pressing Pakistan to punish those involved in the dastardly attacks. But the trial of the accused, including Jamat-ud-Dawah (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed, in the attacks has made little headway so far. Following the attacks, India has been consistently highlighting the threat of cross border terrorism and how Pakistan has been sheltering and providing support to various terror groups.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-will-keep-global-spotlight-firmly-on-cross-border-terrorism-s-jaishankar-920108.html

November 26 marks the 12th anniversary of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai. “It is important for the world and the global community, for us and for justice that those responsible are brought to book. Pakistan must do what is required to bring the perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice,” Jaiswal said, addressing a virtual commemoration event on Wednesday. Ten terrorists of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) carried out 12 coordinated shooting and bombing attacks across Mumbai in November 2008. Over 166 people, including 28 foreigners from 10 nations, were killed in the nearly 60-hour assault that sent shockwave across the country and even brought India and Pakistan to the brink of a war. In November 2012, Ajmal Amir Kasab, the lone surviving gunman among the Pakistani group, was hanged to death in Pune. India has been pressing Pakistan to punish those involved in the dastardly attack. But the trial of the accused, including Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed, in the attack made little headway so far. Following the attack, India has been consistently highlighting the threat of cross border terrorism and how Pakistan has been sheltering and providing support to various terror groups. At the event organised by The American India Public Affairs Committee and American Jewish Committee, Jaiswal described the 26/11 attacks as a “ghastly attack unknown in the annals of history”. He said terrorism is one of the greatest threats confronting the world. “As in the (time of) COVID19, the world has come together to fight this pandemic, we must all come together to fight terrorism, a global problem, tooth and nail. Let us remember on this occasion those who fell to the barbaric and bloody bullets of insanity and inhumanity. And those who sacrificed life to save our tomorrow, to save our today,” he said. Israel Nitzan, Acting Consul General of Israel in New York, said his country was “shocked” by the “barbaric terrorist attacks” carried out against innocent Indian civilians and foreign tourists across Mumbai in November 2008. He stressed that India, the US and Israel share democratic values and deep bonds based on shared experiences. “This horrific attack in Mumbai, with its tragic outcome, only strengthens us and strengthens our deep bond and friendship,” Nitzan said. Nitzan said the three countries know what terrorism is all about and added that the objective of the attack in Mumbai, as well as attacks in New York and Israel, is to cripple the economy, society and its vivid and wonderful culture. “And they (terrorists) failed. The attack is also a lesson about our resiliency, that we will not allow terrorism to break us. Despite the devastating results of this attack, the Indian economy has continued to grow stronger, its society is resilient, its culture remains invincible,” and the relations with Israel grows stronger, he said. “We will not allow hate to prevail,” Nitzan said, adding that the presence of the Chabad House in Mumbai, which also came under attack on 26/11, is a testimony to the tolerance and the acceptance of other traditions, beliefs and the pluralism of Indian society. “The attack on the Chabad House, like other anti-semitic attacks against Jews and Jewish institutions around the world, will not prevail. They will fail and terrorism will only push us to unite and to fight together against terrorism and hatred,” he said. Nitzan said Israel, India and the US have an “extraordinary cooperation” in counterterrorism and fighting hate and radicalism. India's Deputy Consul General Shatrughna Sinha said 12 years after the heinous attacks, “the perpetrators of this ghastly attack are still roaming free”. “Acts of terror not only violate the right of life of the individual who suffers these attacks. There are families whose rights are also violated. Unfortunately, victims of the attacks are also suffering today because their right to get justice has also been violated,” he said. Jaiswal said terrorism needs a very strong global cooperation and called on the international community to ensure that the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, which India sponsored at the UN, is adopted at the earliest. He stressed that in India’s international engagement with the US and Israel, as well as with many countries, counterterrorism cooperation is an important element and New Delhi will continue to strengthen it. Sinha also shared profiles of a few individuals and foreign nationals who lost their lives in the Mumbai attacks. Among them were Rabbi Gavriel and his wife Rivka, who was five months pregnant at the time, who were killed when the Pakistani terrorists stormed Nariman House. The couple’s son Moshe Holtzberg was saved by his Indian caregiver Sandra Samuel. Prominent community leader and American India Public Affairs Committee president Jagdish Sewhani said Pakistan today is more isolated than ever. Sewhani called on the Jewish community to press upon the incoming Biden administration to not restore financial aid to Pakistan -- the “epicentre of terrorism". He expressed confidence that the Biden administration will continue to stand with India in the fight against terrorism.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pakistan-must-bring-26/11-perpetrators-to-justice-india-s-consul-general-in-new-york-randhir-jaiswal-920116.html

Addressing the concluding session of the 80th All India Presiding Officers Conference in Kevadia in Gujarat via video conference, Modi said, "one nation-one election is not simply a subject of discussion. It is rather the need of India. At an interval of every few months, some big election keeps happening in some part of the country. You are aware of its impact on developmental activities. In such a scenario, there is a need for deep study and deliberation on the issue of one nation one election." While the Prime Minister has been pursuing the 'One Nation, One Election' theme ever since he became Prime Minister first in 2014, it has also been criticised by many. Former Vice President and former Rajya Sabha Chairman Hamid Ansari had in 2018 strongly disapproved of the idea of holding Lok Sabha and Assembly polls together, calling it an "assault" on Indian democracy. Later also the pitch had not found favour with a number of political parties, who skipped an all party meeting called on the issue in 2019. But despite Congress, TMC, Left parties, BSP and SP staying away from the meet, the government then decided to set up a committee to give suggestions on the proposal and its implementation. BJP under Modi has grown in size and influence since 2014. Recent election trends have shown while BJP led by Modi at Centre easily won the Lok Sabha polls, the trends in elections for Assemblies held in the corresponding period did not now show equally strong for the BJP. However, the BJP leaders had been arguing that the pitch for one nation one election has larger national interest in mind than merely winning an election. The Prime Minister on Thursday said, "the Presiding Officers can throw much light on this. They can lead us on this. Besides, only one voter list should be used in Lok Sabha, Vidhan Sabha and Panchayat polls. First we have to find a way for this. Today there is a separate list for each of these. Why are we wasting our time and money? Now the voting age for each of these elections is 18 years. Earlier there was some difference in the age eligibility for each of them. Hence they happened separately. Now there is no such need."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/one-nation-one-election-need-of-india-pm-narendra-modi-920118.html

The Bangalore South MP was in Hyderabad earlier this week in support of the BJP in the GHMC elections campaign. On Tuesday morning, Surya along with supporters reached the OU, removed the barricades and barbed wire at the main gate, and marched to the Arts College building. Surya said that they wanted to pay respects to the Telangana movement's martyrs at the university but that the gates were closed at Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao's behest. The OU was the hotbed of the student-led statehood agitation till 2014. The Hyderabad police had then distanced themselves from the obstructions saying that “they have not stopped anyone at the OU gate.” However, on Thursday, a case of criminal trespass under IPC 447 and other relevant provisions was registered on Surya and accompanying supporters, based on a complaint of unauthorised entry and movement on the campus from the university authorities. Telangana BJP chief Bandi Sanjay condemned the case on Surya, saying he was targeted for questioning the CM on behalf of the state's students and youth. During his Hyderabad tour, Surya lashed out at the TRS establishment stating that “Telangana is not a private jagir (estate) of the KCR family.” He also accused the BJP workers of being subjected to police brutality, booked under various cases.

In his valedictory address at the 80th All India Presiding Officers' Conference, Modi remembered the 26/11 martyrs on the 12th anniversary of the Mumbai terror attack.

Five sand-laden trucks have been stationed at Singhu border to stop tractors being driven by the protesters. Also, drones have been deployed for security purposes, police said. While clarifying that the borders have not been sealed, officials said all pickets have been made active, while all vehicles entering the national capital were being checked. According to officials, it was decided that Delhi Metro trains connecting the neighbouring cities in the NCR would not cross the national capital border till 2 pm on Thursday. As such, metro service was not available from Anand Vihar to Vaishali, New Ashok Nagar to Noida City Centre and between Sultanpur and Guru Dronacharya stations sections during the period. Delhi Police Commissioner S N Shrivastava visited the bordering areas and took stalk of the situation there. "Due to Covid-19, guidelines have been issued in which political gathering is not permitted here and for this, their (the farmers') request was rejected. If they still make an attempt, we have deployed personnel at the borders to not let them enter the national capital. We are also in contact with Punjab and Haryana Police," he said. Asked about commuters facing inconvenience, the Delhi Police chief said, "Since they (protesting farmers) have already blocked the nation highway, there are going to be some problems, but we will try to sort it out as soon as possible... Instead of coming to the national capital, they (farmers) should go back and do not break any guideline." Delhi Police on Wednesday said it had rejected requests from various farmer organisations to protest in the national capital on November 26 and 27. A day earlier, it had said that legal action would be taken against the protesting farmers if they come to the city for any gathering amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Punjab farmers, representing over 30 farm bodies, have announced they will go to Delhi through several routes -- Lalru, Shambhu, Patiala-Pehowa, Patran-Khanauri, Moonak-Tohana, Ratia-Fatehabad and Talwandi-Sirsa. Tension was escalating at all the border points. They assembled near the borders in tractor trolleys laden with rations and essentials for their proposed Delhi march. Haryana authorities have imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC in several parts of the state to prevent assembly of protesters. Farmer bodies said they will hold a dharna wherever they are stopped from moving towards the national capital. Punjab farmers are demanding the repeal of the new farm laws, which, they said, should be replaced with another set of laws framed after wider consultation with stakeholders. They also want a guarantee on the minimum support prices.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protest-vigil-stepped-up-in-delhis-bordering-areas-vehicles-being-checked-920147.html

New Delhi also assured Kathmandu that India would consider the requirement of Nepal on priority when it would be in a position to export the Covid-19 vaccine doses. Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla and his counterpart in Nepalese Government, Bharat Raj Paudyal, had a meeting in Kathmandu and shared perspectives about the boundary dispute. They discussed 'ways to take it forward' through 'appropriate bilateral mechanism', sources in New Delhi said. Shringla also called on Oli and Nepalese President Bidya Devi Bhandari and Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali after arriving in Kathmandu earlier on Thursday for a two-day visit. He handed over 2,000 vials of Remdesivir to the Nepalese Minister for Foreign Affairs as a gift from India for treatment of the Covid-19 patients in the neighbouring country. A statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Nepalese Government said that Shringla and Paudyal discussed the 'boundary matters and exchanged views on completing the boundary (settlement and demarcation) work in the remaining segments'. New Delhi’s relations with Kathmandu came under stress after the Oli Government lodged protest over a new 80-kilometer-long road was built from Dharchula in Uttarakhand to the Lipulekh Pass – an India-Nepal-China tri-junction boundary point. It alleged that the road passed through Nepal – a claim dismissed by India. Kathmandu, however, went ahead, published a new map, which showed nearly 400 sq kms of India’s areas in Kalapani, Lipulekh Pass and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal. It also got the Nepalese Parliament amend the country’s constitution to endorse the new map. New Delhi suspects that Beijing nudged Kathmandu to ratchet up India-Nepal territorial dispute amid the military stand-off along India-China disputed boundary in eastern Ladakh. Shringla’s visit to Kathmandu was the second high-level visit from India to Nepal this month. The Chief of Indian Army, Gen M M Naravane, visited Kathmandu earlier this month. New Delhi used the Foreign Secretary’s visit to Kathmandu to underline the 'special relations' between India and Nepal and to stress on 'the importance of respecting each other’s sensitivities', sources said. The two sides also discussed on specific measures that could be taken to finalise key projects funded or proposed by the Government of India in Nepal at the earliest, including the Pancheshwar Multi-purpose Project, as well as launch of new economic initiatives.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/top-diplomats-of-india-nepal-discuss-boundary-dispute-920161.html

'Covaxin' is being developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Dr Srivastava was the first one to receive the shot, which would be given to around 15,000 volunteers at the AIIMS over the next few days, sources said. The first dose of 0.5 ml intramuscular injection was given to four volunteers. They were under observation for two hours and will be monitored for the next few days, a source said. When contacted, Dr Srivastava said, "Covaxin is the first indigenously-developed anti-coronavirus vaccine and on top of that, my institute is participating in the trial. I am honoured to be the first volunteer to receive the shot. I am happy to be a part of such a great cause. I am perfectly fine and I'm working." As part of the trial application, a dose of 0.5 ml would be given on day 0 and on day 28, sources said. The phase-three randomised double-blind placebo-controlled multi-centre trial would cover around 28,500 subjects aged 18 years and above. It would be conducted in around 25 sites across 10 states. The trial has already started at a few sites. The Bharat Biotech has been given the permission for conducting phase-3 human clinical trials of the Covaxin from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) The safety and immunogenicity data of the phase one and two trials were submitted to the central drug regulator. The Hyderabad-based firm, while applying for phase-three trial, stated that the vaccine was well-tolerated in all dose groups and no serious adverse events have been reported. The most common adverse event was pain at the injection site, which resolved transiently, the source said. Besides, Covaxin, four other vaccines are under different phases of clinical trial in India with the Serum Institute of India conducting phase-three trial of the Oxford-Astrazeneca COVID-19 vaccine while the indigenously developed vaccine by Zydus Cadila has completed phase-two clinical trial in the country.

Tata, who headed the Tata group at the time of the attack in November 2008, wrote, "The wanton destruction that took place 12 years ago today will never be forgotten." After the attacks, which severely damaged the property, he oversaw the restoration work. "But, what is more memorable, is the way Mumbai as a diverse people came together, casting aside all differences, to vanquish the terrorism and destruction on that day," he wrote. Tata, who is now chairman emeritus of Tata Sons — the holding company of the salt-to-software group, hoped the unity and the acts of kindness will continue to shine in the years ahead. "Today, we certainly can mourn the ones we lost and honour the sacrifice of the brave who helped conquer the enemy, but what we must applaud, is the unity and acts of kindness and sensitivity which we should cherish, and which hopefully, will continue to shine in the years ahead," he added. Last year, he had penned a similar tribute to all those who lost their lives. "We can be hurt, but not knocked out," he had written. Echoing similar sentiments, Mahindra and Mahindra Chairman Anand Mahindra on Thursday tweeted, "Mumbaikars won't forget the night of the #2611Attack when the air was filled with uncertainty and insecurity. I remember feeling as if the city and the country were being invaded." Quoting a remark by South African leader late Nelson Mandela -- "I learned that courage was not the absence of fear. But the triumph over it" --  Mahindra added, "But by the end of that week, we brought to life this quote by Mandela. Mumbai — and India — did triumph." On November 26, 2008, 10 Pakistani terrorists belonging to the Lashkar-e-Taiba outfit arrived by sea route and opened fire, killing 166 people, including 18 security personnel, and injuring several others during the 60-hour siege in Mumbai. The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, the Oberoi Trident, the Taj Mahal Hotel, Leopold Cafe, Cama Hospital and the Nariman House Jewish community centre, now renamed Nariman Light House, were some of the places targeted by terrorists. Nine terrorists were later killed by the security forces, including the National Security Guard, the country's elite commando force. Ajmal Kasab was the only terrorist who was captured alive. He was hanged four years later on November 21, 2012.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ratan-tata-pens-heartfelt-note-on-mumbai-on-26/11-anniversary-920166.html

We are witnessing the end of the right to democratic protest. @Akali_Dal condemns the Haryana govt & Centre for choosing to repress the peaceful farmer movement,” said Badal in a tweet. Haryana has completely sealed its borders with Punjab to prevent farmers from entering the state for their onward march to Delhi to protest against the Centre's farm laws. The SAD chief also lashed out at the BJP-led government in Haryana for using water cannons against farmers on the Punjab-Haryana border. “The battle for the rights of Punjab farmers cannot be throttled by using water cannons against them. Our resolve will only strengthen further,” he said. Bathinda MP and former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal also condemned the Haryana government for preventing farmers’ entry to Haryana, saying it is a “murder of democracy.” “Murder of democracy on #ConstitutionDay! Farmers' voices stifled, water cannons used on annadata! I appeal to PM @narendramodi ji to direct Hry CM @mlkhattar ji to let our farmers' march on peacefully to convey their issues to Centre in Delhi. I stand in solidarity with them,” tweeted Harsimrat Kaur. The Haryana Police on Thursday used water cannons and tear gas shells to disperse a group of farmers from Punjab who allegedly tried to jump police barricades to enter Haryana as part of their 'Delhi Chalo' march.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/today-is-punjabs-26/11-sukhbir-singh-badal-on-stopping-farmers-delhi-chalo-march-920187.html

The Chinese and Indian militaries held the 8th round of Corps Commander-level meeting on November 6 to resolve the military standoff that errupted in early May. "Since the 8th round of China-India Corps Commander-level meeting, the situation in the China-India border areas have remained stable on the whole” Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang, spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defence told an online media briefing responding to a question on the current situation at the India-China border. "Following the meeting, China and India have maintained candid and in-depth communication and coordination to promote disengagement in areas along the Line of Actual Control in the western sector of China-India boundary," Ren was quoted as saying by official website of the Ministry of Defence of China. Nearly 50,000 troops of the Indian Army are currently deployed in a high state of combat readiness in various mountainous locations in eastern Ladakh in sub-zero conditions as multiple rounds of talks between the two sides have not yielded any concrete outcome yet to resolve the border standoff. China has also deployed an equal number of troops, according to officials. Ren noted that both sides have agreed to earnestly implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries and ensure their frontline troops exercise restraint and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation. "China is ready to maintain communication with the Indian side through military and diplomatic channels. We hope that the Indian side will work with China towards the same goal, implement bilateral consensus with a sincere attitude and positive actions, so as to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the border areas," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/china-india-in-candid-in-depth-communication-to-disengage-troops-in-eastern-ladakh-chinese-military-920189.html

Maradona will forever be remembered for his "Hand of God" goal against England in the 1986 World Cup quarter-final in Mexico City, when he pushed the ball into the net. The Kerala government on Thursday announced a two-day mourning in the state's sports sector and appealed to everyone in the fraternity to join as a mark of tribute.   Faqir Chand Kohli - FC Kohli, often called the Father of Indian IT industry, passed away on Thursday. He was 96. FC Kohli joined Tata Electric Companies in 1951 and helped to set up the load despatching system to manage the system operations. He became director of Tata Electric Companies in 1970.He was the first CEO of TCS which pioneered India’s IT Revolution and helped the country to build the $100 billion+ IT Industry.   Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday pitched for 'One Nation, One Election', saying it is the need of India as polls taking place every few months impact development works. Addressing the concluding session of the 80th All India Presiding Officers Conference via video conference, Modi also paid homage to the victims of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks and asserted that India is fighting terrorism now with new policy and new process. Noting that it was the biggest terror strike on India, Modi said India can never forget the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.   Twelve years after the 26/11 attack, Pakistan has placed 19 members of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in a list of the "Most Wanted Terrorists" for their role in the heinous assault, but it has not initiated any serious efforts to nab them and also punish seven others who are facing trial in Lahore. The security agencies are clueless about the whereabouts of these 19 most wanted terrorists. Some of them have been hiding in Pakistan and others are believed to have fled the country. These terrorists were either crew members of the boats used by the attackers or financiers of the 26/11 attack.   Two army soldiers were killed in a militant attack on the outskirts of Srinagar on Thursday. Police said militants fired at army men near HMT crossing on Srinagar-Baramulla highway injuring two soldiers, who were shifted to army’s 92-base hospital where they succumbed. Reports said that martyred soldiers belonged to the Road Opening Party. Inspector General of Police Kashmir, Vijay Kumar said that three militants carried out the attack.   Source: DHNS/PTI/ AFP||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-pm-narendra-modi-pitches-for-one-nation-one-election-fc-kohli-passes-away-920190.html

"There are huge renewable energy deployment plans for the next decade," he said, adding that these are likely to generate business prospects of the order of around USD 20 billion per year. "Today, India's renewable power capacity is the fourth largest in the world. It is growing at the fastest speed among all major countries," he said. Renewable energy capacity will rise to 220 GW by 2022 from the current 136 Giga Watts (GW), he added. Renewable energy capacity at present is about 36 per cent of India's total electricity generating capacity. Modi said that after the success of Production Linked Incentives (PLI) in electronics manufacturing, "we have decided to give similar incentives to high-efficiency solar modules". He, however, did not elaborate. Stating that ensuring 'ease of doing business' was the utmost priority, he said a dedicated project development cell has been established to facilitate investors. "In the last six years, we increased our installed renewable energy capacity by two and half times," he said. "Our annual renewable energy capacity addition has been exceeding that of coal-based thermal power since 2017." Even when it was not affordable, investments were made in renewable energy. Now, investments and scale are bringing costs down, he said. Noting that in the last six years, India has been travelling on an unparalleled journey, Modi said, "we are expanding our generation capacity and network to ensure every citizen of India has access to electricity to unlock his full potential".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-renewable-power-capacity-growing-at-fastest-rate-in-the-world-says-pm-modi-920194.html

Malaria No More India (MNM India) is a non-profit organisation working to support India's goal of eliminating malaria by 2030. Times Bridge is the global investment and partnership arm of the Times Group. A free to use feature 'Malaria No More' will allow Android device users to get Google Assistant to provide information on malaria, its symptoms, prevention tips, treatment protocols and other subjects, a statement said on Thursday. To activate this feature, an Android user can command the digital assistant by saying 'Ok Google, talk to Malaria No More' that will prompt the bot to answer questions on malaria in a conversational manner, it added. The feature will be available in Hindi and English, and will answer questions like 'What is malaria fever?', 'What are the types of malaria?', 'How does malaria spread?' and 'How to test for malaria?'. "In this information age, leveraging technology to raise awareness of safety and prevention measures for deadly diseases like malaria can play an important role in improving public health outcomes. "Malaria is a grave issue for the Indian society, affecting thousands of lives and livelihoods, and costing billions in lost economic opportunities," MNM India Country Director Sanjeev Gaikwad said. More than a billion people use Google Assistant worldwide, and more people are now using the Internet in their native languages. Keeping this in mind, MNM India made the feature on Google Assistant available in Hindi and English. Very soon, a third Indian language will be introduced so the information can reach a wider audience, the statement said. Earlier this year, MNM India and Times Bridge collaborated with partners, including Star India, Facebook, Sony Pictures Networks India and WPP, in launching the Bite Ko Mat Lo Lite campaign. The national campaign reached more than 130 million Indians during the recent monsoon season with urgent messages to drive timely prevention, testing and treatment of malaria.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/say-ok-google-talk-to-malaria-no-more-on-android-devices-to-get-info-on-disease-920196.html
26-11-2020||National||Govt issues draft 'Merchant Shipping Bill, 2020' for public consultation||The Centre on Thursday said it has issued draft 'Merchant Shipping Bill, 2020' for public consultation. The proposed legislation aims to repeal and replace the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958. The Merchant Shipping Bill, 2020 has been drafted with the primary aim of promoting the growth of Indian shipping industry by incorporating the best practices adopted by other advanced countries like the US, Japan, UK, Singapore and Australia, the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways said in a statement. "The draft of the Merchant Shipping Bill, 2020 is issued for seeking the feedback and suggestions from the public," it said. All up-to-date International Maritime Organisation (IMO) conventions/protocols, to which India is a party, have been adopted in it. Adequate provisions are incorporated to ensure the safety and security of vessels, safety of life at sea, prevent marine pollution, provide for maritime liabilities and compensations, and ensure comprehensive adoption of India's obligations under international conventions, the statement said. The bill proposes to do away with requirement of general trading license for Indian vessels, enables electronic means of registration, and grants statutory recognition to electronic agreements, records, and log books, in addition to electronic licenses, certificates and payments. It also seeks to increase India's tonnage by widening the eligibility criteria for ownership of vessels and providing for registration of bareboat charter cum demise, thereby increasing opportunities for international trade among others, it added. The Bill seeks to introduce for the first-time statutory framework for regulating maritime emergency response against maritime incidents. The provisions seek to provide for time effective implementation of response mechanisms in order to ensure that the same is prevented from becoming a wreck or other catastrophic event. Provisions for repatriation of abandoned seafarers have been enhanced, in line with the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) regulations, the statement said. The Bill incorporates powers of the Director-General to take action against vessels that are unsafe, and pose a threat to safety of life at sea and environment, and includes a procedure for appeal from detention orders. It also incorporates provisions that encourage active enforcement of pollution prevention standards and the Central government has been granted the power to mandate compulsory insurance or such other financial security, for pollution damage. The Bill seeks to provide increased opportunities for investment and provide greater impetus to a self-reliant domestic investment climate in the maritime industry. The provisions regulating maritime education, training, certification and recruitment and placement of seafarers and ease of registration of ships under the Indian flag will give an impetus to the quality and quantity of Indian seafarers, it said. Consequently, it will boost employment opportunities for Indian seafarers in the national and international market. The benefits will be extended to ancillary sectors connected with the shipping industry in consonance with 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' initiative of the government, the ministry said. It has been a priority of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to replace all archaic colonial laws with modern and contemporary international laws with active participation of people to enhance transparency in the governance. For the same, the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways recently issued two draft Bills for public consultation, namely 'Aids to Navigation Bill 2020' and 'Coastal Shipping Bill 2020', and now this historical 'Draft Merchant Shipping Bill 2020' is being issued, within a short span of time of four months, the statement said. Besides, Major Port Authorities Bill 2020 is also under the consideration of Rajya Sabha, which has been already passed by Lok Sabha in the last Parliament session. All these Bills are going to generate sweeping waves in the maritime scenario, moving India towards a fully developed maritime economy, it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-issues-draft-merchant-shipping-bill-2020-for-public-consultation-920199.html

The 24-hour strike was total in several industrial clusters in Karnataka, Telangana, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi while the unions claimed most of the workers in Kolkata, Chennai, Tuticorin, Kochi, Visakhapatnam and Paradip ports did not attend work. Strike was near total in the Bengaluru-based public sector units and also to a great extent in the PSUs in Hyderabad region, the trade unions said. The nationwide protest coincided with the 'Dilli Chalo' protest by farmers' organisations against the controversial farm laws enacted by the government recently. While the RSS-affiliated BMS is not participating in the strike, ten other central trade unions -- INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF and UTUC -- called the protest demanding cash transfer of Rs 7,500 per month for all non-income tax paying families, 10 kg free ration per person per month to all needy, expansion of MGNREGA to provide 200 days work in a year in rural areas at enhanced wages, and extension of employment guarantee to urban areas. The trade unions are also demanding withdrawal of "all anti-farmer laws and anti-worker labour codes", stoppage of privatisation of public sector and corporatisation of government-run manufacturing and service entities like Railways, Ordnance Factories and Ports and withdrawal of premature retirement of Government and PSU employees. It also wants pension to all, scrapping the National Pension Scheme and restoration of earlier pension schemes. The scheme workers, electricity employees, domestic workers, construction workers, beedi workers, hawkers, vendors, agricultural workers, self employed in rural and urban India held demonstrations at various places, even defying police restrictions, the statement said. "They are forming human chains instead, like in Mumbai and various other districts in Maharashtra. At many places, the auto and taxi drivers have remained off the roads," they said. The unions alleged that BJP workers with the "tacit support" of the party-led government in Tripura tried to open shops, failing which they attacked and ransacked the offices of the trade unions and the Left parties which supported the strike. "Around 700 construction workers were arrested across the country, including in Odisha and West Bengal. ‘Preventive arrests’ of CITU leaders were made in Krishna and West Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh. Trade union activists and leaders were arrested in several other states including Telangana," CITU said in a separate statement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/at-least-25-crore-workers-participated-in-general-strike-some-states-saw-complete-shutdown-trade-unions-920200.html

The party's manifesto for the GHMC elections, scheduled on December 1, also assures Rs 25,000 relief for the flood-affected families, and one lakh houses for the poor under the PM Awas Yojana, if elected to power. For families who already received Rs 10,000 aid (as announced by the TRS government), rest Rs 15,000 would be credited, the BJP says. In a controversial assurance, the party document also says that all challans of traffic violations pending on two and three-wheelers would be waived. The announcement earlier made by state unit chief Bandi Sanjay came under severe criticism, especially from the TRS, which accused the BJP of encouraging rule violations. BJP's other promises include free drinking water, free power to hair cutting saloons, laundries, weavers, and other artisans. The party at the same time says it will control electricity theft in the old city. “Theft of power worth Rs 600 crore happens annually there, but the present government is afraid of booking cases in old city areas. We will put a check to this.” Telangana Liberation Day The party's state unit, which has been demanding the K Chandrasekhar Rao government to celebrate the Hyderabad Liberation Day, said it would conduct September 17 events officially if elected to the mayor post in Hyderabad. The erstwhile Hyderabad state of the Nizam, comprising areas in Telangana, Karnataka and Maharashtra, was joined with Indian union on September 17, 1948, after a “police action” called Operation Polo. The BJP credits the merger to the firm vision and decision of then home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The party also promised to build a memorial in Hyderabad “for the people who laid down their lives for Telangana's liberation from a tyrannical rule.” Releasing the manifesto at the BJP office on Thursday, Maharashtra former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said: “he fails to understand why the Hyderabad Liberation Day is not commemorated by the TRS government.” “We will celebrate September 17 as Mukti Diwas,” Fadnavis said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hyderabad-polls-bjp-promises-range-from-free-metro-bus-travel-for-women-to-tabs-for-school-kids-920210.html

Kadam, who was then attached as a special officer with D B Marg police station, recalls the sequence of events that led to the capture of terrorist Ajmal Kasab, which proved crucial to combat terrorists who had entered the city from the sea route. In an interview to a web channel, Kadam said that Kasab's interrogation at the time revealed the scale of the attacks, weapons being used, the number of people involved. "This critical information helped the security agencies and a joint operation was launched by the National Security Guard (NSG) and Mumbai police, in which terrorists got killed. Otherwise, I cannot imagine, how many people could have been killed in the attacks," he said. Kadam was part of a 16-member police team, which was on 'nakabandi' duty at Girguam Chowpatty to intercept the car in which Kasab and another terrorist were travelling. As the car hijacked by the terrorists approached them, it stopped 50 feet short of the checkpoint, and firing ensued, he said. Kadam recalled pulling out his service pistol and firing three rounds at the driver's seat of the vehicle, shooting one of the terrorists in the head. "From the other side, a team including assistant sub- inspector Tukaram Ombale rushed to catch Kasab, who was sitting next to the driver," Kadam said. Just as Ombale caught hold of Kasab, the latter opened fire from his AK-47 rifle that hit him in the chest, the official said. "But the policemen managed to overpower Kasab with their lathis," he said. It was inspector Sanjay Govilkar's decision to capture Kasab alive, as he could give the police vital information about terrorists and their plan, Kadam said. On November 26, 2008, 10 Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists from Pakistan arrived by sea route and opened fire, killing 166 people, including 18 security personnel, and injuring several others during the 60-hour siege in Mumbai. The then Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) chief Hemant Karkare, Army Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, Mumbai's Additional Police Commissioner Ashok Kamte, Senior Police Inspector Vijay Salaskar and Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Tukaram Omble were among those killed in the attack. The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, the Oberoi Trident, the Taj Mahal Hotel, Leopold Cafe, Cama Hospital and the Nariman House Jewish community centre, now renamed Nariman Light House, were some of the places targeted by terrorists. Nine terrorists were later killed by the security forces, including the NSG, the country's elite commando force. Kasab, the only terrorist to be captured alive, was hanged four years later on November 21, 2012.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/26/11-attacks-cop-recalls-events-leading-to-kasabs-capture-920211.html

The court did not agree to a contention by the company that it should not face any criminal case since the top court had earlier stayed the Rs 500 crore fine imposed upon it by the National Green Tribunal. "The order of the NGT passed on the applications filed by certain individuals not claiming as purchasers of vehicles cannot be taken as an impediment for an individual who purchased cars from the manufacturers, to lodge a complaint, if he has actually suffered on account of any representation," the bench said. The top court also pointed out that the Allahabad High Court by its order on October 1, 2020, rejected the plea for quashing of the FIR lodged in Gautam Buddh Nagar on July 10, 2020, but it had protected the company officials from arrest till the filing of chargesheet, provided they cooperated in the investigation.  The company also contended that the complaint filed against it after more than two years of purchase was malicious. It also alleged that the complainant claimed to have bought seven Audi cars but the Vahan portal of the Union government showed him to have purchased three cars. To this, the court said the mere delay in lodging the complaint cannot by itself be a ground to quash the FIR. With regard to the number of cars bought by the complainant, the court said this can be ascertained only in the course of investigation or trial.  "In a petition for quashing the FIR, the court cannot go into disputed questions of fact," the bench said. The petitioner is responsible for the business operations of five automobile brands: Skoda, Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche and Lamborgini. The company faced global outrage following the "diesel gate scandal".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-dismisses-volkswagens-plea-against-fir-for-cheat-emission-devices-920214.html
26-11-2020||National||President Ram Nath Kovind flags litigation cost as topmost hurdle in access to justice||President Ram Nath Kovind Thursday said cost of litigation is the "topmost" hurdle in improving "access to justice for all" and joined Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad in hailing the efforts of the judiciary and the bar for not letting the coronavirus pandemic come in the way of fulfilling the duty of securing justice for citizens. Two separate virtual events were organised by the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court Bar Association to celebrate the 71st anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution. Speaking at the function organised by the top court, Kovind said that the cost involved in litigation was the "topmost" hurdle in improving "access to justice for all". He expressed happiness over the functioning of the apex court amid the pandemic, using technological solutions like video-conferencing and e-filing. The law minister, while hailing the judiciary for hearing over 49 lakh cases digitally during the challenging times of Covid-19 pandemic in the country, expressed dismay over the growing criticism, especially of the top court for its judgements. He said unleashing of criticism of the Supreme Court for its judicial functions and use of expressions like "judicial barbarism" in criticising judgements or orders were unacceptable. "There may be shortcomings, but we need to be proud of our judiciary as it has held the hands of the poor and the underprivileged... Of late, there has been a disturbing trend. Some people have a view as to how a particular case filed the judgement should be. Then there are narratives in newspapers and campaigns in social media as to what kind of judgement should have come. "Very gently I must comment today that expressions like judicial barbarism are totally unacceptable. Regardless of the stature of those who mentioned these things about our judiciary," Prasad said. Chief Justice of India S A Bobde, in his addresses at both the functions, underlined the challenges faced by the judiciary during the pandemic and said that India's top court has fared much better than many other supreme courts of other countries. Justice Bobde said that nothing is conferred as right of freedom of speech in "absolute and untrammelled terms" and the framers of the Constitution have struck a resilient balance between liberty and the rights and conditions on which the states can deny it. "The judiciary has been entrusted with the balancing of the interest of the state and freedom granted by the Constitution to the people," he said, adding "It has to the large extent operated on the wisdom of the old saying while balancing rights that your right to swing your arms end where my nose begins." He said that the restrictions on freedom of speech are in the interest of reputation of individuals and institutions. The CJI said the judiciary has worked hard through the pandemic and its commitment to ensuring that access of justice is maintained to all the citizens. He said the courts have faced some unprecedented challenges during the pandemic and the choice was very clear -- either to switch to virtual conferencing or to shut down the courts completely. The court had to deal with difficult situations pertaining to migrants, woeful situations of dead bodies of dying men and women....etc, he said. "The decision was taken to simply release prisoners, even those undergoing incarceration in detention centres in Assam. The hearings of video conferencing have given rise to a new issue of inequalities and these are extremely difficult to deal with," he said. The Law minister referred to statistics about number of cases heard digitally by courts and said that Supreme Court has either heard or disposed of close to 30,000 cases digitally. "But in spite of all these challenges, let me today compliment the judiciary as a whole. I would wish to share some statistics. This is as of October 2020... The Supreme Court has heard and disposed of or in the process of hearing close to 30,000 cases digitally. The high courts have heard 13.74 lakh cases digitally and the district courts have heard 35.93 lakh digitally. This has been a digital profile of hearing of cases," Prasad said. He said that nine virtual courts have been set all over the country to hear traffic violation cases and they have disposed of 31 lakh cases and also raised fines. Attorney General K K Venugopal suggested that there should be four intermediate courts of appeal with 15 judges each in the four corners of the country for ensuring access to justice by all. Earlier in the day, Venugopal stressed on the need to fill up vacancies in the subordinate judiciary and to deal with the problem of huge pendency of cases, saying collective effort was needed to see that the justice delivery system is able to "wipe every tear from every eye". Venugopal said as per national judicial data grid, around 3.61 crore cases are pending as on today in courts across the country and the "extremely sad" part is that around 4.29 lakh cases are pending for over 30 years. Besides Venugopal, Bobde, Prasad and others including several judges of the apex court, SCBA president Dushyant Dave and lawyers were present at the virtual programme of the bar association.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/president-ram-nath-kovind-flags-litigation-cost-as-topmost-hurdle-in-access-to-justice-920218.html
26-11-2020||National||India sees highest drop in work, social, household travels due to Covid-19: Survey||Amid the global wave of Covid-19 in the past nine months, India saw the highest drop in work, social and household travels among nine countries, including China and the US, reflecting the disruptive changes brought about by the pandemic in the patterns of mobility across the world, according to survey consultancy firm EY. The changing mobility pattern has further raised pertinent questions about the nature and shape of cities and transport networks. "Amid this health crisis, the consumer is heavily conflicted over mobility; not having to commute to work has given many a new sense of autonomy as well as a few hours of their time back every day," EY said in a statement. As far as India is concerned, the survey found that the country "witnessed the highest drop in work travel of nearly 69 per cent, followed almost parallelly by social travel that declined by 59 per cent and household travel that fell by 58 per cent". "The drops are substantial, as India which is the world's biggest democracy with a population of 138 crore, parallels the levels of work-related decline of 70 per cent in a small country of Sweden with a population of only a crore," it added. "The survey results also indicate an overall reduction in average weekly travel time by 40 per cent from 6 hours to 3.7 hours per person," it added. EY India Partner and Automotive Sector Leader Vinay Raghunath said, "The change in mobility industry dynamics and consumer behaviour will push sector stakeholders to think through new operating models that leverage digital platforms and help ride the next wave of mobility growth." EY had conducted a survey, as part of the Mobility Consumer Index, this month with 3,300 consumers across nine countries, including India, China, the US and the UK, to explore the impact of Covid-19 on consumer attitudes and behaviour towards mobility. Five hundred respondents from India participated in the survey. Of the nine countries surveyed, EY said India and Singapore have witnessed the maximum decline in average weekly commute time. "India felt the steepest decline of more than 5 hours, from 81 per cent to just 27 per cent, while in Singapore, it fell from 61 per cent to 19 per cent," it said. EY added that a long-term decline in commuting time could mean a lower peak demand and less strain on public transport systems and road networks. It also said, "This profuse reduction in use of public transport and road networks brings forth a challenging situation for the trains, buses and subway operators that find it difficult to generate enough revenue to meet their operational costs." EY said one of the few positive impacts of the early days of the pandemic due to the lockdown was the sudden drop in air pollution in large cities. "Emissions fell drastically, skies cleared and the residents of New York, London, Shanghai, Mumbai and other major metro cities that are usually traffic-clogged global cities enjoyed clean air for the first time in decades," it said. EY's analysis indicates that monthly per-capita emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) fell globally across all three travel segments, broadly tracking the decline in journey numbers already noted. Emissions fell substantially, by 56 per cent for work travel, 58 per cent for social and household travel and 62 per cent for leisure and entertainment, the statement said. EY India Partner (Automotive Sector) Som Kapoor said the changed scenario with regard to reduced emissions points towards the need for newer non-polluting mobility avenues like electric vehicles. "Rightly directed efforts will certainly catapult the growth of this much-awaited mobility model," Kapoor added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-sees-highest-drop-in-work-social-household-travels-due-to-covid-19-survey-920224.html

Kerkar alias Ajay Ajit Peter was arrested in Mumbai under various sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and will be produced before a court there on Friday. The case relates to ED's money laundering probe in which the central probe agency had said that Yes Bank had a total outstanding of Rs 3,642 crore against Cox & Kings Group of Companies (CKG). The role of Kerkar is under probe with regard to alleged loan defaults with a number of banks including the Yes Bank, official sources said. The agency had raided a number to former executives of the beleaguered tours and travel services firm along with Kerkar in June as part of multiple searches conducted by it in Mumbai. It has also arrested its ex-chief financial officer Anil Khandelwal and internal auditor Naresh Jain in October in this case. The company at present is undergoing corporate insolvency resolution process. The ED had alleged Khandelwal and Jain had "purchased various immovable properties from the funds diverted from Cox & Kings Group (CKG)." "CKG forged its consolidated financials by manipulating the balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries. In addition, some board resolutions submitted to banks for sanctioning the loans were also found to be forged," the ED had claimed. Probe revealed that the loan sanction from Yes bank was driven by the then CMD Rana Kapoor and was given "bypassing" the norms, it said. "ED gathered the evidences regarding clear instruction of Rana Kapoor to the concerned bank officials to get the said loan continued and not to take efforts to recover it," it alleged. "During financial year 2015-2019, sales of Rs 3,908 crore was made to 15 non-existent/fictitious customers," the ED had said after it arrested the two. It had said Cox & King Limited "diverted Rs 1,100 crore to another stressed company without any approval of board which has no business relationship with the company." Yes Bank co-promoter Rana Kapoor and and DHFL promoters Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan have been arrested in this case by the ED early this year. It had booked Kapoor, his family members and others under the PMLA after studying a CBI FIR that alleged that dubious multi-crore loans were given by Yes Bank to various entities in contravention of the law and in lieu of purported kickbacks given to the Kapoor family.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ed-arrests-cox-and-kings-promoter-peter-kerkar-in-money-laundering-case-920227.html

Addressing the Global R&D Summit-2020, organised by FICCI and Department of Science & Technology, Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel, said the government's continuous focus on innovation and skilling will go a long way in the holistic development of the country. Dwelling on the importance of harnessing of space technology for greater common good, the minister said though India was a late starter in the space journey, in the last four-five years, space technology has become part of infrastructure building and promotion and its benefits have reached every household. He was speaking on the topic of 'Building Resilient Economy'. Singh referred to some of the path-breaking historic reforms in the Department of Space under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying possibly for the first time in the history of Independent India, future projects for planetary exploration, outer space travel etc. will be open for the private sector. "This, he said, is also a part of the Modi government's ‘Atma Nirbhar’ roadmap towards self-reliant India, which envisages the initiative to boost private sector participation in space activities," a statement issued by the Personnel Ministry said. Singh said private companies will be provided a level playing field in satellite launches and space-based activities. The minister said with the creation of Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe), there will be a mechanism in place and the private sector will be allowed to use ISRO's facilities and other relevant assets to improve their capacities. Expressing confidence that North East India will take a big leap in the post-Covid era both in the economic and tourism sector, Singh said when main tourist spots of the world still remain infested with the coronavirus, the N-E region could emerge as a tourist destination of the world by remaining "Corona-free virtually", it said. Similarly, the minister said huge bamboo resources in the NE and its multi-dimensional usage has a great potential to reshape the economy of the region, the statement said. "In this regard, he referred to the amendment to the 100-year-old Indian Forest Act brought about by the Modi government in 2017, as a result of which, home grown bamboo has been exempted from it in order to enhance livelihood opportunities through bamboo," it said. C P Gurnani, CEO and MD of Tech Mahindra and Gopal Vittal, CEO of Airtel also addressed the session and endorsed the minister's idea of collaboration between government and the private sector for making India a leader in space technology and space communications, according to the statement. On the occasion, Singh also launched the FICCI publication on "Science Meets Industry".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-will-play-lead-role-in-rebuilding-economy-in-post-covid-era-jitendra-singh-920244.html
26-11-2020||National||Another 26/11-like attack in India almost impossible: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh||A 26/11-like terror strike in India is almost impossible as the national security architecture has been significantly bolstered in the last few year, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Thursday, the 12th anniversary of the deadly Mumbai attack in which 166 people including 28 foreigners from 10 nations were killed. While addressing the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, Singh also referred to the Sino-India border row in Ladakh, and said the armed forces have been given a free hand to effectively deal with any attempts to change the Line of Actual Control and that the government will not allow any harm to India's self respect. "I want to assure everyone that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration, there will be no compromise on India's self-respect, sovereignty and territorial integrity," he said. Referring to the 26/11 attack, Singh said India is no more a soft target for terrorism due to variety of measures in the last few years, and added that Pakistan has been exposed as "nursery of terrorism" following diplomatic outreach by New Delhi. "We can assure all the countrymen that now India has strengthened its internal and external security cycle so much that it is now almost impossible to execute another 26/11 attack on Indian soil," Singh said. On November 26, 2008, a group of 10 Pakistani terrorists went into a rampage, carrying out a coordinated attack on a railway station, two luxury hotels and a Jewish centre, after they sneaked into India's financial capital through the Arabian sea route. Over 166 people including 28 foreigners from 10 nations were killed in the nearly 60-hour seige that sent shockwave across the country and even brought India and Pakistan to the brink of a war. "Now India's response to terrorism has been under a 360 degree approach. India is taking action within its borders. But, if needed, our brave soldiers are going beyond that to destroy the terrorist bases," the defence minister said. The defence minister also referred to the failed attempts by Pakistan-based terrorists to carry out a major attack in Nagrota in Jammu and Kashmir recently. "Whether it was the surgical strike after the Uri incident or the Balakot air strikes after the Pulwama attack, our armed forces have taken drastic action to deal with terrorism," Singh said. "Pakistan's model of terrorism against India is slowly being demolished...We have escalated the cost for those supporting terrorism, and countries like Pakistan may have to pay a heavy price for making terrorism a state policy," Singh said. The defence minister also said a 'blacklisting' of Pakistan by global anti-terror watchdog FATF will prove to be highly costly for that country which is already reeling under financial stress. The 26/11 attack had given a new direction to India's security policy, and there has been a "paradigm shift" in naval and coastal security architecture since then, the minister added. On the border row with China, the defence minister said there was a perceptional difference over the LAC and problem arises when laid down protocols are violated. "I am assuring everyone that nobody can claim even an inch of India's land," Singh said. On assembly elections in West Bengal next year, Singh said there was a possibility of BJP getting two-thirds majority. In the nearly 45-minute-long interactive session, Singh delved into a plethora of issues including farmers' agitation, India's defence modernisation programme, situation in Jammu and Kashmir and threat of hybrid warfare. "Civil-military coordination has improved a lot after the removal of Section 370 in J&K. We are seeing a positive improvement there. Similarly, in the North-East too, there has been continuous improvement in the security situation," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/another-26/11-like-attack-in-india-almost-impossible-defence-minister-rajnath-singh-920247.html

The decision was taken at a high-level review meeting chaired by Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal on Thursday. "A seminal decision was made to start technical education, especially engineering courses, imparting education in mother tongue (and this) will be opened from next academic year. A few IIT and NIT are being short listed for the same,” a senior ministry official said. In the meeting, it was also decided that the National Testing Agency (NTA) will come out with the syllabus for competitive examinations after assessing the existing scenario of school education boards. The NTA, which conducts the JEE(Main) and NEET-UG among others, will come out with the syllabus for competitive examinations, it was decided in the meeting. "The University Grants Commission has also been directed to ensure all scholarships, fellowships are disbursed in time and to start a helpline for the same and address all grievances of the students immediately,” the official said. The NTA had last month announced its decision to conduct the JEE (Main) in nine regional languages, apart from Hindi and English from 2021. However, the IITs are yet to take up the matter so far on whether the JEE (Advanced) will also be offered in regional language. The need to assess the school education scenario before coming out with syllabus arises because many boards, including national boards like CBSE and CISCE, have rationalised their exam syllabus due to the COVID-19 situation and subsequent academic loss due to schools being closed since March 2020.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-next-academic-year-technical-courses-to-be-offered-in-regional-languages-920249.html

The comments came after AstraZeneca and Oxford University acknowledged a manufacturing error that is raising questions about preliminary results of their experimental Covid-19 vaccine. A statement describing the error came days after the company and the university described the shots as "highly effective" and made no mention of why some study participants did not receive as much vaccine in the first of two shots as expected. Asking people to be patient and not panic, the Serum Institute of India (SII) said in a statement, "The AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is safe and effective. Even the lowest efficacy results are at 60-70%, making it a viable vaccine against the virus." That said, varied age groups with different dosage forms will result in slight variations and efficacy. "We must be patient and not panic," it added. SII is conducting clinical trials of AstraZeneca-Oxford's Covid-19 vaccine candidate in India. "The Indian trials are running smoothly with strict adherence to all the necessary processes and protocols. So far, there are no concerns. However, we are going through the data that is available and will make further statement, if needed," SII said. Earlier this week, AstraZeneca said an interim analysis of clinical trials of its Covid-19 vaccine in the UK and Brazil showed that it was 70 per cent effective on average, becoming the third drugmaker to announce promising results to contain the deadly virus. The company had also said that the vaccine, developed with the University of Oxford, showed 90 per cent efficacy in one dosing regimen when the vaccine was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least a month later, while another dosing regimen showed 62 per cent efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart. "The combined analysis from both dosing regimens resulted in an average efficacy of 70 per cent," it had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/astrazeneca-oxford-vaccine-safe-indian-trials-progressing-smoothly-serum-institute-920252.html

Speaking at the Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Supreme Court, he said "there may be shortcomings, but we need to be proud of our judiciary as it has held the hands of the poor and the underprivileged." "Of late there has been a disturbing trend. Some people have a view as to how on a particular case filed the judgement should be. Then there are narratives in newspapers and campaign in social media as to what kind of judgement should have come. "Very gently I must comment today that the expressions like judicial barbarism is totally unacceptable. Regardless of the stature of those who mentioned these things about our judiciary," Prasad said at the function in which President Ram Nath Kovind delivered the inaugural address. The Law Minister said if the judiciary has to be independent then the judges have to be left free and the justice delivery system cannot play to the gallery. Prasad said the coronavirus pandemic has affected everyone and asked people to pledge that vaccine will be first provided to the healthcare workers who have been at the frontlines. He said till October, the top court heard nearly 30,000 cases digitally during the pandemic whereas nearly 50 lakh cases in total have been heard digitally across all the courts. Prasad congratulated the judges for rising to the occasion during the pandemic and continuing the work despite great inhibiting circumstances. Chief Justice S A Bobde said the judiciary has worked hard through the pandemic and its commitment to ensuring that access of justice is maintained to all the citizens. Bobde said he would like to address the President as a person who has been undeniably the most popular advocate of India. He said the courts have faced some unprecedented challenges during the pandemic and the choice was very clear -- either to switch to virtual conferencing or to shut down the courts completely. The court had to deal with difficult situations pertaining to migrants, woeful situations of dead bodies of dying men and women....etc, he said. "The decision was taken to simply release prisoners, even those undergoing incarceration in detention centres in Assam. The hearings of video conferencing have given rise to a new issue of inequalities and these are extremely difficult to deal with," he said. Attorney General K K Venugopal suggested that there should be four intermediate courts of appeal with 15 judges each in the four corners of the country for ensuring access to justice by all.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/prasad-unhappy-over-scs-criticism-asks-people-not-to-use-terms-like-judicial-barbarism-920285.html
26-11-2020||National||India had estimated 74 million Covid-19 infections by August: ICMR's 2nd national serosurvey||Nearly seven per cent of India's population aged ten and above was exposed to SARS-CoV-2, amounting to an estimated 74.3 million infections by August, with the seroprevalence being highest in urban slum areas followed by urban non-slum and rural areas, the findings of ICMR's second national serosurvey stated. According to the findings which have appeared in the Lancet Global Health pre-print, the overall seroprevalence of below 10 per cent in India indicates that a large proportion of the population remains susceptible to novel coronavirus infection.  "The transmission of infection is expected to continue in most Indian states till the herd immunity threshold is achieved, either by natural infection or vaccination. While this threshold is unknown, most estimates place it above 50 per cent," the report said. It stated that one in nine individuals who did not report any Covid-19-related symptoms in the past had the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, indicating asymptomatic seroconversion among the general population in India.  Seroconversion was also documented among individuals without a history of known contact with a Covid-19 case, and among those without any prior SARS-CoV-2 testing.  "Our data supports the expansion of testing strategies to include individuals without having known exposure or symptoms. We found only 3 per cent of seropositive individuals reported Covid-19 symptoms highlighting the limitations of symptom directed testing and the importance of universal prevention methods," the report stated.  "Nearly one in 15 individuals aged ten years and above had SARS-CoV-2 infection by August 2020. The adult seroprevalence increased ten times between May and August 2020. Lower infection to case ratio in August compared to May reflects a substantial increase in testing across the country," the findings stated.   Also, 26–32 infections were reported per case diagnosed in August 2020 as against 82-131 in May 2020, when the first round of serosurvey was conducted, underlining the consequence of the growth of testing outpacing the growth of infections.    The seroprevalence was higher in slum areas of Mumbai (57·8 per cent) compared to non-slum areas (17·4 per cent). While population density coupled with high mobility, and challenges in safe distancing and hand hygiene are the main drivers of spread of infection in urban areas, especially urban slums, the findings of the serosurvey also indicate substantial transmission among the rural population now, in contrast to the first round, the report stated. "Transmission will increase further in these rural areas in the coming months, underscoring the need for implementing nonpharmaceutical interventions as well as strengthening healthcare facilities for the effective management of cases," it said. Of the 29,082 individuals tested for the presence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, 3,135 tested positive, with an unweighted seroprevalence of 10·8 per cent.  Of the 29,082 people (aged 10 and above) surveyed from August 17 to September 22, 6.6 per cent showed evidence of past exposure to Covid-19 while the seroprevalence among adults was 7·1 per cent. The seroprevalence was similar across age groups, sex, and occupation, the report said The IgG positivity across districts ranged between 0·5 per cent (Palakkad in Kerala, Kullu in Himachal Pradesh), and 42·5 per cent (Ganjam in Odisha). The study indicate that the seroprevalence among adults has increased by about ten-fold, from 0·73 per cent in May 2020 to 7·1 per cent during August 2020.  All 70 districts showed a rise in IgG seropsitivity between the two surveys, although the change is highly variable.  ] While the study is not powered to provide reliable district-level estimates, some of the variations observed matches known context.  For example, the largest increase was recorded from Ganjam district which is also reporting the highest number of Covid-19 cases in Odisha state subsequent to migration of inter- and intra-state informal workers, and challenges in facility-based quarantine. Inter-state migration of informal workers is also thought to explain the substantial rise in seroprevalence in all six districts in Bihar, and Kamrup Metropolitan district in Assam.  The first nationwide serosurvey in India was conducted in May, when the entire country was under stringent lockdown, with the exception of conditional relaxation in areas deemed to be minimally affected, and indicated a low prevalence of 0·73 per cent among the general adult population.    The second household serosurve  was conducted among individuals aged ten years and above in the same 700 villages and wards from 70 districts selected during the first serosurvey||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-had-estimated-74-million-covid-19-infections-by-august-icmrs-2nd-national-serosurvey-920286.html

She also said that she would never allow Bengal to be turned into Gujarat, plagued with riots. Speaking to reporters at the State Secretariat the Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo said that those who come and settle in Bengal peacefully were welcome but those who come to the state to indulge in thuggery and riots were outsiders. “Those come here only ahead of the elections to resort to thuggery, incite riots and disrupt peace are outsiders. Bengal has no place for such outsiders,” said Mamata. Lashing out at BJP for claiming that they would turn Bengal into Gujarat, Mamata said she would never allow Bengal to be turned to “riot-torn Gujarat.” “BJP is saying that the would turn Bengal into Gujarat. Who are they to say such things. We don’t want Bengal to turn into riot-torn Gujarat. We don’t want any riots in Bengal,” said Banerjee. Her comments come days after BJP decided to divide the state into five organisational zones and put five Central leaders from other states in charge of them ahead of the Assembly elections next year. Taking a dig at Union Home Minister Amit Shah, the TMC supremo said that he was busy with elections even when there was trouble at the borders. “I have never seen such a Home Minister in my political career,” said Banerjee. As for BJP’s agitation and subsequent clash with police during their protest demanding that the newly constructed Majherhat bridge in Kolkata be opened for public by the state government she said that it was “all drama” and BJP leaders were just trying to draw media attention. “For the last nine months, we were pleading with the Railways to give its clearance so that Majherhat bridge can be opened for public.

But you should not go out to air your grievances. If you want to do that, you can leave the party,” Singh said amid discontentment in the party over successive electoral losses. Senior leaders Kapil Sibal, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Anand Sharma, among others, have expressed concern over the Congress’ performance in the Bihar assembly elections and hit out at lack of introspection within the party to revive the moribund organisation. The Punjab Chief Minister rejected charges of lack of inner-party democracy in the Congress and pointed out that Congress President Sonia Gandhi had not penalised anyone who had raised a voice of dissent but had, in fact, made then members of various committees, in the true spirit of democracy, to bring in reforms. Singh also rejected suggestions for change in party leadership in the light of the Bihar election results. “Sonia Gandhi will remain the leader as long as she wants, after which the new leader will be elected. There is no need for change at this juncture,” the veteran leader said, adding that one should not read too much in the Bihar poll verdict. He said victory and defeat were part of the process of an actual democracy and expressed confidence that Congress could come back into power in 2024.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/dissenters-free-to-leave-congress-amarinder-singh-920256.html

In a late evening statement, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation said no metro services will be available from Anand Vihar to Vaishali and New Ashok Nagar to Noida City Centre during this period. The metro services will also be suspended between Sultanpur and Guru Dronacharya metro stations. However, regular metro services will remain available in the entire section of Airport and Rapid Metro lines during the period. "After 2 pm on Thursday, train services will resume on all Lines from end to end without loops regularly," it added. Earlier in the day, Delhi Police said it has rejected requests received from various farmer organisations to protest in the national capital against the contentious laws on November 26 and 27. "Various farmer organisations have requested permission for protest in Delhi on November 26 and 27. We have conveyed to them in writing and through various media also that the protest is not permitted in view of the latest DDMA guidelines," Delhi Police PRO Eish Singhal said||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-protest-delhi-metro-services-to-neighbouring-cities-suspended-till-2-pm-today-920000.html
26-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality 'very poor', improvement predicted||Delhi's air quality was recorded in the “very poor” category on Thursday and government agencies said it is likely to improve as the wind speed picks up. The city's air quality index was 374 at 9 am on Thursday. The 24-hour average AQI was 413 on Wednesday, 379 on Tuesday and 295 on Monday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board data. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said Delhi-NCR's air quality is likely to improve to the lower end of the “very poor” category on Thursday. The predominant surface wind direction was northerly and the maximum wind speed is likely to be 10 kmph on Thursday, it said. The central agency said the AQI is likely to reach the “poor” category on Friday. The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring states to Delhi's PM2.5 levels was just two per cent on Wednesday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR. The minimum temperature was 10.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday. The maximum temperature is likely to settle around 23 degrees Celsius, the weather department said. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.  Delhi's ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 8,000 m2/s on Thursday and is likely to be 7,000 m2/s on Friday. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-very-poor-improvement-predicted-920051.html
26-11-2020||North and Central||Haryana seals borders with Punjab as farmers assemble for 'Delhi Chalo' march||Haryana on Thursday completely sealed its borders with Punjab as farmers from the neighbouring state started assembling in large numbers as part of their 'Delhi Chalo' march to protest the Centre's new farm laws. There was heavy deployment of Haryana police on the borders with Punjab, officials said. The Haryana Police in adequate strength has also been deployed along the state's borders with Delhi, they said. The BJP government in Haryana had said that it would seal its borders with Punjab on November 26-27 in view of the farmers' march to Delhi. The Delhi Police had on Wednesday asserted that it had rejected requests received from various farmer organisations to protest in the national capital against the Centre's new farm laws on November 26 and 27. A day earlier, it had said that legal action would be taken against the protesting farmers if they come to the city for any gathering amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda) president Buta Singh Burjgill on Thursday said farmers are ready for their Delhi Chalo protest. “We are ready to move towards Delhi to force the central government to scrap its black laws which are not in the interest of the farming community,” he said. Punjab farmers, representing over 30 farm bodies, have announced to go towards the national capital through many routes, including Lalru, Shambhu, Patiala-Pehowa, Patran-Khanauri, Moonak-Tohana, Ratia-Fatehabad and Talwandi-Sirsa. The farmers protesting against the Centre's farm laws are assembling near Haryana borders with tractor-trolleys carrying ration and essentials for their proposed Delhi march.   They have also condemned the Manohar Lal Khattar government in Haryana for sealing the state borders.  In Haryana, police had used water cannons twice in Ambala and Kurukshetra districts on Wednesday to disperse a group of protesting farmers and stop them from going to Delhi. The Haryana authorities have also imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC in several parts of the state to prevent assembly of protesters. Meanwhile, braving the cold and rainy conditions, thousands of farmers spend the night in temporary shelters and inside their tractor trollies. Farmer bodies said they will hold a dharna wherever stopped from moving towards the national capital. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugarhan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan has said around 25,000 women will participate in the protest march and over 4,000 tractor-trailers have been arranged for it. The BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) has claimed that over two lakh farmers associated with it will enter Haryana through Khanauri and Dabwali. Farmers have brought ration, vegetables, wood and other essentials for their march. In view of cold weather conditions, they have stocked quilts, blankets and covered their trolleys with tarpaulin. Haryana Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Gurnam Singh Charuni had said on Wednesday that “even if police use lathis and force, nothing can stop farmers". "We will continue our march towards Delhi. We will force the Centre to roll back these black anti-farmer laws," he said. Videography, including using drone cameras, is being done at the state borders with Punjab and other sensitive points. The Haryana Police has also put up multi-layered barricades and boulders on the roads from Punjab, officials said. Earlier on Tuesday, a detailed advisory was issued by the Haryana Police, urging commuters to modify their travel plans in view of the farmers protest march. Asserting that farmers from Punjab will not be allowed to enter the state, police said they have deployed water cannons and riot vehicles at the state borders. Opposition Congress in Haryana has slammed the BJP-led government for allegedly trying to muzzle the voice of farmers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/haryana-seals-borders-with-punjab-as-farmers-assemble-for-delhi-chalo-march-920054.html
26-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's poisonous air a perennial crisis of its own making||Thousands of families who live near a smouldering waste landfill in a northern corner of Delhi have boarded up their doors and windows because they say the air outside is so toxic that they would be coughing all day. Among all the capitals in the world, New Delhi has the worst air, according to IQ AirVisual, a Swiss-based group that gathers air quality data globally. Jahangirpuri is one of its most polluted parts, choking daily in the murky mix of smoke from burning rubbish, exhaust fumes from trucks coming in and out a large depot and dust rising from unmetalled roads. "We're dying a slow death. But we can't think of going anywhere else because our work is here," said daily wage worker Naresh Yadav, a 33-year-old migrant worker from Bihar. This month, as winds dropped leaving pollutants trapped in the air, the levels of PM2.5, tiny particulate matter that is sucked deep into the lungs, have averaged 390 in Jahangirpuri - six times more than the amount deemed safe by the World Health Organisation. Delhi has blamed farmers burning crop stubble in the neighbouring states for its sickly air, and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said this week it was worsening the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. But, more than half the pollutants in Delhi's air are the result of vehicular emissions, toxic waste and smoke from the thousands of small unregulated industrial units and dust from the never-ending construction, according to a breakdown by environment groups. "Delhi cannot build a wall to prevent polluted air coming from its surrounding states, but it has to check its own sources of pollution - be it dust, illegal industries, polluting factories, polluting vehicles or waste and biomass burning," said Vimlendu Jha, founder of environment group Swechha. A ban on garbage burning is routinely flouted in the teeming Jahangirpuri neighbourhood and there are illegal, small paint and dye shops operating from homes in the area polluting the air and water. On Wednesday, in the Ghazipur area, another mountainous waste landfill site, rising to over 60 metres (197 ft), caught fire, releasing poisonous smoke into the atmosphere. "We're facing breathing difficulties due to the smoke coming out from the landfill site that's been on fire since yesterday," said Vivek Shukla, 34, a resident. LACK OF OFFICERS Across town, a small number of government environment officials sit in large office blocks surrounded by stacks of files and complain of being overburdened with paperwork. For a sprawling metropolis of 18 million, there are only 40 field staff to enforce environmental standards. M. P. George, a scientist at the government's Delhi Pollution Control Committee told a webinar earlier this month that the capital's air monitoring systems were superior to some other heavily polluted cities. "But staff crunch is there, no doubt," George said. The Delhi government has now advertised for about 60 environmental scientists to strengthen its field staff, but recruitment is typically a slow process due to bureaucracy and a lack of resources. Critics say Delhi's fight against pollution is ad-hoc and based on quick fixes. When the air quality plummets as happened soon after the Hindu festival of Diwali earlier this month, the city administration despatched fire trucks to spray water on the streets to stop dust from flying. Next, it hired contract workers to stand at hundreds of traffic intersections to persuade drivers to shut off their engines, saying it would help curb emissions. Few bothered. "These measures will not solve the problem," Jha said. "Pollution levels will start coming down only if policymakers start looking at the root causes of Delhi's toxic air."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-poisonous-air-a-perennial-crisis-of-its-own-making-920074.html

On November 26, 2008, ten Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists from Pakistan arrived through sea and opened fire, killing 166 people, including 18 security personnel, and injuring many during the 60-hour siege in Mumbai. "I pay tributes to all those who lost their lives in Mumbai 26/11 terror attacks and convey condolences to their families. Heartfelt tributes to the brave security personnel who faced the terrorists in these attacks. The nation will always be grateful to your bravery and sacrifice," Shah tweeted in Hindi. The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, the Oberoi Trident, the Taj Mahal Hotel, Leopold Cafe, Cama Hospital and the Nariman House Jewish community centre, now renamed Nariman Light House, were some of the places targeted by the terrorists. The then Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) chief Hemant Karkare, Mumbai's Additional Police Commissioner Ashok Kamte, Senior Police Inspector Vijay Salaskar and Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Tukaram Omble were among those killed in the attack. NSG commando Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan was also killed while fighting the terrorists. Nine terrorists were later killed by the security forces, including the National Security Guard (NSG), the country's elite commando force. Ajmal Kasab was the only terrorist who was captured alive. He was hanged four years later on November 21, 2012.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hm-amit-shah-pays-tributes-to-victims-of-26/11-terror-attacks-920078.html
26-11-2020||North and Central||In door-to-door survey, 1,178 test Covid-19 positive in Delhi's containment zones||A door-to-door survey conducted under the instruction of the Centre to identify and isolate Covid-19 infected people in Delhi's containment zones and densely populated pockets threw up 1,178 positive cases with a positivity rate of 6.4 per cent, officials said. The five-day survey covered over 57 lakh people in the city's containment zones and thickly populated areas, and identified 13,560 symptomatic people, out of which, 11,790 were tested. Also, 8,413 contacts of these symptomatic people were traced, out of which, 6,546 people were tested, they said. The RT-PCR test reports of a total of 18,336 symptomatic cases and their contacts gave up 1,178 positive results, a Delhi government official said. The survey data showed that the highest number of symptomatic people (3,796) were found in south-west district followed by east Delhi 2,744, north-west 1,957 and west 1,330. The maximum positive cases (288) were found in Central district followed by 275 in New Delhi, 197 in west, 196 in south-west and 118 in south-east Delhi. "The number of positive cases found were lower than expected which means the positivity rate is going down, but there could be other reasons for it that will require in-depth analysis of the survey results," the official said. Delhi recorded 5,246 fresh Covid-19 cases in a day as the positivity rate declined to 8.49 per cent, the lowest since October 28, while 99 more fatalities pushed the city's death toll to 8,720 on Wednesday, authorities said. It was after five days that the national capital recorded single-day death below 100. The city had recorded its highest single-day spike of 8,593 cases on November 11. Authorities reported 98 deaths on November 19, 118 on November 20, 111 on November 21, 121 each on November 22 and 23, and 109 on November 24.  The National Centre for Disease Control in a report drafted recently had warned that Delhi needs to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh cases of Covid-19 per day taking into account the winter season-related respiratory problems, large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings. Under the survey, about 9,000 three-member teams equipped with oximeters and thermal scanners surveyed people in 4,456 containment zones and surrounding areas across 11 districts for five days beginning October 20.  The survey was part of various steps decided to be taken in Delhi in view of surging Covid-19 cases, in a high-level meeting attended by Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on November 15.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/in-door-to-door-survey-1178-test-covid-19-positive-in-delhis-containment-zones-920099.html

The much-awaited vaccine, Covishield has been developed at the SII Pune laboratory with a master seed from Oxford University/AstraZeneca – and clinical trials are underway. Pune's Divisional Commissioner Saurabh Rao said that they have received official confirmation about the Prime Minister’s visit to Pune on 28 November. Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said that the Prime Minister would visit the Serum Institute between 1 - 2 pm. However, there was no independent confirmation either from the Prime Minister’s Office or the Serum Institute. Modi will be visiting the Hadapsar campus of SII, where he will be received by Cyrus Poonawalla, the Chairman of Poonawalla Group, popularly known as ‘Vaccine King of India’, and his son and CEO Adar Poonawalla, who is spearheading the Covishield production. The Pune District Collector’s office, Pune Municipal Corporation and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation are making the necessary arrangements. The Pune district is among the worst Covid-19 affected districts of the country. In the Covid-19 situation review video-conference with Chief Ministers, the focus was largely on the vaccination programme. Meanwhile, the visit of 100-odd foreign envoys have been rescheduled to be held for 4 November. They will visit two facilities – SII at Hadapsar, and Gennova Biopharmaceuticals Ltd in Hinjewadi. For Modi, this would be the second visit to the SII facility in Pune - the last being on 13 November, 2016, when he met the Poonawallas and took stock of the low-cost vaccination programme that India follows. In fact, Adar is also a brand ambassador of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the flagship cleanliness mission initiated by Modi. The SII, India’s No 1 biotechnology company, makes more than 1.5 billion doses - which includes Polio vaccine as well as Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Hib, BCG, r-Hepatitis B, Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccines. Vaccines manufactured by the Serum Institute are accredited by the WHO and are being used in around 170 countries across the globe in their national immunisation programs, saving millions of lives throughout the world. Set up in Pune with an aim to provide vaccines at affordable prices, several life-saving biologicals were manufactured at prices with the result that the country was made self-sufficient for Tetanus Anti-toxin and Anti-snake Venom serum, followed by DTP (Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis) group of vaccines and then later on MMR (Measles, Mumps and Rubella) group of vaccines. Sixty-five per cent of the kids across the globe receive one or the other vaccine manufactured by SII.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pm-modi-to-visit-serum-institute-of-india-in-pune-on-november-28-920102.html

Some of the beneficiaries of the Rs 25,000-crore Roshni scam include former chief minister Farooq Abdullah, his family, several former ministers belonging to National Conference (NC), PDP and Congress, retired IAS and IPS officers and high-profile businessmen. Official sources said as all mutations under the Roshni Act already stand cancelled and apart from revealing the names, the government is working on a follow-up, which as per the court's direction, is to evict the encroachers. “The investigation part being carried out by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) which is probing the whole scheme and so far seven FIRs have been registered by the investigation agency,” they said and added the Chief Secretary is monitoring the matter given the beneficiaries include the rich and famous of J&K. Roshni Act, enacted in 2001 by the then NC government, which argued that it would not be possible to recover encroached public land from the occupants, allowed grant of proprietary rights to persons holding state land unauthorizedly on payment of the cost equivalent to prevailing market rate. The Comptroller and Auditor General, in a 2014 report, had stated that only Rs 76 crore had been collected from the transfer of encroached land between 2007 and 2013, as against the target of about Rs 25,000 crore. On November 1, the Union Territory administration cancelled all land transfers that took place under the J&K State Land (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act, 2001 – also known as the Roshni Act – under which 2.5 lakh acres of land was to be transferred to the existing occupants. The principal secretary and revenue department have been asked to work out a plan to retrieve large tracts of state land vested under the Act. According to the High Court order, a total of 6,04,602 kanals (75,575 acres) of state land had been regularised and transferred to the occupants. This included 5,71,210 kanals (71,401 acres) in Jammu and 33,392 kanals (4174 acres) in the Kashmir province.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/roshni-act-after-naming-beneficiaries-jk-govt-prepares-to-evict-encroachers-920103.html

On the Delhi government's decision to bring down the number of attendees at weddings to 50, the high court asked as to how the rule was being enforced and whether there were any protocols in place to implement it as a lot of weddings are held during this time of the year. A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad said that in the present day and time, "cash transactions need to be avoided" and there should be a provision for paying the fines electronically. It said the government should have a portal for collecting fines, in case it is not there already. The court also asked the Delhi government as to what it has done with the huge amounts collected as fines and suggested that they be utilised for the purpose of fighting COVID-19. With regard to Delhi government submission that it has increased RT/PCR test numbers to 40,000 per day, the bench remarked that it came after much pushing and prodding by the court and after loss of a lot of lives. RT/PCR, or Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction, is a laboratory technique widely used in the diagnosis of genetic diseases and to measure gene expression in research.  The court was hearing a PIL by advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking increase in the Covid-19 testing numbers in the national capital and getting speedy results.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/avoid-cash-fines-for-covid-19-norms-violation-hc-tells-aap-govt-police-920110.html
26-11-2020||North and Central||Haryana sets up 3-member drafting committee to frame law on 'Love Jihad'||After Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh took initiatives on legislation on "Love Jihad", Manohar Lal Khattar-led Haryana became the third BJP-ruled state to move forward on the contentious law, setting up a three-member committee to draft the law. "A three-member drafting Committee formed to frame law on Love Jihad in Haryana," Vij tweeted informing that the panel will consist of state Home Secretary T L Satyaprakash, Additional Director General of Police Navdeep Singh Virk and Additional Advocate General Deepak Manchanda. A three member Drafting Committee formed to frame law on Love Jihad in Haryana comprising T L Satyaprakash IAS Secretary Home, Navdeep Sing Virk IPS ADGP and Deepak Manchanda Additional Advocate General Haryana Committee will study the Love Jihad law formed in other states also. Home Minister, Haryana Anil Vij's announcement came three days after Yogi Adityanath government in UP cleared a draft ordinance against conversion for marriage. The UP draft law prescribed declaring null and void any such marriage and provide imprisonment up to 10 years for it called "dishonest" religious conversions including those for the sake of marriage if the woman is a minor. Another BJP-ruled state Haryana passed a bill last year itself against conversion through a marriage solemnised for the sole purpose of adopting a new religion. The Haryana law could be broadly based on the Himachal pattern. The state government had earlier sought information from the neighbouring state on this count. Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government in Madhya Pradesh is also proposing a jail term of 10 years for anyone found guilty of using marriage to force someone to change religion. In Madhya Pradesh, Home Minister Narottam Mishra has asserted that such a law is the need of the hour and hence the state government has proposed a 10-year jail term for luring, threatening and forcing someone into marriage for religious conversion and five year jail term for gurus, priests, maulvis and kazis who will conduct such marriages year jail term , in the proposed Dharm Swatantrya (Religious Freedom) Bill 2020. The UP law--- Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Illegal Conversion Ordinance, 2020--- prescribes that those wishing to change their religion after marriage need to apply to the district magistrate. While Hindutva groups have been alleging for quite some time that Muslim youth are actively wooing Hindu girls into marriage for converting them into Islam, Congress has dismissed the 'Love Jihad' term as "manufactured". In Haryana, the chorus for law against 'Love Jihad' had recieved a fillip after killing of a Hindu girl by a Muslim youth in broad daylight in October. While the victim's family alleged that the man was pressuring her to convert to Islam in order to marry him. Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) had alleged she was murdered by "Islamic jihadists''.  In UP, the Chief Minister had talked about the law on 'Love Jihad' last month in a public rally after the Allahabad High Court in a ruling declared that conversion for the sole purpose of marriage is not valid. Even in Assam, where polls are due next year, the BJP government has said it will start a strict fight against 'Love Jihad' if the party comes back to power again.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/haryana-sets-up-3-member-drafting-committee-to-frame-law-on-love-jihad-920113.html
26-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi riots: HC asks police to file report on vigilance inquiry on leakage of confessional statement||The Delhi High Court Thursday asked the Delhi Police to file a report on vigilance inquiry conducted on the allegation of leaking to media confessional statement of a Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) university student, who was arrested in a case related to communal violence in northeast Delhi during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act in February. Justice Vibhu Bakhru also asked the police to indicate in the status report, further steps which it proposes to take in this regard. The high court was informed by advocate Amit Mahajan, representing the Delhi Police, that the vigilance inquiry with regard to the confessional statement being leaked from the case diaries has been concluded. He sought time to file the status report in this regard. The high court was hearing a plea by JMI student Asif Iqbal Tanha alleging misconduct by police officials in leaking his disclosure statement, recorded by the probe agency during the investigation, to the media. Advocate Siddharth Aggarwal, appearing for Tanha, submitted that apart from examining the question as to the steps taken by the police regarding the leak of documents, a cognisable offence has also been committed and it is necessary to take proper action. He contended that the action of the media houses — Zee News Media Corporation Ltd and OpIndia — in placing such documents in the media violated the programme code and sought time to file a written statement in this regard. The high court, which deleted social media platforms Facebook and YouTube from the list of parties, listed the matter for further hearing on January 18. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Facebook, submitted that they are only intermediaries and have no role to play since the alleged offending news item is being uploaded by the media houses. He said if any order is passed to take down the articles, the intermediaries are obliged to do that. The high court had earlier questioned Zee News over broadcast of the alleged confession statement of Tanha in the riots case, saying such documents cannot be taken out and published. It had directed the media house to file an affidavit disclosing the name of the source from whom the concerned journalist got the documents. Advocate Vijay Aggarwal, representing Zee News, had argued that pressing for disclosure of source would amount to interfering with the freedom of press as guaranteed under the Constitution and in a situation where the source of information is not protected or safeguarded, the freedom of press will be severely jeopardised or interfered with. The high court, however, had said it does not think that it's a journalist’s right to take out the case diary and publish it and that the news report cannot be based on documents which are not in the public domain. Earlier, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (special cell) in an affidavit had said that Delhi Police was also aggrieved by the news report in which the alleged confessional statement of Tanha was leaked out. The police affidavit had also stated that none of its officials indulged in the investigation of the case leaked out the information to the media. The high court had asked two media houses and two social media platforms to respond to the plea which also sought direction to take down the sensitive/confidential information leaked to them by the officials of Delhi Police. The high court had also refused to pass an ex-parte order directing the media houses, Zee News and OpIndia and social networking platforms Facebook and YouTube to remove the content and had said that it will pass necessary orders after hearing all the parties. Tanha, in his petition, said he was aggrieved by various publications reporting that he has confessed to orchestrating the Delhi riots and alleged that he was coerced to sign certain papers in the effective custody of police. It said this information does not have any evidentiary value and alleged that the Delhi Police officials, with malafide intention, leaked the statements to the media to prejudice his case. Tanha, who was arrested in May, is currently lodged in judicial custody in the Delhi riots case. Tanha, a third-year student of BA in Persian language, was earlier arrested in connection with the violence in the Jamia area during a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in December last year. The police had said that Tanha, a resident of Abul Fazal Enclave in Shaheen Bagh, was a member of the Students Islamic Organization and was part of the Jamia Coordination Committee which spearheaded protests against the new citizenship law. "Tanha is a key member of the Jamia Coordination Committee and played an active role in organising protests and riots in Jamia in December 2019. He is a close associate of Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, Meeran Haider and Safoora Zargar who had been key organisers of anti-CAA protests and subsequent riots," the police had said. On December 15 last year, protesters had turned violent, torching four public buses and two police vehicles and pelting stones at the police and civilians, near JMI. At least 40 people including students, policemen and firefighters were injured in the incident. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-riots-hc-asks-police-to-file-report-on-vigilance-inquiry-on-leakage-of-confessional-statement-920122.html

The soldiers were part of an Army patrol team that was deployed to secure roads for security convoys. “Terrorists fired indiscriminately on the Quick Reaction Team of Indian Army in the general area Aban Shah Chowk, HMT, Khushipora, Srinagar today afternoon. Being a crowded area, troops exercised restraint to avoid any civilian casualties and collateral damage,” Defence spokesperson Col Kalia said in a statement. He said two soldiers were critically injured in the incident who were evacuated to the nearest medical facility. “However, they succumbed to their injuries,” Col Kalia added. Inspector General Police (IGP), Kashmir, Vijay Kumar, said that three militants carried out the attack. “Initial reports said that the three militants were travelling in a Maruti car and two of them were carrying weapons, who fired indiscriminately at the army men leaving two of them seriously wounded,” he told reporters. “It seems that Jaish-e-Muhammad outfit carried out the attack. There seems to be the involvement of one or two foreign militants,” Kumar added. The attack came just two days ahead of the first phase of district development council (DDC) polls. In the first polls since it was split into two union territories and had its decades-old special status revoked last August, Jammu and Kashmir will hold DDC elections in eight phases between November 28 and December 19, and votes will be counted on December 22. The fresh attack comes days after four Jaish-e-Mohammed militants, who were hiding in a truck, were killed in an encounter with security forces on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway near Nagrota. The police say militants want to disrupt the election with these attacks.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/two-soldiers-martyred-as-car-borne-militants-fire-on-army-patrol-in-srinagar-920136.html
26-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi records over 2,300 Covid-19 deaths in less than a month: Official data||The national capital has witnessed 2,364 deaths due to coronavirus since October 28, when the daily rise in infections breached the mark of 5,000 cases for the first time, according to official data. Amid a surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths, 99 more fatalities on Wednesday pushed the city's total death toll due to the disease to 8,720. It was after five days that Delhi recorded single-day deaths below 100.  The city reported 98 deaths on November 19, 118 on November 20, 111 on November 21, 121 each on November 22 and 23, and 109 fatalities on November 24, according to official data.  While 131 Covid-related deaths were recorded on November 18, the highest till date, Delhi registered its highest single-day spike of 8,593 cases on November 11.   On Thursday, Delhi had recorded 7,546 cases, followed by 6,608 on Friday, 5,879 on Saturday, 6,746 on Sunday, 4,454 on Monday, 6,224 on Tuesday and 5,246 on Wednesday, according to the government data. The total number of coronavirus cases in Delhi climbed to 5,45,787 on Wednesday, of which 4,98,780 have recovered from the virus, the data shows. Late hospital admissions leading to Covid-19 cases turning critical, shortage of ICU beds, unfavourable weather and rising pollution are among the factors experts attribute to the spike in Covid-19 deaths in Delhi, health experts have said. Going by the epidemiological trend, the severity of the disease is more in this phase of the pandemic compared to the last one and several factors, including weather and pollution, are contributing to it, a health ministry official said on Wednesday.     Amid a spurt in the infection tally in the city, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had Wednesday requested experts to audit Covid-19 death cases and suggest measures to reduce fatalities in the national capital. Health Minister Satyender Jain on Wednesday claimed the national capital reported the "least fatality per million" population amongst all four metro cities in the country. The National Centre for Disease Control in a report drafted recently had warned that Delhi needs to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh cases of Covid-19 per day taking into account the upcoming winter season-related respiratory problems, large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-records-over-2300-covid-19-deaths-in-less-than-a-month-official-data-920146.html

Khattar asked Singh to desist from misleading farmers, pointing out to him that he has already pledged to quit politics if the Minimum Support Price mechanism is ever dismantled. “@Capt Amarinder Ji, I've said it earlier and I'm saying it again, I'll leave politics if there'll be any trouble on the MSP -- therefore, please stop inciting innocent farmers,” Khattar tweeted. Khattar also accused the Punjab CM of “only tweeting and running away from talks” with him for the last three days on the issue. “I've been trying to reach out to you for the last 3 days but, sadly, you have decided to stay unreachable -- is this how serious you are for farmers’ issues? You're only tweeting and running away from talks, why?,” Khattar said in another tweet. I've been trying to reach out to you for the last 3 days but sadly you decided to stay unreachable - is this how serious you are for farmer's issues? You're only tweeting and running away from talks, Why? Launching a scathing attack on Singh, the senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader told him, “Time for your Lies, Deception and Propaganda is over -- let the people see your real face.” “Please stop putting the lives of people in danger during the Corona pandemic. I urge you not to play with the lives of the people – at least avoid cheap politics during the time of the pandemic,” Khattar told Singh. Time for your Lies, Deception and Propaganda is over - let the people see your real face. Please stop putting the lives of people in danger during the Corona pandemic. I urge you to not play with the lives of the people - atleast avoid cheap politics during the time of pandemic. Earlier in the day, Amarinder Singh had lashed out at the BJP-led government in Haryana for stopping farmers from moving towards Delhi, saying the use of "brute force" against them is “totally undemocratic and unconstitutional” Haryana had earlier announced to completely seal its borders with Punjab to prevent farmers from entering the state for their 'Delhi Chalo' protest march against the Centre's farm laws on November 26-27. “Why is @mlkhattar govt in Haryana stopping the farmers from moving to Delhi? The tyrannical use of brute force against peacefully protesting farmers is totally undemocratic & unconstitutional,” said Singh in a tweet. He said farmers have been peacefully protesting in Punjab against the farm laws for two months. “Why is Haryana govt provoking them by resorting to force? Don't the farmers have the right to pass peacefully through a public highway?", Singh had asked. The Haryana Police on Thursday used water cannons and tear gas to disperse a group of farmers from Punjab who allegedly tried to jump police barricades to enter Haryana as part of their 'Delhi Chalo' march. The Punjab chief minister said it was a “sad irony” that the constitutional rights of farmers were being “oppressed” on the Constitution Day. Farmers are marching towards Delhi to protest the Centre's new farm laws. Protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the Centre's farm laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. The government has maintained that farm laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/haryana-cm-manohar-lal-khattar-hits-out-at-punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-tells-him-to-stop-inciting-innocent-farmers-920151.html

The chief minister warned of stern action if complaints of harassment were received, an official spokesperson said here. Adityanath also clarified that there is no requirement for police or administrative permission for organising weddings, the official said. "Wedding functions can be held by complying with necessary Covid protocols and guidelines. There is no ban on DJs and bands... band group members are exempted from the restrictions on such events," Additional Chief Secretary, Information, Navneet Sehgal told reporters. "Only the nearest police station is to be informed that the event is being held by following Covid-19 protocols," Sehgal said. Misleading information is being circulated on social media platforms like WhatsApp about Covid-19 regulations, lockdown etc, Sehgal said as he asked people to ignore such messages. "These should not be relied upon and information provided only by the government should be considered," Sehgal said. The chief minister has warned of strict action against officials and policemen who stop DJs and bands from playing in weddings, he added. On Monday, the Uttar Pradesh government had issued fresh guidelines restricting the number of people attending an indoor event (outside containment zones) to 100.  Similarly, in the case of outdoor programmes, less than 40 per cent of the area of the venue will be allowed to be occupied by people. In both the scenarios, use of face masks, sanitisers, thermal scanning and maintaining social distancing are mandatory.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/yogi-adityanath-warns-against-harassment-in-name-of-covid-19-protocols-920168.html

26-11-2020||North and Central||Number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi alarming, says HC||The Delhi High Court Thursday termed the number of Covid-19 cases in the national capital as “alarming” while hearing a plea challenging AAP government’s decision to reserve 80 per cent of ICU beds for coronavirus patients in 33 private hospitals here. “The numbers, we know, are presently in an alarming state,” said Justice Navin Chawla while listing the next hearing on December 9 for further consideration of the matter. According to the government data, Delhi recorded 99 more deaths and 5,246 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the infection tally to 5.45 lakh. The high court was hearing a plea by 'Association of Healthcare Providers', represented through senior advocate Maninder Singh, to quash the Delhi government’s September 12 order to reserve 80 per cent ICU beds for Covid-19 patients in 33 private hospitals here. During the hearing, Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, representing the Delhi government, said they were reviewing the situation periodically and it was last done by Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) and especially with regard to Delhi by the Union Home Minister. He said the situation was reviewed on Wednesday night also and it will again be done before the next date of hearing of the case. The September 12 order of the Delhi government was earlier stayed by the high court on September 22. However, a division of the high court on November 12 vacated the stay order taking into account the change in circumstances since the time the stay order was passed. The petitioner association had told the high court that the 33 private hospitals are its members and the Delhi government’s order shall be quashed as it was passed in an irrational manner and is ex-facie perverse. The ASG, however, had contended that the situation of Covid-19 infection in Delhi has become critical recently and the Covid-19 cases are spiralling and it was critical that 80 per cent of ICU/ HDU beds be reserved for Covid-19 patients in the 33 private hospitals.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/number-of-covid-19-cases-in-delhi-alarming-says-hc-920197.html

Badal had resigned from the Union Cabinet in September in protest against three farm sector bills, which later got the President's assent after being passed by Parliament. She was the Union minister for food processing industries. The Centre should not adopt a policy of confrontation with farmers. It should instead talk with them and resolve their grievances, Badal told PTI. "Using force against farmers on Constitution Day has turned the day a 'black day' for 'annadattas' of the country," the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader said. "The BJP-led central government is treating farmers as an enemy of the State. We witnessed the same treatment when Punjabis were stopped from going to Delhi during the Asiad Games. Such repressive tactics can have very dangerous repercussions as we have seen in the past," Badal said. Badal's remarks come after tension spiralled at the Shambhu interstate border on Thursday as the Haryana police used water cannons and teargas to disperse hundreds of farmers from Punjab who broke barricades, throwing some into the river, determined to enter the state as part of their 'Delhi Chalo' march against the farm laws. "Farmers' voices stifled, water cannons used on annnadata!" she tweeted and appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to direct Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar to let farmers march on peacefully to convey their issues to the Centre in Delhi. Badal said she is shocked and pained with the way in which farmers are being treated. Days after Badal's resignation, her party also moved out of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) over the farm laws issue. SAD was one of the founding partners of the NDA and had a long association with the BJP from its precursor, Jan Sangh days.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/centre-treating-farmers-as-enemy-of-state-alleges-shiromani-akali-dal-leader-harsimrat-kaur-badal-920198.html
26-11-2020||North and Central||Jammu and Kashmir gears up for first polls post Article 370 abrogation||Preparations are on in full swing for the first elections in Jammu and Kashmir post abrogation of Article 370 and reorganisation of the erstwhile state with political parties making the last last-ditch efforts to woo voters. The first-ever district development council (DDC) elections will be held in eight phases to elect 280 members in 20 districts from November 28 to December 22. In the absence of an elected government in the union territory, these councils are set to become a new unit of governance in the region. Along with the DDC polls, eight-phased polling will be held for by-elections to 230 urban local bodies (ULB) and 12000 panchayat seats. Major regional parties National Conference (NC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which boycotted the panchayat polls in 2018, have plunged into the electoral battleground under the banner of the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD). The BJP and the Congress are also campaigning in various constituencies of Jammu and Kashmir. While the BJP has deployed union ministers and central leaders as its star campaigners, only local Congress leaders are campaigning. The state election commission (SEC) and chief electoral officer (CEO) have issued all notifications for the elections to the DDCs, panchayats and ULBs. "The notifications have been issued for the DCC and other elections. preparations have been made for holding free and fair polls," a election officer said. The process of deployment of staff, training and other requirements is almost complete. Police say elaborate security measures have been done for incident-free polls and more security companies are being brought to Jammu and Kashmir for the poll process. "We have made elaborate security arrangements for polls and candidates besides the campaigning process," a senior police officer said, adding security is being reviewed as per requirements. While campaigning in various constituencies in districts of Jammu division has gathered momentum with roadshows, door-to-door meetings and public rallies being witnessed, in Kashmir, it is a low key affair due to security reasons. BJP has deployed Union ministers Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Jitendra Singh and Anurag Thakur besides national general secretary Tarun Chug and national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain. Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi addressed an election meeting in Kupwara on November 19 while BJP national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain visited Srinagar on Friday. Union minister Anurag Thakur has been on campaign trail in Jammu and BJP general secretary Tarun Chug has addressed rallies in Samba and Kathua districts during the past few days. According to the JK BJP, leaders like Smriti Irani, Krishan Pal Gujjar, Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' and Rajya Sabha member Zafar Islam are expected to join the campaign. The BJP has made the issue of alleged land encroachments by former chief ministers Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah and other leaders of the Gupkar alliance a major poll plank while reaching out to certain communities including Muslims and Gujjars. The BJP has planned digital rallies and door-to-door campaigning as well as social media campaigns by employing around 800 IT people in most of the districts, a party leader said. However, the opposition has accused the BJP of forcing them to keep their campaigning a low key affair due to lack of security. Nasir Aslam Wani, NC provincial president, claimed that PAGD candidates have been "locked up" in hotels and guesthouses in several places and are not allowed to campaign. Head of the Gupkar alliance and former chief minister Farooq Abdullah gave a video call message to people and appealed them to vote for its candidates. "I want to appeal to you to vote for alliance candidates. If we have to be successful, then we have to vote for the alliance.This alliance has been formed to restore special status - Article 370 and Article 35-A. We have come together to keep this state united," the NC chief said. "It is my urgent request to you not to vote for anyone else and come out in large numbers and vote for the alliance candidates," he said. PDP president and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti is campaigning for the alliance candidates in south Kashmir and has addressed some meetings too. On Wednesday, she visited Shopian district to campaign for her candidate at Zainapora and said "The BJP is feeling unnerved over the PAGD's decision of joining the DDC poll fray and that was why our candidates are barred from going for campaigning." She claimed the PAGD's Zainapora candidate was not allowed to come out of his home for campaigning for the past 15 days. The Congress alleged that the security of its former MLA Hajir Rashid of Sopore was withdrawn. "How can he campaign in such a high terror ridden area. It is a deliberate attempt to prevent us from campaigning," a Congress spokesperson told PTI. He said that they have brought the matter to election authority but nothing has been done. "That is why our campaigning is very low key. This is the fate of other opposition parties too," he said. Officials said over 50 public meetings, door-to-door meetings, road shows and other functions have been held in Jammu and Kashmir during the past one week. Newly-formed Jammu and Kashmir Apani Party (JKAP) is contesting elections for the first time. Its president Syed Altaf Bukhari said the youth of Jammu and Kashmir have been always swayed by misleading slogans of political parties, which is why they are unhappy with the present system.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jammu-and-kashmir-gears-up-for-first-polls-post-article-370-abrogation-920201.html

Officials said the Pakistan Army initiated the unprovoked ceasefire violation by firing from small arms and intense shelling of mortars along the LoC in the Kirni Qasba sector of Poonch. “Subedar Swathantra Singh of 16 Garhwal was critically injured in the firing in Kirni Qasba sector. The 48-year-old was shifted to army hospital but succumbed to the injuries,” they said. Defence spokesperson Lt Col Devinder  Anand while confirming the killing of the officer in the ceasefire violation by the Pakistan army said the Indian Army retaliated in a befitting manner. Reports said one civilian identified as Mohammad Rashid was also injured in the incident. Pakistan has been targeting the forward areas and border hamlets along the LoC in J&K frequently. Six civilians and five security forces personnel were killed in multiple ceasefire violations by Pakistani army along the LoC in north Kashmir on November 13 while eight Pakistani soldiers were reportedly killed in the retaliatory action by Indian army. On November 8, seven persons, including three army men, a BSF personnel and three militants were killed as security forces foiled a major infiltration bid near the LoC in Machhil sector of north Kashmir’s Kupwara district. Prior to that three army soldiers were killed and four others were injured on October 1 as Pakistani troops violated ceasefire along the LoC in Kupwara and Poonch districts. According to official figures, as many as 3386 incidents of ceasefire violations have taken place along the LoC and International Border (IB) in Jammu & Kashmir in the first eight months of 2020. Last year 3479 incidents of ceasefire violations were reported in J&K. The Army maintains that Pakistani troops have been frequently violating ceasefire by resorting to heavy shelling and firing to help the militants to infiltrate. A number of infiltration attempts have been thwarted by the army along the LoC leading to the killing of several infiltrating militants in recent months.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/army-officer-killed-as-pakistan-violates-ceasefire-along-loc-in-jk-920228.html

A bench of Justice Suneet Kumar denied bail to the Lok Sabha MP from Rampur, Azam Khan, and his son Mohammad Abdullah Azam Khan saying that granting bail to them at this juncture will not be in the public interest. The court also feared that on being enlarged on bail, they may try to influence witnesses in the case.

The party’s office was locked up by people living in some “illegally” built hutments and outhouses inside and around the office campus after the party administration disconnected their power supply. The party officials said they disconnected the supply to these outhouses as their residents were "stealing" power from the party's main supply line. "Relatives of some former employees of the party office live illegally with their families in the area adjacent to the Congress office. These people have taken the power connection from the party office," Anup Gupta, the administration in-charge of the Uttar Pradesh Congress headquarters told PTI. The party acted against the illegal residents after the party received a huge power bill of Rs 6 lakh this month, he said. "When the Electricity Department officials were asked about the bill, it transpired that out of the total bill, power worth Rs 3.5 lakh had been consumed by the illegal occupants,” said Gupta. At this, the power supply lines of these houses were snapped, he added. "To protest against the snapping of power, some persons locked the party's main gate at around 10 am. They, however, removed the lock later," he said. He said appropriate action would be taken against these "illegal occupants" as per law.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-congress-headquarters-locked-up-by-its-ex-employees-920248.html

26-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi Chalo march: Punjab farmers face water cannons, push through Haryana barricades||Farmers from Punjab faced water cannons and broke police barriers at the state’s border with Haryana as they pushed towards the national capital Thursday on their “Delhi Chalo” march against the Centre’s farm laws. By late evening, a large group of them had reached the road toll plaza at Panipat, about 100 km from Delhi. Bhartiya Kisan Union (Haryana) leader Gurnam Singh said the protesters planned to spend the night there and will resume the march the next morning. There were traffic snarls during the day at Delhi’s border with police checking vehicles coming in from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Metro services between Delhi and NCR areas were restricted. At the Punjab-Haryana Shambhu border, police and Punjab farmers in their tractor-trolleys were locked in a confrontation for a couple of hours in the morning. Police made announcements on loudspeakers asking the farmers assembled on the Punjab side to disperse. But as protesters tried to push through barricades, the Haryana Police used a water cannon and lobbed teargas shells. Farmers chucked some steel barricades into the Ghaggar river from the bridge where they had been stopped. Apart from this confrontation in Ambala district, there were face-offs between the protesters and police in Haryana’s Sirsa, Kurukshetra, Fatehabad and Jind districts bordering Congress-run Punjab. Police had placed cement and steel barricades and parked trucks on the road to stop the farmers’ tractor-trolleys, some of them laden with food for the planned two-day protest, which many felt could extend further. But a few hours later, at most border-points, the farmers were let through. At Shambhu, a few protesters initially managed to cross the barricades on foot. Later, police eased the blockade, allowing the tractors to proceed on the road to Delhi, 200 km away. But barricades were also set up at other points on this Amritsar-Delhi highway that passes through BJP-run Haryana. At Karnal, there was another face-off and police again used a water cannon. By afternoon, several groups of protesters – from Punjab and Haryana – were travelling towards Delhi on tractor-trolleys. Police diverted private vehicles and long lines of trucks were parked on the road. “It is condemnable that Haryana Police is using such measures to suppress an assembly of peaceful protesters. We are protesting in a peaceful manner, but they want to prevent us from using our democratic right to protest,” a Punjab farmer told reporters earlier at Shambhu. Police used water cannons also against protesters trying to enter Kaithal district, and at Khanauri border where farmers were protesting under the banner of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugarhan). Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal were among the opposition leaders who slammed the Haryana Police action at Shambhu. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and his Haryana counterpart Manohar Lal Khattar exchanged words over Twitter. The Congress veteran asked Khattar why his government was stopping farmers, and the BJP leader told him to stop “inciting” them. Shiromani Akali Dal leader Sukhbir Singh Badal too criticised attempts to thwart the protest. “Today is Punjab's 26/11. We are witnessing the end of the right to democratic protest,” he tweeted. The Haryana Police said they acted with restraint and nobody was seriously hurt during the day. No farmer was arrested, they said. Ahead of the protest, Haryana had announced sealing its borders with Punjab to prevent farmers from entering the state on their way to Delhi. The Delhi Police had also made clear that they had denied permission to the farmer organisations planning to protest in the capital on November 26 and 27. In Gurgaon, Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav and a group of protesters were detained by police while they were on their way to Delhi. In Delhi, commuters from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh complained of traffic jams due to police checks. "I had to go to Noida regarding a case in the morning. While I was returning from there in the evening, there was heavy traffic at Delhi-Noida border," advocate Rohit Tomar said, "Police personnel were checking vehicles. I was stuck there for almost half an hour," he said. At Singhu, on Haryana’s border with the capital, the Delhi police had stationed five sand-laden trucks to stop tractor-trolleys. Drones too were deployed. While clarifying that Delhi’s borders had not been sealed, officials said all pickets were active and vehicles entering the city were being checked. Police were also deployed on Delhi’s border with Faridabad and Gurgaon. Punjab farmers, representing over 30 farm bodies, had announced they will go to Delhi through several routes -- Lalru, Shambhu, Patiala-Pehowa, Patran-Khanauri, Moonak-Tohana, Ratia-Fatehabad and Talwandi-Sirsa. Farmer bodies said they will hold a dharna wherever they are stopped from moving towards the national capital. BKU (Ekta-Ugarhan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan had claimed 25,000 women will participate and over 4,000 tractor-trailers were arranged for the protest. The farmers are demanding the repeal of the new laws which deregulate the sale of agriculture produce. They say the laws will lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-chalo-march-punjab-farmers-face-water-cannons-push-through-haryana-barricades-920274.html

26-11-2020||North and Central||Centre wants to suppress leaders from opposition parties in Kashmir: PDP||The PDP on Thursday alleged that the Centre wants to create an atmosphere of fear in Kashmir and suppress the leaders from opposition parties in the valley. Addressing a press conference at party headquarters here, PDP general secretary Ghulam Nabi Hanjura said the timing of arrest of the party's youth leader Waheed Parra was questionable. "Parra is a candidate from Pulwama. See the timing of his arrest. If he is involved in some crime, they could have arrested him before or after this election. But, he filed his nomination and he was arrested," Hanjura said. Parra, the president of the PDP's youth wing, had recently filed his nomination for District Development Council (DDC) elections from South Kashmir's Pulwama. He was on Wednesday arrested by the NIA in connection with a case involving suspended deputy superintendent of police Devinder Singh. Hanjura said similar was the case with Congress leader and former minister Taj Mohi-ud-din who was booked by the CBI in connection with the Roshni Scheme scam. "It seems their one point agenda is to suppress the leaders from opposition parties so that an atmosphere of fear is created here. All those contesting are under fear and are feeling that they made a mistake by fighting the polls. An atmosphere of fear has been created and now people are backtracking and their belief in democracy has been shattered," he said. The PDP general secretary said his party was sincere about the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), but there were some differences over the seat-sharing arrangements for the DDC polls in central Kashmir's Budgam district. He asked the amalgam president Farooq Abdullah to review the seat-sharing arrangement. "We are sincere about the alliance. The PDP had told the NC to contest the elections and the party offered unconditional support to it. But, they said they will not contest alone but unitedly," he said. Hanjura said the alliance then decided to field joint candidates and the parties discussed the seat-sharing arrangement. "But, unfortunately, there was some disagreement at the ground-level at a few places between the candidates. On the last day of the meetings, when Budgam district was being discussed, there was some disagreement and I left the meeting as they were not giving seats to the PDP. "So, there was no decision about the seats in the district. However, I was surprised to see the list yesterday when I saw only one seat to the PDP out of 14 and that too without consultation," Hanjura said. The PDP leader said his party was ready to give any sacrifice for the alliance. "This election means nothing to us. But, I want to request Abdullah to take another view of the seat-sharing arrangement. On some seats which have been allotted to the PDP, NC candidates have also submitted nomination forms, which is not good for the alliance. All those candidates who have not been authorised by the alliance should withdraw,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/centre-wants-to-suppress-leaders-from-opposition-parties-in-kashmir-pdp-920280.html
26-11-2020||Oasis||Nothing is permanent||Nothing is permanent in life, not even the present menacing Covid-19 pandemic. The only thing that is permanent is change! Fame, riches, poverty, happiness, sorrows, troubles, difficulties, diseases, jobs and relationships, forms and substances, people and objects, and even you and me are transient. Change is an inevitable reality in life whether we accept it or not. Change is and will continue to be continuous. If what we have and are, today, is the consequence of our past, it equally goes that what we think and do today will determine our future. The seed of change is inherent in all situations. All these equally apply to pandemics and economic slumps that we are facing today. Instead of falling into the abyss of despair and depression, let us rise up to make the best use of our inner potential and to shape a new future for ourselves and our country. Even considering the issue logically, nothing can be permanent because when the whole universe is constantly changing, the earth and our lives on this planet--a minuscule part of this universe--can never be permanent. What is born should die. The sooner we realise this eternal truth, the better for our wellbeing. The immediate advantages that accrue from realizing this truth in life are myriad. Firstly, it infuses the confidence that the situation will change and will usher in hope for forthcoming. Secondly, it stirs up creativity summons positive thoughts and energy to look for possible solutions to overcome this undesirable situation. Thirdly, it opens up thoughts on what lessons can be learnt. Fourthly, it reminds us not to ignore our other comforts or pursue needless things – possessions, relationships, fame and credit. Fifthly, we become more tolerant, forgiving, understanding and loving. When we accept that situations, things and people change often, we develop the skill and capacity of adapting ourselves to new situations, new environments, and new people. Lastly, we begin to live life to the fullest by living in the present, in the thought that whatever we have today, whether we like or dislike, will all come to an end.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/nothing-is-permanent-920283.html
26-11-2020||Opinion||Why Maradona was better than Messi and Ronaldo||By Bobby Ghosh Soccer fans are fortunate to live in a time when two superstars are simultaneously making the claim to be the best player in the history of the sport — and more fortunate still that we can watch the contest between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo play out, week in and week out, live before a global audience of billions. Thanks to YouTube, I can watch high-quality videos of their most compelling performances, and of every goal they’ve ever scored. When Diego Maradona was staking his claim to the title of best ever, most of the world could only get a quadrennial glimpse of his genius, when he turned out for Argentina in the ’82, ’86, ’90 and ‘94 World Cups. Growing up in India during that period, I never saw highlights of his performances for FC Barcelona or Napoli (a city where he’s still regarded as part deity, part royalty). There are now some video highlights online that preserve a grainy record of him in his pomp — including THAT goal against England in the Azteca Stadium on June 22, 1986. But these only hint at what he was capable of. They don’t constitute sufficient supporting evidence to the argument that he was the best ever.   What makes it harder still is the even scarcer evidence for claimants of previous generations: Hungary’s Ferenc Puskas, Spain and Argentina’s Alfredo di Stefano, Brazil’s Pele, the Dutchman Johan Cruyff, Germany’s Franz Beckenbauer, et al. That they played under different conditions and rules, and in different positions, makes the argument moot, anyway. We can’t, then, know if Maradona was technically the best to have kicked a ball. Nevertheless, I’m here to argue that he was the greatest of all time. And my case rests on the simple fact that he, more than all the other claimants named here, came closest to defying the dictum that soccer is a team sport. For most of his career, Maradona played in teams that lacked any other world-beating players. Run your eye down the list of the Napoli squad with which he conquered Italian soccer in 1986-87, and there’s not a single other player who would make it to a Serie A hall of fame. He had a slightly better supporting cast in the Argentina sides that he took to two World Cup finals — winning it in ’86, and coming agonizingly close in ’90 — but nobody would argue that Jorge Valdano was to Maradona what, say, Jairzinho was to Pele in ’70. It is one thing to be a brilliant player surrounded by other brilliant players; in this regard Messi and Ronaldo have been exceptionally fortunate with their club teams. But Maradona made magic out of mediocre materials. What makes this even more remarkable is the weight of expectation he carried on his diminutive frame. When he signed for Napoli in 1984, the club had never won the Italian league, and yet its fans immediately began to dream of championship glory. The “pibe de oro,” or golden boy, was as much talisman as captain and player. Other footballers — Messi among them — have since had to cope with comparable pressure, but modern superstars are surrounded by a scaffolding of public relations professionals and psychiatrists to help them. Maradona, lacking support off the field as he did on it, nonetheless delivered the “oro” for club and country over and over again. Until he didn’t. It was probably inevitable that the burdens of his genius would eventually crush him, and they did so in spectacular fashion. But he withstood them long enough to cast in bronze — like the plaque commemorating THAT goal outside the Azteca Stadium — his claim to being the greatest of all time.  RIP, Diego Armando Maradona, GOAT.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/why-maradona-was-better-than-messi-and-ronaldo-920001.html
26-11-2020||Opinion||'Love Jihad' law: Once again an attempt at religious polarisation||हुस्ने मस्तानी के जलवों के जो आदी हो गए। अब तो बाजीराव भी जैसे फसादी हो गए। इस नए क़ानून पर जोधा ने अकबर से कहा। आज से ज़िल्ले इलाही लव जिहादी हो गए । (Smitten as he is by the beauty of Mastani, Bajirao seems to have become a rioter.On the new law, Jodha told Akbar, His Majesty has become a Love Warrior) Not great poetry, but the poignancy of this message, doing the rounds of the social media as I got down to write this piece, could not have been more suitable in these times when more and more matters of the heart, and much more, are being declared 'unsuitable'. With its intention to usher in a new law, the Uttar Pradesh government has driven fear into the hearts of generations who internalised the romantic song from the iconic Hindi 1960 film, Mughal-E-Azam, “Pyar kiya to darna kiya...” (what is there to dread if one has loved). Significantly, Justices Pankaj Naqvi and Justice Vivek Agarwal of the aforesaid court, made these observations while nullifying an FIR of kidnapping, forcible conversion and case under the POCSO Act against a Muslim man accused of forcefully converting and marrying a Hindu girl.  The HC quashed the FIR after lending a patient ear to the girl's father who claimed that conversion for sake of marriage was prohibited and such a marriage had no legal sanctity. Most appreciably, the court opined: "To disregard the choice of a person who is an adult would not only be antithetic to freedom of choice of a grown-up individual but would also be a threat to concept of unity in diversity." Divergence between words and actions Not only did the Uttar Pradesh government, led by Yogi Adityanath, a possible future national-level electoral mascot of Hindutva forces, disregard the HC judgement, but it also went against the assertion of the Centre's declaration in Parliament that "the term ‘Love Jihad’ is not defined under the extant laws." This was stated on February 4, 2020, by Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy in Lok Sabha as part of a written reply to a Parliamentary question.  Since 2014 there has always been a divergence between words and action of members of the Sangh Parivar, especially ones in government. As the representative of the State, ambitions have to be limited within the Constitutional framework. But the cadre and affiliated organisations have always been granted liberty to articulate extreme views. Periodically, these are frowned upon by the leadership and friendly sections of the media label these groups as "fringe forces" to propagate the falsity that the mainstream still maintains a distance from hotheads. This has been seen on matters of cow-protection too when the leadership chided over-enthusiasts and lynchers in public but took no action against even repeat offenders. Role of Adityanath government For quite some time, the Uttar Pradesh government has displayed evidence that the State is beginning to play the role of the rabble-rouser. Adityanath's appointment as chief minister in March 2017 was preceded by a highly polarised electoral campaign replete with use of the politics of dog whistle and he followed this with the formation of anti-Romeo squads. This move failed to fulfil the primary objective of reducing crime against women in the state as the squads opted to function as kangaroo courts, asking alleged offenders to perform sit-ups in public, shave their heads and smear interfaith couples' faces with black paint if found together in public spaces. Even the courts chided the UP Police. The Lucknow Bench of the High Court asked that the least that could be done was to ensure that the Squads followed their 'own guidelines'. In September 2018 a leaked video showed a policewoman berating a Hindu girl for being detained with a Muslims boy. In an act of public shaming, the policewoman was heard screaming vulgarly: "Mullah zyada pasand aa raha hai? Woh hi dikh rahe hain Hindu ke hote hue? Mullah ka .... ho?" (You prefer a Muslim? You could not get for yourself a Hindu boy? Sleeping around with a Muslim?) The next day, another video surfaced and this time vigilantes were showing thrashing the Muslim friend of the Hindu girl.  Now, after this move to get this law underway, there are fears that vigilantism will become redundant because punishment will be permissible under law.  The incident in the video, and the soon-to-be law in Uttar Pradesh, treat Hindu women as inconvenient appendages of a patriarchal worldview. They are not considered worthy of exercising their right to decide matters of their own heart. The entire Love Jihad campaign is based on the belief that Hindu women are 'weaklings' who are routinely seduced by 'handsome' Muslim men. There has been little evolution of this depiction from the 19th Century when medieval Muslims were vilified as ones who debased Hindu women. A long-term campaign It is likely that Uttar Pradesh will be followed by several other BJP-governed states who have declared their intent. Madhya Pradesh is already ready with its draft legislation. The entire campaign has a political objective. In the short run, the idea is to polarise the voter in West Bengal where polls are due in April-May 2021. Already a pictorial campaign has been launched in the state with the words Love Jihad smeared over the photographs of Mamata Banerjee and Asaduddin Owaisi. In the long run, the idea is to keep public angst focussed away from policy matters and on more emotive issues, and what better way can there be than hate and fear. It is certain that the Uttar Pradesh Ordinance will be challenged in court. Both legal outcomes would benefit the BJP and its affiliates in the Sangh Parivar. If the law is upheld, the deck would be cleared for a national law to prevent inter-faith marriages as the Special Marriage Act functions more as a dissuasive tool, than an empowering enabler, for adults to exercise personal rights and breakaway from rigid parental control seeped in moribund traditional norms. In the event of courts declaring the enacted law as null and void, energy will once be diverted to a campaign proclaiming instruments of the State as continuing to 'appease' minorities while being against interests of the majority community. At a time when the judiciary is being criticised for being unable to uphold the fundamental rights of citizens, such a campaign will make things more difficult.

26-11-2020||Opinion||The wrong way to regulate disinformation||When the Kerala Governor signed a controversial Ordinance, now withdrawn, proposing amendments to the Kerala Police Act, there was understandably a significant amount of criticism and ire directed at the state government for a provision that warranted a three-year jail term for intentionally and falsely defaming a person or a group of people. After the backlash, the state’s Chief Minister announced his intention not to implement the fresh amendment.  How not to regulate information disorder For anyone tracking the information ecosystem and how different levels of state administration are responding to information disorder (misinformation, disinformation and malinformation) this attempted overreach is not surprising. In Kerala alone, over the last few months, we have witnessed accusations from the opposition of ‘Trump-ian’ behaviour on the part of the state administration to decry any unflattering information as ‘fake news’. Even in September, the Chief Minister had to assure people that measures to curb information disorder will not affect media freedom, after pushback against decisions to expand fact-checking initiatives beyond Covid-19 related news. In October, it was reported that over 200 cases were filed for ‘fake news’ in the preceding five months. How to regulate information disorder? Before proceeding to ‘the how’, it is important to consider two fundamental questions when it comes to the topic of regulating disinformation. First, should we? Four or five years ago, many people would have said no. Yet, today, many people will probably say yes. What will we say in the four or five years from now? We don’t know.  Then, do we need new laws? It is not uncommon to witness the political theatre of rushed legislation to create the appearance of ‘taking action’ when very often, the solution lies somewhere in between building capacity and enforcing existing laws.  These are questions that we need to debate and answer in ways that will stand the test of time. In The Disinformation Age Heidi Tworek of the University of British Columbia, and Ben Epstein from DePaul University, approach the question of regulating information disorder. Similarly, Richard Allan, (a visiting fellow at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism) engaged with the role of a ‘misinformation regulator’ on Regulate.Tech. Keep in mind that these works are from the perspective of the US and UK respectively, but there are lessons that we can draw when it comes to the broader topic of regulating disinformation online. Heidi Tworek warns of ‘novelty hype’, in that, we consider prevailing circumstances to be unique and in the process risk the following: Misdiagnosing issues as content problems rather than situating them in the broader context of international relations, economics and society; overlooking the path dependence of the internet (that is, the history of technologies preceding the internet matters); focusing on day-to-day occurrences instead of investigating underlying structures and thinking short term instead of the long-term and unintended consequences of regulation.  She then draws historical lessons from the German inter-war period that could be applicable today. Some that are more applicable to the Indian context are: Business structures are often more important than individual pieces of content, that solutions should address societal divisions that the media is being used to exploit and the need for robust regulatory institutions and to “democracy-proof” solutions so they cannot be bent or captured by the powers of the day. Ben Epstein poses three important questions that can offer some further insight on how to proceed. First, how should the problem be framed? Next, who should control the regulation? And finally, what would effective regulation look like? Let’s take these one by one.  When you consider the information ecosystem and problem framing, it can be tempting to disregard intentions since the concerns are with the consequences (they are not often easy to establish either). However, when considering punitive measures, limiting the scope by intent is a useful guardrail to start with. In other words, clean the ecosystem through positive incentives and regulate and/or prosecute for intent/disinformation. Principles to regulate information disorder The control of regulation is often posed as a binary between self-regulation and government regulation. And for many, it seems the self-regulation option is closed. This is partly down to the actions (or inactions) of the platforms themselves. But Covid-19 and the US elections have demonstrated that platforms can act (whether these actions are effective is another topic) when strong enough incentives, positive or negative, are created for them to do so – in this case, likely political and public pressure.  It is also important to keep in mind that the likelihood of systemic changes to incentives without a state-backed push, in a timeframe we need, seems unlikely. Though, events around the world suggest that the information ecosystem is also too fragile to be controlled by an unfettered state. Here, Epstein and Richard Allan offer a middle-ground of sorts in the form of independent commissions.  And finally, on what this regulation should look like. Based on these efforts, we arrive at four guiding principles. First, disinformation regulation should minimise the harm posed by disinformation but cause minimal additional harm. Second, it should be commensurate with the size of the harm caused by disinformation as well as the market size of the companies subject to it. Third, such regulation should be forward-thinking, adaptable and responsive to changes in the information ecosystem. And finally, they should be informed by research in the field and ‘determined’ by independent agencies. Now, contrast these with what we have seen so far.

26-11-2020||Panorama||Sailing on rough seas, Uddhav Thackeray has outgunned BJP so far||On November 28, the ‘Trimurti’ -- Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress – alliance’s Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will complete what has been a tumultuous first year in office. Despite the rough weather, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray seems to have his hands firmly on the stern and has managed to keep the boat moving steadily ahead. With NCP supremo Sharad Pawar as the guiding compass of the MVA alliance, the leaders of the three parties know the direction in which they want to head. The opposition BJP has attacked Thackeray almost daily, with even Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari taking potshots at the government frequently. Following the 2019 Vidhan Sabha elections, the state witnessed a brief spell of President’s Rule. Then, in a shocking move, the BJP had Devendra Fadnavis sworn in as Chief Minister for a second term in a midnight to dawn drama in which Sharad Pawar’s nephew Ajit Pawar defected to the BJP camp and promised Fadnavis the support of the NCP; the Centre revoked President’s Rule in the middle of the night, the President signed the order instantly, and Governor Koshyari swore in Fadnavis at dawn. But for all that drama, it lasted barely 80 hours, and Fadnavis had to resign. The MVA alliance took shape and formed the government, largely due to the efforts of Sharad Pawar and Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut. But barely had the government settled down when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, with Maharashtra quickly becoming the worst-affected state. Then came the fury of Cyclone Nisarga, which devastated the South Konkan region, two mega-floods in Vidarbha and in Marathwada and Western Maharashtra, a huge resource crunch in the economy, and the fall-out of the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput. The Shiv Sena’s relations with the BJP-led NDA dispensation at the Centre – of which it was a part before it broke ranks to join the Congress-NCP combine – are bitter – as evident from the pending GST dues to the state, the NIA takeover of the Koregaon-Bhima case, the scrapping of the Aarey Metro car-shed and the Dharavi Redevelopment Project. The MVA came under fire in April when two Sadhus, Kalpavriksha Giri Maharaj and Sushil Giri Maharaj, and their driver Nilesh Telgade, were brutally lynched to death on the night of April 16 in Gadchinchale village in Palghar district, some 120 km from Mumbai. The BJP sought to paint the Shiv Sena-led government as anti-Hindu and emanded a CBI probe, but CM Uddhav Thackeray handed over the case to the Maharashtra CID. Some 350 persons have been arrested so far in the case. Another controversy was sought to be used against the Thackeray government after the June 14 death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, and that of his talent manager Disha Salian a week earlier. BJP bigwigs, including Fadnavis, now the Leader of the Opposition, have consistently attacked Uddhav Thackeray for his handling of the Rajput case. Narayan Rane, a former Shiv Sena politician who is now with the BJP, went a step further, alleging that the CM’s son and Tourism Minister Aditya Thackeray was involved in Rajput’s death. While Mumbai Police were still looking into the death of Rajput, the actor’s father Krishna Kishore Singh filed an FIR in Patna claiming foul play, which the BJP-JD(U) government in Bihar used to hand over the case to the CBI. The Supreme Court transferred the case to the CBI but to the relief of the Thackerays, the CBI has not found anything amiss in the investigation that Mumbai Police had already done. But that was not the end of their troubles. Other central agencies have followed the CBI in a bid to tighten the noose on the Thackerays. The Enforcement Directorate has been at it, and the Narcotics Control Bureau has widened the probe to investigate a Bollywood-drug mafia nexus. By September, what began as a suicide-or-murder investigation had become quite something else, with Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut becoming the spearhead of a BJP attack on the Thackerays. The Thackerays hit back, with the Brihan Mumbai Municipal Corporation demolishing alleged illegal portions of Ranaut’s Bandra bungalow. The Centre moved in to protect Ranaut, including with a Y-category security cover for the actor. Meanwhile, Republic TV Editor Arnab Goswami kept up the drumbeat of allegations against the Thackerays and the Maharashtra government. The MVA government hit back by reopening a 2018 double-suicide case and arrested Goswami. Simultaneously, Mumbai Police unearthed an alleged TRP scam involving Republic TV. The Shiv Sena has also taken on the BJP, alleging that the latter had joined hands with vested interests to malign the Maharashtra government. On the biggest challenge that the MVA government has faced – the Covid-19 pandemic – too, Thackeray has been at the receiving end of the BJP, including for “working from home.” While Mumbai and Maharashtra were the worst-affected for several months, the MVA government’s handling of the pandemic in the hotspot of Dharavi earned it laurels from international organisations, including the World Health Organization. However, the government has now warned that there could be a second wave of infections in early 2021. While Thackeray has a difficult enough task managing a coalition with partners of diametrically opposite ideology, he has not taken things thrown at him by the BJP lying down. For instance, he rattled the Centre when he demanded that it scrap the GST regime and return to the old indirect tax system, saying that the states had not benefited from GST. The Centre owes Maharashtra a whopping Rs 30,000 crore – and the politics between BJP and Shiv Sena isn’t helping the state get its due. Thackeray has also ordered a probe into the JalYukt Shivir Abhiyan, the flagship water supply scheme of Fadnavis, scrapped the Mumbai Metro car-shed at Aarey Milk Colony and shifted it to Kanjur Marg, and ordered retendering for the Dharavi Development Project. Given the tough odds he is against, Thackeray has managed to outfox the BJP so far. Will he continue to be able to do so?||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/sailing-on-rough-seas-uddhav-thackeray-has-outgunned-bjp-so-far-920287.html
26-11-2020||Right in the Middle||Bedtime stories||Niharika would not budge a bit that day. Until I fed my 6-yr old granddaughter her daily ‘dose’ of a new bedtime story, she would not sleep. Even the reasoning that doing so in the AC coach of our overnight train would disturb other co-passengers didn’t convince her. I had no option but to whisper a random story into her ears. She was barely four when I introduced her to short bedtime stories. Soon, she became so fixated with it that telling her one every night became a must for me. Sometimes, even I would drift into drowse taking the story to an alien track when she would stir me up to regain my senses! As she grew, she lost interest in fantasy stories and craved for the ones that looked real. With my small treasure of stories soon getting exhausted, I started saving photos of the stories of her liking published in newspaper columns and children’s magazines and books for its instant retrieval when needed. A TV series “I Shouldn’t Be Alive,” based on the real-life thrilling events, telecast on Discovery Channel also provided me fodder. As described by Aleks Krotoski, stories act as “memory aids, instruction manuals, and moral compasses” for the children. It was my late grandmother who made me discover the true potential of stories. Every night, I and other siblings would encircle her for a story which she narrated in her own inimitable style. During my schooling, fifty years ago, our library had a series of books, each captioned on the folk tales of different Indian regions. Believing these books to be extinct, I was pleasantly surprised to find them all freely available in my recent online Search! I am continuing with story-telling to my younger granddaughter, Kamakshi, whenever she comes to Bengaluru. Though disinclined initially, it took just a few witty animal stories for her fondness for the stories to get wings! Lest both she and Niharika miss my stories when they are away, I sought refuge in technology. Now, I simply find a nice story somewhere and record it in my own voice on my smartphone, and then ‘Whatsapp’ the recording to them!

26-11-2020||Second Edit||Diego Maradona: A flawed genius||If you were a sports fan growing up in India in the 1980s, you had two larger-than-life figures to look up to. There was Kapil Dev, who led India to its maiden World Cup triumph in 1983. And there was Argentine maverick Diego Armando Maradona, who guided his team to its second FIFA World Cup crown in 1986. Kapil and Maradona didn’t script these triumphs all on their own, but their imprint in their teams' success was unmistakable. A second World Cup crown in three editions meant as much to Argentina as India winning cricket's greatest prize for the first time, in the most unexpected fashion. The canvases of the two sports may have been different, but the impact of the victories on the respective nations was similar. Two countries steeped in poverty and looking for light at the end of a tunnel had something to cheer about. These successes were welcome distractions from the harsh realities of life for millions. And while cricket's popularity grew manifold on the back of the 1983 triumph, Maradona attained god-like status in already football-crazy Argentina. Maradona’s dramatic fall from grace, culminating in his ejection from the 1994 World Cup for doping, was as spectacular as his meteoric rise had been eight years previously. The genius who transformed a mediocre Italian club like Napoli into a continental force with his inspirational performances slipped into a morass of hopelessness following dalliances with drug lords and addiction to cocaine. Considered, along with Pele, as the greatest footballer of all time, Maradona's similarities with his significantly older Brazilian counterpart ended on the football turf. Where Pele has maintained a squeaky-clean image, Maradona was anything but a role model. The man who showed such impeccable ball-control couldn't summon the same quality as he unabashedly embraced multiple vices. Alcohol and drug abuse began to become as well chronicled as his on-field achievements. A bundle of contradictions, he was a footballing genius with a sordid lifestyle who made little attempt to either hide or rectify it. If anything, he proudly flaunted it, like he did his 'Hand of God' goal. Few have tried to glamourise "cheating" in sports like Maradona and succeeded in it. Thanks to his own narration of the story leading up to that goal against England in the 1986 quarterfinal, it's spoken of in the same breath as his 'goal of the century', which came four minutes later in the same match. That pretty much sums up Maradona – he was a magician on the field, but off it, his zest for trouble knew no limit. And yet, Argentina and the world loved him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/diego-maradona-a-flawed-genius-920269.html
26-11-2020||South||After making landfall in Puducherry, Cyclone Nivar weakens into severe cyclonic storm||Powerful Cyclone Nivar, packing estimated wind speeds of 120 to 130 kmph, made its landfall as a very severe cyclonic storm near Puducherry coast in the wee hours of Thursday. The centre of the cyclone took three hours to cross the coast, the Indian Meteorological Department said in an update at around 3.30 am. The terse update said the centre of the cyclone, which travelled at a speed of 16 km per hour, began its landfall at 11.30 pm on Wednesday and completed at 2.30 am on Thursday. After landing, the very severe cyclonic storm weakened into a severe cyclonic storm. "It would continue to move north-westwards and weaken further into a cyclonic storm in the next six hours, the IMD added. Cyclone Nivar is understood to have landed in Marakkanam in Villupuram district in Tamil Nadu, 40 km from Puducherry. At least one woman died in Marakkanam due to the cyclone, Villupuram MP D Ravikumar wrote on his verified Twitter page. The extent of the damage caused by the cyclone is yet to be known. Besides massive efforts by the governments of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, two warships – INS Sumitra and INS Jyoti – are on stand-by for assistance in the aftermath of the cyclone, while the Indian Army and the Indian Coast Guard also made elaborate arrangements to provide succour to the people after the landfall. Apart from state disaster response teams, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has pre-positioned 19 teams in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, while over 465 ambulances were kept ready in the state. With the landfall area likely to be around Puducherry, focus is now on the UT and Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, which is prone to cyclones. Over 1.20 lakh people living in low-lying areas and places vulnerable to flooding were evacuated and lodged in 1,455 relief centres across Tamil Nadu, while 2,000 were moved to such camps in neighbouring Puducherry. Road traffic between Tamil Nadu and Puducherry also came to a halt. Commissioner of Revenue Administration K Phanindra Reddy told DH that 1.21 lakh people across the state have been lodged in 1,455 relief centres. “We have kept 4,733 relief centres ready across the state that can house nearly 13 lakh people. We are prepared to tackle the cyclone and at this moment we also want people to stay indoors,” he said. Officials said physical distancing is being maintained at all relief centres while Covid-19 testing will be done for people who display symptoms. The city of Chennai looked like a ghost town on Wednesday as major roads witnessed heavy water-logging due to torrential rains that began early Tuesday. As the city was on the edge, Chennai Traffic Police closed down all major roads in the city and asked people to remain indoors. The Chennai International Airport also suspended its operation for 12 hours – from 7 pm on Wednesday to 7 am on Thursday, while Southern Railway cancelled close to 30 trains. Tamil Nadu government extended the public holiday to Thursday in 16 districts as it kept ready equipment and personnel to clear the roads as the cyclone is expected to uproot trees.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/after-making-landfall-in-puducherry-cyclone-nivar-weakens-into-severe-cyclonic-storm-919985.html
26-11-2020||South||Cyclone Nivar: Nearly 300 trees uprooted in Chennai||As Cyclone Nivar packed winds with speed up to 130 kmph rammed the coast between Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, it seemed to have had a devastating effect on the green cover in Chennai. Nearly 300 trees, including those on arterial roads in the city, were uprooted due to gusty winds that travelled as far as over 100 km from where the very severe cyclonic storm made its landfall in the wee hours of Thursday. Huge trees located on the Dr Radhakrishnan Salai, close to the Marina Beach, Triplicane, Raja Annamalaipuram, Kodambakkam, Mambalam, and other areas were uprooted due to the wind speed that is estimated to be between 120 to 130 kmph. In an early morning update, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) said 267 trees fell due to the effect of the cyclone on Wednesday night and that 223 of them have already been cleared. Residents also posted pictures of uprooted trees in their locality on social media requesting GCC to clear them. Falling of trees is a major concern for the city as it has already lost much of its treasured trees to Cyclone Vardah that hit the Chennai coast in 2016. Hundreds of trees in localities like Kalaignar Karunanidhi Nagar (K K Nagar) were uprooted due to the impact of the cyclone four years back. As rains subsided in the city, teams from the GCC were out to remove trees and pump the flood water out of major roads and streets across the metropolis. Suburbs, especially Tambaram and surrounding areas in Chengalpattu district, seems to be the worst-hit as several villages were marooned due to heavy rains that pounded the area for two days in a row. Cyclone Nivar made its landfall as a very severe cyclonic storm near Puducherry coast in the wee hours of Thursday. The centre of the cyclone took three hours to cross the coast, the Indian Meteorological Department said in an update at around 3.30 am. The terse update said the centre of the cyclone, which travelled at a speed of 16 km per hour, began its landfall at 11.30 pm on Wednesday and completed at 2.30 am on Thursday.

Cyclone Nivar made landfall near the Puducherry with winds of up to 130 km per hour (81 miles per hour), according to the India Meteorological Department. Heavy rains triggered by the storm caused flooding in some streets of the city of Chennai, which is home to many large automobile manufacturers, according to a Reuters witness. Television networks showed fallen trees in Chennai and people walking in knee-deep water in some streets. No casualties were immediately reported, local media said. "This year, because of the precautions taken, the situation has not been that bad. Except for a few fallen trees and flooding in some streets, we have largely been safe," said S. Sakthivel, a shopkeeper in the city. Chennai's city corporation said on Twitter it was working to clear the roads. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from low-lying areas of Tamil Nadu ahead of the storm's landfall, R.B. Udhayakumar, Tamil Nadu's disaster management minister, said on Wednesday. The Meteorological Department said that Nivar's intensity had dropped to 85 to 95 kph (53 to 59 mph) and is expected to weaken further.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cyclone-nivar-tears-down-power-lines-trees-no-casualties-920043.html
26-11-2020||South||Why the BJP bigwigs are campaigning in a city body elections in Telangana||This is the first time the BJP national president is participating in a civic body election campaign, a senior Telangana BJP leader claimed, while putting together names of the prominent personalities in the party and central government descending on Hyderabad this week. Maharashtra former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday, party chief J P Nadda is coming on November 27, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath on 28th and Home Minister Amit Shah on the 29th. And two days later – on December 1 - are the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polls, for which the state BJP leaders are already engaged in a fierce electioneering bout with the TRS. While Union Minister of State for Home Kishan Reddy is the homeboy, two senior BJP ministers – Prakash Javadekar and Smriti Irani, and the BJP's youth wing chief Tejasvi Surya have already toured Hyderabad, launching a blistering attack on “the Kalvakuntla family rule in the state, gross mismanagement over city's floods and the TRS-AIMIM cooperative letting the refugee Rohingyas, illegal immigrants, vote.” With its ceaseless political attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and counterattacks on the BJP from the last several days, analysts say, the ruling party in Telangana state and Hyderabad corporation has admitted in practice what it denies verbally – the BJP's emergence as its main rival in the polls. Opinion polls, T-BJP's own analysis shows that the party would fare impressively in the civic polls, compared to the four out of total 150 GHMC wards it won in 2016. So, what is the arrival of the saffron party's luminaries in a city civic body's poll scene for? CM Kalvakuntla Chandrasekhar Rao's TRS, which evolved from agitation to administration in 2014, and has become invincible since then was humbled for the first time by the BJP, which wrested the TRS held seat in its bastion. It was the second time if we consider the 2019 defeat of KCR's daughter Kalvakuntla Kavitha in Nizamabad and winning of three other Lok Sabha seats by the BJP in a state, where its assembly tally had fallen from five to one, six months back. The general election triumph was largely because of Modi's nationwide charisma, but the Dubbaka assembly success is attributed to the state unit's rigour in turning resentment against the TRS to BJP's favour. The unexpected result has the party leadership's attention turned on Telangana, while it simultaneously strategizes for the assembly polls in neighbouring Tamil Nadu next year. BJP leaders see the 2020 Hyderabad polls as their grand archway to the 2023 Telangana assembly arena. The GHMC jurisdiction covers a whopping 24 assembly constituencies i.e. 20 per cent of total seats. With the Congress party seen as falling into disarray, the BJP realizes this three year time as its opportunity to advance in Telangana. “Our fight in Hyderabad elections, irrespective of the success rate, is to concretely fix 2023 assembly elections as the target to assume power in Telangana,” a senior BJP functionary says. While the T-BJP leaders state their top leaders' presence would boost the karyakartas' morale, with a bonus of national attention on their disclosure of TRS's alleged corrupt rule, analysts believe the stalwarts agreed to come as the civic polls guarantee to display BJP's gains in seats and vote percentage. Ramchander denied reports claiming that Modi might also canvas for BJP in the Hyderabad polls.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/why-the-bjp-bigwigs-are-campaigning-in-a-city-body-elections-in-telangana-920044.html

Cyclone Nivar made landfall near the Puducherry with winds of up to 130 km per hour (81 miles per hour), according to the India Meteorological Department. Heavy rains from the storm caused flooding in some streets of Chennai, Tamil Nadu's largest city which is home to many large automobile manufacturers, according to a Reuters witness. The storm caused at least five deaths in and around Chennai from trees falling, drowning and electrocution, the Times of India reported. A spokesman for the chief minister's office declined to comment on the reported deaths. Local administration workers have been working to remove fallen trees and power lines, city corporation officials said on Twitter. People in Velachery, a low-lying suburb of Chennai, said the storm's impact was mitigated by steps taken by the government ahead of the storm, compared to the hundreds of deaths during floods in 2015. "The situation was terrible here during the floods in 2015. This year, because of the precautions taken, the situation has not been that bad," said S. Sakthivel, a shopkeeper in Velachery. More than a hundred cars were parked on the edge of a bridge in Velachery to keep them above the floodwaters, according to a Reuters witness. While rains are expected to subside in Tamil Nadu, heavy precipitation is expected in the Rayalaseema region of the neighbouring state of Andhra Pradesh on Thursday.

Another farmer was feared washed away while NDRF personnel rescued two others from a reservoir in Chittoor district. According to the State Disaster Management Authority, SPS Nellore, Chittoor, Kadapa, Krishna, Prakasam and East Godavari districts received heavy to extremely heavy rainfall at more than 177 places. Other districts like Anantapuramu, Kurnool, Guntur and West Godavari were also receiving moderate to heavy rainfall under Nivar's impact. It said gales with a speed of 45-65 kmph were lashing SPS Nellore and Chittoor districts bordering Tamil Nadu. Tirumala Hills, the abode of Lord Venkateswara, has been receiving incessant rain since Wednesday, causing a lot of hardship to hundreds of devotees stranded there. In SPS Nellore district, which was the worst hit with rainfall as high as 30 cm, at least 3,363 people were shifted to 115 relief camps from vulnerable areas, district Collector Chakradhar Babu said. The Swarnamukhi river in SPS Nellore district was in spate while the Somasila reservoir received an inflow of 65,000 cusecs. State Water Resources Minister P Anil Kumar visited some relief camps and spoke to the affected people. He later reviewed the situation with his department officials and directed them to ensure that there were no breaches to tanks. Reservoirs in SPS Nellore, Chittoor and Kadapa districts filled to the brim following which excess water was being let out into the streams and rivulets downstream. This has resulted in water overflowing on roads at many places, cutting off road communication, and also inundating agricultural fields. Uprooted trees also blocked traffic on roads in Kadapa, Chittoor and SPS Nellore districts. The rain left standing crops in several hundred acres inundated in some districts, according to preliminary reports received at the State Disaster Management Authority here. Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy reviewed the situation with top officials here on Thursday afternoon and asked the respective district Collectors to be on high alert and render every assistance wherever required. The Chief Minister asked SPS Nellore district Collector to render all assistance to the family of the person who died of electrocution on Wednesday. In Chittoor district, three farmers went to their fields to fetch electric motors but were suddenly caught in a swirling flood from the Mallemadugu reservoir on Thursday. "We tried to deploy a helicopter for the rescue operation but inclement weather did not permit it. Still, our teams are continuing the search operation for the missing farmer," Chittoor district Collector Narayana Bharat Gupta said. He asked people not to venture out of their homes for two days in view of the turbulent situation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cyclone-nivar-kills-one-in-andhra-pradesh-brings-torrential-rains-920155.html
26-11-2020||South||Will 'rose' play spoilsport for 'lotus' in Thiruvananthapuram local body election?||The 'rose' seems to be posing serious concerns for the 'lotus' in Thiruvananthapuram Corporation. BJP made a major stride in Thiruvananthapuram Corporation in the 2015 local body elections by winning 35 out of 100 seats up from just six in 2010 and the party is pinning high hopes to secure majority this time and end CPM-led left front's two-decade-long dominance. But a series of independent candidates with names identical to that of BJP candidates and having rose flower as a symbol are posing a serious concern for the saffron party BJP already launched a stir against the Kerala State Election Commission alleging that it was a deliberate move by the commission as well as some pro-Left employees involved in election duty to allot rose flower as symbols to namesake candidates. At least eleven wards in Thiruvananthapuram have independent candidates with their names identical to that of BJP's candidates and rose flower as a symbol. At four other local body wards in Thiruvananthapuram district also there are similar namesake candidates with a rose flower as a symbol. While the ballot papers of Lok Sabha and Assembly polls are having the candidates' names in the order of names of national parties, state parties, other recognised parties and independents, in the local body polls it will be in alphabetic order of candidates' names in Malayalam. Hence the names of independent candidates that are identical would come close. Hence the BJP was concerned if it would confuse voters and affect the winning chances of BJP candidates. For instance, Anu G Prabha is the BJP candidate at Kazhakoottam ward where Technopark is located, while there is an independent candidate named Anu with the rose flower as a symbol. BJP's Archana Manikantan is facing a threat from M S Archana with rose flower symbol at Powdikonam, which is another ward. BJP state president K Surendran alleged that it was a deliberate attempt to sabotage the elections, that is to be held on December 8. However, state election commissioner V Bhaskaran told DH that the allegations against the commission in connection to the namesake candidates were baseless. Rose flower has been an approved free symbol of the state election commission for quite a long time. The symbols were allotted to candidates as per their requests only, he said. While the commission would be giving a reply in this regard to a petition given by the BJP, sources in the party said that it might approach the High Court if the state election commission did not address the issue. BJP is planning a massive campaign by using the model of the ballot paper to be used on EVMs to ensure that the votes for lotus did not fall accidentally to the rose flower. Both symbols may not look alike when viewed together. But when it is on ballots, there are considerable chances of voters being confused. Since the number of voters in local body wards are very few compared to that of Assembly and Parliament, each and every vote is very important, said a BJP worker. Meanwhile, sources in the election commission said that a proposal was sent to the government several years back to make necessary amendments in rules to model the ballot papers for local body polls on the lines of those for Assembly and Lok Sabha elections so that such confusions could be averted. However, there was no action from the government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/will-rose-play-spoilsport-for-lotus-in-thiruvananthapuram-local-body-election-920188.html

It was his deep passion towards football and the immense admiration for Maradona that prompted V Raveendran, who runs Hotel Blue Nile in Kannur city in North Kerala, to keep the suite room used by Maradona intact. The plates and towels he used, the cigarette packets left by him and bouquets he received are among the items with Maradona's touch being preserved there. Around 200 pictures of the footballer, including the those taken during his two day Kerala visit, are another attraction of the room. Raveendran told DH that it was like a dream come true for him when Maradona stayed at his hotel. It obviously enhanced the reputation of the hotel. The suite room is now being given only to selected guests, especially those having genuine love for football. Otherwise the room might be spoiled. The room will be retained as a museum for football lovers to have a look, he said. Kannur district, which is known for its love for football, indeed gave a rousing reception to Maradona during his two-day trip form October 24, 2012. The stadium where he attended a private jewellery firm's promotional event was jam-packed with football lovers. Amazed by the reception, Maradona had even danced and displayed some of his football skills.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-hotel-turns-room-where-diego-maradonas-stayed-into-a-museum-920207.html

The two villages are located very close just divided by the stream. But the rains that pounded the northern Tamil Nadu coast under the influence of Cyclone Nivar since Tuesday submerged the ground-level bridge that connects the two hamlets, which are near Marakkanam, where the cyclone made its landfall. But when Mani made the journey in the river that was in spate, he had water above his waist. “What else can I do? The detour via Marakanam is around seven km and I do not have a motorcycle. I took the risk to cross the river which is in spate due to the rains and I had the shock of my life when I saw my paddy field submerged in water. We just hope the water recedes in just a few days so that the crops are saved,” Mani told DH before taking the “risk” yet again to reach home. This is not the first time that the residents of Kanimedu and Mandagapattu are suffering due to torrential rains. Aadhi Lakshmi, who works in agriculture fields, said the monsoon season is a nightmare for residents of Mandagapattu. “We do not get even a match box in our village. We have to go to Kanimedu or Marakkanam to get our supplies. The ground-level bridge gets submerged if there is heavy rain in the region. We have to survive on whatever we have till the water level reduces here,” she said.Though their demand for a bridge fell to the deaf ears of authorities, the district administration was in full attendance at the village on Thursday morning to check the damages due to Cyclone Nivar. “At least they came today. Otherwise, they do not turn up,” she said, adding that trees that fell due to the cyclone were cleared swiftly on Thursday morning. 65-year-old Paavadai, who has cultivated paddy in a couple of acres of land, is hoping against the hope that the water recedes very soon. “The paddy crop that I cultivated just a few weeks ago is under the water. This is our only source of income and I am just hopeful the water recedes soon and the crop is saved,” he said, as he asked the children of the village not to go near the river. The river has become the centre of attraction now with people from near-by villages coming in auto rickshaws and motorcycles to look at the river in spate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/nondescript-village-in-tamil-nadu-cut-off-due-to-cyclone-nivar-residents-swim-to-cross-river-920215.html

Fire and rescue personnel deployed boats to rescue nearly 200 persons from the two villages, located just a few km from Tambaram, the gateway to Chennai from Southern Tamil Nadu, as rains subsided on Thursday morning. They were lodged in schools and community centres in the localities. Using boats to rescue people from low-lying areas aforementioned areas and in places like Velachery, which attained posh status due to the IT boom, has become a common sight during heavy rains. Residents of a few localities in Velachery were also rescued using boats on Wednesday. Videos and photos of rescue personnel helming the boats with senior citizens, women, and kids went viral on social media, highlighting the problems that come along with rapid urbanisation. “The water kept going up every hour. But luckily we were on the first floor. We are happy that we have been rescued today. We have to come back here because this is our home,” Anthony Dass, who has been living in Mudichur, since 2010 told DH. Power supply, which was cut-off in areas which experienced gusty winds on Wednesday, was yet to be restored in several areas with the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) admitting that there was a problem, though supply was restored in most areas by Thursday night. The situation was not any good in many areas in the crowded North Chennai, with people wading through waist-deep water to buy essentials and get back home. And adding to their woes was the power cut. “It is quite cold, so we do not even need a fan. But what about water? We have been using water very sparsely since Tuesday. But yet it got over on Thursday. We cannot run the motor as the power supply is not yet restored,” Banu, who lives in an apartment in Ayanavaram, said. Besides the troubles that people went through, Cyclone Nivar also had a devastating effect on the green cover in the city. Nearly 300 trees, including those on arterial roads in the city, were uprooted due to gusty winds that travelled as far as over 100 km from where the very severe cyclonic storm made its landfall in the wee hours of Thursday. Huge trees located on the Dr Radhakrishnan Salai, close to the Marina Beach, Triplicane, Raja Annamalaipuram, Kodambakkam, Mambalam, and other areas were uprooted due to the wind speed that is estimated to be between 120 to 130 kmph. The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) said 267 trees fell due to the effect of the cyclone on Wednesday night. Falling of trees is a major concern for the city as it has already lost much of its treasured trees to Cyclone Vardah that hit the Chennai coast in 2016. Hundreds of trees in localities like Kalaignar Karunanidhi Nagar (K K Nagar) were uprooted due to the impact of the cyclone four years back.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cyclone-nivar-residents-marooned-in-their-homes-moved-to-safety-using-boats-920222.html
26-11-2020||South||3 die, 1,000 trees uprooted as Cyclone Nivar lands near Puducherry||Cyclone Nivar made landfall between Marakanam and Puducherry in the wee hours of Thursday as a very severe cyclonic storm, but the impact and damage was not as heavy as it was predicted. At least three people lost their lives in cyclone-related incidents, while over 1,000 trees were uprooted across the state. Though the winds that packed speeds of 120-130 kmph did not bring much damage to trees, electric poles and houses, heavy to very heavy rainfall that accompanied Cyclone Nivar inundated several areas of Chennai, Puducherry, Chengalpattu, Villupuram, and Cuddalore districts. Relief efforts were on-going. After crossing the Puducherry coast, Nivar weakened into a severe cyclonic storm, then into a cyclonic storm and further into a deep depression Thursday evening. As the cyclone moved towards interior districts, several areas in Tiruvallur, Vellore, Ranipet, and Tirupathur districts were drenched with rains through Thursday. Heavy damages were expected due to the IMD forecast and also because the winds packed speed of 120-130 kmph gusting to 145 kmph. People stayed indoors as the memories of Cyclone Gaja that ravaged the Cauvery Delta region in 2018 came back to haunt them. Most people who were staying in relief camps left for their homes after learning that there was no major damage to their roofs. The governments of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, which took enough precautionary measures, also moved swiftly to remove uprooted trees, and their branches from roads. Most of the trees that fell on the scenic East Coast Road (ECR) had been removed by Thursday noon while water was being pumped out from all low-lying areas in Chennai and Puducherry. Puducherry and nearby Cuddalore received more than 20 cm rainfall each in the past two days. A visit to the two districts showed the damage was not as predicted by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), though many areas were still underwater. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami visited cyclone-affected areas in Cuddalore, while his Puducherry counterpart V Narayanasamy was also on the streets overseeing the relief and rescue operations. Palaniswami took credit for the less damage saying it was possible only because of the “efforts” put in by his government. Leader of Opposition M K Stalin blamed him for not taking steps to prevent flooding in Chennai. One person died each in Tiruvallur, Chennai, and Villupuram, while over 100 electric poles were uprooted. Though not many electric poles were damaged, power supply which was snapped in several areas of Chennai and the affected districts were yet to be restored at the time of writing. “The damages are being firmed up. The precautionary measures that we took have minimised the damage. We are getting reports of damage from districts and we are in the process of firming them up. There may not be significant additions to be made other than what have already been announced. The death toll remains three as of now,” Commissioner of Revenue Administration K Phanindra Reddy told DH. As the cyclone made its landfall, public transport in seven districts resumed on Thursday afternoon. Sub-urban and train services also resumed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/3-die-1000-trees-uprooted-as-cyclone-nivar-lands-near-puducherry-920232.html

Paddy crops over an extent of 820 hectares besides vegetables on 200 hectares, sugarcane on 170 hectares, 55 hectares of banana crop and betel leaf cultivated on seven hectares had been severely hit by the torrential rains, the chief minister said. Puducherry administration would seek an interim relief of Rs 50 crores from the Centre, he told reporters. A full assessment was being made by the departments on the total quantum of loss in farm and other sectors although it had been estimated tentatively that the loss would be Rs 400 crore, Narayanasamy said. He expressed relief that 'Nivar' had caused no big loss and there was no loss of life. "I thank the Almighty for saving Puducherry from the fury of the cyclone," he said appreciating the teamwork of all departments, the NDRF team and defence personnel. Puducherry registered 27 cm rainfall while Karaikal recorded 10 cm in the 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. Thursday. Water was drained from low lying areas and various housing colonies using pumps. All trees that were uprooted under the strong winds were being removed, the chief minister said||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/estimated-loss-due-to-cyclone-nivar-put-at-rs-400-crore-puducherry-cm-920242.html

26-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Posting blitz sets off 'CM-change' buzz in Karnataka||A flurry of appointments to various statutory boards and corporations continued on Wednesday, giving flight to rumours of Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa’s likely exit. Over the past few days, the administration appointed or nominated 53 people seen as Yediyurappa loyalists as chairpersons, directors and ex-officio members at different boards and corporations. On Wednesday, 20 people were appointed or nominated, adding to 33 on Tuesday. Chief ministers usually appoint MLAs to boards and corporations to mollify them. But despite pressure from ministerial aspirants, Yediyurappa picked only three legislators while doling out positions in boards: Duryodhan Aihole (Raibag), S R Vishwanath (Yelahanka) and B C Nagesh (Tiptur). The appointments started after Yediyurappa’s meeting with BJP national general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh on Monday. Soon after the meeting, Yediyurappa allocated Rs 500 crore to the new Veerashaiva-Lingayat Development Corporation. Some see the appointments as Yediyurappa’s attempt at one-upmanship against the party leadership for delaying his Cabinet expansion. “Such appointments are the CM’s discretion,” a source said. Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah wondered if Yediyurappa was on his way out going by the slew of appointments. “Maybe it is guaranteed that he is going,” he said. The BJP has denied Yediyurappa is being removed. Meanwhile, the appointment of M Rudresh -- said to be close to the CM -- as chairman of Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development Ltd has raised eyebrows. A house committee recommended a probe against him in the NICE corridor project.  Also, former Kundgol MLA Siddanagouda Ishwaragouda Chikkanagouda, the new chief of the Karnataka State Agricultural Produce Processing and Export Corporation, is Yediyurappa’s relative.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/posting-blitz-sets-off-cm-change-buzz-in-karnataka-919974.html

This is on the agenda for the Cabinet meeting scheduled to be held on Friday morning, according to sources. At present, Veerashaiva-Lingayats are considered backward class in Karnataka and come under Category 3B with a 5% reservation. Their inclusion as OBC in the Central list will mean 27% reservation in Central government services and Central educational institutions. Only some sub-castes of Veerashaiva-Lingayats come under the central OBC list at present. In fact, the All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha has been pressing for this. Bringing the community under the central OBC list will require a formal recommendation from the state government to the Centre. This move could have political ramifications, especially for Yediyurappa amid buzz that he could be replaced. Yediyurappa, a Lingayat himself, will look to further consolidate his standing within the community that is estimated to form about 16% of the state's population. Earlier this month, Yediyurappa ordered the establishment of the Veerashaiva-Lingayat Development Corporation and allocated Rs 500 crore for it. On Thursday, Yediyurappa huddled with Lingayat ministers apparently to discuss an issue pertaining to reservation for the community. After Friday's Cabinet meeting, Yediyurappa is slated to address a news conference where he is expected to make a major announcement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-cm-b-s-yediyurappas-master-plan-central-obc-status-for-veerashaiva-lingayats-920302.html

They said Chandole has been arrested late Wednesday under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and is expected to be produced before a local court for custody. He was questioned by the ED on Wednesday. The agency, they said, is probing Chandole's role and alleged suspect dealings with Sarnaik, Tops Grup security providing service and its promoter, Rahul Nanda, they said. Nanda, as per media reports, had denied any wrongdoing. Searches at ten premises of Sarnaik, Nanda and few others were launched by the ED on March 24 in neighbouring Thane and Mumbai.A particular instance of the company providing security guards to a Maharashtra government organisation during 2014-15 is also under the ED scanner, they said. The agency, sources claimed, has also seized a debit card, issued by a foreign bank in the name of Sarnaik, during the raids and its address is that of a Pakistani man based abroad. The MLA will soon be questioned in this context, they said. The Shiv Sena had earlier called the raids a "political vendetta" and said the Maharashtra government or its leaders will not surrender to pressure from anyone. "The searches are being conducted on the Tops group (a company in the business of providing security) promoters and related people, including some politicians," an official source had said. The ED case has been filed after studying a Mumbai Police economic offences wing FIR filed against the promoters of the business group on charges of alleged irregularities in the acquisition of some overseas assets in 2009 and the transactions of some trusts based abroad. ED officials had also questioned the MLA's elder son Vihang. Sarnaik, 56, represents the Oval-Maijwada constituency in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and is also a spokesperson for his party. The legislator was in the news when he wrote a letter seeking re-opening of an alleged abetment to a suicide case of 2018 in which Republic TV's editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami was arrested by the Mumbai Police recently. Goswami is now out on bail. "Sarnaik took a firm stand in connection with a channel and the Anvay Naik suicide case. Hence, such suppressive action...the entire Shiv Sena is with Sarnaik. The ED's action is a political matter," Raut said. Sarnaik had also demanded a unanimous resolution in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly for legal action against actress Kangana Ranaut, who, he said, has "maligned" the image of Maharashtra and Mumbai through her tweets. "This action (ED raids) is a political vendetta. The ED or other agencies should not work as a branch of a political party," Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut had told reporters. The Shiv Sena was earlier an ally of the BJP but snapped ties with it last year over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post and it is in power in the state along with the NCP and the Congress.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/ed-arrests-alleged-associate-of-shiv-sena-mla-in-money-laundering-case-920095.html

Speaking at the Maharashtra Police headquarters here after paying floral tributes to the martyrs, Thackeray said though the state is facing a financial crisis, his government will take every step to strengthen the police force. Earlier, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh and Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray also paid respects to the martyrs, who died fighting terrorists during the attack on November 26, 2008, at the newly-built memorial at the police headquarters in south Mumbai. Wives of some of the personnel killed in the 26/11 attack inaugurated the martyrs' gallery at the state police headquarters here. On the occasion, Thackeray released of coffee table book, titled 'True Grit' on the Maharashtra Police's work during COVID-19 pandemic. "We should make our force so strong that the idea of attack on Maharashtra and Mumbai does not come into the mind of terrorists, they should not dare to attack the state and Mumbai. If any terrorist comes forward, he should be killed on the spot," he said. "We woke up about strengthening the police force after the 26/11 terror attack. As we made necessary arrangements for health facilities after COVID-19 outbreak, we can also work to strengthen our police force," he said. Thackeray remembered the day of the attack in 2008 when he was on a tour of Dhule and Nashik for poll rallies. "After getting information about the attack, I had called police inspector Vijay Salaskar and he said he had just reached home and was again rushing to the spot," he recalled. "I then made two-three calls to him. When he picked up the call, Salaskar said he was in front of the Taj Mahal Hotel and that the police force will enter it after a survey," the chief minister said. Salaskar was later killed while fighting with the terrorists. "Later, I made various calls to Salakar, and till this day, he hasn't picked up the call," the CM said on an emotional note. "When I reached Nashik, I got the shocking news, which I could not have imagined," he said, adding that the scars of the deadly attack are "irreparable". People should be aware of what conditions police personnel are working in, what is the meaning of police, what is their life, he said, adding the concept of martyrs gallery should also be extended to other major cities of the state. On the occasion, state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the 26/11 terror attack was a "national crisis". "The black face of the neighboring country (Pakistan) came to light after the police caught one of the terrorists (Ajmal Kasab) alive," he added. At least 797 Maharashtra Police personnel have died in various operations, including Naxal attacks, terror attacks, communal riots, and other official duties from 1965 to 2020, according to the state police. The 12th anniversary of the deadly terror attack was attended by a limited number of people in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Family members of some of the martyred police personnel also paid tributes at the memorial. During the ceremony, the governor, chief minister and the home minister met family members of some martyrs. "Their sacrifice will never be erased from the memory of time and history. Today, we pay tribute to our saviours #2611Attack #2611Martyrs," Mumbai Police tweeted. Remembering their personnel killed in the attack, the Maharashtra Police in a tweet said, "A tribute to the ones who sacrificed their lives to safeguard the rest!" "Saluting the bravehearts whose sacrifice still ignites the spirits of millions #2611Attack #2611Martyrs #SalutingMartyrs," Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh tweeted. NCP chief Sharad Pawar also paid tributes to the policemen and other security personnel who laid their lives during the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, and called for a resolve to intensify the fight against terrorism. "Tributes to martyrs from the police and other security forces who laid their lives in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. As we condole with the families who lost their near ones in the attack, we should (also) resolve to intensify our fight against terrorism," the former Union minister tweeted. On November 26, 2008, 10 Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists from Pakistan arrived by sea route and opened fire, killing 166 people, including 18 security personnel, and injuring several others during the 60-hour siege in Mumbai. The then Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) chief Hemant Karkare, Army Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, Mumbai's Additional Police Commissioner Ashok Kamte, Senior Police Inspector Vijay Salaskar and Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Tukaram Omble were among those killed in the attack. The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, the Oberoi Trident, the Taj Mahal Hotel, Leopold Cafe, Cama Hospital and the Nariman House Jewish community centre, now renamed Nariman Light House, were some of the places targeted by terrorists. Nine terrorists were later killed by the security forces, including the NSG, the country's elite commando force. Ajmal Kasab was the only terrorist who was captured alive.

District Judge P P Jadhav of Thane Sessions Court granted bail on a personal bond of Rs 15,000 each, and a surety. Those granted bail include 8 who were arrested immediately after the incident, and the rest who were subsequently picked up. Defence lawyers Amrut Adhikari and Atul Patil, representing the accused farmers or tribals, argued in the that their clients were not involved in the lynching incident and had been arrested merely on grounds of suspicion. The Pune-headquartered State CID has filed three separate charge sheets in the case and so far, arrested a total of 238 accused including 11 minors. Of these, 77 adult accused including 9 minors have been granted bail, while another 135 accused are reported to be absconding. Special Public Prosecutor Satish Maneshinde represented the CID while advocate PN Ojha appeared on behalf of the families of the deceased sadhus. Two sadhus, Kalpavriksha Giri Maharaj (70 years), Sushil Giri Maharaj (35) and their driver Nilesh Telgade (30), were brutally lynched to death on the night of 16 April in the Gadchinchale village in Dahanu tehsil of Palghar district, nearly 120 km from downtown Mumbai. For four days before the incident, there were rumours that robbers had come to the village to steal kidneys, particularly of children, and sell them in the black market. This led to the villagers mounting a round-the-clock vigil. The sadhus and their driver were attacked by a group of nearly 500 villagers who suspected them to be kidnappers. The two Nashik-based sadhus belonged to the Varanasi-headquartered Shri Panch Dashnam Juna Akhara, the biggest order of sadhus in India. The case was handed over to the State-CID from the Palghar police after there was furore with the BJP attacking the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government demanding a CBI probe into the incident.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/court-grants-bail-to-54-accused-in-palghar-mob-lynching-case-920160.html

Although the sudden visit was not officially announced till Thursday late evening, a legion of police personnel has been deployed in and around the facility. Sources said that the prime minister is most likely to announce a "significant development" on the vaccine's progress. Zydus Cadila is developing its Covid-19 vaccine candidate "ZyCoV-D" at Vaccine Technology Centre, located at its Changodar park. Senior government officers said they "speculate" the visit to focus only on the vaccine. Sources said Modi will fly to Pune to review the status of Oxford University's vaccine AstraZeneca at Serum Institute of India after his Ahmedabad visit. "There is another possibility which is slightly remote that there may be talks of production of a vaccine developed by another firm indigenously whose human trial has just begun," said a source in the know of the development. Despite repeated attempts, Zydus Cadila chairman Pankaj R Patel didn't respond to calls for information. Officials said that Modi is expected to arrive at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel airport in the city at around 9 am and head for Changodar in a helicopter. The officials on Thursday evening decided to turn an open plot near Bhagyoday hotel into a helipad for the prime minister to land. "According to the tentative plan, he is expected to stay at the facility for an hour before heading back to the airport," said a top police officer. Meanwhile, the civil hospital in Sola enrolled five volunteers for its trial of "Covaxin" developed by Bharat Biotech for human trials. The hospital has received a consignment of 500 vaccines which will be tried on healthy youth to check its effectiveness. The hospital is targetting 1,000 volunteers for trial.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/covid-19-vaccine-pm-narendra-modi-to-visit-zydus-cadila-facility-in-ahmedabad-920217.html

The development came hours after a video of the dead bodies lying in the van was widely circulated. Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel, who is also the health minister, ordered Principal Secretary, Health, Jayanti Ravi and Health Commissioner Jayprakash Shivhare to probe the people responsible for meting out "inhuman treatment"  to the deceased. Officials said that the four patients, who were infected with coronavirus and had comorbid conditions, had died between November 24 and November 25. Because of the comorbid conditions, their deaths were recorded in the list of people dying due to the coronavirus infection. Gandhinagar Collector Kuldeep Arya confirmed this to DH and said that consent was taken from the relatives of the deceased but such treatment to the departed soul was disrespectful and was being looked into. Officials said that one of the incinerators of the crematorium at Sector 30 was not functional due to which there was a queue and it was then that "someone clicked the photo and circulated it."  One of the relatives of the deceased, Rajnikant Solanki, said in a video message, "My father was infected with coronavirus and died yesterday. He was taken in the van along with three other dead bodies. I was shocked and therefore couldn't react. But, I was surprised to see that not a single case of coronavirus was reported from Gandhinagar the next day."  Meanwhile, the state reported 1,560 new cases on Thursday, the highest single-day spike so far and 16 more deaths.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/probe-into-cramming-of-4-covid-19-infected-bodies-in-a-van-in-gujarats-gandhinagar-920279.html
