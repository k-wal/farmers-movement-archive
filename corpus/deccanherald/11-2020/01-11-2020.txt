The new system is unscientific and unsafe for motorists, argue residents of Thokkottu. Incidentally the same officials had decided to close the divider after many motorists were injured weeks ago while attempting to turn and take the road to Ullal. Local residents are once again worried with the opening of divider. Mangaluru Commissioner of Police Vikash Kumar Vikash, who had visited the spot after a young couple were killed in mishap, had said that there was a need to find a permanent solution to avoid accidents at the overbridge. Local organisations are planning to carry out a protest to urge authorities to close the divider at Kapikad. The road at Kapikad is also not motorable. If the divider is opened in front of Gatti Samaja Bhavana, at Ambika Road, a few meters away from Kapikad, then accidents can be prevented to some extent, the members of various organisations said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/knee-jerk-response-invites-danger-for-motorists-in-thokkottu-909786.html
01-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Keeping alive the art of making traditional Goodudeepas||With a few days left for Deepavali, the festival of lights, Nagaraj Upadhya Bailoor in Udupi district is busy making traditional ‘Goodudeepa’ or lanterns for his long list of customers. Nagaraj has been engaged in this traditional art work for the past 36 years and his ‘Ashtapatti’, ‘Mantapa Goodudeepa’, are a rage among his customers. Many customers opt for the readily available lanterns at the shops or even buy online, after being lured by their glitzy, colour, design. But the traditional eco-friendly variants are still in great demand, stresses Nagaraj. “I do not use any plastic material in the Goodudeepa that I make. I used to prepare with colourful papers. As the quality of papers are not good, this year I have used cotton cloth for preparing the traditional lanterns. Making good use of the lockdown period, I made around 60 Ashtapattis and Mantapa Goodudeepas,” the artist told DH. Customised Goodudeepas A self-taught artist, he began making customised Goodudeepas for customers when he was 17 years old. He was attracted towards the art of making Goodudeepas and began on his own workshop for preparing the traditional lanterns. Nagaraj Upadhya, when not decorating halls for wedding and other religious programmes, utilises the available time for preparing the lanterns. “Earlier, I used to make minimum 150 traditional lanterns during Deepavali. Due to my professional life, the numbers reduced. However, I am continuing the art as there are not many who prepare traditional Ashta Patti and Mantapa Goodudeepa these days,” he declares proudly. Upadhya has consciously decided not to use plastic for Goodudeepa. “Though many use thin plastic sheet for the borders of Goodudeepa, I use colour papers instead. It takes at least four hours to prepare one Ashtapatti Goodudeepa if the bamboo straws, cloth and colourful papers are available,” he explained. Customers from Bengaluru There is a good demand for the traditional lanterns. Many customers from Bengaluru come in search of traditional lanterns. “This year, I have even supplied small straws of bamboo required for preparing Goodudeepas for shops in Udupi, so that people can prepare their own lanterns at their houses. While collecting bamboos for decorations, I keep aside small pieces that are not used and use the same in the Goodudeepas,” he explains. Bamboo straws, glue, ropes, colour paper, cloth and patience is what goes into making these lanterns. “Most prefer Chinese or plastic lanterns that are glittery in their looks. Nevertheless, I have enough order for handmade lanterns that help me to keep the tradition alive. My children too have learnt the art and are engaged in making traditional lanterns during their free time,” he says with pride.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/keeping-alive-the-art-of-making-traditional-goodudeepas-909791.html

After a PIL filed in the High Court by the members of the Karnataka Ward Samithi Vedike, the court in its order dated August 8, 2019, had directed the authorities to notify Area Sabhas before the Ward Elections and form Ward Committees after the elections to the MCC Council. The 74th Constitutional amendment and amendment of Karnataka Municipal Corporation (KMC) Act in 2011 mandates formation of ward committees and area sabhas in all city corporations, to ensure citizens' participation. The MCC had adopted the agenda on formation of ward committees at its meeting held on August 13. Accordingly, the MCC has to form ward committees in each ward with the respective ward corporator as chairman. As a prelude to the formation of the ward committees, the MCC has invited applications for the ward committee members, MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar said. As according to government guidelines, each ward committee will have 10 members, including one member from the Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, three women, two representatives from civic groups and three from the general category. The MCC will accept applications from the public keen on being members in the ward committees of their respective wards.

01-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||No light in sight at the end of tunnel for weavers||The unprecedented rains and floods during monsoon in 2019 literally broke the backbone of the weavers in the district with their power-looms getting submerged, raw materials destroyed and workshop-cum-homes damaged. While they had begun to crawl to regain strength and sell some of their products by restoring their power-looms, the Covid-19 pandemic again pushed them to the wall. With lakhs of sarees in stock, the weavers are in a grim situation, with no light in sight at the end of the tunnel for the coming season too. “If the government purchases its requirements of different departments from us, instead of calling for open tenders, the weavers from across the State will benefit, and will also come out of debts. The industry will flourish providing more employment. This demand has been pending since long and pleas to provide orders to the weavers have fallen on deaf ears, weavers’ representatives say. Shahapuri sarees in demand The weavers of Shahapuri sarees, popularly called as Belagavi sarees, are spread in the suburbs of Vadgaon, Khasbag, and Old Belagavi in the City. Sulebhavi village in Belagavi taluk manufactures sarees, from cotton to silk, as per demand in the market. These weavers also manufacture sarees at Sureban, Kadakol, Halgatti, and other surrounding villages in Ramdurg taluk, Yamakanamaradi and Hattargi in Hukkeri taluk, Munavalli and Saundatti, Borgaon in Chikkodi taluk, and at Nej in Nippani taluk. The workshop-cum-homes of weavers results see the entire family toiling to earn their daily bread. Despite a slump in the business, the weavers had been somehow running the show. But, the unprecedented rains and floods dealt a severe blow. Power-looms, raw materials, and finished products worth lakhs of rupees were damaged due to the workshops-cum-houses collapsing during monsoon in 2019. 25,000 power looms damaged Around 25,000 power looms were damaged, and more than two lakh persons were directly affected due to rains and floods. The government initially announced a compensation of Rs 25,000 per power loom, and later changed it to per family, which dealt another blow, say the weavers. The weavers under the banner of Belagavi District Nekar Okkut led by MLA Abhay Patil held meetings with Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, and urged the government to come to their aid. “We had also met Education Minister S Suresh Kumar and requested him to direct the Education Department to procure cloth from us to revive our business, but the demand is yet to be met,” says weavers’ representative Gajanan Gunjeri. Floods during 2019, and Covid-19 pandemic this year destroyed the weavers’ lives. The outlook for the next year too looks bleak. The weavers are passing through a difficult phase, and the government needs to stand by them. Sarees in lakhs have been lying with them with no demand in the market, while debts have been mounting, he said. Of the 32,000 power looms in the district, around 25,000 are damaged. Each power loom has about four workers that includes the owners too. Over two lakh people depending on them have been hit, he noted. The weavers are not in a state to compete with big companies in the open tenders to supply the needs of the government. If open tenders are avoided, we can supply the same to the government at the same prices. This will help us regain our business, Gunjeri said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/no-light-in-sight-at-the-end-of-tunnel-for-weavers-909796.html

For the first time, BJP will win the election in Sira. “We have been seeking votes in the name of development works taken up by the PM Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre and the B S Yediyurappa-led government in Karnataka.

01-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||For Karnataka's parties, pastures ever green||Karnataka’s sheep and goats, the bleating animals involved in a political movement through their rearing Kuruba community, have 15 different government schemes exclusively for them and more are in the pipeline.  The state is home to 1.09 crore sheep and 6.14 lakh goats, according to provisional census figures.  The state government is now mulling a comprehensive policy under which the rearing of sheep and goats will be promoted as a financial activity under animal husbandry. Also, a laboratory is proposed to be set up for the genetic improvement (twinning) of indigenous sheep. These will add to existing sheep and goat schemes such as scientific training for sheep/goat farming, certification of pure breeds, incentives for cooperative societies formed by wool producers, training for mechanised wool cutting, and so on.  Also, keeping the November 3 Sira bypoll in mind, the BS Yediyurappa administration recently notified the creation of the Kadu Golla Development Board. This will cater to the Golla community that is also involved in sheep rearing.  The most popular of these schemes, in terms of the number of beneficiaries, is Anugraha under which Rs 5,000 compensation is provided by the government to owners of sheep or goats that die.  “Most people don’t even know there are so many schemes,” former cooperation minister Bandeappa Kashempur of the JD(S), who belongs to the Kuruba community, said. “Also, is there money for the schemes? There’s a Karnataka Sheep & Wool Development Corporation Ltd, an entity in name only,” he said.   According to Kashempur, the neighbouring Telangana provides subsidies worth Rs 13,000 crore for people living off sheep and goats. Telangana has 1.91 crore sheep and 49.48 lakh goats. “That’s the kind of attention they’ve given. But here, the government is ignoring this sector. It’s important because a person can eke out a livelihood with just two sheep or goats,” he said.  Notwithstanding, Kuruba leaders across political parties and seers have joined hands to up the ante on their demand to get the community included under the ST list. The movement dates back to 1935 and farther back, according to those involved. Apparently, when D Devaraj Urs was the CM, his government recommended extending the ST reservation status statewide for the Kuruba, Gonda, Kadu Kuruba, Jenu Kuruba, Kuruman (Kurumban) and Kattunayakan sub-sects. But, this did not come through. Of these sub-sects, the Kurubas are considered as ST only in the Kodagu district and as OBC elsewhere.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/for-karnatakas-parties-pastures-ever-green-909713.html

Somashekar was replying to Siddaramaiah’s statement that when he was chief minister he had sanctioned Rs 2,000 crore for the development of the segment. Somashekar said, Bengaluru generates huge revenue to the state government and the revenue will be distributed among all the assembly segments in Bengaluru and R R Nagar received its share, Somashekar said. Expressing confidence over BJP candidate Munirathna for RR Nagar bypolls, Somashekar said, he will win with a margin of 35 to 40 thousand votes. Munirathna had worked for the people during the Covid-19 lockdown when Congress party failed to respond to the people. Somashekar said, “Siddaramaiah did not nurture either me or Byrathi Basavaraj or Munirathna to grow politically. All of us were with Congress party before Siddaramaiah joined the party. We did not quit Congress due to Siddaramaiah but, due to humiliation from JD(S)-Congress coalition government,” he said.

01-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||Campaigning ends for for Karnataka bypolls||The high voltage campaigning for the November 3 bypolls to two assembly seats in Karnataka ended on Sunday. The run-up to the bypolls in R R Nagar in the city and Sira in Tumakuru district, which has a total of 31 candidates in the fray, saw the ruling BJP, opposition Congress and JD(S) hurl charges at each other. In R R Nagar, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa had promised to make BJP candidate Munirathna a minister "after he wins the polls," which drew a sharp reaction from Congress, with its state chief D K Shivakumar alleging that it was a violation of the model code of conduct. The Congress, which has fielded H Kusuma, wife of former IAS officer late D K Ravi in the seat traditionally held by the party, accused JD(S) of playing spoilsport. The JD(S) has fielded V Krishnamurthy. "We all know the Noora Kushti (friendly fight) going on between BJP and JD(S)," Congress MP D K Suresh said on October 31, a statement which drew flak from JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy. In Sira, the BJP, Congress and JD(S) have fielded radiologist Dr Rakesh Gowda, former minister T B Jayachandra and former (JD-S) MLA B Satyanarayana's wife Ammajamma respectively. Satyanarayana's death after prolonged illness in August warranted the Sira bypoll. The BJP has never won the election from there, but this time, the party would try to turn the tables on the Congress and the JD(S). Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa's son and BJP state vice president B Y Vijayendra led the election campaign here. During campaigning, the Chief Minister had said that the BJP had lost its deposit here but that the voters have made up their mind this time to give the saffron party a chance. If that were to happen, it will be another dent in the JD(S) citadel. BJP had already wrested the KR Pet assembly constituency in Mandya from JD(S), which was its stranglehold. A year ago during the Lok Sabha election, a BJP backed independent MP Sumalatha Ambareesh, a multilingual film actress, had won the election from Mandya defeating the JD(S) first family H D Deve Gowda's grandson and H D Kumaraswamy's son Nikhil Kumaraswamy. The JD(S) and the Congress have left no stone unturned to prevent the BJP from making any gains here. In the 225 seat assembly, including a nominated member, BJP has 116 MLAs minus the Speaker, Congress 67 and JD(S) 33, BSP 1 and two independents Four seats are vacant, of which elections to R R Nagar and Sira, will take place on November 3. Elections to Maski and Basava Kalyan, will be held later. While the election in Maski is caught in a legal tangle, the Basava Kalyan seat fell vacant due to the death of Congress MLA B Narayan Rao. The counting of votes for the bypolls will take place on November 10.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/campaigning-ends-for-for-karnataka-bypolls-910017.html

The National Medical Commission (NMC), since its constitution on September 25, 2020, has come out with a detailed list of requirements applicable for setting a new medical college, and to the established medical colleges proposing to increase their annual MBBS intake from the academic year 2021-22, the health ministry said.  The requirement for the number of beds in a medical college hospital has been reduced from 530 to 430 for a 100-seat college, and from 930 to 830 for a 200-seat college, according to the new regulations notified. The beds required in various departments of a teaching hospital have been rationalised to align with the annual student intake, teaching time to be spent in clinical specialties and the minimum clinical material required for undergraduate medical training which has resulted in about 10 per cent reduction in teaching bed needs compared to the earlier regulations.  The human resource of teaching faculty has also been rationalised under the new regulations. Over and above the minimum prescribed faculty, the provision for 'visiting faculty' has been made to enhance the quality of training, the ministry said. The medical college and its affiliating teaching hospital should provide for proportionate additional beds, infrastructure, faculty and other human resource in any specialty depending upon the needs and patient load.   The new standards have been defined keeping the functional requirements of the institution(s). These allow optimisation and flexibility in utilising available resources, and harnessing modern educational technology tools to facilitate moving towards quality education, even when resources are relatively scarce, the ministry said.  "In a significant step towards affordable medical education, the National Medical Commission (NMC) has notified its first major regulation. Titled as 'Minimum Requirements For Annual MBBS Admissions Regulations (2020)', the notification issued today replaces the Minimum Standard Requirements for Medical Colleges, 1999 (for 50/100/150/200/250 Annual Admissions) of the erstwhile Medical Council of India (MCI)," the ministry said. The new regulation has deleted the quantum of land required for setting up a medical college and its affiliated teaching hospitals, it said.  In tier 1 and tier 2 cities, hilly and north-east states and notified tribal areas, the campus could also be on two plots of land – one housing the teaching hospital and the other the medical college with hostels for students and interns, the notification stated. If the campus is housed in more than one plot of land, the distance between each one of these plots should be less than 10 kms or less than that of 30 minutes travelling time. "Provided that where the government district hospital is being considered for use as the teaching hospital of a medical college, all constituents of the district hospital, even if they are on two plots of land, will be considered as the affiliated teaching hospital, provided that the main district hospital has at least 300 beds or in Hilly and North-East states has 250 beds," it said.    According to the new regulations, every medical institution shall have a skills laboratory where students can practice and improve skills pre-specified in the curriculum.  The purpose of the skills laboratory is to provide a safe and non-threatening environment for students to learn, practice and be observed performing skills in a simulated environment thus mitigating the risks involved in direct patient exposure without adequate preparation and supervision.  The skills laboratory shall have a total area of at least 600 sq m for intake up to 150 MBBS students annually and 800 sq m for intakes of 200 and 250 MBBS students annually, and should have trainers or mannequins required to achieve skills outlined in the competency-based undergraduate curriculum document, the regulations added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nmc-notifies-new-norms-for-mbbs-admissions-setting-up-of-medical-colleges-deletes-5-acre-land-requirement-909731.html

"The Commission under Article 324 of the Constitution of India and all other powers enabling in this behalf, also bars Imarti Devi, from holding, anywhere in Madhya Pradesh, any public meetings, public processions, public rallies, roadshows and interviews, public utterances in media (electronic, print, social media) , in connection with ongoing elections for one day on 1 November," the EC order said. The EC had on Tuesday issued a notice to Imarti Devi for allegedly describing an unnamed political rival as "insane" and making remarks against women members of his family. She had denied the allegations in her response to the poll panel. The commission said it has carefully considered the matter and is of the considered view that Imarti Devi "has violated provisions... of general conduct of Model Code of Conduct for the guidance of political parties and candidates and disregard of the advisory issued by the commission." Taking note of former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and Congress leader Kamal Nath's "item" jibe against Imarti Devi, the commission had on Monday advised him against using such words during the period of the model code. On Friday, the EC had revoked the "star campaigner" status of Kamal Nath for Madhya Pradesh assembly bypolls for repeated violations of the model code.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/mp-bypolls-bjp-candidate-imarti-devi-barred-from-campaigning-for-one-day-909764.html

And, as he finally hung up the keys, tears welled up in many eyes at the Embassy of India in Beijing. Many of India’s diplomats – retired and serving alike – showered best wishes on him on Saturday, some at the embassy, others on Twitter. Yue retired after driving the cars of the Embassy of India in Beijing for 28 years. The diplomats and consular officials as well as the rest of the staff of the mission raised a toast for him on Saturday. Though the military stand-off between India and China took the relations between the two neighbours to a new low, it did not cast a shadow over the farewell ceremony. Yue came to the embassy with his family and was given a warm send-off by India’s ambassador to China, Vikram Misri, and his wife, Dolly Misri. Misri was in fact the sixth ambassador of India to China to be chauffeured by Yue, who earlier drove top diplomats like Nirupama Rao, Ashok Kantha, Vijay Gokhale and Gautam Bambawale. He also chauffeured S Jaishankar, who was New Delhi’s envoy to Beijing from June 2009 to December 2013 and now holds the external affairs portfolio in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet. “The farewell was an emotional one with many on the verge of tears. Thank you Yue for your long years of dedicated service. Wish you and your family the very best!” tweeted the Embassy of India in Beijing, along with pictures of the send-off ceremony. Rao, who was India’s ambassador to China from November 2006 to July 2009, fondly recalled Yue on Twitter. “A gentle and kind soul. I wish Yue the best in the years ahead. He deserves it in ample measure,” tweeted the ace diplomat, who was India’s Foreign Secretary from 2009 to 2011. “Yes, Lao Yue drove for the Indian Embassy in Beijing for many, many years. He was devoted to his duty through the ups and downs of India-China relations. Happy retired life to you Lao Yue!” Gautam Bambawale, who was India’s ambassador to China from November 2017 to December 2018, posted on Twitter. ‘ Vikram Doraiswami, India’s High Commissioner to China, also recalled Yeo, who was the longest serving among the Chinese employees of the Embassy of India in Beijing. “A gentle and kind friend for all of us @EOIBeijing. Indian diplomats for over 30 years will cherish memories of his ready smile and helpful nature,” tweeted Doraiswami, who was posted in Beijing for four years in the late 1990s. So did Sharmila Kantha, author and economist and wife of Ashok Kantha, who was New Delhi’s envoy to Beijing from 2014 to 2016. “Yue Shifu was my friend and guide in China, always sincere and smiling. All the best to him!” she posted on Twitter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-embassys-chinese-chauffeur-in-beijing-retires-after-28-years-of-service-909766.html

01-11-2020||National||DH Toon | Religious extremism not vaccine research takes front seat||French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday he respected Muslims who were shocked by cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad but that was no excuse for violence, as his officials ramped up security after a knife attack in a French church that killed three people this week. An assailant shouting "Allahu Akbar" (God is Greatest) beheaded a woman and killed two other people in a church in Nice on Thursday, in France's second deadly knife attack in two weeks with a suspected Islamist motive. The Nice attack, on the day Muslims celebrated the Prophet Mohammad's birthday, came amid growing Muslim anger across the world over France's defence of the right to publish cartoons depicting the Prophet. While ‘cash for votes’ is all too familiar in India, the BJP has introduced a new inducement -- ‘vaccine for votes’ -- in the Bihar elections in an obvious attempt to exploit the electorate’s fear over a pandemic that has cumulatively affected over 7.5 million people in the country and taken over 117,000 lives so far. Releasing the party’s poll manifesto, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the people of Bihar would be provided Covid-19 vaccination free of cost.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dh-toon-religious-extremism-not-vaccine-research-takes-front-seat-909773.html
01-11-2020||National||Secularism as principle and practice in India is in 'danger': Shashi Tharoor||Secularism as principle and practice in India is in "danger" and the ruling dispensation may even try to remove the word from the Constitution, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said, but asserted that "forces of hatred" cannot alter the country's secular character. Secularism is only a word and even if the government takes it out of the Constitution, it would still be a secular Constitution because of its basic structure, Tharoor told PTI in an interview on his new book The Battle of Belonging. He also asserted that the Congress party cannot risk trying to become 'BJP Lite' as it may end up making it 'Congress Zero' and said his party was not offering a watered-down version of the BJP's political messaging and the spirit of Indian secularism was very much "alive and well" in the grand old party. Asked about his party being accused of peddling in soft Hindutva, Tharoor said he does recognise that there's a very real and tangible concern for some liberal Indians over the issue, but asserted that "we in the Congress party are very clear that we cannot allow ourselves to become a BJP-lite". "I have long argued that any attempt to emulate 'Pepsi Lite' by 'BJP Lite' will end up with us becoming like 'Coke Zero' -- that is, 'Congress Zero'," the former Union minister said. "Congress is not BJP in any shape or form, and we should not attempt to be a lighter version of something we are not. Nor are we trying to, in my view," he said. Underlining that the Congress makes a distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva, Tharoor said the Hinduism that "we respect is inclusive and non-judgemental", whereas Hindutva is a political doctrine based on exclusion. "So we are not offering a watered-down version of the BJP's political messaging: Rahul Gandhi has made it explicitly clear that, for all his avowing his personal Hinduism by going to temples, he does not support any form of Hindutva, neither soft nor hard," the MP from Thiruvananthapuram said. Asked if the Congress needs to talk about secularism more often than it has been doing of late, Tharoor said he disagrees with the assertion that the Congress has not talked about secularism enough and the party on every opportunity has stressed its unshakeable commitment to secularism. On Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari's recent dig at Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray over secularism, the Congress leader said he did suggest that Koshyari should be given a different letterhead to express such ideas, rather than the official "Raj Bhavan notepaper". On whether the word 'secularism' in the Constitution was in imminent danger, he said, "The word is only a word; but even if the government takes the word 'secularism' out of the Constitution, it is still a secular Constitution." After all, freedom of worship, freedom to profess and propagate your religion, freedom of expression, minority rights, and equality of all citizens, are all part of the basic structure of the Constitution, and they can't disappear by deleting a word, he asserted. "The ruling dispensation may well try to do that: there is certainly a concerted effort to erode secularism and replace it with a sectarian way of being that offers no place to religious minorities in Indian society," Tharoor said. "Secularism as principle and practice is in danger, but I do not see it falling anytime soon: India embodies tolerance and pluralism in its very essence, and I do not believe that forces of hatred can permanently overcome our fundamental secularism," he said. However, Tharoor cautioned that people must not let their guards down and must continue to oppose such regressive ideas wherever they arise. In the book, Tharoor makes a stinging critique of the Hindutva doctrine, asserting that it is a political doctrine, not a religious one. He argues in the book that the Hindutva movement is the "mirror image" of the Muslim communalism of 1947 and its triumph would mark the end of the Indian idea. Talking about the controversy over a Tanishq advertisement which showed an inter-faith marriage and had to be withdrawn after social media backlash, Tharoor told PTI that it offered yet another illustration of how "reactionary and bigoted certain right-wing fringe elements" have become, even as the ruling dispensation was quick to distance itself from the episode. "But let us not forget that this is a Frankenstein's monster that they have created, sustained through organised and vicious social media trolls, and it's just one more reminder of the appalling power of the full-throated communal hatred that is so often unleashed in today's India," he said. "As I have said, if such people are so infuriated by Hindu-Muslim 'ekatvam', why not boycott the world's longest-surviving symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity: India itself?" he asked. On whether Hindutva had gained mass popularity, Tharoor said the BJP holds a commanding parliamentary majority, but it has worked overtime to suppress dissenting voices and in that sense, it is difficult to get an accurate gauge of support for Hindutva among ordinary Indians. Asked about Congress leader P Chidambaram's recent remarks calling for the restoration of Article 370 and its criticism by the BJP, Tharoor said he has articulated his stand clearly within Parliament. "It's not just an issue of abrogating 370 -- even (Jawaharlal) Nehru ji had said the provision was a temporary one. But the Constitution specifies how it is to be done," he said. "So though it shouldn't matter what side of the debate on Article 370 you stand on -- after all, differing voices are the lifeline of any democracy -- the manner in which it was implemented, the way our own fellow citizens were overnight clamped down upon by their own government, consciously and willfully disregarding the democratically enshrined rights guaranteed to all Indians, does not bode well for the future of the country," he said. No political objective can justify the huge-scale abuse of the rights of Indian citizens in this manner, Tharoor said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/secularism-as-principle-and-practice-in-india-is-in-danger-shashi-tharoor-909799.html

The company's vaccine candidate Covaxin has been developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV) using inactivated Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The virus was isolated in an ICMR lab. "If we get all the approvals after establishing strong experimental evidence and data, and efficacy and safety data in our last stage of trials, we aim to launch the vaccine in Q2 of 2021," Bharat Biotech International Executive Director Sai Prasad told PTI. After the company received approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to conduct Phase 3 clinical trial to establish the efficacy of the vaccine candidate, it has begun site preparatory exercises for Phase 3, recruitment and dosage will begin in November, he added.  "The trial to be conducted in 25 to 30 sites across 13-14 states will provide two doses each for the vaccine and placebo recipients. About 2,000 subjects could be enrolled per hospital," Prasad said. Asked about the investment on the vaccine, he said: "Our investment is about Rs 350-400 crore for the development of vaccine and the new manufacturing facilities, which include our investments for conducting the Phase 3 clinical trial, in the next six months". On the company's plan to sell the vaccine to the government or to private players, Prasad said: "We are looking to supply for both government and private markets. We are also in preliminary discussions with other countries for probable supply." Prasad said the price of the vaccine is yet to be determined, as the company is still looking at the cost of product development. "Our immediate focus is to conduct Phase 3 trial successfully across sites," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bharat-biotech-planning-to-launch-covid-19-vaccine-covaxin-in-second-quarter-of-2021-909820.html
01-11-2020||National||'Even Rs 150 not enough': India's poor cannot afford aloo, pyaz||Farm experts are of the view that rising prices of essential commodities coupled with wage deflation and increasing joblessness are pushing poor households to the point of distress despite the government's relief measures. Not only daily wagers and the economically poor section but middle-class families also are finding it hard to manage their kitchen budget with skyrocketing prices of these two commodities since the last few weeks, they said. Prices of potato and onion have shot up in both wholesale and retail markets of the national capital and other parts of the country because of tight supplies, the reason that the government attributes to damage to the crop due to heavy rains. In Delhi, retail onion prices spiked to Rs 80 per kg on October 21 from Rs 20 per kg in June while that of potato to over Rs 70 per kg from Rs 30 in the said period, according to trade data. In Mother Dairy's Safal outlets, potato was being sold at Rs 58-62 per kg in the last week while onion was hardly available in some outlets. "With my daily earning of Rs 150-200, I cannot think of buying aloo and pyaz. What will I feed my family of five members? Other vegetables are equally costlier. How do we survive?" Brij Mohan, a rickshaw-puller at Sadar Bazar, cried. Mohan, who hails from Bihar, returned to the national capital to restart his life after the Covid-19 lockdown was lifted. "But earnings are not that great as people are not very keen to take rickshaws these days due to the fear of infection. Somehow I am managing to meet the house expenses. The rise in prices of vegetables has added to my woes," he said. Sharing a similar ordeal, carpenter Mustakeen who hails from Uttar Pradesh, stated, "Though life has limped back to normalcy in markets my earnings are still low. On top of it, potato-onion prices are touching sky-high. What will I feed my children? Cannot buy even aloo and pyaz." Mustakeen, who works in Bhogal and Ashram areas of the city, said his hopes of earning extra during Diwali are all dashed to the ground as not many people are interested to get any big carpentry work in this pandemic. Experts, who do not want to be identified, said as long as the price inflationary pressure persists along with wage deflation and increased joblessness, the measures like free distribution of grains to ration cardholders will not fully solve the real problems of the common man. To give relief to the poor, the government has taken several steps. It is distributing additional foodgrains of 5 kg per person for free via ration shops under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana till November. The government has also launched new PM Street Vendors' Aatmanirbhar Nidhi (SVANidhi) microcredit programme and other steps to help the poor to tide over the crisis. However, Roma Devi, a housemaid working in Nizamuddin area, said: "No matter how much free grains I get from the ration shop, I have to buy at least potato and onion, else what sabzi my family of five will have with rice or roti?" "My daily aloo consumption is 1 kg. How will I manage now?" she said as she purchased a half kg potatoes at Rs 70 per kg from a nearby market. The irony is that India, which was exporting both potato and onion till a few months back, has started importing them now -- a situation which experts say the government could have easily avoided and not left the poor to bear the brunt of price rise at a time the pandemic hit them harder like never before. According to the official data, the country exported 8,05,259 tonnes of onion till June this year while 1,26,728 tonnes of potato till May. Last week, Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal had said about 7,000 tonnes of onion have already been imported by private traders and 25,000 tonnes more are expected to arrive before Diwali. Also, 30,000 tonnes of potatoes are being imported from Bhutan to boost domestic supply.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/even-rs-150-not-enough-indias-poor-cannot-afford-aloo-pyaz-909823.html

These will facilitate seaplane services on various routes including Lakshadweep, Andaman & Nicobar, Assam, Maharashtra, and Uttarakhand. "Development of 14 more water aerodromes is being planned pan India under RCS UDAN scheme. Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) had requested Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) to conduct a hydrographic survey and later on requested assistance in setting up jetties for facilitating the passenger movement," a Shipping Ministry official told PTI. Shipping Minister Mansukh Mandaviya last week told PTI that post the launch of seaplane service at Gujarat, regular services are being planned on various routes including in Guwahati, Andaman & Nicobar and Uttarakhand. "The potential locations include Tehri Dam in Uttarakhand, Guwahati riverfront and Umrangso reservoir in Assam, Khindsi Dam and Erai Dam in Maharashtra, Prakasam barrage in Andhra Pradesh, Minicoy and Kavaratti in Lakshadweep, Havelock, Neil, Long and Hutbay islands in Andaman & Nicobar and Dharoi and Shatrunjaya in Gujarat," according to a Shipping Ministry document. IWAI has set up concrete jetties for the seaplane project in Gujarat in record time, the official said and added IWAI has been entrusted for hydrographic survey, floating jetties and navigational buoys. Directorate General of Lighthouses and Lightships (DGLL) had used differential global positioning system (DGPS) technology, essentially a system to provide provisional corrections to GPS signals to mark the runway and shallow water in Gujarat for landing of the seaplane in daylight visibility while provision has already been made over installed buoys for fixing automated navigation lights for operation during nights in future, the document mentioned. For the seaplane service no-frills carrier SpiceJet has chartered a seaplane from the Maldives, the official said and added that more such seaplanes will be hired once services start at other places. These seaplanes will be Twin Otters. "From the Maldives to the Canadian North, the Twin Otter has proven itself as the largest-selling 14-passenger commuter airplane in the world for over 40 years. Its an un-pressurized, all-metal, high-wing, twin-turboprop aircraft and is certified in the Normal Category by the Canadian Department of Transportation," a Shipping Ministry document mentioned. Prime Minister Modi on October 31 inaugurated India's seaplane service by boarding the twin-engine plane from pond-3 close to Sardar Sarovar Dam after taking part in the Ekta Diwas celebrations at the Statue of Unity on the occasion of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's 145th birth anniversary. The plane carrying Modi had landed on the waters of Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad in around 40 minutes after covering a distance of around 200 km. Floating jetties and water aerodrome buildings were built at the riverfront and at pond-3 near Sardar Sarovar Dam to enable passengers to board and alight from the plane. The service will be operated by SpiceJet's fully-owned subsidiary, Spice Shuttle. Daily two flights will be operated on the Ahmedabad-Kevadiya route from Saturday, the company had said in a statement. The Gujarat government in July this year had cleared a proposal to enter into a tri-party agreement with Union Ministry of Civil Aviation and Airports Authority of India (AAI) for the construction of four water aerodromes under the regional connectivity scheme for seaplane service. A water aerodrome or seaplane base is an area of open water used by seaplanes, float-planes and amphibious aircraft for landing and taking off.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/government-eyes-setting-up-14-more-water-aerodromes-for-seaplane-services-909835.html

The trajectory of the active caseload across different states and UTs have been diverse demonstrating their focused efforts and gradual progress in their fight against Covid-19, the ministry said, noting Karnataka has reported a steep decline in the active cases in a span of 24 hours. "With the consistent decline in the active cases, the cases per million in India are among the lowest in the world. India's average cases per million stand at 5,930," it highlighted. Seventeen states and UTs have Covid-19 cases per million lower than the national average. "For the third day after the active cases dropped below the 6 lakh mark after nearly three months, the progressive decline has been maintained," the ministry underlined Presently, there are 5,70,458 active coronavirus infections in the country. The active cases have dropped to only 6.97 per cent of the total cases of the country demonstrating a steady falling percentage of the total cases, the ministry stated. This sustained achievement is the result of collaborative action by states and UTs under the Centre's strategy of comprehensive testing, timely tracking, quick hospitalization and adherence to the Standard Treatment Protocol which has ensured a standardised quality of medical care across the public and private hospitals and for the home isolation cases. There has been a steady decline in the number of daily deaths in India. A total 470 deaths have been reported in a span of 24 hours in the country. India's deaths per million population are one of the lowest in the world and stand at 88. Twenty-one states and UTs have deaths per million lower than the national average, the ministry said. "The declining trend of the percentage active cases is commensurately supported by the rising percentage of recovered cases. The total recovered cases have surged to 74,91,513 and exceed active cases of Covid-19 by 69,21,055. With an increasing number of recoveries, this gap is continuously widening. A higher number of recoveries has aided the national recovery rate to further improve to 91.54 per cent. A total of 58,684 people have recovered and were discharged in a span of 24 hours as against 46,963 infections reported during the same period. Seventy-six per cent of the new recovered cases are observed to be concentrated in 10 states and UTs. Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra have contributed the maximum to the new recovered cases with more than 7,000 single day recoveries. Delhi and West Bengal, both have added more than 4,000 to the new recoveries, the ministry said. A total of 46,963 new coronavirus infections were recorded in a span of 24 hours of which 77 per cent are from 10 states and UTs. Kerala is still reporting a very high number of new cases with more than 7,000 cases followed by Maharashtra and Delhi with more than 5,000 cases. As many as 470 case fatalities have been reported in a span of 24 hours. Of these, nearly 78 per cent are concentrated in ten states and UTs. More than 15 per cent of new fatalities reported are from Maharashtra (74 deaths).    India's Covid-19 caseload mounted to 81,84,082 with 46,963 new infections being reported in a day, while the death toll climbed to 1,22,111 with 470 new fatalities, the data updated at 8 am showed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-covid-19-cases-per-million-lowest-globally-909873.html

Use of four Ayurveda interventions-- Ayush kwatha, Sanshamanivati, Fifatrol tablets and Laxmivilasa rasa not only improved the condition of Covid-19 patient but also turned the rapid antigen test negative within six days of treatment, according to a case report published in the journal of AIIA -- 'Ayurved Case Report' in October. Presently, there is no specific cure for the disease that has infected over 44.7 million people and claimed 1.17 million lives world over. Citing the case of a 30-year-old male health worker infected with coronavirus, the report said his infection was managed with Samshamana therapy that included oral administration of Ayush kwatha, Sanshamani vati, Fifatrol tablets, and Laxmivilasa rasa. The patient after testing positive for Covid-19 was advised home quarantine. "The mentioned treatment plan was effective in the symptomatic relief (fever, dyspnea, anorexia, fatigue, anosmia, and dysgeusia) as well as in the resolution of viral load, as the patient tested negative in the RAD for Covid-19 within six days of intervention and RT-PCR test was also done on day 16, which was reported negative," the study said.    Herbal drug Fifatrol developed by AIMIL Pharmaceutical helps fight infection, flu and cold. It has immunity strengthening herbs like guduchi, sanjeevini ghanvati, daruharidra, apamarga, chirayata, karanja, kutaki, tulsi, godanti (bhasam), mrityunjaya rasa, tribhuvana kriti rasa and sanjivani vati. Ayush Kwatha is a combination of four medicinal herbs commonly used in every Indian kitchen - basil leaves (tulsi), cinnamon bark (dalchini), Zingiber officinale (sunthi), and krishna marich (Piper nigrum). Sanshamani Vati (also called guduchi ghana vati) is an ayurvedic herbal formulation used for all types of fevers. Laxmivilas Ras is a traditional herbomineral medicine that mainly contains Abhrak Bhasma and cures cough, cold and rhinitis. It soothes the throat and sinuses.  The report has been authored by Dr Sisir Kumar Mandal, Dr Meenakshi Sharma, Dr Charu Sharma, Dr Shalini Rai and Dr Anand More from the AIIA. "The present case study proved the efficacy of Ayurveda interventions in mild-to-moderate case of Covid-19 infection in a very short period with complete regression of symptoms," the report said. “The treatment was personalised, holistic, and purely based on Ayurvedic principles, and no conventional medicines were used. With this case study, it can be inferred that Ayurveda has vast potential to address Covid-19 and such other pandemics; a large sample-sized, multi-center randomized and controlled clinical studies are the need of the hour," the report said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ayurveda-drugs-can-be-effective-in-mild-to-moderate-cases-of-covid-19-aiia-909881.html

Habibullah, now a retired IAS officer who worked in Rajiv's PMO, writes that events that followed the Shah Bano judgement aroused suspicion amongst other communities and to appease the Hindus, the government decided to unlock the gates of Babri Masjid to the devotees of Lord Rama. This was done through a local court in Faizabad vacating a stay order that had retained status quo, he writes in the recently released 'My Years with Rajiv'. While in February 1986 the locks were opened, Habibullah got a chance to ask Rajiv directly about the decision and his role in it nine months later while they were flying to drought-hit Gujarat. Habibullah quoted several sources to say that unlocking of the gates would not have changed the status quo as the building continued to be a mosque while functionally it had been a Hindu temple. While Hindus were having access to the area, Muslim did not have access to the building. Against this backdrop, Habibullah asked Rajiv was it not realised that the benefit could “only be limited” to such a move, as with the Congress remaining secular, the development could not be exploited to its maximum, and the right-wing would hijack the outcome, which it could "trumpet as its triumph". It was then Rajiv told him that he "knew nothing of this development until I was told of it after the orders had been passed and executed". Rajiv told him that no government has any business to meddle in matters like determination of the functioning of places of worship. When Habibullah said, "but, sir, you were prime minister", Rajiv responded, "Of course I was. Yet I had not been informed of this action, and have asked Vir Bahadur Singh (under whose watch, and under whose instructions, it was rumoured, the magistrate had taken this fateful - or shall I call it fatal - decision) to explain. I suspect it was Arun (Nehru) and Fotedar (Makhan Lal) who were responsible, but I am having this verified. If it is true, I will have to consider action." In the coming month, Nehru, who was Rajiv’s cousin, was dropped from the Cabinet. On the government decision to bring a law to circumvent the Supreme Court judgement in the Shah Bano case, Habibullah writes that Akbar, a journalist who became a Congress MP and joined BJP to become a Minister in the Narendra Modi government, has played a role. He writes that it seemed initially Rajiv had agreed that the government would not get into Shah Bano judgement and would nudge the petitioners to go for review, which the government would not contest. During one of the days, Habibullah writes that he saw Akbar, then a journalist, in Rajiv's office and when he entered the room, the Prime Minister greeted him, "come in, come in, Wajahat, you are one of us", which he found "curious but was to discover the reason" for it soon enough. "Akbar had succeeded in convincing Rajiv that if the government were not to challenge the Shah Bano judgement, it would appear to the Muslim community that Rajiv was distancing himself from the defence of the religious rights of Muslims. He needed to demonstrably recognise the support that the community had always placed on his family," Habibullah writes. "This argument was developed by Akbar in a Doordarshan debate with then Congress minister, Arif Mohammad Khan—an MP from Azamgarh, UP, who had been asked by Rajiv to convince Muslims of the merits of the Supreme Court judgement in which Arif had argued that the Qur’anic provision, or lack of it, for maintenance was neither a compulsion nor closed to interpretation. But Akbar, more westernised than Arif, had argued that the Muslims needed a reassurance that could only be provided by an amendment to the law; one that ensured reversal of the judgement," Habibullah writes.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rajiv-gandhi-didnt-know-about-unlocking-of-babri-masjid-gates-in-1986-says-book-909910.html

In a tweet, Nath said the ruling BJP has brought down the age of retirement of Class-IV employees from 62 years to 60 years, prompting the BJP government to issue a clarification about it. "The decision by the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government to reduce the retirement age of Class IV employees from 62 years to 60 years again. This is deception with Class IV employees. This decision will create a crisis for them," Nath said in on the micro-blogging site. Chouhan replied to the Congress leader's tweet saying, "You are spreading rumours seeing the imminent defeat of Congress (in the by-elections). This disgusting work can only be done by you and your party." Chouhan said that the state governments order was only meant for the temporary class-fourth employees appointed in the minister's staff. "On the contrary, the state government has increased the age limit for such employees (appointed in minister's staff during their tenure) to 60-years, which was so far 40- years," he said. Later in the day, the state government's General Administration Department issued a clarification in this regard. It said that there is no change in the age limit for Class IV employees, except for those appointed temporarily in the minister's staff during their tenure. Nath later thanked the government for the clarification and said that Congress would continue to fight for the rights of the employees.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/madhya-pradesh-government-reduced-employees-retirement-age-says-kamal-nath-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan-calls-it-rumour-909926.html

01-11-2020||National||SC deprecates practice of delayed filing of cases||The Supreme Court has decided to impose a cost on government officers for being responsible for the delayed filing of a petition. The court said that it cannot be a place for the governments to walk in when they choose to ignore the period of limitation prescribed. The top court deprecated the practice of filing appeals beyond the period of limitation by the government authorities, saying its repeated advice had failed to have the desired impact and ironically no action was taken in any of the cases against the officers. "We are thus, constrained to send a signal and we propose to do in all matters today, where there are such inordinate delays that the government or state authorities coming before us must pay for wastage of judicial time which has its own value. Such costs can be recovered from the officers responsible," a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Dinesh Maheshwari said. The court imposed a cost of Rs 25,000 on the Madhya Pradesh government for filing a plea after 663 days of delay. It said contempt proceedings would be initiated against the chief secretary if the order was not complied with. The court noted the "preposterous" explanation given by the authorities that if there is some merit in the case, the period of limitation has to be given a go-by. In its judgement, the court highlighted the laxity and lethargy on the part of the government authorities in filing the cases on time. "We have raised the issue that if the government machinery is so inefficient and incapable of filing appeals or petitions in time, the solution may lie in requesting the Legislature to expand the time period for filing limitation for government authorities because of their gross incompetence. That is not so. Till the statute subsists, the appeals or petitions have to be filed as per the statutes prescribed," the bench said. The court said that there is a category of cases where the officers are keen to obtain a certificate of dismissal to save their skins. In such cases, "the object appears to be to obtain a certificate of dismissal from the Supreme Court to put a quietus to the issue and thus, say that nothing could be done because the highest court has dismissed the appeal. It is to complete this formality and save the skin of officers who may be at default that such a process is followed," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-deprecates-practice-of-delayed-filing-of-cases-909950.html

The BJP claimed that Bijoy Sil, a resident of Gayeshpur, was their member and killed by goons owing allegiance to the Trinamool Congress, a charge dismissed by the state's ruling party. "He had left the TMC before last year's Lok Sabha elections. He was murdered for switching over to the BJP. His role in increasing the BJP's influence in his ward in Gayeshpur Municipality was the reason for the killing," said Bijoy's nephew Bappa Sil, who is the vice-president of Gayeshpur town BJP Yuva Morcha. Gayeshpur Municipality chief and TMC leader Maran Kumar Dey refuted the allegation, saying Bijoy died by suicide. A senior police officer said that the body of Bijoy, who was missing since Saturday evening, has been sent for post-mortem. The body has a ligature mark, he said. The BJP has given a call for a 12-hour shutdown in Kalyani sub-division on Monday over the death. "Bijoy Sil, a member of BJP, has been cruelly murdered. The pattern remains the same. This time it is in Gayeshpur constituency, Nadia Kalyani. The law and order of West Bengal have totally gone awry," said Mukul Roy, the BJP's national vice-president. He also drew Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar's attention to the incident.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/man-dies-by-sucide-in-nadia-bjp-blames-tmc-909952.html

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Indu Malhotra, and Indira Banerjee said that in matters of matrimonial disputes such as the present, the welfare of the minor child is of paramount concern, which can be subserved if the mother is allowed to take the child to Singapore but the father is allowed adequate rights of access and visitation.  The court made adequate arrangements for regular meetings of the father and the child during holidays and video conferencing for one hour every on Saturday and Sunday and five to 10 minutes every day. "A balance has to be drawn so as to ensure that in a situation where the parents are in a conflict, the child has a sense of security. The interests of the child are best subserved by ensuring that both the parents have a presence in his upbringing," it said. The court passed its order under Article 142 of the Constitution to do complete justice, rejecting the father's plea that she had not challenged the order of not taking the boy outside the jurisdiction of Bengaluru's family court. "Allowing this case to be lost in a maze of technicalities involving a formal challenge to the order, will eventually lead to the child staying in Bengaluru with the maternal grandparents, while the mother is employed in Singapore," it said. The court also interacted with the child through video conferencing. While the child is attached to the father, he has indicated, in no uncertain terms, his desire to live with his mother, it said.  The court also noted the mother was gainfully employed in Singapore and her desire that she should be allowed to take the child with her is not an artifice. Further, the child has been with her since his birth, despite the demands of her employment, it said. It was also informed Singapore is Covid free and the child would be able to attend regular school and some on-line classes.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-allows-mother-to-take-child-to-singapore-from-bengaluru-909955.html

As per the Road Accidents Report-2019, the data compiled by the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, people belonging to the group of 18-60 years accounted for a share of 84.3% of the total road accident deaths. Of the 449,002 accidents in 2019, total 151,113 persons died and 451,361 were injured. Among the those who died, 1,04,739 persons were aged between 18 to 35 years. Total 1,27,350 persons who were aged between 18 to 60 years died last year. Men were the biggest accident victims with 1,29,319 dying last year against 21,794 women. More people died in road accidents in the rural areas than in the urban areas last year despite vehicle density being more in the cities. 67.1% people died of road accident in the rural areas, while in the urban are 32.9% people died. "Road accident victim largely constitutes young people in the productive age groups underscoring major implication on the economic cost of road accidents," says the report. Earlier Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said, "When translated into economic terms on road accidents,  estimates suggest that this has adversely affected our GDP by as much as 2-3% per annum." "Road accidents not only have an economic impact, but also serious implications for those involved in such crashes and their immediate families who suffer severe physical and psychological trauma as a result," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/youths-are-the-biggest-victims-of-road-accidents-in-india-909956.html

The senior Congress leader's remark calling BJP's Imarti Devi an "item" has triggered a controversy. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian would take up on November 2 the petition filed through advocate Varun K Chopra. In his plea, Kamal Nath asked the top court to quash the October 30 order by the EC and frame guidelines for speeches during campaigning by star campaigners keeping in mind fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression and concept of democratic elections. The Model Code of Conduct has been in enforced in 12 districts of Madhya Pradesh since September with the announcement of schedule for by-elections to 28 seats in the state Legislative Assembly on November 3. He maintained that Section 77(1) of the Representation of People Act, 1951 read with Guidelines for Star Campaigners issued by the EC from time to time makes the selection of revocation of ‘Star campaigners’ the sole prerogative of the political party. However, he claimed, the poll panel passed "completely unreasoned" order against him without any notice and application of mind. This was also violative of principles of natural justice and fair play, he said. "For a vibrant democracy and for the conduct of free and fair elections, it is necessary that voters, candidates, campaigners and workers are not unduly restrained from exercising their freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)a of the Constitution," he said. Giving out instances of the use of objectionable remarks against him by the BJP leaders, Kamal Nath claimed the EC has taken no equivalent actions against them despite the fact that those were in gross violation of the Model Code of Conduct. With regard to his remark against the woman BJP leader, he said he had already issued a clarification and expressed regret. The president of Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee further maintained that there was no malice or intent to disrespect on his part.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-to-hear-on-monday-kamal-naths-plea-against-ecs-order-to-revoke-status-of-star-campaigner-in-mp-bypolls-909971.html

The BCI, the regulator of law education in the country, on Sunday also clarified that the students who appear but are unable to clear the exam will also get a chance to reappear in the fresh exams. The exams will have to be held with a No Objection Certificate (NOC) of the state government and State Disaster Management Authority, it said. "It is observed by the Council (General Council of the BCI) that if physical exams as contemplated by the University is held with effect from November 2 and if the said exams are held without any penal consequences to any student who is unable to appear in the said exam, no student shall be prejudiced or affected and they will get an opportunity to appear in the exam again after physical reopening of the college/university," the BCI said in a press release. It provided an option "to Universities/Centres of Legal Education to conduct physical examination with the NOC of the state government and State Disaster Management Authority, by giving the option to such law students who are unable and/or unwilling to appear in such physical exams till the COVID-19 pandemic is averted, and having appeared therein, who are/is unable to clear such exam, to appear in the re-appear exam after physical reopening of the University/Centres of Legal Education". Considering that the pandemic still persists with no early respite from it in sight, the Council resolved that examination for all intermediary along with final year law students and classes too may be held online, if the universities and law colleges are able to hold it online, and if adequate infrastructure and other facilities for students are available. "It is further resolved that if online exam is so conducted and any student is unable to take it, or having appeared therein, is unable to pass such exam/subject paper, such student shall be entitled to take the reappear exam/paper whenever it is held preferably within one month of physical re-opening of the universities and college after the pandemic is averted," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bci-allows-law-universities-to-conduct-physical-examination-910030.html

An analysis of such data at the previous two milestones of the epidemic’s progression reveals its silent spread over the last one and half months. On September 27 when India reached the 60 lakh mark, the top 50 districts accounted for 63.6% deaths and 51.7% of cases. The figures changed to 61.5% and 51% respectively on October 10 when the number of Covid-19 cases crossed 70 lakh. The changes indicate the epidemic’s spread outside the top 50 districts that include Bangalore Urban and Bellary. “The share of total cases and deaths accounted for by the top 50 districts has decreased now. It has been on a steady decline indicating a wider spread of the coronavirus. The strategy should now be to shift the testing more to other districts where the disease is beginning to spread,” John told DH. While the Union Health Ministry’s data shows 35% of active Covid-19 cases are reported from only 18 districts, there are a fairly large number of districts, each harbouring a tiny percentage of total active cases that account for the bulk of India's active Covid-19 cases. "Implementation of sound public health practices is needed to break the chain of transmission in districts that have started witnessing an increase in the caseload. When the cases are concentrated in a particular area, the transmission is likely to be high, so everyone is at risk. The aim should be to bring down that risk," commented Oommen John, a public health researcher at the George Institute for Global Health, Delhi. “If there is a test positive, by tracing the immediate contacts, checking their status and keeping them safe will break the chain” With 46,963 new cases, India’s Covid-19 tally inched closer to the 82 lakh mark, out of which 5.7 lakh are active cases. The death toll stands at 1,22,111 out of which 470 were added in the last 24 hours.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-half-of-the-positive-cases-60-deaths-are-in-50-districts-but-pandemic-spreads-silently-to-the-hinterland-910037.html

The committee was earlier planning to visit Ladakh on October 28-29 and had later put off the visit to November 7. The decision to shelve the plans was taken by Chowdhury after consultation with members as the Ministry of Defence advised the committee against the visit citing the stand-off with China, the ongoing efforts to defuse the tensions through talks at military and diplomatic levels and the sub-zero temperatures prevailing in the region. Members of the parliamentary panel were keen to visit Leh to know the ground realities of the infrastructure and the clothing provided to armed forces posted at high-altitudes. Parliamentary sources said some members in the panel were not in favour of the move to visit frontal areas at Leh due to the tough weather conditions and the visit would add additional pressure on the fully engaged forces there. Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat had agreed to receive members of the PAC at Ladakh during a meeting on October 7 following which the visit was tentatively planned for October 28 and 29. However, after requests from a section of the members, the visit was put-off for November 7. In the meanwhile, the PAC chairman received a communication from the defence ministry, advising against the visit, on account of the prevailing situation where troops from both the sides are in “close proximity” in the high-altitude region.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/parliament-panel-shelves-ladakh-visit-due-to-weather-conditions-910043.html

Addressing the Chhattisgarh Foundation Day function through videolink, the former Congress president said that he has been reading reports of farmers’ suicides almost on a daily basis. “But we should not accept it. We should protect farmers, labourers and small businessmen and stand with them,” Rahul said. He lauded the Chhattisgarh government for passing legislation to negate the impact of the new farm laws enacted by the Modi government. Rahul said that he was pained to see farmers in distress due to the three farm sector laws passed by the Modi government. “Farmers and labourers are the foundation of the country. Villages are the foundation of cities while farmers and labourers are the foundation of villages,” Rahul said. He said that there could be some shortcomings in the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMC), but destroying them was not a solution. “If we destroy the entire system, like it was done in Bihar in 2006, then the country’s foundation will be destroyed, which is why we have been fighting against the three new central farm laws,” Rahul said. Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel released the third instalment of cash benefit under the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojna to 18.38 lakh farmers in the state. Baghel also launched the Swami Atmanand Government English Medium School scheme, aimed at providing education in the English language to students across the state. The Chief Minister also dedicated mobile hospital-cum-laboratories in 30 urban slum areas under the Chief Minister Urban Slum Health Scheme. Rahul said that English medium schools would open up a whole new world of opportunities for youth. “Hindi and our local languages have their own place. But English language gives global opportunities,” the former Congress president said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/new-farm-laws-will-weaken-nations-foundation-rahul-gandhi-909869.html

The BSP, which is contesting on 80 seats in Bihar, has entered into an alliance with the Rashtriya Lok Samaj Party.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/mayawati-asks-voters-to-send-message-to-rivals-cast-ballot-in-favour-of-bsp-in-bypolls-909870.html
01-11-2020||National Politics||Nitish Kumar will quit NDA after assembly polls, try to challenge PM Modi in 2024: Chirag Paswan||Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar may ditch the BJP after the assembly poll results are out, join the RJD-led Grand Alliance and make yet another attempt at posing a challenge to the NDA in the 2024 general elections, Lok Janshakti Party president Chirag Paswan claimed on Sunday. Paswan, who has chosen to plough a lonely furrow in the ongoing assembly elections, reiterated that the LJP was and will remain loyal towards the BJP, which was staring at the spectre of yet another "paltimaar" (volte face) by the JD(U) president. "Nitish Kumar has earned the epithet 'palturam' (turncoat) by virtue of his frequent acts of paltimaar. He came to power in Bihar after a long political battle with RJD chief Lalu Prasad. A few years later, he snapped ties with the BJP, an old ally and ended up forging an alliance with his arch-rival," he told a news channel. Paswan, whose late father and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan, joined the NDA ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, recalled "criticisms heaped on (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi" by Kumar, who had been opposed to his then Gujarat counterpart.  "Fancying himself as a potential challenger to the prime minister nationally, Kumar, with Lalu Prasad by his side, spewed so much venom against Modi in the assembly polls held just five years ago. It took him just two years to dump Lalu and return to the NDA," he said with a hint of sarcasm. "Mark my words, he has been very caustic against Lalu Prasad during his election campaign, but given his disposition, he may once again cross over, try to form the next government with the Grand Alliance, and even try to project himself as an alternative to Modi in 2024," Paswan, who is the MP from Jamui, said. Earlier, the LJP chief addressed a press conference where he repeated the allegations of corruption in 'saat nishchay' (seven resolves) which included, among other things, schemes for bringing piped water to every household and fortifying alleys and ditches with concrete. "Corruption in these schemes ought to be thoroughly probed and we must not be surprised if the complicity of the chief minister himself comes to the fore," he added. The LJP has fielded its candidates in over 140 seats of the 243-strong assembly, mostly against those fighting on a JD(U) ticket. Paswan's party has shied away from taking on the BJP in most of the 110 seats being contested by the saffron party. It has also made an exception in the JD(U)'s case at Hassanpur, where interestingly, it is being felt that the LJP wants to help Tej Pratap Yadav, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad's elder son, who is pitted against the sitting MLA belonging to the chief minister's party.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/nitish-kumar-will-quit-nda-after-assembly-polls-try-to-challenge-pm-modi-in-2024-chirag-paswan-909891.html
01-11-2020||National Politics||NDA hopes to ride reach of welfare packages, PM Narendra Modi's appeal to score over Opposition||The smooth highway coursing through Muzaffarpur into Mithilanchal is not only a gateway to a distinct cultural landscape but also a region of changed political narrative as the ruling BJP-JD(U) combine seeks to draw support from the poorest sections of society on the back of a number of welfare schemes to take on a resurgent RJD-led alliance. The Mithila region was hit hard by floods, and a large section of the extremely backward communities (EBCs), whose numbers are higher than the state average in many seats here, and scheduled castes has benefited from the relief package, including cash transfer of Rs 6000, of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led state government. And above all, it is the 'Brand Modi' that shines brightest in one village after another as people praise the prime minister for free ration, from April to November, and money transfer to the poor following the coronavirus pandemic outbreak and consequent lockdown. "Jiska khayengein, usika gayengein, (Will sing the tune of the one who feeds us) " Shrawan Das, a Kahar which belongs to the EBC, says in Darbhanga town while a number of other such voters in Berua village in Gaighat constituency in Muzaffarpur reel out central government schemes that have led them to affirm their support to the ruling alliance. "The government gave us money, food and cooking gas cylinder. What else does one want," one of them says. While there are mixed views about Nitish Kumar as people acknowledge his work and also express disappointment with his latest term at the same time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains a reason for their solid support to the ruling alliance.     Assembly elections have often seen local issues and leadership take precedence in the mind of voters over national factors, including Modi's leadership, but things are a tad different in this part of Bihar as the polls come against the backdrop of the coronavirus crisis, with people benefitting from welfare measures. Rajendra Ram, a Dalit of Simri panchayat, expresses his anguish at not getting any cash transfer benefit like many other villagers but blames local government handlers for his pain. "Modi treats everyone as equal. But our society and villagers discriminate against us. I will not blame Modi for this," he says, affirming his support to the NDA. There are, however, voices of discontent in this north-central Bihar region with the state government and Kumar. The chief minister, feted for long as a model of 'sushasan' (good governance), is now a source of conflictive narratives in which is he is at once a leader who has delivered a lot and is also someone who has grown disconnected with people and did not offer much in this term. "How can I say he has not worked. But he confined himself to his residence during the coronavirus crisis while we suffered. He resisted migrants' return to home," Asha Devi, a resident of dalit colony of Sikandarpur in Muzaffarpur, says. Kumar's prohibition policy draws more criticism from men and women, as they complain that it has only pushed the liquor trade underground. "Afsarshahi" (bureaucratic highhandedness) is the common refrain in the criticism of the state government, especially from people linked to private enterprise, from transporters to owners of restaurants and small tea stalls. In Keoti, RJD's senior leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui expresses confidence of prevailing upon his BJP rival Murari Mohan Jha due to "discontent" with the state government, but Sanjay Kumar, a local campaign manager of the saffron party, says the opposition grand alliance will be defeated across the region.  The rainbow caste coalition that propelled the National Democratic Alliance to win in 39 of 40 Lok Sabha seats in the state in the 2019 general election, may have eroded a little, but is still effective on the ground, its members say. One factor that is, however, seemingly working against the JD(U) in a number of seats is the presence of Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party candidates. LJP candidate Komal Singh, daughter of party MP Veena Devi, is drawing visible support from a section of upper castes in Gaighat, and so is Vijay Prasad Singh in Kanti. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav's barnstorming across the state with more than twice and even thrice the number of daily public meetings held by Kumar has rallied the party's traditional support base around the 'mahagathbandhan' (grand alliance), and its leaders hope to sway a big section of EBC and Dalit voters to their side to defeat the NDA. The RJD-led alliance has also reached out to other communities by giving representation to them in their list, with 33 of 70 Congress nominees belonging to the upper castes. With the RJD often tagged as a party of Yadavs and Muslims (MY), Yadav has asserted time and again it is now a party of A to Z. Polling was held in 71 out of 243 Assembly seats on October 28 in the first phase. As the state heads to the second and third phase of polls on October 3 and 7, it is these most disadvantaged sections of society who hold the key to power. For over 15 long years, a majority of them backed Kumar and then the BJP as Modi led his alliance to strong showings in Lok Sabha polls in 2014 and 2019. Whether the old loyalties hold firm or break down will decide the fate of the NDA.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/nda-hopes-to-ride-reach-of-welfare-packages-pm-narendra-modis-appeal-to-score-over-opposition-909900.html
01-11-2020||National Politics||RSS for ‘swadeshi’ with Indian features||In the 95 years of its existence, not once has the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) Sarsanghchalak’s annual Vijayadashami speech ever been missed. This year was no exception despite the pandemic and a small gathering of attendees. The day is doubly important for the RSS – the organisation was started on Vijayadashami Day in 1925. The RSS has been clear in its approach through the years. An assertive Hindu society fully aware of its rights will be able to elect a pro-Hindu government and also keep that political dispensation in check within the parameters of the Constitution.  It would not be wrong to say that this seems to be happening. Therefore, a large portion of RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat’s speech focused on how the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government has fared on many of the Sangh’s ideas for a united Hindu society as well as key issues it has identified itself with. But those thinking that with Ram Mandir and Article 370 done, it is curtains for the RSS, a close reading of Bhagwat’s Vijayadashami speech is in order. The RSS is here to stay. Bhagwat’s speech had much in terms of guiding the government on matters that are likely to take up significant time and energy in the coming months – managing the economic fallout of the pandemic, and connected to it, the anti-China coalition that is emerging, albeit very slowly.  This year’s speech dwells on national sovereignty as well as push for ‘swadeshi’ with Indian characteristics, thus flagging off a qualified backing for foreign investment, something that should be music to the Modi government’s ears. It need not face the predicament that the AB Vajpayee government faced. In fact the Sarsanghachalak’s statement, “…the idea of safeguarding life and exercising international cooperation by promoting unique strengths and assets of each country is an idea that has started to take shape in the global mind. The philosophy of ‘swadeshi’ has trumped once again. It is time to redefine these adages in view of the current Bhartiya context and to rebuild paths that will lead us back to our time-tested values and traditions,” is likely to remain relevant for a long time. An important part of Bhagwat’s speech was his exposition on the meaning of Hindutva. When the Sangh says that ‘Hindustan is Hindu Rashtra’ it does not have any political, theological or state-centered concept in mind.  The RSS has taken pains to clarify that the idea of ‘Hindu Rashtra’ is in no way akin to a theocratic state as the term Hindu (or Hindutva, Hinduness or Hinduism) is not a sectarian, class or denominational concept. “Hindutva is the essence of this Rashtra’s ‘Swa’ (self-hood). We are plainly acknowledging the selfhood of the country as Hindu because all our socio-cultural practices are directed by its principles with their spirit percolating in the personal, familial, professional and social life of each one of us,” Bhagwat explained in his speech. In this context his suggestions to the government on two aspects is interesting. As mentioned, the RSS would like the government to focus on economic restructuring with emphasis on ‘swadeshi’ but with Indian characteristics. What does this mean? Unlike its frontal organisations the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) and the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM), the RSS seems to be clear about the need for foreign investments and engaging with the world strictly on ‘our terms’. It is for the government to set the rules of engagement.  Invoking veteran Gandhian Vinoba Bhave and founder of the SJM Dattopant Thengadi, the Sarsanghchalak laid new ground rules which identify a combination of self-reliance and non-violence as swadeshi. By quoting Thengadi as having claimed that Swadeshi cuts beyond goods and services and stands for attaining a position of international cooperation by achieving national self-reliance, sovereignty and parity, the RSS has cleared the path for the government to freely work on foreign investments-related policies. Bhagwat said: “So to achieve financial independence in the future and attain a position of international cooperation we are open to foreign investors and give relaxations to companies offering newer technologies, provided they engage on our terms and mutually agreeable conditions.” What he probably indicated was that in the birth centenary year of D B Thengadi, the government better dust off his book The Third Way and do its homework. In fact, in a departure from standard parameters of such speeches, Bhagwat raised issues such as the woes of the migrant labourers, skill development and the psychological effects of the pandemic such as lockdown and unemployment, especially of the unskilled and rural population. Other than his appeal to work for prevention of crime, depression and suicide through counselling and support services, Bhagwat’s suggestions to create employment opportunities and skill training could very well be part of Modi government’s future economic programmes reflected in the Budget. This is not the first time that the RSS is giving its opinion on the prevailing economic situation and its suggestions at the macro level. In his 2018 Vijayadashami address, Bhagwat had spoken of “establish(ing) our own model of development” in the light of the provisions of the Constitution. “Even after adopting the noble principles from the world, it is absolutely essential for the progress of the nation that we devise our own distinct model of development and corresponding framework based on our philosophical foundation,” he had said. At a time when the democratic countries of the world are talking about forging a ‘free and open rule-based new world order’ as against China’s hegemonic ambitions, as one of the largest democracies, India has a much bigger role to play in the coming years. The contours of the emerging world order and India’s role will depend on the Modi government’s action plans. But as of now the RSS-BJP coordination is at its best with the Modi government ticking off the items on the RSS wish list.  (Seshadri Chari is a member of the BJP National Executive and was formerly Editor of the RSS publication, Organiser)||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rss-for-swadeshi-with-indian-features-909954.html

In a statement here, he expressed solidarity with victims of the riots and said his party will continue to stand with them and fight to ensure that the Congress leaders responsible for the killings are brought to the book. Badal said even though witnesses had stepped forward to testify against Jagdish Tytler and Kamal Nath, they were successful in delaying their prosecution, which was unfortunate. He said despite the formation of successive commissions and even an SIT, the process to make the perpetrators of the genocide accountable for their sins against humanity was proceeding at a slow pace. “I urge the Home Ministry to intervene and speed up this process to ensure justice is served to the victims,” Badal added. He also took on the Aam Aadmi Party's Delhi government, alleging that it was hand in glove with the Congress and always tried to “weaken” the prosecution proceedings against its leaders accused of being involved in the genocide. He said Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was trying to befool the Sikh community with claims of being sympathetic to the cause of the victim families. “The truth is that Kejriwal is refusing to give government jobs to the next of kin of massacre victims despite the fact that a decision to this effect was taken by the Delhi cabinet earlier. Kejriwal is refusing to implement this decision even though the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) took up this issue in the High Court which asked the Delhi government to look into the matter. Kejriwal has always adopted double standards on this issue and is known to speak one thing in Delhi and another in Punjab,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/1984-riots-delay-in-prosecution-of-tytler-kamal-nath-unfortunate-says-badal-909958.html

In a statement here, the BJP president said Punjab farmers were being calculatedly misinformed and misled by the chief minister only to gain political mileage and to cover up his incompetence. Sharma said goods and passenger trains are not coming to Punjab because the chief minister has miserably failed to maintain law and order. "On the one hand, he is instigating farmers to intensify their agitation, on the other, he is blaming the Centre for not allowing trains in the state. It reflects the chief minister's blatant hypocrisy and petty political gameplan,” said the state BJP president. If any losses are happening to the state due to inoperative goods trains, it is the chief minister who is solely responsible for it, he said. Lashing out at the Punjab government for allegedly failing to remove the railway blockades, he said it is preposterous the way Punjab chief minister is shifting the blame to the Centre. Sharma said the BJP had never equated farmers with Naxals. "Farmers are the lifeline of the country and the legislation brought out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi are meant to empower farmers to an extent that their income is doubled," he said. The BJP, he said, had been soliciting cooperation from the chief minister to educate farmers in the right perspective and to keep the law and order situation under control. "But the chief minister is eyeing petty political gains and is indulging in misleading hyperbole,” said the BJP president.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-instigating-farmers-to-agitate-over-agri-laws-state-bjp-president-ashwani-sharma-909961.html
01-11-2020||National Politics||Pakistan announces provincial status for Gilgit-Baltistan, India protests||After Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday formally announced the elevation of ‘Gilgit-Baltistan’ as the fifth province of his country, New Delhi underlined that Islamabad had no locus standi on the region as it is an integral part of India. New Delhi reiterated that the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and Ladakh, including the area of so-called ‘Gilgit-Baltistan’, were an integral part of India. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) also stressed that accession of the erstwhile princely state of J&K to India in 1947 was “legal, complete and irrevocable”. “The Government of Pakistan has no locus standi on territories illegally and forcibly occupied by it,” Anurag Srivastava, the spokesperson of the MEA, stated in New Delhi. Khan on Sunday announced his government’s decision to elevate Gilgit-Baltistan as a full-fledged province of Pakistan. “The Government of India firmly rejects the attempt by Pakistan to bring material changes to a part of Indian territory, under its illegal and forcible occupation,” the MEA spokesperson stated in New Delhi. The MEA earlier also conveyed its strong protest to Islamabad over the Khan Government’s move to hold polls on November 15 next to elect the third legislative assembly of Gilgit Baltistan, which India claims to be its own and accuses Pakistan of illegally occupying. The Pakistan Government held polls in Gilgit-Baltistan in 2009 and 2015 – electing a legislative assembly, despite protests from New Delhi. It is now preparing to hold the third assembly elections in the region on November 15. The Khan Government recently initiated the move to elevate the status of Gilgit-Baltistan to a fully-fledged province of Pakistan with all constitutional rights, including representation in the upper and lower houses of parliament of the country. New Delhi suspects that Islamabad’s all-weather ally Beijing may have nudged the Khan Government to turn Gilgit-Baltistan into a province of Pakistan. With several projects of the controversial China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) located in Gilgit-Baltistan, Beijing wants Islamabad to end the ambiguity about the status of the region. Islamabad’s move on Gilgit-Baltistan appears to be an attempt to respond to New Delhi’s August 5, 2019 decision to strip Jammu and Kashmir of its special status and reorganize the erstwhile state into two Union Territories. New Delhi earlier rejected the recent actions by the Pakistan Government on Gilgit-Baltistan, including the so-called “Gilgit-Baltistan (Elections and Caretaker Government) Amendment Order 2020”. It also opposed continued attempts by Islamabad to bring “material changes in areas under illegal and forcible occupation” of Pakistan. “Such attempts by Pakistan, intended to camouflage its illegal occupation, cannot hide the grave human rights violations, exploitation and denial of freedom for over seven decades to the people residing in these Pakistan occupied territories,” said the MEA spokesperson. “Instead of seeking to alter the status of these Indian territories, we call upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/pakistan-announces-provincial-status-for-gilgit-baltistan-india-protests-909983.html
01-11-2020||National Politics||Congress slams govt over rise in price of essential commodities||The Congress on Sunday attacked the government over the rise in prices of essential commodities, asking it to act sternly against black marketeers and push sufficient stocks of food in the market to check rising prices. Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh accused the government of being ignorant and alleged it was allowing stocks to rot and the people to suffer. He said the festive season is here but it is not only Covid-19 that is denting the spirits of the common man as the prices of food items are spiralling. He claimed that with almost no fiscal stimulus, the economy is struggling to get back on track, but "the government is ignorant and blatantly incompetent in controlling inflation". Vallabh said while the government should be exploring avenues to provide support to the people and boost consumption, it is on a lookout to "extract as much from the common man and leave them helpless". "We demand that the government immediately act on black marketeers, assess the stock of essential items lying in cold storages and push sufficient stock in the markets to control the prices," he told reporters. The Congress leader cited the high prices of onions and potato, saying it is highest in 10 years. He said the consumer food price inflation has been consistently high for the last few months, both in the urban and rural areas. The overall CFPI (Consumer Food Price Index) was over 9 per cent for July 2020 and August 2020, but it breached the 10 per cent-mark in September 2020, he said, adding that the inflation rate for vegetables in September 2020 was 22.71 per cent and for pulses and products it was 13.69 per cent. "What was the government doing to control all of this? By the looks of it, nothing. The government's incompetence and inaction is evident from the fact that while we exported 1.23 lakh tonnes of potatoes to nations like Saudi Arabia, Oman, Myanmar and others in 2019-20, we ourselves have a supply shortage," he said. "Why was no proper planning done before exporting our potato stock when there is a supply crunch in our domestic market," he asked. Vallabh said there are 30 lakh tonnes of potatoes lying in cold storages across Uttar Pradesh, out of which 22 lakh tonnes was meant for the markets. "When the time is to boost consumption in our economy, why is the government denting the pockets of the common man through increased prices for their mandatory spending," he also asked.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-slams-govt-over-rise-in-price-of-essential-commodities-910028.html

Adityanath had on Saturday said his government would come out with a law to deal with ‘love jihad’ and used the Hindu funeral chant ‘Ram Naam Satya Hai’ to threaten those who do not respect their daughters and sisters. Love jihad is a derogatory coinage referring to the alleged campaign of Muslims forcing Hindu girls to convert in the guise of love. "After the BJP formed government in the state, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is only making laws. The reality is that the Adityanath government is unable to control crime in the state, and the law and order situation in deteriorating,” Chaudhary, also the Leader of Opposition in UP Legislative Assembly, said. “Have incidents of murder and rape stopped?” he told reporters here. The Samajwadi Party leader also accused the chief minister of moving on the path of German dictator Adolf Hitler. He also claimed that despite the “misuse” of government machinery in the ongoing polls, the SP candidates will emerge stronger. On asked if his party will register a complaint with the poll panel over the alleged misuse of state machinery, Chaudhary claimed that various constitutional bodies, including the Election Commission, are under the control of the BJP.

01-11-2020||North and Central||At 11.4 degree Celsius, Delhi records season's lowest minimum temperature||The national capital recorded a minimum temperature of 11.4 degrees Celsius on Sunday morning, the lowest this season so far, according to the India Meteorological Department. Normally, the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, records a minimum of 15 to 16 degrees Celsius in the first week of November. The mercury dips to 11-12 degrees Celsius by the last week of November, it said. Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of IMD, said the absence of cloud cover was the major reason for the low minimum temperature.   Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground. Another reason is calm winds, which allow formation of mist and fog, Srivastava said.  There hasn't been much snowfall in the hills, so cold winds from that region are yet to start affecting Delhi's weather, he added. The month of October was the coolest in 58 years in the national capital, according to IMD.    The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius, it said. Normally, Delhi records a mean minimum temperature of 19.1 degrees Celsius in October. The city recorded a mean minimum temperature of 17.5 degrees Celsius in October 2007, according to IMD.   On Thursday, Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 12.5 degrees Celsius -- the lowest in October in 26 years. The last time Delhi recorded such a low temperature in October was in 1994. The national capital had recorded a minimum of 12.3 degrees Celsius on October 31, 1994, according to IMD data.   The city recorded the all-time lowest temperature (9.4 degrees Celsius) on October 31, 1937, Srivastava said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/at-114-degree-celsius-delhi-records-seasons-lowest-minimum-temperature-909801.html
01-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality remains 'very poor' due to 'unusually high' farm fires||The national capital's air quality remained “very poor” on Sunday with an “unusually high” number of farm fires negating the effect of better ventilation, according to a government forecasting agency. However, the situation is likely to get better by Monday. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 366 at 8:30 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 367 on Saturday, 374 on Friday, 395 on Thursday, 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday, and 353 on Monday. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitoring agency, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was 32 per cent on Saturday, the second-highest this season so far. It was 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday -- the maximum so far this season. According to the central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the fire count increased to an unusual high on Friday over Punjab (approx 4,266), Haryana (155), Uttar Pradesh (51) and Madhya Pradesh (381) impacting air quality in Delhi-NCR and other parts of northwest India. NASA's satellite imagery showed a large, dense cluster of fire dots covering Punjab and parts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. SAFAR said Delhi's AQI did not improve much despite better ventilation, mainly because of highly favourable north-north westerly boundary level wind direction and perfect wind speed for the intrusion of pollutants from farm fires. “Increased local surface wind speed with faster dispersion conditions are counteracting with increased fire-related emission and associated intrusion. But still, AQI is likely to improve for the next two days as dispersion will eventually play a lead role,” it said. According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction was northwesterly and the maximum wind speed was 15 kilometres per hour on Sunday.  Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. The city's ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was expected to be around 8,500 metre square per second on Sunday – favourable for dispersion of pollutants. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-remains-very-poor-due-to-unusually-high-farm-fires-909804.html

01-11-2020||North and Central||J&K excise scam: Process to frame charges against 16 accused set in motion||After a 24-year long legal battle, the framing of charges against 16 accused, including a retired IAS officer and four government employees, in the Jammu and Kashmir excise scam has been set in motion, an official said on Sunday. According to the spokesperson of the Crime Branch, Jammu, the state exchequer lost around Rs 3 crore due to the scam related to payment of contract bid of liquor vends allotted by the government to M/s Kuldip Singh and Company. The firm was supposed to deposit Rs 13.23 crore in banks and treasuries of the excise department. The receipts and vouchers were to be presented before excise office, Jammu, to get the liquor permit. However, the deputy commissioner of excise, Jammu, found some discrepancies in the receipts and vouchers and sought their verification. A variation in the amount paid by the firm and that shown in vouchers presented to the excise office was found, the official said. “The accused would deposited Rs 1 lakh in the bank as revenue on account of excise duties but on the vouchers they used to add one more zero, making it appear as Rs 10 lakh," the spokesperson said. "This illegal practice continued for over a period of one year which caused a loss of around Rs 3 crore to the excise department directly and the state exchequer indirectly,” the official added. The allegations were proved against the accused during investigation and the chargesheet was produced in the court of sub Judge, Jammu, on September 10, 1996. Six of the accused, including two government employees and four shareholders of the company, have died since the registration of the case, the spokesperson said. “After 24 years of battle in the court by the crime branch represented by additional public prosecutor, Jammu, the process of framing of charges has been set in motion. This case was clubbed with yet another case registered with the then vigilance organisation,” the spokesperson said. He said Additional Sessions Judge, Jammu, Tahir Khurshid Raina passed the order to chargesheet the accused -- retired IAS officer and shareholder of the company -- Hansraj Mangotra, his son and partner Manoj Mangotra, co-shareholders Amardeep Sharma, Kuldeep Singh, shareholders Rashpal Singh, Rameshwar Singh, Ripu Daman Sharma (chartered accountant), Ashok Agarwal, Sudershan Singh Jamwal, Thakur Shiv Ram and Moolraj, and Randeer Singh. He said excise inspectors Narinder Sharma and Sardari Lal, senior accountant at excise office, Jammu, Surinder Singh and employee Sunil Masih Matto are also named as accused. However, Rashpal Singh, Ashok Agarwal, Thakur Shiv Ram, Moolraj, Surinder Singh, and Sardari Lal have passed away, the spokesperson said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jk-excise-scam-process-to-frame-charges-against-16-accused-set-in-motion-909886.html
01-11-2020||North and Central||After UP, Haryana to bring law to curb 'Love Jihad'||Days after killing of a Hindu girl by a Muslim youth in broad daylight, Haryana government is mulling to bring a law against 'love jihad", a theme the BJP and VHP have repeatedly played upon to allege that Hindu girls are being wooed by members of the other community as part of a grand conspiracy to alter the nation's demography. This is the third state in which the issue of "love jihad" has been raked up within a week in the midst of ongoing assembly polls in Bihar and assembly bypolls on November 3 in 54 Assembly constituencies across 10 states, including 28 in Madhya Pradesh and the rest in Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Nagaland, Odisha, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh. Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij said on Twitter Sunday that Haryana is contemplating a law against love jihad (Haryana me love jihad ke khilaf kanoon banane par vichar kiya ja raha hai). The remark by the Haryana minister comes days after a delegation of Vishwa Hindu Parishad met him over the killing of a 21-year-old college student, Nikita, who was shot dead in Haryana's Ballabgarh by a man. The police later arrested two persons Tausif and Rehan in the case. The victim's family alleged that the man was pressuring her to convert to Islam in order to marry him. Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) working president Alok Kumar, who had met the victim's family on Friday said in a statement "a talented young girl, ambitious to reach the skies was murdered by Islamic jihadists at a public place and in broad daylight." While the VHP said that the alleged increasing incidents of "love jihad, religious conversions and atrocities on Hindus" are a cause for concern, Bajrang Dal had held protests in the streets. Yoga guru Ramdev, who also called it a case of "love jihad" has demanded public hanging of the killers of Nikita and asked Islamic clerics to oppose "love jihad" . Earlier, NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma had raised the issue of the alleged rising number of 'love jihad' cases in the Opposition-ruled Maharashtra during her meeting with Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari over a week ago. Her comment that there is a 'rise in love-jihad cases' in Maharashtra had kicked up a row. On Saturday Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced his government will bring a legislation to deal with it and had made some controversial remarks. Addressing election rallies in Uttar Pradesh's Jaunpur and Deoria on Saturday, Adityanath had welcomed the Allahabad High Court ruling declaring that conversion for the sole purpose of marriage is not valid. Latching on to it, he also said the Uttar Pradesh government will also work to curb 'Love-Jihad' and the honour of 'behen betis' will be protected thoroughly under Operation "Shakti". "I warn those who conceal identity and play with our sisters' respect, if you don't mend your ways, your 'Ram naam satya' journey will begin," the UP Chief Minister had said. Already in Kanpur in the state, an eight-member SIT formed by Kanpur police is looking into allegations of forced conversion on the pretext of marriage, which was formed after some members of Hindu organisations met the top cops claiming rise in "Love Jihad" incidents. Over ten days ago, BJP and VHP workers in Bareilly ransacked a police station accusing the police of inaction in the case of kidnapping of a girl, which they said was a case of "love jihad". This happened despite the girl in a video that went viral saying that she was an adult and had left her home with her boyfriend Bilal on her own. BJP and VHP have for quite some time been using this term to allege that there is a campaign of Muslims forcing Hindu girls to convert in the guise of love. Earlier this month, key BJP strategist and Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma promised the state government will start strict fight against 'Love Jihad' if the party comes back to power again in the assembly elections due in March- April 2021. In September, Goa BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member Vinay Tendulkar had said "Love Jihad" was a curse to the society. Recently even in BJP ruled Madhya Pradesh, allegations of love jihad have flown thick and fast.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/after-up-haryana-to-bring-law-to-curb-love-jihad-909890.html
01-11-2020||North and Central||1.25 crore wait-listed passengers denied train travel in 2019-20: RTI||More than one crore passengers could not travel by trains despite buying tickets in 2019-2020 because of being waitlisted, a query filed under the RTI has found, indicating a shortage of trains on busy routes in the country. The RTI reply has said in 2019-2020, a total of 84,61,204 Passenger Name Record (PNR) numbers, against which 1.25 crore passengers were scheduled to travel, were automatically cancelled due to being waitlisted. The Railway Ministry has for the first time taken measures to reduce waitlisting for train travel with the introduction of private trains. The Railways has also introduced special 'clone trains' on the routes which generally have high passenger traffic. These trains have limited stoppages/halts and faster transit time. They primarily have 3-tier AC coaches and will run ahead of the already operating special trains on the same route. The Advance Reservation Period (ARP) of these 'clone trains' is 10 days. The waitlisting of passengers and the automatic cancellation of tickets have been a problem for the Railways over the years with the national transporter unable to meet the demands of its growing customers. After cancellation of PNRs, the ticket fare is refunded to the passengers. In the last five years, almost five crore PNRs were automatically cancelled because of being waitlisted, said the RTI filed by Madhya Pradesh-based activist Chandra Shekhar Gaur. While in 2014-15, the number of cancelled PNRs stood at 1,13,17,481, the number in 2015-2016 was 81,05,022, in 2016-2017 it was, 72,13,131, the next year it was 73,02,042 and in 2018-2019, the number stood at 68,97,922. Chairman and CEO of the Railway Board too in a press briefing earlier had acknowledged the need for reducing waitlisting in trains and said with the introduction of private trains, the number of waitlisted passengers will decrease. According to official figures, the passenger sector requirement in 2019-2020 was 8.4 billion. The average drop in the waiting list was 8.9 per cent in 2019-20. During the busy season, 13.3 per cent of passengers were not able to get confirmed reservations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/125-crore-wait-listed-passengers-denied-train-travel-in-2019-20-rti-909901.html

With the peoples' support, militancy will be eradicated completely,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the Police martyr’s memorial sports festival in Baramulla. According to the army data, out of 207 active militants in the Valley 87 are in north Kashmir while 120 are in south.  The data show that while 24 youth joined militancy in north Kashmir this year, 107 did so in the south. The police chief said the launch pads along the LoC are still active and Pakistan is trying to push in militants into Kashmir. “This year too, launch pads are full and attempts are continuously being made to push in militants into this side,” Singh said. He said Pakistan continues with ceasefire violations along the LoC to give cover to militants to infiltrate into Indian side.. “However, our counter insurgency grid along the LoC is active and majority of the times, infiltrators are getting killed on the LoC,” the J&K police chief said. He said the relentless anti-militancy operations would continue in winters too. The police chief said that militants at the behest of Pakistan have started to target innocent people in the valley. “Such actions will not be tolerated and will be dealt with with iron hands,” he asserted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/militancy-on-its-last-legs-in-north-kashmir-jk-police-chief-909903.html

It rejected any policy on rehabilitation which did not recognize the "genocide" inflicted on the community. The group said in a statement that the creation of UT of Panun Kashmir has become a geopolitical imperative to safeguard "Indian national interests" in the region. It said there was no question of the community returning to their old areas as the "Hindu habitat in Kashmir from which Hindus were expelled stands destroyed". Referring to Pakistan's admission of complicity in the deadly Pulwama attack on a CRPF convoy in February last year, the Panun Kashmir said it is an imperative for Centre to respond to this admission. "We demand that Government of India declare Pakistan a terrorist state and hold it responsible for crimes against humanity," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/migrant-kashmiri-outfit-pandit-panun-kashmir-demands-separate-ut-for-rehabilitation-in-valley-909904.html
01-11-2020||North and Central||Hizbul chief Ghazi Haider killed in Srinagar encounter||In a huge setback to militancy in Kashmir, chief commander of Hizb-ul-Mujahideen outfit Saifullah Mir aka Ghazi Haider was killed in an encounter with security forces in Rangreth area on the outskirts of Srinagar city on Sunday. 30-year-old Saifullah, who had taken command of the indigenous outfit after the killing of Riyaz Naikoo on May 6 this year, was one of the most wanted militants in the Valley and was involved in several attacks on the security forces, police said. His selection to lead the Hizbul had been declared by Saleem Hashmi, the outfit’s Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK) based spokesperson on May 11. Inspector General Police (IGP), Kashmir, Vijay Kumar while confirming the killing said that a suspect was also arrested at the encounter site, who is being questioned. Talking to reporters, Kumar said that on the basis of a specific lead, joint teams of police and CRPF laid a cordon at Rangreth area and later the army also joined in the operation. Terming the killing a big success, police said they are waiting for the family members of Hizbul chief to identify the body. Saifullah, son of a government school teacher, with three brothers and a younger sister, had studied till class 10 before earning a diploma in medical electronics from the Industrial Training Institute in Pulwama in 2010. Saifullah, who hailed from Malangpora in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district, was recruited by Naikoo in 2014 and came on the radar of security agencies in 2017. He had also figured in one of the group pictures of Burhan Wani and his associates that went viral on social media in 2015 and was the last surviving militant from the group. He was also known by the code name “Doctor Saif” because he treated injured militants. Saifullah was the fourth operational chief of the Hizbul from Pulwama since 22-year-old Burhan was killed on July 8, 2016, triggering a six-month long unrest that left over 100 protesters dead and thousands injured. After Burhan’s killing, Sabzar Bhat had taken over as chief of the Hizbul. Bhat was killed in an encounter with security forces in Pulwama on May 27, 2017. “Saifullah maintained a low profile, both before and after becoming the chief, and he was in contrast to his predecessors who were more active in using social media to further their goals,” a senior police officer told DH. After Saifullah’s killing, the officer said, either Mohammad Ashraf Khan alias Ashraf Molvi or Zubair Wani will take over as new chief of the Hizbul. “Molvi is among the senior-most militant commanders in Kashmir, while Wani, who joined militant ranks in April 2018, is expert in targeting political workers and security forces. He has a Masters in Philosophy (M Phil) degree to his credit,” he added. Formed in 1989, the Hizbul is one of the largest and oldest militant groups operating in Kashmir. The outfit is led by Specially Designated Global Terrorist Mohammad Yusuf Shah, also known as Syed Salahuddin, who is based in the PoK.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hizbul-chief-ghazi-haider-killed-in-srinagar-encounter-909908.html
01-11-2020||North and Central||Public buses resume plying with full seating capacity in Delhi||The DTC and Cluster buses resumed plying with full seating capacity on Sunday, with Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot urging travellers to wear masks and observe Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. In a tweet, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) said intra-state movement of buses has been permitted with full seating capacity on a trial basis, subject to the condition that no passenger will travel standing and without a mask. Owing to closure of offices, the number of passengers who travelled on buses on Sunday was relatively low. However, at some crowded bus stands like ITO and Dhaula Kuan, drivers and conductors had to struggle to manage the commuters who were trying to board the buses. "It is difficult to maintain the required social distance of six feet in a bus even if no one is standing in the corridor because seats are very close. "But there is no other option because how long can you sit at home and not go out to earn for your family," said Ram Sajivan, a daily wager, who was travelling in a bus from Anand Vihar to Badarpur Border. Gahlot tweeted "I would appeal to all passengers to wear a mask and observe Covid appropriate behaviour." The number of passengers is likely to increase on Monday when more people use public transport buses to commute to work and other purposes. The Delhi government on May 20 directed that a maximum of 20 passengers in public transport buses will be allowed in view of maintaining proper social distance to check the spread of coronavirus. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in its order on Saturday said movement of buses will be permitted on trial basis up to November 8 or till further orders, whichever is earlier, subject to the condition that no passenger will be allowed to travel in a standing position and without a mask and all other stipulations of standard operating procedure. However, the move to resume operation of DTC and Cluster buses with full seating capacity comes at a time when the city is witnessing a surge of COVID-19 cases with upwards of 5,000 new infections being reported daily for the past few days. As per the standard operating procedure issued by DDMA, in case more persons than seating capacity board the bus, the driver and conductor will request the extra passengers to de-board the bus with the help of marshal. In case, the extra passengers refuse to comply with the order, the driver and conductor will seek police assistance, it said. The DDMA order states in case, the driver of any DTC or Cluster bus is found carrying passengers more than the seating capacity of the vehicle, strict disciplinary action will be taken against him and he will also be liable for prosecution action under Disaster Management Act 2005. The DTC and Cluster buses can seat up to 40 passengers. There are around 3,800 buses run by the DTC and over 2,600 run under Cluster scheme of Delhi Integrated Multi Modal Transit System.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/public-buses-resume-plying-with-full-seating-capacity-in-delhi-909917.html

A case has been registered against a doctor and some staffers of the hospital, according to police sources, on Sunday. Sources said, the 20-year-old victim, a resident of the Kokhraj area in the district, was admitted to the private hospital in Manjhanpur locality last month with complaints of fever and stomach pain.

Her father met the senior district officials and sought a probe into the matter. A preliminary probe by a three-member committee found that the allegations were true, following which a case was registered at the Manjhanpur police station against the doctor and some employees of the hospital, sources said. A majority of the staff members and the doctor had been absconding since then, the sources added. "We will take stern action against the accused persons...The license of the hospital will be cancelled," said a senior district official in Kaushambi.

01-11-2020||North and Central||Ten Faridabad cops injured as youths pelt stones at them over Nikita murder case||Ten Faridabad police personnel were injured on Sunday when a group of youths allegedly pelted stones at them and tried to indulge in vandalism after being asked to vacate the Delhi-Agra national highway that they had blocked in Haryana's Ballabhgarh, police said. Police used mild force to disperse the group and the highway, which was blocked for a few minutes, was then cleared. The incident took place just around the time a “Mahapanchayat” was being held in nearby Dussehra grounds in Ballabhgarh. The “Mahapanchayat” was organised by various social organisations to demand justice for 21-year-old college student Nikita, who was shot dead outside her college in Ballabhgarh on Monday allegedly by a man who had been pressuring her to marry him. Three men, including the main accused Tausif, were later arrested in the case. Police said the group of youths who had also reached close to the site where the “Mahapanchayat” was going on suddenly started gathering at the highway and blocked it. The protesting youth were demanding capital punishment for the accused involved in Nikita's killing. Some among them later started pelting stones at the police when they were asked not to block the highway. Police said the organisers of the “Mahapanchayat” told them they did not know who the youths were. Faridabad Police Commissioner O P Singh told PTI over phone that 10 policemen were injured as stones were hurled at them. “Thirty of them have been rounded up. The situation was immediately brought under control,” Singh said. He said during questioning it was found that a majority of the 30 had come from places outside Faridabad district including Gurugram, Mewat, Palwal, Delhi and Noida. Some of the youths were carrying lathis and stones as well and had come with a "pre-planned intention to vitiate the atmosphere", police said. “The intention looked to disturb peace and harmony. We are investigating if there was any conspiracy angle involved,” Singh said. “The highway was blocked by protesters for a few minutes and the road was cleared soon,” Singh said. Heavy police force was already deployed in the area in view of the “Mahapanchayat”. Asked about various protests which have been held by different outfits against Nikita's killings, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who was interacting with reporters in Karnal, said, “Everyone has a right to hold protest in a peaceful manner. But no one should take law and order into one's hands… If anyone tries to disturb the law and order situation, he will be dealt with strictly as per law”. Meanwhile, the 'Mahapanchayat' decided to accord “martyr” status to Nikita and sought exemplary punishment for the accused. “Despite grave pressure put on her by the main accused to marry him and convert to Islam, she outright refused and even sacrificed herself. The 'Sarv Samaj' (mahapanchayat) gave her martyr status. "Further, the Mahapanchayat decided to organise a “Shradhanjali Sabha” on November 8 in her memory. We have demanded that the case should be tried by a fast track court. The woman's family should be given compensation by the government and provided police security,” a member of the “Mahapanchayat” told reporters in Ballabhgarh. Nikita, a BCom final-year student, had come out of her college after appearing in an exam on Monday afternoon when she was shot dead outside the place in Ballabhgarh allegedly by the man who had been forcing her to marry him, according to police. Police have so far arrested three people in connection with the case. Tausif and Rehan were nabbed on Tuesday, while Ajaru was held on Thursday. A Special Investigation Team has been set up to carry out the probe. Notably, some Hindu outfits have alleged that the main accused in the case had been putting pressure on the young woman for marriage and had also asked her to convert to Islam. The woman's family has claimed that Tausif had harassed her two years ago and had compelled her to convert to Islam in order to marry him, which she had refused.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ten-faridabad-cops-injured-as-youths-pelt-stones-at-them-over-nikita-murder-case-909927.html

Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday accused the BJP of misusing the government machinery and making voters feel afraid while apprehending defeat in the bypolls. In a statement, Akhilesh Yadav said, "The BJP never had faith in 'loktantra' (democracy), 'loklaaj' and 'lokmaryada'. They never hesitate in doing something wrong to gain power." He demanded that central forces be deployed at sensitive places to ensure free and impartial polls. Appealing to the voters, Yadav said, "These bypolls should be taken seriously. The results of the bypolls will determine as to on which path will UP's politics move. The voters have to choose between development and destruction." Meanwhile, UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said the BJP government has failed on all fronts and asserted that the public has decided to teach the ruling party a lesson. "This will be visible in the bypolls. These bypolls will mark the commencement of the decline of the BJP and the Congress will emerge victorious," Lallu said while slamming the state government over the law and order situation. On Saturday, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had said his government will come out with a law to deal with "love jihad" and used the Hindu funeral chant "Ram Naam Satya Hai" to threaten those who don't respect their daughters and sisters. Welcoming the Allahabad High Court ruling declaring that conversion for the sole purpose of marriage is not valid, the chief minister said posters will be put up of those involved in "love jihad", a derogatory coinage referring to the alleged campaign of Muslims forcing Hindu girls to convert in the guise of love. "We will bring an effective law. It is my warning to those who play with the honour and dignity of sisters and daughters by hiding their real names and identities. If they do not mend their ways, their 'Ram Naam Satya' journey will start," Adityanath had said while addressing election rallies in Jaunpur and Deoria. Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati too on Sunday appealed to voters to vote for her party candidates and send a political message to rivals.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-canvassing-ends-for-bypolls-to-seven-assembly-seats-88-in-fray-909984.html

Police said the posters, declaring "Jihadi Terrorist Islamic Centre", were removed immediately and an FIR registered against unknown persons at the Tughlak Road station after the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) reported the matter. "We have registered a case under Section 3 of the Delhi Prevention of Defacement of Property Act against unknown people. We are scanning CCTV cameras installed in and around the vicinity but have not found any relevant footage," a senior police officer said. An NDMC official added that police was informed "to take action as per norms". Hindu Sena president Vishnu Gupta said he got to know that some of the group’s workers were behind it. “When we asked the workers (karyakartas), they said radical terrorist activities are taking place all over the world, particularly in France… Our workers expressed their anger against such activities by putting posters at the India Islamic Centre,” Gupta told reporters. The Centre, which abuts the Lodhi Gardens in the heart of Lutyens Delhi, is a hub of several cultural activities, including plays and concerts. This is not the first time the Hindu Sena has defaced road signs in the national capital. In June this year, its workers defaced a signboard outside the Chinese embassy here against the killing of 20 Indian soldiers in clashes with the Chinese troops in Ladak Galwan Valley. Last year, the Babar Road signboard was blackened by Hindu Sena workers who demanded that the name of the road be changed. In May 2015, signboards of Akbar Road and Feroz Shah Road were plastered with posters of the group. Three people died in a knife attack at a church in Nice last week. It was described by French President Emmanuel Macron as an "Islamist terrorist attack". A few weeks ago, an assailant decapitated a French middle school teacher who showed caricatures of Prophet Muhammed for a class on free speech.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/india-islamic-cultural-centre-signboard-defaced-hindu-sena-says-its-workers-did-it-909997.html

Haryana will host the fourth edition of the Khelo India Youth Games next year.  The Games will be held in Panchkula in November 2021 and preparations for it have started from today on 'Haryana Day', Khattar said at a state-level function at Karan Stadium in Karnal to mark the day. Haryana was carved out of previous undivided Punjab on this day in 1966. On the occasion, the chief minister inaugurated a 'U-turn flyover' near DLF Cyber City on National Highway-48 in Gurgaon through video conferencing, according to an official statement.  He said a number of players from Haryana have made their state and the entire nation proud with their achievements at the national and international levels. In the last edition of the Khelo India Games, the state had come second. The chief minister said that participating players from Haryana should take a pledge to work hard and bag the first position this time. The Haryana government will provide full support to players in this regard, he added. Khattar congratulated the people on the completion of 54 years of Haryana coming into existence. Functions were also held across the state on the occasion of 'Haryana Day', which is also being celebrated as 'Sports Day' this year. Ministers and other leaders of the BJP-JJP coalition government in the state took part in these functions. Deputy Chief Minister and JJP leader Dushyant Chautala addressed a gathering of sportspersons in Rohtak and urged them to work harder so that the state can achieve new heights in sports. On the occasion, 288 chaupals of Karnal district were equipped with WiFi. Khattar said that with the facility of WiFi, people will now have access to more than 550 government schemes and services. Now, they will not have to visit government offices time and again, he said. He also informed that out of 382-gram panchayats in Karnal, optical fibre cabling of 288 panchayats has been completed, while internet and WiFi facility is functioning smoothly in 225-gram panchayats. On the newly constructed 'U-turn flyover', which is 675-metre long and 12.5-metre wide, Khattar said that one more step has been taken towards making Gurgaon free from traffic jams. While inaugurating the three-lane flyover, the chief minister said it has been constructed at a cost of about Rs 52 crore and it will provide a big relief to commuters. The cost of the project was borne by the National Highways Authority of India and the state government in a 75:25 ratio, he said. The chief minister said that despite the challenge of Covid-19, the construction of the flyover has been completed within the stipulated period of 18 months.   The flyover will help in preventing traffic congestion and facilitate U-turn movement for vehicles coming from Delhi to Jaipur, Khattar said. It will prevent accidents and help in reducing pollution caused by traffic jams, he said. Khattar said that a four-lane U-turn underpass is being constructed on NH-48 near Ambience Mall in Gurgoan and it is in the final stages of construction.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/haryana-emerging-as-sports-hub-says-khattar-on-haryana-day-910009.html

The Congress leader, however, has denied the charge and termed it as a “conspiracy” to tarnish his image. Superintendent of Police Yashveer Singh said police took cognizance of the matter after its video went viral on social media. Meanwhile, Mishra said one of the girls was an office-bearer of the party’s women cell and was angry as she was removed from her post on the recommendation of senior leaders. The Congress leader claimed that he had paid for the construction material used in her house. When he demanded his money back, she started misbehaving and beat him up, the leader alleged. Meanwhile, Orai Circle Officer Santosh Kumar said they have registered a case under Section 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the IPC. The accused will be arrested soon and the entire matter will be probed, he said. The UP Congress too has formed a five-member team to look into the matter. Siddharthapriy Srivastava, in-charge administration of the UP Congress Committee, said following the scuffle between Anurag Mishra and the woman, a five-member team will go to the spot to obtain information about the incident. Former Union minister Pradeep Jain Aditya is a member of the team.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/uttar-pradesh-jalaun-congress-leader-anurag-mishra-beaten-up-by-women-910011.html

The district police's campaign named 'Lon Varratu' (return to your home/village), launched in June this year for the rehabilitation of Naxals, is yielding positive results as 177 ultras have so far surrendered under it, he said. "In the latest case, altogether 27 cadres, including six women, turned themselves in before senior police and CRPF officials at Barsoor police station in the district," Dantewada Superintendent of Police Abhishek Pallava told PTI. Of them, 11 cadres are natives of Gufa village, seven from Bedma, five from Mangnar, three from Hitawada and one from Handwada, he said without disclosing their identity citing security reasons. These ultras were active as members of Dandakaranya Adivasi Kisan Mazdoor Sangthan (DAKMS), Krantikari Mahila Adivasi Sangthan (KAMS)- frontal wings of Maoists, Chetna Natya Mandli (CNM-cultural offshoot of Maoists) and jan- militia groups, Pallava said. "All of them were allegedly involved in attacks on police teams, triggering IED blasts and putting up Maoist posters and banners. Five of them carried rewards of Rs 1 lakh each on their heads," he said. In their statement they said, they were disappointed with the "hollow" Maoist ideology. They also said that the recent surrenderby their colleagues as a part of 'Lon Varratu campaign of local police also encouraged them to quit violence, he said. Each of them was given immediate assistance of Rs 10,000 and will be provided facilities further as per the government's surrender and rehabilitation policy, Pallava added. Under the 'Lon Varratu' (term coined in local Gondi dialect) initiative, Dantewada police have put posters and banners in the native villages of at least 1,600 Naxals, mostly carrying cash rewards on their heads, and appealed them to return to the mainstream.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/27-naxals-surrender-in-chhattisgarhs-dantewada-910038.html

However, police refuted her allegations and said 12 arrests have been made after she complained in April that her father was beaten up by eight people resulting in his death three days later. In a note uploaded along with the video, the girl claimed her family was poor and helpless and were begging for justice from the government with complaints given to various officials in the last six months, all in vain. She alleged police had connived with an accused to render the probe ineffective, adding that efforts to meet the state chief minister had been futile for several months now. However, Bhopal Urban Deputy Inspector General Irshad Wali tweeted that 12 people had been arrested by Govindpura police on the girl's complaint. Govindpura police station in charge Ashok Singh Parihar told PTI the girl has been hospitalised and her statement is being recorded.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/madhya-pradesh-girl-claims-apathy-slits-wrist-uploads-video-on-twitter-910054.html
01-11-2020||Opinion||Controlling the waters||Young men wading through chest-deep water to rescue babies. Cars swept away in seconds by the force of rushing water. Submerged apartments and homes and collapsing stormwater drains. Bengaluru’s news was full of such stories during last week’s torrential rains. The same rains that wreaked havoc across residential localities in Bengaluru also worked their magic on its keres, kaluves and baavis. Six lakes filled to the brim, a rare occurrence. One of Bengaluru’s best known lakes, Sankey lake, filled and overflowed into the outflow channel, for the first time in 12 years. The monsoons are a blessing and a curse. The legend of Bellandur lake is that of a pregnant woman who cursed the village for not providing her with food and water. Her words brought down a deluge, turning the entire area into a lake. People prayed to the goddess (for the woman was indeed the goddess in disguise). She halted the rains but warned people about the dangers of greed and the disregard for nature, asking them to build a temple in her name and pay heed to her warning. When lakes overflowed in Bengaluru, communities celebrated. The wells and kalyanis filled up. To thank the goddess for her bounty, residents conducted Gange puje – floating a coracle across the lake with a lit lamp made of rice flour, and a goat -- ending with a community feast, to celebrate the bountiful months of harvest that they anticipated with eagerness. Gange puje is almost lost from urban memory, until a good monsoon brings it back. Last week, local residents offered ­bagina at Sankey lake, an abbreviated urban form of what used to be a days-long rural ceremony. Older residents around Rachenahalli lake, another kere that filled to the brim this monsoon, speak with nostalgic affection about the times that they got together as a community in their childhood to request ‘Maleraya’, the god of rains, to shower them with his blessings at the end of the summer. The spot where they used to pray to Maleraya is now a small temple on the lake bund. Earlier, it was inside the lake, submerged in water during most of the year. The lake dried up in summer, providing everyone – elderly grandmothers and grandfathers and young babies alike – a path so that they could walk over the dry lakebed, down to the temple, to participate in the communal feast. During the rest of the year, children swam to the partially submerged temple, taking with them offerings that their parents sent. The girls swam, too, tucking in their langas, until they were banned by watchful relatives. They caught fish at the side of the lake, as they waited for their cows to complete grazing. Today, a fence at the inner side of the lake ostensibly keeps out the cows. An odd cow or two still finds its way past the fence, following the path that other cows have trodden for centuries, but which modernity seeks to limit. Like cows, water finds its way past barriers. Water slides through cracks and gaps, cracking open barricades, collapsing retainer walls, filling basements, converting ‘low lying’ areas into lakes, and threatening babies, cattle and cars. We cannot engineer solutions to floods, which will become increasingly common in the era of climate change. Maleraya and Gange will not save us – our sins are numerous. We ignore the power of nature, seeking to tame it and alter its course, drive it into safe paths using retainer walls and fences, manage its vagaries by using technologies such as cloudseeding to call down the monsoon and pumps to reduce flooding. The unpredictability of nature can only be managed by nature – restoring ecological integrity by protecting wetlands, reviving lakes, deconcretising lake bunds and stormwater channels, reclaiming grasslands, and uprooting plantations on lakebeds. Our obsessive belief in technology – not much different in its particulars from blind faith -- will not save us.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/controlling-the-waters-909706.html
01-11-2020||Opinion||Nothing. Justifies. Violence. Period.||As pretty much a freedom of expression absolutist, I believe in the right to offend and blaspheme, as well as in the right to take offence. There is one single red line for both: Nothing. Justifies. Violence. Period. My rule of thumb is, “Your freedom of expression stops where my nose starts”. It is not “Your freedom of expression stops where my emotional meltdown begins”. People should be free to be irreverent or offensive—whether that is in the form of jokes about religious figures, or merciless satire about public figures, or sexist jokes. They can expect fiery blowback. Equally, free speech/expression has no immunity from other free speech/expression. It can expect to be challenged, countered, heckled, called out, or ignored. Your vigorous opinion on my lousy free speech is also free speech. A plurality of ideas makes for a vibrant, creative, and ultimately healthier democracy. In a free society, private citizens and entities are free to set their own red lines, even if it’s on a public platform (be it a Twitter account or a television channel); but the State must safeguard universal freedom of expression, and the universal right to life and liberty. A contest of ideas, no matter how vile, under this umbrella, can eventually shift conversations and behaviours towards the most persuasive (from where I stand, hopefully, the most liberal). Call each other names all you like, but Nothing. Justifies. Violence. Period. In the real world, every constitutional democracy sets ‘reasonable restrictions’ on freedom of expression. In India, incitement to violence is a red line; but so, sadly, is offending religious sentiments—an exception that has no place in a free society—and criminal defamation, an offence which civilised societies should decriminalise. Arguments about freedom of expression tend to get stuck in disagreements about the ideas themselves. But the question of whether an act of speech/expression is right or wrong, acceptable or not, is a completely different debate. We can, and should, have that debate until the last person falls dead of exhaustion from shouting. But in the meantime, Nothing. Justifies. Violence. Period. In the real world, not everyone can manage their emotions; when they encounter ideas they don’t like, they attack people and break things. Among these emotional toddlers, you will find the devout of every stripe, pseudo-nationalists, patriarchs, the far left, the not-even-that-far right, and all kinds of ideologues as well as political opportunists. Peaceful protest is a fundamental right, but a society that caves in to these violent bullying babies is a less free society. The core problem of free speech is not free speech: It is effective law enforcement. This is the only meaningful protection for the legal standard for freedom of expression, and it is the State’s obligation to provide it, so that freedoms are not garrotted by social veto and vigilantism. Real countries have to decide whether to stand by liberal constitutions or allow themselves to be blackmailed by the threat of violence. Vigorous peaceful protest against perceived offence is fine—necessary, even. Physical retaliation is not. France has refused to restrict its freedom of expression standards, in a way that Indian free speech advocates can only envy. India, with its majoritarian double standards, and liberal confusion about ‘respect’ versus freedom of expression, has a long way to go. There is no difference between the Islamist who beheads so-called blasphemers, the Hindutva sympathiser who lynches Muslims or Dalits, the self-appointed custodian of ‘cultural values’ who destroys art or property, the rapist-murderer, or the murderous political ideologue. You can tie yourself up in knots with competing well-meaning impulses, but if you’re looking for clarity, I can offer you this: When it comes to freedom of expression, Nothing. Justifies. Violence. Period.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/nothing-justifies-violence-period-909708.html
01-11-2020||Opinion||Information wars are nothing new||Almost 50 years ago, a prescient senior executive of IBM, from Australia I believe, remarked that whoever controlled information would, in the future, end up controlling the world. A citizen’s legal right to information, even in exigent circumstances such as the coronavirus pandemic, is rendered meaningless when the people in charge of making the information available place every conceivable roadblock. Whether this is done in the context of India’s Right to Information (RTI) Act or America’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), it doesn’t really matter, does it? In 1965, when the University of California-Berkeley professor and world-renowned computer scientist Lotfi Zadeh first developed “Fuzzy Logic,” an AI model for human reasoning in which everything -- including truth -- is a matter of degree, he did not, at that time, realise how his work would end up being repurposed. In his May 25, 1997, commencement address to UC-Berkeley Computer Science graduates, Professor Zadeh stated that unrestrained advertising, with its high content of half-truths and untruths, had become a corrosive force in the US and that other countries were being forced to follow this undesirable route. He bemoaned the quest for efficiency and stronger competitive position in the global marketplace using intrusive advertising to promote consumerism in total disregard to cultural values and social rights. This single-mindedness, he added, would become stronger and less amenable to control as the world moved further and further into the Information Age and multimedia. And he delivered the address well before the age of social media and fake news. The information wars really began about 600 years ago when, around 1440, Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press, which enabled the wide dissemination of information, and therefore knowledge, across Europe on a scale unknown until then. This singular invention broke the monopoly on information held by the Papacy and the aristocracies in France, Spain, Italy, Holland, Germany, and England. Of course, the backlash that ensued resulted in the creation of the Protestant denomination, and a series of religious sectarian wars which broke out across Europe lasted almost 200 years. The same invention was also responsible for the spread of Christianity across much of Africa and the Americas since translated versions of the Bible could now be easily mass-produced in a variety of vernacular languages and distributed by the colonialists. Of course, these days one can use Google software to translate almost any utterance, oral or written, into whatever language one chooses. With a caveat, however. Translated versions oftentimes do violence to the original, as any competent linguist will attest. The victims of enhanced interrogations do not suffer any less pain, do they? If changing Stalingrad to Leningrad or vice versa can bring back the victims of the purges, it would be a really neat trick if it can be pulled off. Perhaps AI can help? Fast forward 500 years, we have Joseph Goebbels who, as Information Minister under Hitler, quickly gained control of the print media and used the relatively new media of radio and film for propaganda purposes. He was responsible for making available to the German populace the 1940s version of the mobile phone and social media – a cheap radio receiver dubbed the Volksempfänger (people’s receiver), which enabled Germans to stay tuned to Nazi broadcasts. As Albert Speer, Hitler’s architect and later Minister for Armaments and War Production, so cogently put it, “Through technical devices like the radio and loudspeaker, 80 million people were deprived of independent thought.” It is only too well-known that Nazi Germany went on to grab territories and exterminate what it considered undesirable segments of the population. Four hundred years ago, missionaries came calling on Central and South America, Bible in one hand, sword in the other. In the process of colonising the continents, they exterminated the natives in genocidal wrath and ruined their culture. Their descendants are still in control. In the 2020 world of information and all things AI, when nattily attired missionaries of commerce come calling, they bear the internet’s promise of riches and most-favoured-nation treaties in one hand, and sanctions and cyber weapons in the other. While book bans and book burnings still go on in various parts of the globe, these days a simple mouse click can make entire libraries disappear, leaving behind neither fire nor smoke. An environment-conscious act on the part of governments and corporations alike, I suppose. The proselytizers of today are to be found not in thatched huts in remote villages but in sparkling glass and concrete edifices bearing innocuous names such as the XYZ Enterprise Institute and the ABC Consulting Group. The missionaries of old sold religion and grabbed resources, the new ones peddle consumerism and greed while exploiting resources. Plus ca change.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/information-wars-are-nothing-new-909709.html
01-11-2020||Opinion||Whatever happened to the wit and repartee of an earlier era||The proceedings of the legislature begin with Question Hour when members pose questions to the government on various issues. While some questions are clever and put the government on the mat, most are pedestrian, and some bizarre. Sometimes, a question provides comic relief in an otherwise mundane session. Sample this: “How many trees are there in the state?” This question by an MLA left even a seasoned politician like the then forest minister Gurupadappa Nagamarapalli flummoxed. The minister, however, quickly gathered his wits and shot back: “As many trees as the strands of hair on the forest minister’s head.” To this came a repartee from BJP legislator S Suresh Kumar, who is now the primary and secondary education minister, “Thank God, M C Nanaiah is not the forest minister.” While Nagamarapalli had a thick mop of hair, Nanaiah, the law minister was almost bald! Normally, members are not satisfied with the response provided by the government to their questions and engage in a verbal duel with the ministers. In contrast, while covering the proceedings of the legislative council, I had noticed that one particular senior member from Tumakuru always seemed to be convinced with the government’s reply and never raised a supplementary question. One day, to the utter surprise of all, he expressed dissatisfaction at the minister’s response to his question and rose to ask a supplementary. But just then, there was a minor commotion in the House and the member had to resume his seat. Barely a minute later, things had settled down and the chairman called upon him to address his question to the minister. The member stood up hesitantly. “Chairman sir, I have forgotten what I wanted to ask,” he said sheepishly. The House was in splits. Thus ended the poor man’s first attempt at jousting with the government. I wrote a humorous piece about the incident, half-mocking the member, and I had expected him to be upset with me. Instead, the next day, he walked towards the press gallery with a wide grin and expressed his gratitude: “Thank you very much for the beautiful report. I am very happy you mentioned my name.” I couldn’t help letting out a chuckle. To him, that his name appeared in print was more important than the context in which it did. While the sessions of the legislature provide an opportunity to the lawmakers to put the government on the mat over unfulfilled promises, over the years, ministers have mastered the art of wriggling out of tricky situations. One standard reply is: “The matter is under consideration.” This would usually satisfy the members -- until JH Patel, who was the chief minister from 1996 to 1999, let the cat out of the bag. “In the House of Commons”, he explained in an Yes, minister-esque revelation, “When the minister says the file is ‘under active consideration’ what he actually means is, he has not yet seen the file. When he says the file is ‘under consideration’, it means the file does not even exist.” Patel was a forthright man, and witty, too. But sometimes, he fell victim to one or both of those characteristics. Once, Patel made a sarcastic remark on the way elections were held in Uttar Pradesh. “In UP, there is a class called Rigvedis—those who rig polls.” Suresh Kumar, punning on Patel’s self-confessed love for wine, retorted: “In Karnataka, we have a class called Pegvedis.” The chief minister had a hearty laugh. Such repartees were common as both sides took them in their stride, enlivening the proceedings. Today, even members with a sense of humour think twice before cracking a joke because people are so easily offended. No surprise then that legislature sessions these days can easily put one to sleep.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/whatever-happened-to-the-wit-and-repartee-of-an-earlier-era-909711.html

He was shifted to the private hospital here the same day. “With deep grief, we announce the sad demise of the Honourable Minister for Agriculture, Thiru. R. Doraikkannu on 31.10.2020 at 11.15 pm. Our thoughts and prayers are with the grieving family during this difficult period,” Dr Aravindan Selvaraj Executive Director, Kauvery Hospital, said in a statement.  The minister had tested positive for Covid-19 after being admitted to the hospital and his health condition deteriorated due to co-morbid conditions. The hospital had on October 25 said that he had multiple co-morbidities and his CT scan showed 90 per cent lung involvement.   Born in 1948, Doraikkannu was first elected to the Tamil Nadu Assembly from Papanasam constituency in 2006 and won subsequent elections in 2011 and 2016 from the same segment. In 2016, he made to the J Jayalalithaa cabinet after the AIADMK retained power in the assembly elections and was appointed as Agriculture Minister.  Doraikkannu is the latest VIP to succumb to Covid-19 in Tamil Nadu. DMK MLA J Anbazhagan, former MLA P Vetrivel, and legendary singer S P Balasubrahmanyam also lost their lives after being infected with the novel Coronavirus.  Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and his cabinet colleagues paid floral tributes to Doraikkannu's portrait on Sunday morning after which the mortal remains were taken to his native village in Thanjavur district. Deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam and a host of his cabinet colleagues represented the state government at Doraikkannu's funeral. While Palaniswami and Panneerselvam termed Doraikkannu's death as “loss to the AIADMK and the state”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the departed leader had made noteworthy efforts to “serve society and empower the farmers.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-agriculture-minister-who-had-covid-19-passes-away-at-72-909715.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi wished the people of Kerala on the occasion, saying he prays for the continuous progress of the southern state. Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Union Home Minister Amit Shah were among others who greeted the people of the state on the occasion. Vijayan said due to Covid-19 there were no extensive celebrations on the formation day this year. Kerala was formed on November 1, 1956 by integrating Travancore, Cochin and Malabar provinces. "Kerala Piravi (formation) day wishes to the wonderful people of Kerala, who have always made indelible contributions to India's growth. "Keralas natural beauty has made it among the most popular destinations, drawing people from all over the world. Praying for Keralas continuous progress," Modi tweeted. Governor Khan wished the people of the state in Malayalam and said the aim should be to make it a more developed 'Nava Keralam'. "Let us work in harmony for the progress of our beloved state, with the aim of making it a more developed Nava Keralam... We can also give importance to the development of Malayalam, the mother tongue," he said in a video message. Shah, in a tweet, said: "Best wishes to my sisters & brothers of Kerala on 'Kerala Piravi day'. The state is blessed with mesmerising culture and beauty. People of Kerala have been playing an important role all over the world in various fields, especially in health and education." Vijayan urged the people of Kerala to move forward by upholding the values of secularism, democracy and brotherhood. "This time our Kerala Piravi day has been affected by the pandemic Covid-19 and hence we have no extensive celebrations. However, we are celebrating the birth of our state in our hearts," the Marxist veteran said. In a Facebook post, he also said the state needed to continue its fight against social inequalities. "Let us move forward by upholding the values of secularism, democracy and brotherhood," Vijayan added. Kerala is battling a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases since September with the infection tally touching 4.20 lakh on Saturday||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/narendra-modi-pinarayi-vijayan-greet-people-of-kerala-on-state-formation-day-909847.html
01-11-2020||South||Major government projects in Kerala under ED probe||Various major infrastructure projects of Kerala government are learnt to be under the scanner of Enforcement Directorate as part of the probe against Chief Minister's former principal secretary M Sivasankar. There are reports that ED has already sent a letter to Kerala government seeking details of four major projects. However, government sources preferred to be tight-lipped. Kerala Fibre Optic Network, a Rs. 1,500 crore project aimed at last-mile fibre connectivity and free high-speed internet to 20 lakh economically weak families, Rs. 4,500 crore e-mobility project that aims at rolling out 10 lakh electric vehicles by 2022, DownTown IT/ITES infrastructure and township project attached to Technopark Phase-III campus in Thiruvananthapuram and development of the SmartCity Kochi were learnt to be under ED scanner owing to direct involvement of Sivasankar in these projects. ED is also learnt to have collected details of Sivasankar's assets. Sivasankar, who was arrested by the ED last week, is now in ED's custody and being quizzed in Kochi.

The man doused himself with diesel and self-immolated but was immediately rescued by some police and locals, who put out the flames and shifted him to a hospital,a senior police official told PTI. Doctors said the man suffered over 50 per cent burns. Reacting to the incident, Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) working president K T Rama Rao alleged that the saffron party was hatching a conspiracy to foment trouble in the state capital ahead of the November 3 by-polls to the Dubbak Assembly seat. According to the state BJP President, the man attempted "suicide" after learning that police prevented him (Sanjay Kumar) from visiting Siddipet town last week. Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy and other party leaders visited the party cadre at the hospital and enquired about his health condition. In a video clip aired by some local channels, the man is purportedly heard raising pro-BJP slogans and saying that he resorted to the act aggrieved over "detention" of Sanjay Kumar recently. On October 26, Sanjay Kumar was prevented by police from going to Dubbak after they had seized Rs 18.67 lakh cash from the house of a relative of BJP candidate M Raghunandan Rao. Subsequently, he staged a sit-in protest alleging that the ruling TRS was planning to postpone Dubbak Assembly by-poll by hook or crook and using police force to harass his party workers. Meanwhile, Rama Rao said the BJP was conspiring to disrupt law and order in the state. Addressing the media here, he said, "BJP is conspiring to cause trouble on the eve of Dubbak by-poll. It's planning to lay siege to the DGP office, Pragathi Bhavan or Telangana Bhavan (on Monday) to provoke lathi-charge or firing by police." He claimed that BJP was indulging in false propaganda to gain sympathy votes in the by-poll. In a letter to the Election Commission, the TRS leader stated that he had reliable information that BJP was planning to 'incite violence' and create law and order issues in view the Dubbak by-election. He requested the EC to take action to prevent any untoward or unwarranted incidents in Telangana.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/bjp-worker-commits-self-immolation-outside-party-office-in-hyderabad-909974.html
01-11-2020||South||Opposition demands ban on Tamil Nadu BJP's 'Vetrivel Yatra'||BJP's Tamil Nadu unit will embark on a month-long 'Vetrivel Yatra' from November 6 to reinforce that the state was a "spiritual land" hoping to capitalise on a controversy owing to a YouTube channel uploading a derogatory video on Kandha Sashti Kavasam, a devotional song dedicated to Lord Murugan. Though the BJP says the Yatra that will travel to all six abodes of Lord Murugan, considered a Tamil God, is aimed at galvanising its cadre, Opposition parties see red in the month-long tour. Barring DMK, almost all parties in the Opposition bloc have demanded a ban on the Yatra alleging that the BJP's intention was to "instigate riots" in the name of god. The ruling AIADMK has taken objection to the presence of its founder M G Ramachandran's image in the posters put up by the BJP asking people to participate in the Yatra. The BJP, which is making desperate attempts to make inroads into Tamil Nadu, has been harping on to the controversy, which actually blew over after members of the YouTube channel were arrested, to widen its base in the state. The Yatra that begins on November 6 in Tiruttani, one of the six abodes of Lord Murugan, will culminate in Tiruchendur in Thoothukudi district on December 6. VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan, who has locked horns with BJP over the age-old Manusmriti, has alleged that the last date of the state-wide tour raises more questions about the saffron party's intentions. "Why did they choose December 6? Why not begin the tour on November 1 and end on December 1? The intention is clear. They want to whip up religious passions in Tamil Nadu as they do elsewhere. They very well know Muslims come out to protest on December 6 against the demolition of Babri Masjid. This shows that their plan is something else," Thirumavalavan said. The Left parties have also called for a ban of the Yatra citing the same reason. However, Tamil Nadu BJP President L Murugan said that the Opposition parties are asking for a ban on the Yatra due to "fear" that the BJP was becoming popular in the state. "They are scared of the BJP's rise in Tamil Nadu. The Yatra will march on,” he said. The party feels the ‘Vetrivel Yatra’ will help it reach out to the masses ahead of the crucial Assembly polls due in the first half of 2021. The BJP has been making concerted efforts to project it as an alternative to the Dravidian majors – DMK and AIADMK – by tapping into every major community and attempting a social engineering formula. Party leaders said the Yatra, which has been a successful method devised by the BJP to reach out to people, will help galvanize party cadre and also send across a message to other political parties that the saffron outfit “cannot be taken for granted” any more in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/opposition-demands-ban-on-tamil-nadu-bjps-vetrivel-yatra-909988.html
01-11-2020||South||Dubbaka bypoll: BJP's fierce fight to emerge as principal political challenger to ruling TRS||All eyes in Telangana are now on Dubbaka, a rural Assembly constituency, about 100 km north of Hyderabad, going to by-polls on Tuesday. The by-election was necessitated by the death of four-time TRS MLA Solipeta Ramalinga Reddy in August, who suffered cardiac arrest. The ruling party has fielded Solipeta's widow Sujatha as its candidate. The Congress made former minister Cheruku Muthyam Reddy's son Srinivas its nominee after his switchover, miffed by the TRS's decision. BJP's candidate is Raghunandan Rao, who contested the 2018 Dubbaka Assembly and 2019 Medak Lok Sabha polls unsuccessfully, coming third both times. However, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi, which won Dubbaka in 2014 and 2018, appears far from a position of garnering sympathy votes and retaining the seat effortlessly. Dubbaka, nestled between Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao's Gajwel, his nephew and Finance Minister Harish Rao's Siddipet and IT, Industries and Municipal Administration Minister and KCR's son KT Rama Rao's Sircilla, is seen by the locals as a patch of neglect amidst the three high profile constituencies. The BJP is trying to cash in this resentment, especially of the youth, over the lack of jobs, development in a constituency which has a cordial atmosphere communally. By consistently fielding the local man and advocate Raghunandan, the BJP has expanded its presence in the constituency and is trying to wrest the seat from the ruling TRS. Raghunandan, also a Velama (landlord caste) as the Kalvakuntla family is, was with the TRS till 2013. “Surprisingly, the BJP, seen as an urban party, could spread out into remote villages. The youth appears to be attracted and if they could influence their families and others, the TRS could find itself in an embarrassing situation,” P Raju, a teacher from Etigadda Kistapur village, told DH. The TRS might still manage to pull it off, but the victory margin would be very slender, Raju says. As the Congress appears to have fallen back in the triangular contest, the TRS-BJP are engaged in a fierce fight. The events of the past one week, including the seizure of over Rs 18 lakh cash from the BJP contestant's relative house last Monday, and detention of BJP leaders, including state chief Bandi Sanjay visiting Dubbaka, has heated up the election environ. BJP alleged the money was planted by the police at TRS's behest. On Sunday, the Hyderabad police seized Rs one crore “unaccounted for money” from a car allegedly being taken to Dubbaka to influence voters. City police commissioner Anjani Kumar connected the arrested persons to the BJP candidate. The BJP alleges the TRS as resorting to large-scale misuse of government machinery especially the police and threats to voters of stopping government benefits if not elected. Political observers say that the BJP winning or even losing by a thin margin would largely help it consolidate its attempts to become the principal challenger to KCR by the 2023 Assembly elections. The saffron party made an astonishing comeback winning four Lok Sabha seats in 2019 after its Assembly tally dropped from five to one in 2018. The BJP likens a vote for the Congress as going in the TRS favour pointing to the several MLAs who joined the TRS later. The high decibel Dubbaka campaign ended on Sunday evening. Close to two lakh voters would choose their next legislator on Tuesday. The results will be out on 10 November.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dubbaka-bypoll-bjps-fierce-fight-to-emerge-as-principal-political-challenger-to-ruling-trs-909990.html

Addressing a protest of Congress-led United Democratic Front in Kerala on Sunday, Ramachandran said that a woman with self-respect who gets raped would either end her life or would try to prevent such incident in future. "But a woman here is stating that the entire system raped her and the ruling left-front in Kerala is using her to deviate attention from the serious allegations against the government," he said. Ramachandran's statement came in the backdrop of a fresh rape allegation raised against a Congress leader by a cheating case accused woman. The same woman had earlier raised rape allegations against many senior Congress leaders. With Ramachandran's statement triggering criticisms of insulting womanhood, he tendered an apology at the same event itself. Kerala social justice minister K K Shailaja and Kerala Women's Commission chairperson M C Josephine flayed Ramachandran's statement. Josephine said that the commission would take action against him. Ramachandran, who was a former union minister of state for home affairs, had courted controversy in June after he had stated that state health minister K K Shailaja was trying to earn publicity over Covid-19. "She earned the title of NIPAH princess just by playing a guest actor's role in the fight against NIPAH and she was trying to get C ovid-19 Queen title," he had stated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/woman-with-self-respect-would-kill-self-if-raped-kerala-congress-chief-mullappally-ramachandran-909991.html

The girl later died in a hospital. This is the third such incident of women being killed in Andhra Pradesh in less than three weeks. According to the police, the girl Varalakshmi was in the intermediate second year in a local college and the accused Akhil (23) is studying law. Both know each other for some time. She was found with heavy bleeding near a temple. The police have reportedly taken Akhil and another youth into custody in connection with the murder. The fresh incident, this time in Visakhapatnam has shocked the port-city. The earlier two incidents were in Vijayawada, where a 24-year-old nurse was set afire on 12 October, and on 15 October, a 20-year-old engineering student was stabbed in her neck inside her house by a man who was allegedly in a relationship with her earlier. While the perpetrator in the first case also succumbed to the burn injuries, the second case offender is under treatment in a hospital for alleged self-inflicted knife injuries. Women organisations and opposition TDP leaders have condemned the attacks and expressed fear over a series of brazen attacks on ladies in the state. Chief Minister Jaganmohan Reddy has announced an ex-gratia of Rs 10 lakh to the family of Varalakshmi in Visakhapatnam. Reddy directed the DGP and other officials to take stern action against the accused and other such perpetrators of atrocities on women. The Chief Minister called for more awareness creation among every woman to download the “Disha” app for their safety. “Efforts should be made to educate school and college girls to compulsorily download the app on their phones,” Reddy said while directing officials to act immediately when they receive a distress call from any woman claiming a threat to life.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/woman-killed-by-alleged-jilted-lover-in-vizag-third-such-incident-in-andhra-in-three-weeks-909995.html

And to wean them away from smartphones, a government hospital here has set up an exclusive library to enable patients to swap gadgets for old-fashioned books. Set up in an area of 500 sq. ft, the library at the Government Covid-19 Hospital inside the King Institute campus in Guindy boasts of around 1,700 books in English and Tamil. Novels, comics, science, self-improvement, mental health, and biographies— the library has collections from several genres, besides 10 newspapers and magazines in Tamil and English. Another distinct feature of the library is that most of the books have been donated by Covid-19 survivors who were treated at the hospital. The library has been set up by converting a conference hall located close to the elevator, which makes it easy for patients to access the facility. “Since they are cut-off from the outside world, Covid-19 patients use their mobile phones excessively to keep themselves engaged. And a few people were reading books that they had brought with them. That is when we decided to set up a library so that more patients can take to reading,” Dr K Narayanasamy, director of Government Covid Hospital, Guindy, told DH. The library not just keeps book lovers busy but also gives them an opportunity to interact with others. Open for three hours each in the morning and evening, the library has become a hit among asymptomatic and mild Covid-19 patients in the hospital, Narayanasamy said. 10 to 15 people are in the library at any given time during the working hours and many come in the morning to read newspapers. The hospital, which has a total of 750 beds, has treated thousands of patients, including bureaucrats who were infected with the novel coronavirus. “Books usually de-stress one’s mind. And the library has become a good centre for patients to engage with others and share their experiences. This way, they can keep their mind free and feel that they are not alone. They also feel they are at home,” Narayanasamy added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-library-inside-covid-19-hospital-to-de-stress-patients-910008.html

Bineesh was arrested under the anti-money laundering law on October 29 following which a city court sent him to the agency's custody till November 2. On Sunday evening, Bineesh reportedly complained of back pain following which he was taken to the Bowring Hospital for check-up. The central agency alleged that the "drug peddler" in the case, Mohammed Anoop, was a "benamidar" of Bineesh.

In a 20-minute speech at the 'Let's Reclaim Tamil Nadu' conference, organised by Erode district via video conferencing, Stalin tore into Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami for allowing the BJP-led Centre to “impose Hindi”, usurp state's rights on Goods and Services Tax (GST) and “keeping mum” on the New Education Policy (NEP) and issues related to environment. There was a time when “Delhi was scared of Tamil Nadu” and its leaders, Stalin said, recalling former prime minister H D Deve Gowda's statement that though Delhi was the capital of India, Tamil Nadu was the capital in “claiming rights” from the Centre. “Tamil Nadu was known for its magnificence and there was a time when those administering the country from Delhi were scared of leaders from our state. Because they fought for their rights. Today, Palaniswami has surrendered all our rights and has fallen on the BJP's feet like a cat just to be in power,” Stalin alleged. The DMK will hold a series of online conferences in several districts this month as part of its campaign for the Assembly elections due in the first half of 2021. Stalin has been making optimum use of technology to keep in touch with party cadre by talking to them regularly via video calls. “There is an urgent need to reclaim the rights of Tamil Nadu that have been surrendered. Tamil Nadu is the land that showed the way for India on why states should have more autonomy and Centre should be ruled by a coalition of parties. Tamil Nadu is the land that sowed the seeds of social justice and remains its capital,” the DMK president added. He also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi for praising Palaniswami and the Tamil Nadu government for their efforts in containing Covid-19, saying Modi must be living in a foreign nation to have lauded a government that claimed that it will ensure not even one person gets infected with the Coronavirus in the state. “The state, today, has over 7 lakh cases and has recorded over 11,000 deaths. Who is responsible? Why is the prime minister praising a state that has failed to control the Covid-19 spread? Only the prime minister and the BJP will praise AIADMK. No one else will,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dmk-vows-to-reclaim-tamil-nadus-lost-rights-from-delhi-910032.html

The Jaganmohan Reddy government took the decision as the daily fresh Covid-19 cases dropped to below the 3000-mark. The state has 23,668 active cases as of Sunday. For students of 9-10 standards, the schools will reopen from November 2, for classes 6-8, it is from November 23, and for students of class 1-5, the school starts on December 14, education officials said. The academic year 2020-21, disrupted due to the pandemic, is extended up to April 30, totaling 180 working days. All higher educational institutions, including university colleges and its affiliated colleges, would function from November 2 with classes conducted on all six days of the week. First-year professional and non-professional UG courses will commence from December 1. State education minister Adimulapu Suresh has said that the app was created to see that all schools adhere to the SOPs like distancing, temperature screening, and sanitizing in wake of the Covid-19 situation. “A task force is formed with the collectors and other officials to monitor the situation and random tests would be conducted for the students on a regular basis. Every effort would be made to maintain sanitation,” the minister said. “Wearing masks, washing hands, and maintaining physical distance are mandatory which should be followed by every student as well as teachers. Students will undergo orientation on Covid-19 precautions daily and the classes starting at 9.15 am will go on till 1.45 pm, followed by the midday meals. In the afternoon hours, online classes would be taken for those students not turning up,” school education commissioner China Veerabhadrudu explained. Following CM Reddy's instructions, officials made alternate arrangements for the students opting to stay home to pursue online education, utilizing dedicated mobile apps like Abhyasa and Diksha, along with Doordarshan classes and youtube channels, based on the student’s accessibility to technology. Hostel facilities in residential schools could be made available between November 2-23, prioritising the students who lack proper accommodation. With reference to intermediate classes, the minister said second-year Intermediate classes would begin from November 2 and first-year from November 16.

It was a low-key Dasara due to the outbreak of Covid-19. While the government had earmarked Rs 10 crore for the celebrations, only Rs 2,05,83,167 was spent. The government has spent a total of Rs 2.91 crore, including Rs 50 lakh given to Mandya and Rs 36 lakh for Chamarajanagar, for the celebrations.  The balance amount of Rs 7,08,16,833 is in the deputy commissioner’s bank account, the minister said. The expenditure includes Rs 40 lakh honorarium to the erstwhile royal family of Mysuru and Rs 35 lakh spent on five Dasara elephants. The authorities spent Rs 16.94 lakh for Jamboo Savari and Rs 6.5 lakh for live streaming of Dasara events. Besides, Rs 44 lakh was spent on cultural events of Dasara and honorarium to artists and Rs 41 lakh was spent on other arrangements. The minister said the remainder of Rs 7 crore will be utilised after discussing with Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa. Last year, the then district in-charge Minister V Somanna had promised to release details of the expenses for Dasara, but failed to keep the promise. Charges were made against the district administration on bills pertaining to works undertaken by private stakeholders for the festivities not being cleared. The contractors, artistes and sportspersons were forced to wait for months to get their money.  Last year, contractors working with Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) had stopped Dasara-related works as the government had kept a large amount pending.

The ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi and opposition BJP both backed Marathi-speaking people of Belagavi and demanded the merger of 800-odd villages in Maharashtra. A few ministers of the Uddhav Thackeray-led government wore black ribbons to support the Marathi-speaking locals of Belagavi, who observed a 'Black Day.' Last week, two ministers handling issues vis-a-vis Maharashtra-Karnataka boundary issue – Eknath Shinde and Chhagan Bhujbal, in an open letter to people of Belagavi, stated: "…The Marathi-speaking people of all religions and castes consider Maharashtra as its own…" They said that the Maharashtra government is committed to education, social justice, conservation of Marathi language, transport infrastructure in 865 villages including Belagavi, Karwar, Nippani, Bidar and Bhalki. "We both are small soldiers of this movement to include these areas into Maharashtra which is indebted to the sacrifice and courage of the local Marathi population," they said. In Kolhapur, Water Resources Minister and state NCP president Jayant Patil was seen sporting a black band on his arm. "We are with Marathi-speaking people and we express solidarity with our brethren," Patil said. The Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, that spearheads the campaign in Belagavi, is regularly in touch with Maharashtra's political spectrum in Mumbai. The Maharashtra government also took objection to the statement of Karnataka's Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, who had said that parts of Karnataka cannot be separated. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said, “This is a 60-year-old fight for the rights of the Marathi people. Their wish to be part of Maharashtra should be respected. If Kannada-speaking people on Karnataka-Andhra or Kerala borders wish to be part of Karnataka, their wishes too should be fulfilled,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-ministers-sport-black-armbands-express-solidarity-with-marathi-speaking-people-of-belagavi-909981.html
