19-11-2020||First Edit||Bihar polls: Chief Minister as Caligula’s horse||Nitish Kumar has been sworn in for the fourth time as Chief Minister of Bihar to head a government over which he will have little control. Nitish had himself resigned and nominated Jitan Ram Manjhi as Chief Minister in 2014, owning responsibility for his party’s heavy loss to the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections. Manjhi was his proxy, and in the same manner he will now be beholden to the BJP and will be taking orders from that party. He had refused to continue as Chief Minister then because, he said, the mandate was not in his favour. Even now, the mandate is against him, but ironically, he has to continue as Chief Minister for reasons that more suit the BJP than him. If he had assumed chief ministership on three occasions in the past as a morally, politically and electorally strong leader, he lacks that strength and legitimacy now.   It is clear that the BJP, with 74 seats in the Assembly against the JD(U)’s 43, will call the shots in the government and the NDA. Nominally, he remains the leader as tactically the BJP cannot ditch and disown him so soon after the elections which it contested with him as the leader and after the party’s leaders, including the Prime Minister, repeatedly said that he would continue to be the Chief Minister. It is also because both sides do not have other viable options. If Nitish refuses to play the BJP’s game, he may lose much of his party to the BJP or the RJD. But the BJP’s strategic aims are certain to be different. When it starts to assert itself and to build on the dominance it now has in the state’s politics, Nitish Kumar will certainly feel the heat. After weakening him as a leader, the BJP may also be eyeing the social base he now has, especially because he has no strong second line of leadership to protect that base and to keep the flock together.  The BJP has made its intentions clear by binding Nitish Kumar with two Deputy Chief Ministers in place of Sushil Kumar Modi, who was close to him and was the most visible face of the old NDA. The message is that the old NDA is dead and there are new power equations in the state. In the cabinet also, more portfolios and the more important ones have gone to the BJP. It is a sad turn: Nitish Kumar, who has dominated the state as a politician, administrator and leader for decades, may now be seen as Caligula’s horse, appointed and anointed by the master for a purpose.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/bihar-polls-chief-minister-as-caligula-s-horse-917331.html

Her win is being celebrated globally for having crushed a major gender stereotype in the US and bringing a symbolic victory to women around the world. In her national address, Harris encouraged future women candidates by prophesying that, “While I may be the first woman in this office, I won’t be the last. Because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities.” While the 2020 American presidential election will be remembered for a long time as monumental, it is empowering to remember that so many countries have earlier  elected women to be their leaders. In 1960, Sirimavo Bandaranaike became the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka and the first female Head of State in Asia. In 1966, Indira Gandhi became India’s first female Prime Minister and today, November 19, marks the 103rd birth anniversary of our ‘Iron Lady’, a woman who stood at the helm for nearly 16 years and was responsible for several historic decisions that altered the course of our nation. While India can boast of having had a female PM and President, the election of Kamala Harris is still so important to us Indians partly because of her South Indian descent and also because the book on women’s empowerment is yet to have its concluding chapter written. While the question of whether women can lead as capably as men has been adequately answered by prominent world leaders, particularly during this global pandemic, there is still the perception of an existing glass ceiling. The term ‘glass ceiling’ was popularised three decades ago in a Wall Street Journal article to describe the barrier that prevented women from being promoted to leadership roles. Despite extant gender stereotypes and the statistical masculinity of leadership, women are rising into positions of power in governments and private organisations. The presence of corporate leaders like Susan Wojcicki and Lisa Su, Heads of State like Angela Merkel and Jacinda Ardern, and heads of international organisations such as Christine Lagarde and Kristalina Georgieva are examples of how women do make it to high positions of authority, and proof that the metaphor of the glass ceiling is untrue. While an absolute barrier does not exist, the path to leadership for a woman is still not a straight one. Rather, as Alice Eagly and Linda Carli, professors of psychology at Northwestern and Wellesley College, respectively, put it, it is a labyrinth with obstacles, not barriers. Routes to the centre exist, but are full of setbacks, twists, turns, and sometimes dead-ends. The metaphor of the labyrinth more accurately describes the complexities women face along the way, including prejudices, male domination, issues with leadership style, and family responsibilities. Women have proven their ability to lead, especially when their communities are jeopardised. This year’s news has seen women on the frontlines everywhere as heads of governments, legislators, healthcare workers and community leaders. Today, women are heads in just 21 countries, though they have displayed inclusive and effective decision-making. The world’s oldest democracy may have waited till 2020 to entrust a woman with the second highest office, but the past and present is full of examples of women who have successfully navigated to the centre of the labyrinth, such as Indira Gandhi. Today, we celebrate a piece of history by remembering India’s first and only woman Prime Minister, and also look forward to what the future will bring with Kamala Harris. While her election is an empowering reminder that times have changed, we must also remember that we once elected a woman as head of our country. I am proud that we can claim to be one of the 75 countries to have had a female leader but yearn to see more women at the forefront. Harris’ victory, especially as she is the daughter of an Indian immigrant in the US, should remind women all over the world of their native changemakers who made it through the twists and turns of the occupational labyrinth. The celebration of a woman making it to the top should remind us that there is a passage through the labyrinth that requires perseverance, wisdom, and an occasional helping hand. As a woman slowly making my way through the professional world, I am grateful for the laws in place to discourage systemic discrimination against women, but I am constantly reminded of how skewed the gender ratio of people in leadership positions is. Today, however, I am inspired. I am inspired by history and the present. I am inspired by the fact that India once entrusted a woman with its destiny, and I hope it once again will. I look forward to a less polarised future, where the progress women have made for themselves is not lost but is perpetuated by a rising number of women who make it to the news and by the many women who navigate through the labyrinth every day.

The Karnataka Cabinet on Wednesday gave its in-principle approval for carving a new Vijayanagar district out of Ballari. Vijayanagar, if everything works out fine, will be the 31st district of Karnataka. Hosapete and west taluks (of Ballari) erupted in joy after learning the Cabinet decision. Social media was abuzz with discussions about the new district and its constituenttaluks. In fact the demand for the new Vijayanagar district dates back to 2007, when the newly coined Vijayanagar Zilla Horata Samithi went big with a campaign for a new district. Three months later the agitation lost its steam and soon it turned into a dormant campaign. In the subsequent years the struggle was limited to submitting memoranda to successive governments. The struggle, however, gained steam in 2019. Anand Singh, who was elected on Congress ticket in 2018, quit as MLA and joined the BJP with a condition that Vijaynagar be made a district. The BJP was then struggling to muster numbers to form government,  Anand Singh fought the bypolls on Vijayanagar district issue and had it easy. Right after the byelection, Anand Singh led a delegation to Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa demanding the creation of a new district. Yediyurappa responded by moving a note to the chief secretary on carving out Vijayanagar district from Ballari. The new district issue did not make any further progress after the BJP legislators from Ballari, led by Somashekar Reddy sternly opposed the move. Finally, the BJP-led state government on Wednesday set the ball rolling for carving out Vijayanagar district from Ballari. Of the 11 taluks in Ballari district, four west taluks - Hagaribommanahalli, Kottur, Hadagali and Harapanahalli - will join Kampli and Hosapete to constitute the new Vijayanagar district.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/vijayanagar-district-decade-long-struggle-comes-to-fruition-917302.html

The court extended the order of stay on the work till the next date ofhearing. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka was hearing the PIL which claimed that the Rs 110-cr project intending to change the path of Vrushabhavati river may result in consequences impacting environment and ecology. The counsel for the petitioners pointed that the state had not stated in its objections about obtaining an expert opinion on the work. The advocate representing the state government submitted that the project was not intended to change the course of the river. The project only intends to prevent the encroachers and polluters from further damage the river, he stated. The court asked the state government to file a statement on oath that the work of changing or diverting the course of Vrushabhavati river would not be taken up. The PIL filed by Bangalore Environment Trust and others mainly seeks quashing of the government order on the project. The petitioners also sought direction for restoration of the area of the Byramangala reservoir as it was prior to the construction of the diversion weir.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/byramangala-project-karnataka-hc-seeks-affidavit-on-river-course-917303.html
19-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Bengaluru IPS officer trolled over cracker ban debate||IPS officer D Roopa was trolled and abused on Twitter on Wednesday three days after an argument over ban on firecrackers led to the suspension of a pro-Hindutva handle from the platform. A section of social media users has been arguing against the ban or restriction on firecrackers with many dubbing it as government “interference” in Hinduism. However, discussion took a turn when True Indology, an anonymous handle known for making disputed claims over India’s history, engaged Roopa over the claim that firecrackers were not essentially part of Hinduism but more of a social practice. When the civilised debate led to heavy trolling, the anonymous account was suspended on Wednesday morning, hours after Roopa slammed the abusive words and lies and said: “Ur time’s up”. It was not clear whether the officer complained about the handle. However, many supporters of ‘True Indology’ saw it as abuse of power. To a question, Roopa told DH that she would not like to comment on the issue. She, however, sought to note that trolling was not an offence as per law. Actor Kangana Ranaut joined the force and by late evening, the abuse got louder and personal with nearly 1 lakh people trolling the officer and demanding reinstatment of True Indology. Mysore MP Pratap Simha came to the defence of the officer. “Guyz, u can fiercely argue with @D_Roopa_IPS (and) u can disagree with her, but she is not your foe. In fact, she is a staunch nationalist. Cool down pls, things vl get better,” he tweeted. Many questioned the line of defence by citing the ‘nationalism’ of the officer.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/bengaluru-ips-officer-trolled-over-cracker-ban-debate-917312.html

Following demands by aspirants of both KPSC and Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exams, as there was little gap between the exams of these two government agencies, KPSC re-scheduled a few pending exams. S R Ravi, Navodaya Foundation, said, “While UPSC exams are scheduled between January 8-10 and 16-17, next year, KPSC exams were due for December 21-24 and January 2-5”. S Sowmya, an aspirant for the exams for Assistant Controllers (Group A) and also Company Secretary (CS) exams, conducted by Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI), said, the exams for Gazetted Probationer Group A and B posts and other post have been postponed, but the exams for the posts of Assistant Controllers (Group A) for the Department of State Accounts and Audit has been re-scheduled from December 21 to 24. “The CS exams are also scheduled from December 21 to 30. Commerce graduates appear for both the exams. Now, we have to choose either of them,” she said. Suresh, an aspirant, urged the state government to direct the KPSC to re-schedule the exams further, to facilitate the appearance of all aspirants in the exams. R Rohit, another aspirant, said, “Some of us also appear for UPSC exams. Thus, the agencies conducting the recruitment exams should understand the schedule of other agencies. They should have a system for coordination, so that their schedules do not put the aspirants in trouble”.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/new-schedule-of-kpsc-exams-put-commerce-graduates-in-a-fix-917457.html

"We have collected opinions from school development and monitoring committee members, teachers and parents on reopening of schools. We would take a call on it after holding talks with the Chief Minister," he said. He said that lands of many government schools are not registered in the name of institutes. So, nodal officer would be appointed to ensure that lands are registered in the name of schools with the help of Revenue Department. He also said that sakala, seva sindhu, janasevaka and grama one must not be politicized.  "The allegations that only BJP workers had been selected are far from truth. These schemes have been implemented for the welfare of public. Those who came forward are given training," he said. He said that zero academic year is a new concept. "Earlier, students upto class 9 were promoted to the next class without conducting examinations. So, can we call it zero academic year?" he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/will-take-a-call-on-reopening-of-schools-in-karnataka-education-minister-suresh-kumar-917592.html

On the other hand, we have internal rumblings. We can’t go forward if we have people weakening the party from within. If our ideology weakens, we will be destroyed,” he said.  Kharge’s comments were seen as his rebuke of the latest leadership crisis in the Congress after the party’s dismal performance in the recent Bihar elections.  “There’s an old adage that the true colours of our friends can be measured during defeat and that of our family during illness. Now, we have both defeat and illness, so we will know who’s with us and who’s not,” Kharge, a Gandhi family loyalist, lamented.  The former Union minister questioned the credibility of leaders who are targeting the Congress high command. “They can’t even produce corporators in their areas,” he said. “Everybody will praise the party when everything’s nice. But when an election is lost, Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi are blamed,” he said. “But every state has its own leaders and 90% of the tickets are given based on their advice. Today, leaders complain that nobody listens to them.”  Kharge pointed out that it was the decision of the Congress Working Committee that Sonia Gandhi should continue as interim president until elections are held. “Elections are yet to be held and Covid-19 hasn’t gone still. We can’t have 100 people together in one place. And yet, people are talking,” Kharge rued.  Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Siddaramaiah said he acknowledged Kharge’s pain over the state of affairs in the party. “Communalists are spreading throughout the country,” he said, attacking the BJP for “disrespecting” the Constitution.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/karnataka-congress-crisis-mallikarjun-kharge-attacks-leaders-for-weakening-party-917633.html
19-11-2020||Main Article||Constitutional Propriety: Remember the oath, Governor||Globally, the layered idea of ‘democracy’ has been in retreat, with simplistic questions abounding the procedures and subtilities that beset its functioning. Rise of uber-nationalistic politics has unleashed restlessness, impatience and aversion to the systemic checks and balances that accompany and often nuance the discourse to curb unconstitutional activism under the garb of speed and efficiency. The deliberate diminishment and enfeeblement of various restorative constitutional institutions is a byproduct of that misplaced enthusiasm that invariably weakens democracy and encourages authoritarian tendencies. India prides itself as the world’s largest democracy, but it is also recognised as a ‘flawed democracy’, as the Economist Intelligence Unit, under its Democracy Index ratings, puts it. Worse, India’s ratings have slipped a further 10 ranks in 2020 to a dismal 51st rank globally. Even the once model democratic culture of politics in the US has suffered due to the intolerant and dismissive era of the Trump tenure, which ensured that the US, too, got demoted from the status of ‘full democracy’ to a ‘flawed democracy’. Filling supposedly apolitical posts with incorrigibly and unapologetically partisan individuals has been the hallmark style of compromising democracy. While a certain degree of partisanship is natural, given the nomination process to constitutional bodies, yet the decay to overt-politicisation of domains like constitutional posts, judiciary, investigative agencies, etc., has been unprecedented in its brazenness. In the Indian experiment in democracy, the optics surrounding the role of Governors/Lt Governors of states and Union Territories has brought up similar concerns. All political parties have misused the gubernatorial offices by appointing loyalists who often insisted on retaining their partisan slant whilst in office and invoked convenient precedents or made controversial decisions, especially in the formation or dismal of state governments. The first gubernatorial dissonance occurred way back in 1957, when Governor Ramakrishna Rao locked horns with the Communist leader EMS Namboodiripad in Kerala and set the template for Delhi’s footprint in the states. History was to repeat itself ingloriously with some questionable decisions made by some gubernatorial appointees, but many more upheld the constitutional restraint. The essential veneer of apolitical civility and anchorage was broadly maintained, at least in the day-to-day functioning that essentially necessitated the maintenance of formal procedures, postures and language. Sadly, today, even those basics have surrendered to a competitive bid by some gubernatorial appointees to ingratiate themselves to ‘Delhi’. The political obsequiousness of some appointees has degenerated to unbelievable lows that openly manifests in the daily run-ins with the state governments and in the shockingly political diatribe. The silence of ‘Delhi’ in this melee of constitutional regression can be construed as tacit acceptance or even encouragement. Namoodiripad had then warned against the “office being used as a fifth-wheel in the constitutional set-up.” The Sarkaria Commission had acknowledged that some Governors were “unable to shed their political inclinations, predilections and prejudices while dealing with different political parties within the state. As a result, sometimes, the decisions they take in their discretion appear as partisan and intended to promote the interests of the ruling party in the Union government.” But today’s regression of gubernatorial politicisation is much deeper, with Centre-state disagreements predicated on dangerously creative interpretations of constitutional restraints that routinely sully the constitutional dignity and propriety of the office of the ‘conscience keeper.’ One recently demitted appointee from a North-Eastern state has made or supported provocative tweets like “boycott everything Kashmiri,” or on getting questioned about the “fighting spirit” of Hindus had incredulously stated, “one exception was Gujarat, 2002. I’m glad you appreciate what Hindus did then?” Today, his twitter handle bears the descriptor, “Unabashedly Right-wing Hindu socio-political activist, thinker, writer, ideologue. Former Governor.” But, perhaps, the most significant indiscretion of constitutional restraint was the mocking of ‘secularism’ by a Governor who asked the state’s Chief Minister if he had, “turned secular”? Beyond the violation of oath under Article 159 mandating that the Governor protects, preserves and defends the Constitution of India (irrespective of ideological difference of opinion with any of its elements), the cavalier way of expressing that violation in the form of a public letter suggests the impunity with which the morass of overt politicisation has set in. That the said ‘conscience keeper’ of a state should choose to express his angst by casually invoking the sacred, reconciliatory and reassuring tenet of ‘secularism’ is highly regrettable.  Already, the gubernatorial post is lazily attributed the notions of ‘rubber stamp’ appointees, ‘geriatric retirement homes’ and the refuge of ‘political has-beens’. However, given the tenuous federal relationships, socio-political polarisation and constitutional laxities, the role of the ‘conscience keeper’ cannot be overstated. The real issue today is not of too many ‘roadblocks’ to daily governance, but of inadequate checks and balances to ensure no abuse of electoral numbers. Democracy is not majoritarianism, and ensuring that crucial distinction between the two suppositions is the invaluable role of the Governor. As the world awakens to the debilitating after-effects of tinkering with democratic and constitutional traditions, a seemingly new dawn of restorative democratic sobriety is on the horizon from New Zealand to, now, even in the United States! Indian citizenry, too, must introspect and insist that those who hold such constitutional posts behave in a manner befitting constitutional correctness and restraint. The shining example of the late Somnath Chatterjee, the former Speaker of Lok Sabha, who chose to uphold the apolitical mandate of his constitutional post, illustrates the practical challenges. The lifelong Communist had refused to toe his party line on the UPA government’s trust vote and was, sadly, expelled.  Presciently, Chatterjee later suggested that all future Speakers should be required to resign from principal party membership to ensure non-partisan behaviour. Unfortunately, no such move was initiated, and many subsequent constitutional appointees failed to match up to the exacting standards of Chatterjee’s constitutionality. As the ‘first citizen’ of constitutional expectations, gubernatorial appointees, above all, must remain sensitive and restrained in expression and conduct.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/main-article/constitutional-propriety-remember-the-oath-governor-917334.html
19-11-2020||National||Biden stresses on 'democracy at home and abroad' during phone-call with Modi||With American President-elect Joe Biden indicating that “strengthening democracy at home and abroad” will be a priority for his administration’s engagement with India, New Delhi has started reaching out to the United States lawmakers, who earlier expressed concern over shutdowns imposed in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) last year. Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to each other over phone late on Tuesday. “The President-elect noted that he looks forward to working closely with the Prime Minister on shared global challenges, including containing Covid-19 and against future health crises, tackling the threat of climate change, launching the global economic recovery, strengthening democracy at home and abroad, and maintaining a secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific region,” according to a statement released by the office of Biden on Wednesday. The statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in New Delhi on Modi-Biden phone-call late on Tuesday had no mention of the discussion between the two leaders “on strengthening democracy at home and abroad”. Biden referred to “strengthening democracy at home and abroad” in talks with Modi amid speculation in New Delhi and Washington D.C. that the new regime in the White House might press the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government hard on issues of alleged violation of human rights and purported curbs on religious freedom in India. Biden pledged ahead of the election that his administration would make the US once again play its traditional role as a champion of human rights around the world. Taranjit Singh Sandhu, New Delhi’s envoy to Washington D.C., recently had a discussion over phone with US Senator, Chris Van Hollen, whom the Modi’s Government had last year denied permission to visit Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) after the erstwhile state was stripped off its special status and reorganized into two Union Territories. “Engaging conversation this afternoon with Senator @ChrisVanHollen on the partnerships for our 2 (two) democracies in vaccines, public health, clean energy, higher education and digital technologies,” Sandhu posted on Twitter on Tuesday. Hollen, who was born in Karachi and studied for a few years at Kodaikanal in Tamil Nadu, was among four American Senators, who in September 2019 wrote to the US President Donald Trump, expressing concern over the human rights situation in J&K and urging him to nudge New Delhi to ease restrictions, lift communication blackout and set free political leaders and activists detained in the wake of the Modi Government's August 5 decision on the erstwhile state. They noted that situation for people of J&K was turning more difficult with each passing day. They again wrote to US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, just before Trump’s visit to Ahmedabad and New Delhi expressing concern over “troubling actions taken by the current government” in New Delhi on J&K. Sandhu also spoke over phone to another American Senator, Chris Coons, who joined 13 others to ask President Donald Trump’s administration a couple of months back to implement the recommendation of the US Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) to designate India, along with some other nations, as a “Country of Particular Concern”. The USCIRF’s recommendation was based on what it believed as a “sharp downward turn” in religious freedom in India. Coons is one of the frontrunners for the office of the US Secretary of State in the Biden Administration. He had last year joined other US lawmakers to extend solidarity with India after the killing of 40 paramilitary personnel in a terror attack at Pulwama in J&K on February 14 last year. “Warm & (and) substantive conversation w/ (with) Senator @ChrisCoons on India-US partnership in furthering mutual interests & (and) meeting common challenges. Appreciated his commitment to deepening our collaborations in areas of clean energy, health, edu (education), bio and digital technologies,” tweeted India’s ambassador to the US. The Modi Government drew flak from some of the US lawmakers last year for detention of political leaders and activists, shutdowns and restrictions imposed in J&K. The US lawmakers also criticized the Bharatiya Janata Party’s government for the new Citizenship Amendment Act and process of updating the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. “We have to remind the Kashmiris that they are not alone in the world,” Biden’s Indian American running mate and the Vice-President-elect, Kamala Harris, said in October 2019, when she was still in the race for the Democratic Party’s nomination to contest the US presidential elections. She also criticized External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in December 2019, when he cancelled a meeting with a group of US lawmakers, because it included Pramila Jayapal, who introduced a bipartisan resolution in the American House of Representatives asking New Delhi to end restrictions on communication and arbitrary detentions in the J&K. Biden too not only argued in favour of asking New Delhi ahead of the elections to take all necessary measures to restore rights of all people in Kashmir, but also expressed disappointment over the CAA and the NRC.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/biden-stresses-on-democracy-at-home-and-abroad-during-phone-call-with-modi-917310.html

In an affidavit filed in the apex court, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has placed on record the November 4 order passed by it in the proceedings pertaining to the show-cause notice issued to the channel over the controversial programme. "After taking into consideration the written and oral submissions of the channel and the findings and recommendations of the IMC, the ministry is of the opinion that while freedom of speech and expression is a fundamental right, the tone and tenor of the episodes telecast do indicate that the channel has, through the various utterances and audio-visual content, breached the programme code. The ministry finds that they are not in good taste, offensive and has a likelihood of promoting communal attitude," the affidavit said. It further said the ministry has examined the four episodes, including the 13 video clips mentioned in the show-cause notice issued on September 23 to the channel. "The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, after examining all facts and circumstances of the case and balancing the fundamental rights of the broadcasters, hereby 'cautions' Sudarshan TV Channel Ltd to be careful in future. It is further directed that if any violation of the programme code is found in future, stricter penal action would be taken," it said. The ministry said the telecast of the remaining episodes of the programme would be subject to the order of the apex court in the pending matter. A bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud is scheduled to hear on Thursday the pleas that have raised objections on the "Bindas Bol" programme of Sudarshan TV. The apex court had earlier imposed a pre-telecast ban on the remaining episodes of the programme. On September 23, the Centre had informed the top court that it has prima facie found violations of the programme code by Sudarshan TV's "Bindas Bol" show and has issued a show-cause notice to the channel. Earlier, the top court had questioned Sudarshan TV officials over the programme, asking whether the media can be allowed to "target a whole set of communities". It had asked the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the National Broadcasters Association (NBA) to give suggestions for strengthening the "self-regulating mechanism" of the NBA for electronic media.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/episodes-of-sudarshan-tvs-bindas-bol-breached-programme-code-ib-ministry-to-sc-917350.html

Rao was shifted to the private hospital late Wednesday night, the official said. The High Court on Wednesday directed the authorities to shift 80-year-old poet from jail to Nanavati Hospital for 15 days, noting that Rao was almost on his deathbed. "He needs some treatment," the bench of Justices S S Shinde and Madhav Jamdar had said. "Can the state say no we will treat him in Taloja? We are only saying transfer him to Nanavati for two weeks. We will further see after two weeks," they had noted. They added that Rao should not be discharged from the hospital without informing the court, and that his family should be allowed to meet him at the hospital. "It goes without saying that the state will bear the expenses (of his hospital stay)," the bench had added. The next hearing in the case is scheduled on December 3.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/varavara-rao-shifted-to-private-hospital-from-taloja-jail-917395.html

The process of human rating is progressing well and is expected to be complete in the second half of next year, Isro Chairman K Sivan told the publication. The first unmanned mission was planned in December 2020, the second unmanned mission in June 2021. The final and the main component, the manned mission of Gaganyaan, was scheduled six months later in December 2021, much before the 2022 deadline. ISRO had earlier indicated that there would be a delay in several missions as the space body's work has been hit by disruptions due to the coronavirus pandemic. Among the major projects that have been affected are Chandrayaan-3 and Gaganyaan.

"It has transformed the lives of the poor and marginalised and the way the government functions," he said after inaugurating the three-day 23rd edition of the Bengaluru Tech Summit virtually. Noting that India had an advantage in innovation, the prime minister said it was time to deploy Indian-designed products for the world. "Technology is playing a key role in all the schemes. Crores of farmers receive monetary support at the click of a button. At the peak of the lockdown, it was technology that ensured that our poor received proper and quick assistance. The scale of this relief has few parallels," Modi said in his address. Thanks to digital technology, India has been able to scale up its delivery of services to people across the country. Even during the Covid-19 pandemic, the government has been able to help citizens through the Ayushman Bharat healthcare scheme, he said in his 20-minute speech. "The Internet came to this country about 25 years ago. Today, we have achieved a milestone of 750 million internet connections, more than half of that were added in the last four years," the prime minister said. Union IT and Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the new Data Protection Law will be finalised very soon that will enable India to transform into a data economy. "We will be providing optical fibre connection in all six lakh villages over the next 1,000 days. The work has already begun in this direction," he said. "The whole world is looking towards India. Achieving 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' is not to isolate from the world but to become a global supply chain hub for the whole world," the PM said. He further added that the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme will enable the companies to invest Rs 11 lakh crore in the next five years. Of this, Rs 7 lakh crore will be invested for producing goods for the export market. Nine of Apple's units have moved to India from China, he cited, adding that one of them has started production of iPhones at a factory in Bengaluru. Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, State Deputy Chief Minister CN Ashwath Narayan, State Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar and other dignitaries participated in the inaugural event.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bengaluru-tech-summit-2020-pm-modi-bats-for-local-tech-solutions-to-go-global-917411.html

It also asked the government to look at the situation with a "magnifying glass". Pulling up the Delhi government, a bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad asked why it waited till the court intervened to take steps such as reducing the number of people attending weddings to 50 to prevent the spread of Covid-19. "You (Delhi government) saw from November 1 which way the wind was blowing. But you turn turtle now because we asked you some questions. The bell should have rung loud and clear when the numbers were spiralling. Why did you not wake up when you saw the situation was deteriorating? "Why did we have to shake you out of your slumber on November 11? What did you do from November 1 till November 11? Why did you wait 18 days (till November 18) to take a decision. Do you know how many lives were lost during this period? Can you explain it to those who lost their near and dear ones," the bench asked. On implementation of social distancing norms, prevention of spitting and wearing of masks, the court was not satisfied with the monitoring being done by the Delhi government in some districts where Covid-19 numbers were high. The bench also said the fines being imposed -- Rs 500 for the first violation and Rs 1,000 for every subsequent violation -- did not appear to be a deterrent. It said there appeared to be a substantial disparity in monitoring and imposition of fines in certain districts as compared to others. "What kind of monitoring and marshalling are you doing? Look at the situation seriously with a magnifying glass. You have crossed cities like New York and Sao Paolo," the court said. The high court was hearing a PIL by advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking increase in the Covid-19 testing numbers in the national capital and getting speedy results.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/why-did-you-not-wake-up-high-court-raps-delhi-govt-over-worsening-covid-19-situation-917431.html

Also, the lockdown had an impact on many low-income group families whose mobile usage dipped resulting in a decline in subscription. However, I think that things would improve from September onwards as things get back to normal,” Neil Shah, vice president (research), Counterpoint Research, told the publication.  The data shows that wireless teledensity in the country during the period decreased to 84.38 at the end of June from 85.87 at the end of March.

The government also claimed it found various utterances and audio-visual content of the show "are not in good taste, offensive and has likelihood of promoting communal attitudes". Taking up a writ petition filed by Firoz Iqbal Khan for restraint order, a bench presided over by Justice D Y Chandrachud gave two weeks time to the parties to file their reply to the government's decision. The ministry, in an order passed on November 4, cautioned Sudarshan News that if any violation of the Programme Code is found in future, stricter penal action would be taken. After taking into account written and oral submissions of the channel, the Ministry, in the order, said that it is "of the opinion that while freedom of speech of expression is a fundamental right, the tone and tenor of the episodes telecast do indicate that the channel has, through various utterances and audio-visual content, breached the Programme Code". The ministry recommended the TV channel should review the content of the future episodes of the programme "Bindas Bol - UPSC Jihad", and the audio-visual content should be suitably moderated and modified. It has said the manner in which the channel has gone about its exposition, including its comments on the selection process, examination system of civil services, portrays one community and the UPSC in poor light, and the channel could have avoided it. The ministry said the issue of alleged terror links of Zakat Foundation, which was raised in the shows, and the alleged source of funding was a highly disputed matter of fact, which required a full investigation of evidence to adjudicate the veracity or falsity of the claim made in the programme. On October 5, the Centre had informed the Supreme Court that the Inter-Ministerial Committee, in its recommendation, has given certain additional recommendations in connection with channel's programme "UPSC Jihad".  It also said it is duty-bound to give one more opportunity to the news channel to make a representation in accordance with these recommendations. On September 23, the Centre had informed the Supreme Court it has prima facie found that the news channel programme with title UPSC Jihad has violated the Programme Code, and as a result, a detailed show-cause notice has been issued to the channel to explain why action should not be taken against it. The top court had, on September 15, passed on order injuncting the remaining episodes of the TV show, and the stay continues to remain in operation.  Four episodes of the planned 10 episodes have been broadcast so far.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-allows-parties-to-respond-to-governments-caution-to-sudarshan-tvs-programme-917441.html

During long cold nights, the Army and the Border Security Force (BSF) soldiers regularly patrol the LoC and the IB as it is the time when militants try and sneak in. They disregard the freezing temperatures, fog, and darkness to do their duty. “Inputs continue to flow that infiltration may see a rise and also present weather conditions are suitable for infiltration. But the BSF and other security agencies are ready and alert to foil any possible bids,” Director General of BSF, Rakesh Ashtana, told reporters on the sidelines of a sports event in Srinagar. He said the situation along the LoC and the IB is under control after the recent flare up in which six civilians and five soldiers lost their lives when Pakistani army resorted to unprovoked shelling along the Indian border posts and villages. “There is a situation and we are facing it bravely,” Ashtana said. A senior police officer involved in counter-insurgency operations in Kashmir said the summer months that have gone by did not bode well for the Pakistan-based militant groups. “Concerted infiltration bids in peak season were thwarted by the Army and the infiltration success rate was in decimals, if at all. At the same time security forces achieved major success in counter terrorist operations across the Valley. Now militant handlers across the border may try to take advantage of the current situation,” he said. With increasing number of ceasefire violations by Pakistan, infiltration attempts by the militants and chilly and foggy weather conditions, the soldiers can’t afford to lower their guard for a moment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/jk-security-forces-on-toes-to-foil-infiltration-attempts-in-foggy-weather-917458.html

The order, dated November 18, comes at a time when hospitals are again getting swamped with the infection spreading faster every single day, leading to an overwhelming number of deaths in the last several days. Delhi recorded 7,486 fresh Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the infection tally in the national capital to over 5 lakh, even as 133 new fatalities, the highest single-day death count till date, pushed the toll to 7943. As per the order, all Covid-19 hospitals of Delhi government have been allowed to "engage fourth and fifth-year MBBS students, interns and BDS doctors to assist duty doctors at an honorarium of Rs 1,000 (8 hours shift) and Rs 2,000 (12 hours shift) per day". In case of interns, the honorarium would be over and above their stipend, it said. RGSSH, a dedicated coronavirus facility under the Delhi government has 200 ICU beds with ventilators, all occupied, while at LNJP Hospital, another dedicated facility, only seven such beds out of the 200 were available at 12:30 pm, according to online Delhi Corona dashboard.

The JD(U) MLA from Tarapur in Munger, who was one of the five ministers from Nitish’s outfit, was in the eye of storm ever since he took oath. He was reportedly facing corruption cases for irregular appointments of assistant professors and junior scientists when he was earlier the Vice Chancellor of an agriculture university. Besides, the Opposition on Thursday posted a video which showed that “the Education Minister does not even know the national anthem.” Hugely embarrassed, Nitish summoned Mewalal before asking him to tender his resignation on Thursday. Mewalal is the same leader whom Nitish had thrown out of the party in 2017 after an FIR was registered against him for illegal appointments of assistant professors and junior scientists when he was the V-C of Bihar Agriculture University in Bhagalpur. Opposition leader Tejashwi Yadav said that Mewalal was booked under Section 409, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120 (B) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in 2017. “How and why such person, who has been facing such serious criminal charges, and is on bail, was made Bihar Education Minister... A video shows that he does not even know the national anthem,” averred the Opposition leader. Earlier in the day, the RJD posted a tweet in Hindi. “Bihar’s Education Minister, accused in several corruption cases, does not even know the national anthem. Nitish Kumar Ji, is there any shame left? Or, your conscience has sunk?” Congress leader Prem Chandra Mishra too joined the chorus gunning for Mewalal’s removal. “There were no serious charges against me. I was not even charge-sheeted. I will send legal notices to all those who have defamed me,” said Mewalal, who, incidentally, formally took charge as the minister on Thursday itself. However, Nitish deemed it fit to get rid of such tainted person as the Chief Minister has already been drawing flak for his other Cabinet colleagues too. Nitish has been criticised for appointing an Intermediate-educated Tarkishore Prasad as Finance Minister and Renu Devi, a Class XII passout, as Industry Minister. Incidentally, both are Bihar’s Deputy Chief Ministers from the BJP quota, and Nitish presumably has no say in choosing his ministerial colleagues this time.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bihar-education-minister-mewalal-choudhary-resigns-amid-corruption-charges-917475.html

Emphasising that there is a need to request both the union and state governments to enhance spending on health, he said the Covid-19 experience will justify an increase in expenditure on health sector. "India's overall spending on the health sector is low. It has been coming from constrained resources... many many competing priorities. It is low and must be corrected," he said while addressing a virtual event organised by industry body CII. In 2018-19, India's spending on health sector was 1.5 per cent of GDP, somewhat an improvement over the last decade, Paul said. While noting that "definitely expenditure of 1.5 per cent  of GDP on health is not acceptable, not good", he pointed out that in European countries, spending on the health sector is 7-8 per cent of GDP.  Citing the National Health Mission (NHM) document, Paul said India's expenditure on the health sector should be to the tune of 3 per cent by 2025. "We all need to request both the union and state governments' to enhance the expenditure on health," he said, adding that post Covid-19, there will be a way to increase healthcare sector infrastructure. Paul is also a key official in coordinating the central government's efforts to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Further, Paul said that the government may target the primary healthcare sector and the private sector should focus on the secondary and tertiary healthcare sector. "In secondary and tertiary healthcare, there is a huge scope for expansion," he noted. In the last six years, Paul said there was a 45 per cent increase in the number of medical colleges., a 48 per cent increase in the number of under graduate medical seats and a 79 per cent increase in post graduate medical seats. As many as 114 new government hospitals will come up in the next three years, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-overall-spending-on-health-sector-low-says-niti-aayog-member-v-k-paul-917487.html

"I'm very keen to promote India as a very big centre of the data economy. Data is going to drive the digital economy. It is also going to drive international commerce," he said. Addressing the Bengaluru Tech Summit, 2020 (BTS2020) virtually, he said India produces huge data and the digital ecosystem, like mobile phones and Aadhaar, is producing data. "We are going to finalise a data protection law very soon. India is waiting for its movement for data economy, data innovation, data refinery. I would urge the Chief Minister (of Karnataka) to ensure that the state becomes a great centre of India's data economy," he added. Organised by the Karnataka government, along with Karnataka Innovation and Technology Society, the state government's Vision Group on Information Technology, Biotechnology & StartUp and Software Technology Parks of India, the summit, that saw the inaugural address by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is scheduled to take place from November 19 to 21. Prasad said that even during the pandemic the communications sector witnessed a growth of over seven per cent and also received significant investments from major global companies. "It is a challenging time and we decided to convert it into an opportunity. The global manufacturing world was looking towards alternative destinations. In view of India's enormous success in mobile manufacturing, we came up with a big idea of production linked incentive," he said. Prasad said major global companies, including from India, have committed to invest close to Rs 11 lakh crore in the next five years and proposed to manufacture mobiles and components, out of which Rs seven lakh crore would be only for exports. Addressing Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, Prasad said he wanted to give him some very good information, which was that during the Covid-19 pandemic, the government has got Apple to shift nine of their operating units, along with components, from China to India. "In your city of Bengaluru, the Apple company has started production to manufacture its quality phones for India and also for abroad for exports," he said. Prasad noted that the summit was taking place in very challenging times and the Covid-19 pandemic created a lot of problems, but said the digital ecosystem gave the opportunity. "Also now we have made the regulations very clear that not only work from home, work from anywhere to promote the cause of gig economy in India in which Bengaluru again has to play a crucial role. He also said that the approach to Artificial Intelligence is that it should lead to inclusion and empowerment of ordinary Indians. "I must also emphasise that AI should respect the ethical and cultural values of India," he said. Prasad lauded the "steller role" played by Bengaluru in propelling India's IT story on the global stage. "Looking into this department for the last close to six years, whenever I analyse the growth of India's IT road map, I always see that Bengaluru coming with shining colours," the Minister said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/will-finalise-data-protection-law-very-soon-ravi-shankar-prasad-917490.html

Announcing the decision, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the selection of candidates will be made by the Medical Council Committee (MCC) through online application on the basis of rank obtained in the NEET-2020 conducted by the National Testing Agency. Central pool MBBS seats will be allocated for selection and nominations of the candidates from amongst the wards of Covid-19 warriors, who have lost their lives due to Covid-19 or died accidently on account of Covid-19 related duty. This will be done by introducing a new category called ‘Wards of Covid-19 Warriors’ in the guidelines for selection and nomination of candidates against central pool seats. The state or union territory governments will certify the eligibility of a candidate seeking admission through this category. He said this is aimed at "dignifying and honouring the noble contribution made by the Covid-19 warriors in treatment and management" of Covid-19 patients. “This will honour the solemn sacrifice of all Covid-19 warriors who served with selfless dedication for the cause of duty and humanity”, he added. The definition of a Covid-19 warrior was been laid down by the Centre while announcing the insurance package of Rs 50 lakh for them, he said. "Covid-19 warriors are all public healthcare providers including community health workers, who may have to be in direct contact and care of Covid-19 patients and who may be at risk of being impacted by this," he said citing the definition. "Private hospital staff and retired/volunteer/local urban bodies/contracted/daily wage/ad-hoc/ outsourced staff requisitioned by States/Central hospitals/autonomous hospitals of Central/States/UTs, AIIMS and Institutes of National Importance (INIs)/hospitals of Central Ministries drafted for Covid-19 related responsibilities are all included," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/five-mbbs-seats-under-central-pool-reserved-for-children-of-covid-19-warriors-917492.html

As the country added 45,576 new cases, the Centre rushed teams to Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Manipur to visit districts with a high number of Covid-19 cases and support the state's efforts towards strengthening containment, surveillance, testing and efficient clinical management of positive cases.  The decision to send teams to Rajasthan and Haryana came following the surge in daily cases in Delhi -- which reported the highest number of cases in the country on Wednesday -- and its spillover effect being observed in these states. AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria will head the team to Haryana while NITI Ayog member Dr VK Paul will lead the team to Rajasthan. NCDC Director SK Singh and Additional Director General (DGHS) Dr Swastcharan will lead the teams to Gujarat and Manipur respectively. According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 45,576 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours while the recoveries registered was 48,493, resulting in a net reduction of 2,917 cases from the active caseload. "India’s active caseload has fallen under the 5% mark on Thursday. This trend of more daily recoveries than the daily cases has led to a continuous contraction of India’s Active Caseload. It has ensured that India’s present active caseload of 4,43,303 consists of just 4.95% of India’s Total Positive Cases," the Ministry said. New recoveries outnumbering the daily new cases every 24-hour cycle has also improved the recovery rate to 93.58%. The total recovered cases stand at 83,83,602 while the gap between recovered cases and active cases is steadily increasing and presently stands at 79,40,299. Ten states -- Delhi, Kerala, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu -- account for 77.28% of the fresh cases in the country. Delhi reported 7,486 cases, Kerala recorded 6,419 new cases while Maharashtra registered 5,011 new cases. When it comes to recoveries, these ten states again top the list accounting for 77.27% of the total discharges. With 7,066 persons recovering from Covid-19 Kerala saw the most number of recoveries. Delhi registered another 6,901 daily recoveries while Maharashtra reported 6,608 new recoveries. Of the 585 new fatalities reported in the past 24 hours, 79.49% have been from ten states. Delhi accounted for 22.39% or 131 deaths followed by Maharashtra (100) and West Bengal (54).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-77-daily-cases-deaths-reported-from-10-states-centre-sends-teams-to-four-states-917493.html

Twitter India representatives deposed before the Joint Committee of Parliament on Data Protection Bill on Thursday. The panel sought a reply from Twitter within seven days. "It is shameful that Twitter is allowing its platform for obscene remarks like the one by stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra against the Supreme Court and the CJI," Lekhi told reporters in Delhi. "Twitter is allowing its platform to be misused for abusing top constitutional authorities, such as Supreme Court and CJI," she added. She said that members of the committee across the political spectrum, including Congress MP Vivek Tankha, BSP MP Ritesh Pandey and BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab, grilled Twitter representatives on this issue. Lekhi also said that the explanation of Twitter about banning accounts and deleting tweets was found to be inadequate. Earlier, Attorney General K K Venugopal gave consent to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against Kamra for a series of tweets posted after the apex court gave interim bail to Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami. Several lawyers filed complaints against Kamra. Kamra had refused to retract his controversial tweets against the Supreme Court or apologise for them, saying that he believes they "speak for themselves".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/parliamentary-panel-grills-twitter-over-obscene-tweets-by-kunal-kamra-targeting-sc-cji-917494.html
19-11-2020||National||Confident that Covid-19 vaccine will be ready in 3-4 months, says Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan||Noting that it is natural to prioritise the Covid-19 vaccine distribution process, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Thursday said healthcare workers and people aged above 65 years will be given coronavirus vaccine on priority. Addressing the FICCI FLO's National Webinar on 'The Shifting Healthcare Paradigm During and Post-Covid', Vardhan said coronavirus vaccine will be available in a couple of months and it is estimated that by July-August, 400-500 million vaccine doses will be made available for 25-30 crore people. "I am confident that the Covid-19 vaccine will be ready in the next three-four months," he said. "It is natural that the vaccine distribution would have to be prioritised. As you know the healthcare workers who are corona warriors will be prioritised, then people who are above 65 years of age, they have been prioritised and then those from 50-65 years of age have been prioritised. Then those below 50 years who have other diseases," he said. Vardhan said everything is being decided by experts with a scientific point of view. "We have made a very detailed meticulous plan on this," he said.  "What we would have to do in March-April next year, we have started planning for it from now only," Vardhan said. The minister said, "We have also initiated an integrated response system against Covid-19 and will also host clinical trials for all the major vaccines. About 20 vaccines are in different stages of development." He said about 90-99 per cent tackling of Covid-19 is only through protecting and motivating others. "You can protect yourself from this deadly virus with small precautions like wearing a good quality mask properly, maintaining social distance and taking care of hand-hygiene," he noted. The phase-3 trial of the Oxford vaccine of the Serum Institute is almost near completion, while the phase-3 clinical trial of the indigenously-developed vaccine candidate of the Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has already started.  Dr Reddy's Laboratories will also soon start the combined phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the Russian Covid-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, in India.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/confident-that-covid-19-vaccine-will-be-ready-in-3-4-months-says-union-health-minister-dr-harsh-vardhan-917496.html

Kumar, in the legal notice sent through law firm I C Legal on November 17, said Rashid Siddiquee, in his YouTube channel FF News, has uploaded several defamatory, libelous and derogatory videos against him. The Bollywood superstar has sough an unconditional apology from the YouTuber, who has been booked by the Mumbai police in a separate defamation case, and also removal of objectionable videos from his channel. Our client (Kumar) states that because of your (Siddiquee's) scandalous, defamatory and derogatory videos, he has suffered mental trauma agony and huge loss, including loss of reputation and goodwill, which our client quantifies at Rs 500 crore, the notice said. The said videos make several false and baseless allegations against our client (Kumar) that he helped (actress) Rhea Chakraborty abscond to Canada, that our client had secret meetings with (Maharashtra minister) Aaditya Thackeray and the Mumbai police Commissioner to discuss the death case of Sushant Singh Rajput and so on, it said. Rashid Siddiquee allegedly made Rs 15 lakh by way of the false videos, reports said. "These videos are false, baseless, defamatory and have been intentionally published to mislead the public and is just a cheap publicity stunt," the law firm said in the notice. Our client is indignant and absolutely outraged at the public embarrassment, discomfort and anxiety he had to face because of these false, scandalous and derogatory videos, the notice said. The superstar has asked Siddiquee to publish an unconditional apology, take down all the videos where references have been made regarding him and desist from uploading such clips in the future. The notice said if Siddiquee fails to respond to the notice within a period of three days, the actor would initiate legal proceedings against him. The Mumbai police have separately filed a case against Siddiquee on charges of defamation, public mischief and intentional insult for his posts against the city police, Maharashtra government and minister Aaditya Thackeray. Siddiquee was on November 3 granted anticipatory bail in the case by a Mumbai court, which directed him to cooperate in the probe. Rajput was found dead in his suburban Bandra apartment on June 14.

19-11-2020||National||SC asks RBI to respond to relief sought by power producers||The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the RBI to reply on loan relief sought by the power producers body, as they claimed while moratorium applied on the principal loan, banks were taking coercive steps on other aspects such as guarantees.  A bench presided over by Justice Ashok Bhushan sought a response from the RBI as senior advocate A M Singhvi called it as "subterfuge happening" by banks.  The court, however, disposed of a plea by Gajendra Sharma related to charging of interest following the relief announced by the government during the six-month moratorium on loan announced due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Appearing for the Centre, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for his part, told the court that Rs 5,270 crore has been credited to 13.12 crore accounts in the interest waiver plan so far. The Centre has subsidised compound interest for all loans up to Rs 2 crore.  He also said that pre-Covid defaulters cannot benefit from a fresh resolution framework and the committee for resolution framework for Covid-related stress has assessed various sectors. Mehta also said it was the responsibility of the banks to credit compound interest waiver for loans up to Rs 2 crore, not for consumers to remind the banks of this scheme. Among other measures, he said that the IBC process has already been suspended since March to stop companies from slipping into bankruptcy.  During the hearing, the bench said that credit card users should not be given any benefit of compound interest waiver, as they are not borrowers. The bench said the credit card users don't have a loan, instead they are purchasing. Mehta referred to the Kamath Committee's report on restructuring of big loans, and submitted that a separate mechanism for restructuring small loans by lending institutions is already there. The court put the matter for further consideration next week.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-asks-rbi-to-respond-to-relief-sought-by-power-producers-917533.html

Here is the top news of November 19, 2020: Mumbai terror attack mastermind and Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed was on Thursday sentenced to 10 years in jail by an anti-terrorism court in Pakistan in two more terror cases. Saeed, a UN designated terrorist whom the US has placed a USD 10 million bounty on, was arrested on July 17 last year in the terror financing cases. He was sentenced to 11 years in jail by an anti-terrorism court in February this year in two terror financing cases. He is lodged at the Lahore's high-security Kot Lakhpat jail.   Four freshly infiltrated militants, believed to be affiliated with Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed outfit, were killed in an encounter with security forces on the outskirts of Jammu, on Srinagar-Jammu national highway, on Thursday morning. Two policemen were also injured after the militants opened fire at the security team when the truck, on way to Kashmir, was stopped at around 4.45 am for a security check at Ban toll plaza near Nagrota, police said. The group of terrorists onboard a truck was on its way to Kashmir valley.   Noting that it is natural to prioritise the Covid-19 vaccine distribution process, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Thursday said healthcare workers and people aged above 65 years will be given coronavirus vaccine on priority. Addressing the FICCI FLO's National Webinar on 'The Shifting Healthcare Paradigm During and Post-Covid', Vardhan said coronavirus vaccine will be available in a couple of months and it is estimated that by July-August, 400-500 million vaccine doses will be made available for 25-30 crore people.   A parliamentary committee questioned Twitter on Thursday over the recent "obscene" tweets by stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra targeting the Supreme Court and the chief justice of India (CJI), and sought reply from the social media giant over the matter within seven days, said the panel's chairperson Meenakshi Lekhi. This came close on the heels of Twitter apologising in writing to the same parliamentary panel for wrongly showing Ladakh in China and promising to correct the error by the month-end. Twitter India representatives deposed before the Joint Committee of Parliament on Data Protection Bill on Thursday.   With the Congress facing an unresolved leadership crisis, party veteran Mallikarjun Kharge on Thursday lashed out at his colleagues for “weakening the party from within” and questioned their credibility as leaders. “I am pained by the way some senior leaders have spoken about the party and our leader,” Kharge said during an event to mark the birthday of former prime minister Indira Gandhi. “On one hand, we have the BJP-RSS on our back. On the other hand, we have internal rumblings. We can’t go forward if we have people weakening the party from within. If our ideology weakens, we will be destroyed,” he said.   Three days after being sworn in as Bihar’s Education Minister, Mewalal Choudhary resigned on Thursday. The JD(U) MLA from Tarapur in Munger, who was one of the five ministers from Nitish’s outfit, was in the eye of storm ever since he took oath. He was reportedly facing corruption cases for irregular appointments of assistant professors and junior scientists when he was earlier the Vice Chancellor of an agriculture university. Besides, the Opposition on Thursday posted a video which showed that “the Education Minister does not even know the national anthem.” Hugely embarrassed, Nitish summoned Mewalal before asking him to tender his resignation on Thursday.   The Karnataka government said on Thursday it is aiming to mould the state into a $300 billion digital economy in the next five years. It is also targeting to garner 50 per cent market share of India's bio-economy (biotechnology-economy) by 2025. "One of the key goals of the State is to achieve 50 per cent market share of the national bio-economy target of 100 billion US dollars by the year 2025 and necessary steps have already been taken," Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa said at Bengaluru Tech Summit, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.   Source: DHNS/PTI||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-hafiz-saeed-jailed-for-10-years-bihar-education-minister-mewalal-choudhary-resigns-917542.html

Bartels, a friend of Agisilaos Demetriades, brother of actor Arjun Rampal's partner Gabriella, was arrested on November 12. The NCB, which is probing alleged drug use in Bollywood following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, had questioned Rampal earlier this month. The special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act court observed that there was no "substantial material" against Bartels. Senior counsel Aabad Ponda and advocate Subhash Jadhav who appeared for Bartels argued that the NCB did not find anything incriminating in its search at his residence here on November 11. Bartels, employed as an engineering manager with an international construction contractor, was accused of being part of a conspiracy to procure drugs alongwith Agisilaos Demetriades. Judge H S Satbhai noted in the order that accusations against Bartels were said to be based on the statements of co-accused Agisilaos and Nikhil Saldanha, and certain messages exchanged between the accused persons. "From the said messages, it is tried to contend that the accused (Bartels) is dealing in drugs....But at this stage, those messages are not substantial and sufficient to hold the role of the accused as a peddler/supplier of drugs," the court said. The NCB after arresting Bartels did not seek his custody when he was produced before the magistrate, it noted. "It goes to show that there was no material available with the NCB to interrogate the accused and to make further investigation," the bail order said. The court also noted that the maximum punishment under the NDPS Act sections under which Bartels was booked is only one year, and the co-accused are already released on bail. "In absence of any substantial material, taking into account the fact that no contraband material was found/ recovered from the accused and except the statements of the co-accused and messages, there is no substantial material to treat the accused as a peddler/ supplier of drugs, it may not be justified to refuse bail," the court said. The court directed Bartels to furnish a bond of Rs one lakh and surrender his passport to the NCB. He shall not leave Mumbai and shall attend NCB office twice a month, it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bollywood-drug-use-case-australian-national-gets-bail-917575.html

Addressing the meeting, Sharma said that this year witnessed an "unprecedented challenge of unregulated toxic content" by some channels who were not NBA members. "NBA believes in editorial standards ensuring objectivity, neutrality, fairness and accuracy in reporting. We have appealed to the advertisers not to support toxic content and sensationalism that promotes hate. I am happy to share that reputed brands have come forward and supported our stand," he said. Referring to the TRP scam, he said NBA has been highlighting its concerns about the veracity of TV viewership data, which have been prone to irrational fluctuations. "The lid was blown with the recent revelations by Mumbai Police relating to tampering of meters installed in panel homes by BARC. This has led to BARC suspending the weekly individual ratings for all news channels for 12 weeks," he said. He urged NBA members during this 12-week period to take all necessary steps to improve the content of their channels and "move away from the tyranny of ratings" and ensure that independent self-regulatory model adopted by news broadcasters is vigorously supported and its decisions adhered to by all of them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rajat-sharma-re-elected-as-president-of-news-broadcasters-association-917579.html

A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to file counter affidavit within a week on the plea against the August 21 order of the high court. The apex court asked Mehta whether there are any guidelines in this regard by the Ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy). The solicitor general said that he would place on record the guidelines on this aspect. “As prayed, one week time is granted. List after a week,” the bench said in its order. During the hearing, the bench, also comprising Justices R S Reddy and M R Shah, said, “Everybody can’t be allowed to prescribe medicines,” and “It may be used as immunity booster but not for treatment.” The high court had passed the order on a plea which had sought a direction to the state authority to ensure that homoeopathic practitioners are immediately allowed to perform in accordance with the March 6 notification of the Ministry of AYUSH, which had said that state government shall take steps to adopt homoeopathic system among other systems of medicines in the fight against the menace of coronavirus. “Advisory of the Ministry of AYUSH is being followed by the government and tablets are given free of cost to those persons as immunity boosters. As per the state medical protocol, Covid-19 affected persons should not be treated by anybody other than the government and those authorised by the government,” the high court had noted in its order. The high court had further noted that as per the medical protocol of the government, doctors practising in AYUSH medicines are not supposed to prescribe any medicines stating that it is curative for Covid-19 disease. “However, as per the advisory, there is nothing prohibiting the qualified medical AYUSH practitioners to prescribe immunity booster mixture or tablets, as suggested by the Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India, New Delhi,” it had said. “When the Central as well as State Governments have approved prescription of certain mixtures and tablets, as immunity boosters, qualified medical practitioners in AYUSH can also prescribe the same, but only as immunity boosters,” the high court had noted in its order.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/everybody-can-t-be-allowed-to-prescribe-medicines-says-supreme-court-917580.html

19-11-2020||National||India says objective of its talks with China is complete disengagement of troops along LAC||India on Thursday stated that the objective of its engagement with China was to ensure “complete disengagement” of troops from the face-off points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) – the de facto boundary between the two nations in eastern Ladakh. New Delhi stressed on “complete disengagement” of troops as the objective for India-China talks, amid reports that the communist country’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of late is not only reinforced and fortified its positions, but is also building roads on the northern bank of Pangong Tso (lake), instead of preparing to pull back its soldiers from the face-off scenes. “The objective of these discussions (between diplomats and senior military commanders of India and China) is to ensure complete disengagement and full restoration of peace and tranquillity along the LAC in the western sector,” Anurag Srivastava, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), told journalist during a briefing on Thursday. He was replying to a query on New Delhi’s view on the reports about Chinese PLA building defence structures fortifying its forward positions in the northern bank of Pangong Tso as well as the other face-off scenes along the LAC. The reports about the PLA’s move to fortify its positions came even as the senior military commanders of India and China were discussing a disengagement plan, beginning with the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso. The plan could not be implemented yet as the Indian Army turned down the Chinese PLA’s proposal for creating a moratorium on patrolling between Finger 3 and Finger 8 on the northern bank of the lake. Srivastava said that the discussion between the senior military commanders of India and China during the eighth round of talks on November 6 were “candid, in-depth and constructive” with both sides exchanging views on disengagement at all friction points along the LAC in the western sector of the India-China border areas. “We will continue our dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels and have also agreed to have another round of talks soon with a view to achieve this objective,” said the MEA spokesperson.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-says-objective-of-its-talks-with-china-is-complete-disengagement-of-troops-along-lac-917600.html

TRS Working President and state Municipal Administration Minister K T Rama Rao accused the Modi government of not releasing any funds to the state to provide assistance to the victims of recent heavy rains and deluge in the city. The BJP hit back, slamming Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao for hurling "chaiwala" barb against Prime Minister Narendra Modi over privatisation of railways. With the announcement of the elections to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation on December 1, the TRS has stepped up its attack on the BJP, which recently upset the ruling party by bagging the Dubbak assembly seat in a bypoll. Rama Rao, son of the chief minister, dared BJP leaders to list out what the NDA government at the Centre has done for Hyderabad during the last six years. Addresssing a Meet the Press programme here, he alleged the BJP only talked about "Hindu-Muslim", "MIM-TRS" and "India-Pakistan". While Telangana people paid Rs 2.72 lakh crore by way of taxes to the Centre inthe last six years, the state received only Rs 1.40 lakh crore through Central devolution, he said. He was responding to claims of BJP leaders that the Rs 67,000 crore development works by the TRS government in Hyderabad had been carried out with the help of the Centre. Rama Rao also claimed that the country's economy was now faced with a recession, preceded by a slowdown for eight consecutive quarters prior to the Covid-19 lockdown. "Eight consecutive quarters of slowdown has led into a lockdown which has now led into a recession. That's a fact. They may call it an act of God. I would call it an act of fraud, absolute fraud. What they have done, what they have perpetrated on this country, is an act of fraud, without a question," he said. The TRS leader said he would leave the matter to the party chief (Chandrashekar Rao) when asked if the latter's comments of convening a conclave of opposition parties against the disinvestment and "anti-farmer" farmer policies of the NDA government would materialise or if it was just a knee-jerk reaction to TRS' loss to BJP in Dubbak bypoll. He said the voters should decide whether they wanted "divisive politics" or "decisive politics". Claiming that that some were trying to sow the seeds of animosities in the state, he asserted that the TRS government would put down with an iron hand any attempts to hurt the brand image of the city. State BJP president and MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar took exception to the Chief Minister's comments on Wednesday that Modi who described himself as a 'chaiwala' was now selling the railway station (privatisation of railways). "It is shameful that the Chief Minister talks about PM, a great person who is making efforts to build India as a strong nation, in an insulting way. Shameless chief minister," he said at a party meeting. Rao who 'thinks' about 30 crore Muslims in the country was supporting AIMIM and trying to 'handover' Hyderabad to the latter, Kumar claimed. "Is he bothered about the Hindus in Telangana?" he asked. Finding fault with the disinvestment and "anti-farmer" policies of the NDA government, Rao on Wednesday said he would soon convene a conclave of opposition parties in Hyderabad to fight against the Modi regime||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hyderabad-civic-polls-trs-bjp-engage-in-war-of-words-917617.html

Chaudhary was in Rajasthan to address election meetings in rural areas of the Chauhtan assembly constituency in support of party candidates for the upcoming zila parishad and panchayat samiti polls. Attacking the Congress, he said the party’s motive only is to “divide and rule and move ahead”. "Congress is not interested in development and change the fate of the common man. It does politics of vote-bank and appeasement only. Its only job is to do manipulative politics," the Union minister of state for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare alleged.

Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava asserted that Gilgit-Baltistan was an integral part of India since 1947. Asked at an online briefing about elections held in Gilgit-Baltistan and protests against the poll process there, he said, "I had given a few answers before the elections. Elections in Gilgit-Baltistan are nothing but a sham and their aim is to hide Pakistan's illegal occupation of areas of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir." "We reiterate that along with Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan is an integral part of India since 1947," Srivastava said. India had earlier also slammed Pakistan for its decision to hold elections in Gilgit-Baltistan and said any action to alter the status of the militarily-occupied region has no legal basis. To a question on the Kulbhushan Jadhav case, Srivastava said Pakistan has failed to provide an environment in which the allegations against him can be seriously and effectively challenged. "We had asked Pakistan to allow Queen's Counsel for Jadhav. The International Court of Justice had pronounced judgment on Kulbhushan Jadhav in July 2019, but Pakistan has not made available to us all documents related to the case till now," Srivastava said. The ICJ judgment should be implemented fully, he asserted. In 2017, India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence handed to him by a military court. The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an "effective review and reconsideration" of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay. India has slammed Pakistan for adopting a "farcical" approach in denying available legal remedies to Jadhav against his death sentence in contravention of the ICJ order. The retired Indian Navy officer, Jadhav, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017. On another question as to who will represent India at the International conference on humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan in Geneva next week, Srivastava on Thursday said External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will represent India at the conference which will be held in the virtual format.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-slams-pak-says-polls-in-gilgit-baltistan-aimed-at-hiding-illegal-occupation-of-territory-917646.html

However, sources close to Kapil Sibal told the news outlet that Chowdhury and other leaders were not aware that most of the G-23 leaders were not on the list of the party campaigners for Bihar and none of them could even go to campaign unless the party officially requested them. G-23 was a reference to the 23 senior Congress leaders who had written to party chief Sonia Gandhi in August, giving suggestions on ways to revive the grand old party. There have been demands from a section of the Congress for a review of its Bihar poll performance.

On the other hand, we have internal rumblings. We can’t go forward if we have people weakening the party from within. If our ideology weakens, we will be destroyed,” he said. Kharge’s comments are seen as his rebuke of the latest leadership crisis in the Congress after the party’s dismal performance in the recent Bihar elections. “There’s an old adage that the true colours of our friends can be measured during a defeat and that of our family during illness. Now, we have both defeat and illness, so we will know who’s with us and who’s not,” Kharge, a Gandhi family loyalist lamented. The former Union minister questioned the credibility of leaders who are targeting the Congress high command. “They can't even produce corporators in their areas,” he said. “Everybody will praise the party when everything's nice. But when an election is lost, Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi are blamed,” he said. “But every state has its own leaders and 90% of the tickets are given based on their advice. Today, leaders complain that nobody listens to them.” Kharge pointed out that it was the decision of the Congress Working Committee that Sonia Gandhi should continue as interim president until elections are held. “Elections are yet to be held and Covid-19 hasn’t gone still. We can’t have 100 people together in one place. And yet, people are talking,” Kharge rued. Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Siddaramaiah said that he acknowledged Kharge’s pain over the state of affairs in the party. “Communalists are spreading throughout the country. Perhaps, we are failing to convince people. I don’t know if we’re failing in convincing party workers also,” he said, attacking the BJP for “disrespecting” the Constitution.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-crisis-mallikarjun-kharge-attacks-fellow-leaders-for-weakening-party-structure-917481.html

Shelar's remarks came in the backdrop of Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut's reported critical comments on the flag of the BJP, a former ally of the Uddhav Thackeray-led party which joined hands with the the NCP and the Congress to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in November last year. Talking to the media here, Shelar said, "The working pattern of the Shiv Sena is not democratic and their mentality is like British. Hence, they can see only Union Jack. "The flag of the Shiv Sena needs purification as they have left the agenda of Hindutva." Shelar was here to campaign for BJP candidate Shirish Boralkar, who is contesting the December 1 legislative council election from the graduates' constituency in the Aurangabad division. Talking about the 2022 elections to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation(BMC), now ruled by the Shiv Sena, the BJP leader exuded confidence about his party winning the polls. "We will win the elections in Mumbai (BMC). Last time (in 2017), the Shiv Sena's seat tally came down to double digits from 110 (in 2012). "But the BJP's seat tally increased from 31 to 84 in last elections. We will win the elections for development of Mumbai," the former state minister said. Asked about Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat's reported statement on allocation of development funds to Congress MLAs, Shelar said the MVA constituent is not getting respect in the Shiv Sena-led ruling coalition. Thorat is also the Maharashtra Congress president. "Congress ministers are not only struggling for funds, they are not even given proper respect in this government. They have to wait for long to meet the chief minister," the BJP leader said. Asked about the BJP's support to the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena over the issue of "inflated" power bills, Shelar said, "The state government has fooled electricity consumers and has not given them any relief." "The MNS has undertaken an agitation (over issue of (inflated power bills) and we have supported them. "This should not be seen in context of upcoming local governing body elections in Mumbai or elsewhere," the BJP leader said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/shiv-senas-saffron-flag-needs-purification-bjps-ashish-shelar-917561.html

The district’s Sihani Gate police also claimed that accused Jitendra has confessed that he along with MLA’s elder brother Girish Tyagi hatched the conspiracy to eliminate the lawmaker's maternal uncle Naresh Tyagi out of political rivalry in the family. Deputy Superintendent of Police Avnish Kumar said the police are further investigating the case and verifying the veracity of Jitendra’s confession. The DySP said MLA’s maternal uncle was killed on October 9 during his morning walk in a park at Officers' Colony in Lohiya Nagar of the city. He added that accused Jitendra told police that as per the murder plan, contract killers were hired to kill Naresh on October 9. The DySP said Jitendra also told police that to create an alibi that they were not in the place where the crime occurred, he and Girish left for Lucknow on October 7. DySP further quoted Jitendra as saying that when he along with Girish returned to Ghaziabad and came to know of the murder, they got worried and went underground, frequently changing their hideouts, besides having switched off their mobile phones. Jitendra also told police that owing to his involvement in his maternal uncle’s murder, Girish did not even attend Naresh Tyagi’s funeral, said DySP Kumar, adding the police are still verifying Jitendra’s confessions. In a press conference on Tuesday night at his residence, MLA Ajit Pal Tyagi had accused police of trying to implicate innocent persons in the murder case, lamenting that the police have not been able to gather any solid evidence against the sharpshooters who allegedly gunned down his maternal uncle. He added that he would not let any innocent person be framed falsely in this case. On the other hand, MLA Tyagi’s father and former UP cabinet minister Rajpal Tyagi on November 9 had alleged that his MLA son wanted to falsely implicate his elder brother Girish Tyagi in the murder case of his maternal uncle Naresh Tyagi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ghaziabad-police-claim-to-have-solved-murder-case-of-bjp-mla-s-kin-one-held-917325.html

Two policemen were also injured after the militants opened fire at the security team when the truck, on way to Kashmir, was stopped at around 4.45 am for a security check at Ban toll plaza near Nagrota, police said. The group of terrorists onboard a truck was on its way to Kashmir valley. Inspector General Police (IGP), Jammu, Mukesh Singh said the truck driver took advantage of darkness  and fled from the spot while security forces recovered a large quantity of arms and ammunition, including 11 AK-47 rifles, three pistols and 29 grenades. “As the truck was stopped for search, the driver stepped out and fled. During the search of the vehicle, the hidden militants opened a heavy volume of fire that met with retaliation, in which all four militants were killed,” he said and added the encounter lasted for three hours. The IGP said that it was a newly infiltrated group of four militants and given the quantity of weapons recovered from them, it seems they were “planning something very big.” “It's possible that they were planning a big attack. It's possible that they were targeting the DDC (District Development Council) election. However, we're investigating,” he said and added that this was t he largest seizure of weapons in the recent past, Earlier, J&K police chief Dilbagh Singh said the group had infiltrated into India through the International Border in Samba on Wednesday night.  The incident happened just nine days ahead of the first phase of first ever DDC polls in the union territory. The DDC elections are being held from November 28 to December 22 and the Centre has rushed 25,000 additional paramilitary troops to thwart any possible attacks by militants. Earlier on January 31, three Pakistani militants affiliated with the Jaish, travelling in a truck towards Srinagar were killed in a similar encounter at the same place. In November 2016, seven soldiers, including two officers, were killed when terrorists dressed as policemen stormed a military camp in Nagrota. The national highway has often been used by militants in attempts to carry out sneak-and-strike attacks. Their modus operandi is to breach the border at various points to enter Jammu, and after hitching a vehicle by force they carry out suicide attacks on the army or police installations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/four-jaish-militants-killed-in-jammu-while-trying-to-travel-to-kashmir-917373.html

A change in the wind direction has also increased the share of stubble burning in the city's pollution slightly. Delhi's air quality index was recorded at 272 at 9 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 211 on Wednesday and 171 on Tuesday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". V K Soni, the head of the IMD's environmental research centre, said the northwesterly winds increased the stubble contribution slightly on Wednesday. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, stubble burning accounted for 8 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on Wednesday. It was 3 per cent on Tuesday. Around 800 fire points were observed in Punjab, Haryana and western Pakistan on Wednesday. However, their impact on Delhi-NCR's air quality will not be significant, Soni said.  The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi also said Delhi-NCR's air quality is likely to remain in the “moderate” and the lower end of the “poor” category on Thursday and Friday. However, SAFAR said it may deteriorate to the lower end of the “very poor” category on Friday and Saturday, “as the conductive meteorological environment created after rainfall is slowly retreating”. The minimum temperature settled at 9.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday – the lowest this season so far -- and the maximum wind speed was predicted to be 10 kmph, according to IMD. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.  Delhi's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 5,000 m2/s on Wednesday and is likely to be 7,500 m2/s on Thursday. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. The IMD had earlier said the minimum temperature in Delhi will drop to 9 degrees Celsius by Saturday, as cold winds have started blowing from hilly regions, which have witnessed a fresh bout of snowfall. The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degree Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover, according to IMD officials.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-poor-may-deteriorate-as-temperature-dips-917391.html

The tigress, Barkha, is six years old. She will form a pair with Karan, who is also aged around 6. The Delhi zoo did not have a Royal Bengal tigress for six years despite it being a participating zoo for the Conservation Breeding Programme of Bengal Tiger, according to its Director Ramesh Pandey. According to the Central Zoo Authority, the Conservation Breeding Programme is a science of conserving a species by preventing imminent population collapse in the wild due to a large number of eliminative pressures such as habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, industrialisation, poaching, illegal trade and climate change, etc. The Delhi zoo had three Royal Bengal tigers till a year ago. One of the three tigers, eight-year-old Rama died at the zoo in September last year due to kidney failure. He was brought from the Mysore zoo in 2014. At present, the zoo has two male Royal Bengal tigers -- B2 or Bittu and Karan -- and seven white tigers -- three females and four males. Officials said 15-year-old Bittu was not in good health and reports suggest very high presence of creatinine that affects the functioning of kidneys. Recently, the Delhi zoo acquired five species -- wild boar, black and grey partridge, golden pheasant, Eurasian dove and jungle cat -- from Chandigarh's Chhatbir Zoo. A male rhino from Patna will be brought soon for breeding purposes. There are two female rhinos in the Delhi zoo at present, Pandey said. It is also likely to acquire chinkara and a pair of ostrich from Chandigarh and a pair of striped hyena from Jaipur. The last chinkara of the zoo had died in June last year. "There are around 88 species in the Delhi zoo at present. We hope to increase this number to 100 by the year end,” Pandey said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-zoo-gets-bengal-tigress-from-kanpur-for-conservation-breeding-917422.html

The rise in cases of the infection has happened at a time when approaching winter and severely deteriorating air quality in the city have worsened complications in people with respiratory illnesses. According to the online Corona dashboard of the Delhi government at 12:30 pm on Thursday, only 131 Covid-19 ICU beds were available out of 1,362 such beds at various facilities here. There was no vacancy at Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (RGSSH), Max hospital's facilities at Saket, Patparganj and Shalimar Bagh, Batra hospital, Fortis hospital's facilities at Shalimar Bagh and Vasant Kunj and Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, and Venkateshwara Hospital in Dwarka, among others, as per the data. The RGSSH, a dedicated coronavirus facility under the Delhi government, has 200 ICU beds with ventilators, all occupied, while at the LNJP Hospital, another dedicated facility, only seven such beds were available out of 200 at 12:30 pm. Seven of 71 ICU beds with ventilators were available at AIIMS Trauma Centre, at the Safdarjung hospital, seven such beds were available out of 65, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital has eight such beds available out of 45 and RML Hospital has only two ICU beds with ventilators available out of 28, as per the data. At other Delhi government facilities such as the BSA Hospital, nine beds were free out of 12 and at the SGMH hospital, four beds were free out of six, the data showed. There was no vacancy at the DDU hospital. The non-Covid-19 ICU beds were also getting occupied at many hospitals in Delhi and their count is shrinking at other facilities too. The national capital has witnessed a spurt in coronavirus cases since October 28, when the daily rise breached the 5,000-mark for the first time, and it crossed the 8,000-mark on November 11.   Delhi recorded 7,486 fresh Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the city's infection tally to over five lakh, even as 133 more fatalities, the highest single-day death count till date, pushed the toll to 7,943, authorities said. These fresh cases came out of the 62,232 tests conducted the previous day, while the positivity rate stood at 12.03 per cent amid festive season and rising pollution in the city, according to Wednesday's bulletin issued by the Delhi health department. The highest single-day spike till date here -- 8,593 cases -- was recorded on November 11. The National Centre for Disease Control, in a report drafted recently, had warned that Delhi needed to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh cases of Covid-19 per day, taking into account the upcoming winter season-related respiratory problems, large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/covid-19-icu-beds-with-ventilators-not-available-at-nearly-60-hospitals-in-delhi-917442.html

Speaking to reporters after an all-party meeting on the Covid-19 situation in the national capital, the AAP MLA said that he suggested that market associations should be given a chance to present their views and take precautionary measures to check the spread of the virus. After the meeting, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, "Sought cooperation from all parties in the all-party meeting. This is time to serve, not to indulge in politics. Urged the parties to distribute masks through their workers at public places. All the parties assured to serve the people, keeping aside politics." Bharadwaj said, "We said market associations should be consulted by the government before any decision is taken to shut down markets and they be allowed to take precautions so that markets do not become Covid-19 hotspots. I believe in the coming days the chief minister will meet them. Besides, discussions will also be held by district magistrate and MLA." The BJP and the Congress raised the issue of restriction on Chhath Puja at public places and demanded that the government allow it with required Covid-19 precautions.

19-11-2020||North and Central||Covid-19: Delhi hikes fines for not wearing masks to Rs 2,000; hospitals told to increase non-ICU beds||Not wearing masks in Delhi will pinch one's pockets with the Arvind Kejriwal government on Thursday hiking the fines for non-compliance from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000, saying several people are still not adhering to Covid-19 protocols. The city government is also planning to increase the number of RT-PCR tests from the current 18,000 to 27,000 even as an all-party meeting chaired by Chief Minister Kejriwal decided to take market associations in confidence before shutting down markets, which may emerge as Covid-19 hotspots. The decision to increase the fine on not wearing masks was taken against the backdrop of rising cases in the capital and people not adhering to Covid-19 protocols, which was highlighted during review meetings held by the Centre. "Most people in Delhi are wearing masks, but some people are still not adhering to rules; it has been decided to increase the fine from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000," he said after briefing Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal about Covid-19 situation in the capital. In the meeting, he said, it was agreed that there was a need to "create an effective deterrent" to sensitise people towards wearing masks and to generate awareness in the people regarding adhering to Covid-19 safety protocols. "We both agreed on the fact that even though many people are following Covid-19 protocols and wearing masks, there are still many people who are not wearing masks. They are defying the Covid-19 protocols and exposing themselves and others to the risk of contacting Covid-19. Sometimes, when words do not do the task, imposing restrictions on them becomes necessary," Kejriwal said. With Chhatt Puja festival falling on Friday, he also appealed to people to celebrate it in their houses rather than come to water bodies to perform pujas. Delhi government has restricted Chhath Puja celebrations at riverbanks, ponds and other public places due to the threat of the infection. "I am a part of your family, I want the two crore people of Delhi to celebrate Chhath Puja, but if around 200 people go in a water pond, and even if one out of them is Corona infected, everyone will 100% get infected," Kejriwal said. Delhi authorities have also allowed all Covid-19 facilities to engage MBBS students in fourth and fifth years, interns and others to assist doctors on duty at a fixed honorarium. District Magistrates have also been asked to take steps to immediately double the number of testing centres in their respective districts.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/covid-19-delhi-hikes-fines-for-not-wearing-masks-to-rs-2000-hospitals-told-to-increase-non-icu-beds-917464.html

Women will be able to avail free treatment at their doorsteps in these clinics, which is the "first-of-its-kind" initiative in the country, the government official claimed. Women residing in slums will mainly benefit from these clinics, which will have all women staff, including doctors, lab technicians and ANMs (auxiliary nurse midwife), he said. The clinic will be stationed in slum areas near 'anganwadi' (government-run women and child care facilities) centres on certain days, in coordination with the women and child development department, he added.

19-11-2020||North and Central||Rajasthan set to allow legal mining of unique sandstone needed to build Ram temple||The district administration in Rajasthan’s Bharatpur is seeking the denotification of part of a wildlife sanctuary to allow the mining of a special sandstone, much sought after by builders including those constructing the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Thousands of tonnes of the pink sandstone mined in Bharatpur’s Bansi Paharpur have been sourced for the temple over the years, but much more is needed. There were concerns in Ayodhya that supplies of this stone with a unique pink hue would dry up. Since blocks of this sandstone had already been carved – ready to be put in place as the temple comes up – switching over to a lesser grade of stone would have caused problems. The Dholpur variant is said to be no match to the Bansi Paharpur stone. Authorities in Congress-run Rajasthan denied that the move to denotify Bansi Paharpur block in Bharatpur’s Band Baretha wildlife sanctuary has anything specific to do with the Ram temple. But a Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader approved of reports that this “technical problem” is now being sorted out. "The Rajasthan government never created hurdles in the supply of the stone. However, there was some technical problem regarding Forest and Wildlife Act at Bansi Paharpur in Bharatpur district, which the Rajasthan government is taking steps to denotify," senior VHP leader Triloki Nath Pandey told PTI in Ayodhya. He said there has been cooperation from all past governments – including those of Mayawati, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh—for uninterrupted supply of building material for the Ram temple. Anubhai Sompura, an architect associated with the temple project, said one lakh cubic feet of the stone has already been stockpiled, adding that two lakh cubic feet is still needed. According to Bharatpur district collector Nathmal Didel, initial steps have now been taken for the denotification of Bansi Paharpur block – a move which will remove its status as forestland and allow legal mining. A preliminary survey is being done by a team of revenue, forest and mining department officials, he said. "After the initial survey, a report will be sent to the chief wildlife warden of the forest department,” he said, adding that the recommendations will go to the Centre for approval. He said the stone is in high demand across the country and the process has not begun because it is required for the Ram Temple. The collector said there is rampant illegal mining in the area. There is no forest left there, and if it is delinked from the sanctuary the state government will get the revenue from any mining there. When contacted, Rajasthan Principal Secretary, (Forest and Environment), Sreya Guha said the matter is related to the mines department, which has not yet placed it before the forest department. She said a survey might have been done at the local level and has not yet come for clearance to her department. Principal Secretary (Mining) Ajitabh Sharma said he would not be able to give details. In a landmark judgment last year, the Supreme Court cleared the way for building a Ram temple at the disputed Ayodhya site where the Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992. The groundbreaking ceremony for the temple took place in August at a ceremony led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/rajasthan-set-to-allow-legal-mining-of-unique-sandstone-needed-to-build-ram-temple-917504.html
19-11-2020||North and Central||Clinical trial of homeopathic medicines to treat Covid-19 approved principally: AAP govt to HC||The AAP government on Thursday told the Delhi High Court that the proposal, by two homoeopathic doctors, for the clinical trial of a certain combination of homeo medicines for prevention and cure of Covid-19 has been principally approved. The Delhi government told a bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad that the approval is subject to adherence to AYUSH Ministry guidelines. It said there was also a need for a go-ahead from the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC), the inclusion of patient information sheet and written consent form and registration of trial with Clinical Trials Registry-India. It also told the court that "there shall be no financial implication of this on the Directorate of AYUSH, Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi as funding was to be provided by the Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India under an extramural research scheme".   The submissions were made in response to a plea by two doctors -- Kerala-based Dr Ravi M Nair and West Bengal-based Dr Asok Kumar Das -- seeking directions to the Centre, Delhi government and Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH) to allow and support conducting of the clinical trial on Arsenicum album–Phosphorus-Tuberculinum (APT) combination of homeopathic medicines to prevent Covid-19. In their plea, filed through advocate Suvidutt Sundaram, the two doctors have sought that doctors be allowed to dispense homoeopathic medicines as a supplement to allopathic ones, to treat for Covid-19 if so desired by the patients. The Delhi government, in its status report filed through additional standing counsel Jawahar Raja, told the court that the approval was communicated to the petitioners on July 17. It also told the bench that it had in May this year set up a five-member advisory committee to examine and suggest steps of homoeopathic system of medicine for boosting immunity against Covid-19 infection. Pursuant to recommendations of the committee, the Delhi government has started its own study titled, 'A Pragmatic, Placebo-controlled, Parallel Groups, Randomised Clinical Trial to Assess the Efficacy of Homoeopathic Medicine(s) in the Prevention of Covid-19 in a High Risk/Exposed Population', the report has said. It further said the sample size of the study was 15,000 persons and its outcome would come after it is completed under the supervision of the  State Advisory Committee constituted by Delhi government. The matter was listed for further hearing in December. The status report was filed after the court asked the Delhi government why it was not writing to the CCRH for carrying out clinical trials of homoeopathic medicines for prevention and cure of Covid-19 despite requests from the two doctors. The doctors, in their plea, have said that they were informed in June by CCRH that the state governments have to approach it for clinical trials and it cannot go to the states. Subsequently, they wrote to the Delhi government in June itself to approach CCRH for clinical trials, however, no steps were taken by it, they have claimed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/clinical-trial-of-homeopathic-medicines-to-treat-covid-19-approved-principally-aap-govt-to-hc-917524.html
19-11-2020||North and Central||India will continue to deal firmly with cross border terrorism from Pak||The Indian Army had carried out 'pinpointed strikes' on suspected terror launchpads inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in response to Pakistani military's unrelenting efforts to push maximum number of terrorists into India before the onset of harsh winters, sources in the security establishment said on Thursday. The Army clarified that there has been no firing or ceasefire violations along the LoC on Thursday. Referring to recent attempts of cross border terrorism, the sources said the 'deep state' in Pakistan has tried to manage a fine balance between escaping the scrutiny by global anti-terror watchdog FATF and supporting terror activities with an aim to fuel unrest in Jammu and Kashmir. The Army said speculative reports that it carried out strikes on Thursday are "based on analysis of the Ceasefire Violations (CFV) that took place on November 13. There has been no firing or CFV in LoC today". Triggering a major flare up, Pakistan resorted to heavy shelling in several areas along the LoC in north Kashmir on Friday killing five security personnel apart from at least four civilians. The Indian Army mounted a major retaliation pounding several Pakistani positions with anti-tank guided missiles and artillery guns in which at least eight Pakistani soldiers were killed and 12 others injured. In the last few weeks, Pakistan Army has been aggressively targeting civilians on Indian side of the Line of Control (LoC) by resorting to indiscriminate firing by heavy calibre artillery guns to support infiltration of terrorists into Jammu and Kashmir, they said. This year, 21 innocent civilians have lost their lives in Pakistani firing compared to 18 in the whole of 2019, according to official data. The sources said intelligence-based targeted strikes are being conducted by the Indian Army to neutralise mostly Pakistani and foreign terrorists, and the collateral damage has been very negligible in these operations. The new pattern being followed by Islamabad in "inciting" unrest and arm the youths in Jammu and Kashmir has been to avoid any trace of its involvement in view of the growing international pressure on it to take action against terror groups operating from its soil, they said. "Pakistan has sought to target the peaceful villagers living alongside the Indian side of the LoC in order to send a message to the inhabitants of Kashmiri hinterland that to disobey Pakistani diktats and directives on terrorism will prove lethal," said a military source. "Pakistan Army's actions to exclusively target civilians are countered by Indian Army's pinpoint strikes on suspected launchpads inside Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir," the source said, adding deaths of terrorists in the area are shown as civilian deaths by Pakistan in order to garner sympathy and aid from foreign donors. Pakistani military has also been resorting to firing at Indian Army posts along the LoC with heavy calibre weapons, the sources said. This year eight infiltration bids were foiled and 14 terrorists have been neutralised along the LoC, according to official data. The sources said Pakistan has been strongly guarding the location of terrorist training camps following India's Balakot air strikes last year. Indian war planes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26 last year in response to Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF soldiers were killed. The Indian action reflected a doctrinal change in the country's approach in tackling cross border terrorism. The sources said Pakistan's efforts to incite violence inside Kashmir valley and disrupt the lives of common citizens have proved "futile" as an increasing number of youths have surrendered to join the mainstream. "Increasing number of misguided youth who were lured by the false narratives from Pakistan and joined terrorist tanzeems are surrendering to the security forces after concerted efforts were made to reach out to them through their parents, friends and relatives," according to a security official. He said a revamped liberal policy of surrender and rehabilitation has encouraged militants to return to the national mainstream. To mislead the international community and reduce signatures of Islamic identity of terrorists, the deep state has created new entities on the social media, the sources, adding the endeavour is to somehow catch the imagination of the youth and arm them. Apparently, these groups are unknown to people of Kashmir, they said. Notwithstanding the coronavirus pandemic in the region, Pakistan has been resorting to unprovoked ceasefire violations along the LoC and making concerted efforts to push militants into Kashmir. Pakistani hostilities increased after India announced its decision to withdraw the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and divide the state into two union territories in August last year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/india-will-continue-to-deal-firmly-with-cross-border-terrorism-from-pak-917546.html

He said the Academic Council also decided to establish a Special Centre for Systems Medicine (SCSM) in the university. Systems Medicine is an approach to understand the complexity of the interactions of all the molecular and cellular determinants involved in the pathophysiology of a disease. “This proposed centre would serve as a national hub for the development of India specific clinical and molecular data and its application in the area of systems medicine,” the JNU rector said. “This proposed centre would serve as a national hub for the development of India specific clinical and molecular data and its application in the area of systems medicine,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jnu-forms-committee-to-deliberate-upon-measures-needed-for-implementation-of-nep-917562.html

He urged senior Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and presidents of the party's state and union territory units to clarify their stand on separatism and communalism. "The Congress's alliance with the Gupkar gang in J&K and the AIUDF in Assam is a dangerous development and shows that the party has a dubious and suspicious agenda," he told a press conference here. "The Gupkar gang, led by Farooq Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, wants restoration of Article 370 and Article 35(A) revoked by the BJP, and all know that they have connections with separatists," he said. The minister said the BJP will not allow restoration of Article 370 and Article 35 (A), and foil the "communal agenda" of the Congress in Assam.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/congress-has-communal-agenda-for-assam-says-bjp-leader-himanta-biswa-sarma-917568.html
19-11-2020||North and Central||AAP's Amanatullah Khan elected as chairman of Delhi Waqf Board||AAP leader Amanatullah Khan was unanimously elected as the chairman of the Delhi Waqf Board on Thursday, officials said. The Okhla MLA returned as the chairman of the board for the third time in a row after stepping down from the post in March due to the dissolution of the Delhi Assembly. "Khan was elected unanimously by the six members of the Waqf Board present at the meeting. One member, Pervez Hashmi, was not present," a senior Delhi government officer said. Khan said his priority will be to put the affairs of the board back on track, including addressing the issue of pending salaries of employees, imams and moazzins of mosques for months. The functioning of the board, including payment of salaries, disbursal of various types of pensions and other administrative and financial matters, has been affected due to the absence of a chairman for nearly eight months. The employees of the board even went on a strike demanding salaries. "I will try to resolve all the issues, including the pending salaries and other grievances of the staff and other stakeholders, within a week," Khan told reporters after his election. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader was elected as a member (MLA) of the Waqf Board in September. A meeting of the board members in October to elect a new chairman was deferred till November 19, after the high court asked the AAP government how could it allow Khan to become the chairperson of the panel when a special audit was initiated to look into allegations of irregularities against him. The audit was ordered into the alleged irregularities committed at the board from March 2016 to March 2020, officials said. Khan has previously served as the chairman of the board for around six months in 2016 and again from September 2018 to March 2020.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/aaps-amanatullah-khan-elected-as-chairman-of-delhi-waqf-board-917604.html

The estranged uncle of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, who launched a separate political outfit after quitting the SP, said his party would contest the assembly election on its own symbol. He, however, added that "an alliance with the SP will be his first priority". “We will form the alliance to defeat the BJP,” Shivpal added. "The decisions that the BJP government has taken are neither in the interest of the country nor its citizens,” said Shivpal Yadav. “Besides the SP, we will also consider other parties for alliance, but there is still time for taking such decisions,” he added. He also said his party organisation is active and ready in 75 districts of the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/will-have-alliance-with-sp-to-defeat-bjp-in-2022-up-assembly-polls-shivpal-yadav-917606.html

19-11-2020||North and Central||Minimum temperatures dip in parts of north India; Delhi experiences coldest morning this season||Parts of northern India witnessed a dip in minimum temperatures on Thursday with the national capital recording its coldest morning this season, while the meteorological department predicted a further dip in mercury in the northwest parts of the country in the next couple of days. Delhi's air quality was recorded in the "poor" category while the minimum temperature dropped to 9.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday morning, the lowest this season so far, due to cold winds blowing from snow-capped western Himalayas. The minimum temperature on Thursday was three notches below the normal. The city recorded a low of 10.6 degrees Celsius on Wednesday.  Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of IMD, had earlier said the month of November this year is expected to be the coldest in the last four to five years. The IMD had earlier predicted a drop in the minimum temperature in Delhi as cold winds have started blowing from hilly regions, which have witnessed a fresh bout of snowfall. The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degree Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover, according to IMD officials. Government agencies have warned that the air quality might dip to "very poor" category on Friday and improve slightly on Saturday due to favourable surface wind speed. Delhi's 24-hour average air quality index on Thursday was recorded at 283. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". In neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, light rains occurred at isolated places leading to a dip in temperatures in the state. Day temperatures fell markedly in the Prayagraj division and were appreciably below normal in Jhansi and Agra divisions; below-normal in Ayodhya, Kanpur, Bareilly and Meerut divisions and normal in remaining divisions of the state, the meteorological division said. Ballia recorded the highest maximum temperature in the state at 29.5 degrees Celsius. Muzaffarnagar recorded a minimum temperature of 8.6 degrees Celsius, it said, adding that the weather would most likely remain dry on Friday with shallow to moderate fog in the morning. Maximum temperatures hovered below normal limits in Haryana and Punjab, with Chandigarh, the common capital of the two states, recording a high of 22.5 degrees Celsius, four notches below the normal. In Haryana, Ambala recorded a high of 24.4 degrees Celsius, down four notches against the normal, while Hisar's maximum settled at 23.5 degrees Celsius. Karnal registered a high of 23 degrees Celsius, down four notches against normal. In Punjab, Amritsar recorded a high of 22.4 degrees Celsius, down four notches, while Ludhiana registered a maximum of 22.7 degrees Celsius. Patiala's maximum settled at 23.6 degrees Celsius, four below normal limits. The minimum temperatures too hovered one to four degrees below the normal at most places in the two states on Thursday. In the Kashmir Valley, overcast conditions led to a dip in temperatures with the meteorological department saying there was a possibility of rains or snowfall at a number of places in Jammu and Kashmir next week. The famous ski-resort of Gulmarg in north Kashmir was the coldest place in the Union territory with the minimum temperature settling at minus 5.4 degrees Celsius. Srinagar recorded a maximum temperature of 11.7 degrees Celsius, down from Wednesday's 13 degrees Celsius. A number of places in the hill state of Himachal Pradesh shivered at sub-zero temperatures with Keylong, the administrative centre of the tribal district of Lahaul and Spiti, being the coldest place in the state recording a temperature of minus 2 degrees Celsius. Kinnaur's Kalpa registered a low of minus 1.2 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperatures in Kufri, Manali and Dalhousie were 2.5 degrees Celsius, 3.4 degrees Celsius and 3.9 degrees Celsius respectively. State capital Shimla recorded a low of 4.6 degrees Celsius. Several areas in Rajasthan too witnessed a dip in night temperatures with the meteorological department predicting a further fall in mercury on Friday. Mount Abu, the state's only hill station, recorded a night temperature of 2.2 degrees Celsius. Churu recorded a minimum temperature of 6.6 degrees Celsius, Pilani 8.3 degrees Celsius, Ganganagar 8.4 degrees Celsius and Bikaner 10.3 degrees Celsius. The maximum day-time temperature in most parts of the state was recorded 28 degree Celsius or below. According to the India Meteorological Department, minimum temperatures are very likely to fall gradually by two to four degrees Celsius over northwest India during the next three days and over central after a day.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/minimum-temperatures-dip-in-parts-of-north-india-delhi-experiences-coldest-morning-this-season-917634.html
19-11-2020||Oasis||Never forget your roots||A heartwarming spectacle that I just witnessed made me pen this piece. I always visit old homes and orphanages on festive occasions. On the occasion of Bhaiya Dooj, when I visited an orphanage, I saw a young woman play with the kids. She gifted sweets and clothes to the children. Curious, I asked her whether she had visited the orphanage before? She told me, that like me, she too visited all orphanages on festive occasions and would distribute goodies among the kids. What she told me, brought tears to my eyes. She said that she too was an orphan and never saw her biological parents. The orphanage in Mumbai where she was brought up, changed her life.  She was an exceptionally brilliant student and went on to eventually become a gynaecologist!  I was moved beyond words. This wasn't just plain and perfunctory gratitude. This was more than that. Gratitude with a rooted sense of belonging. Despite becoming a doctor of repute, she didn't forget her humble roots and deprived childhood. "To remember one's roots and go back to them occasionally, makes one a human," wrote the English essayist Charles Lamb. Going back to our roots and remembering the humble background one comes from is an antidote to hubris. This keeps us firmly rooted and grounded. People often forget their roots once they become something in life. To forget the roots is to forget bonds. "Only those, whose feet are firmly grounded, can soar high in the firmament of greatness," aptly observed Harilal Kania, the first CJI. He came from a very humble background. In spite of achieving such a high position in life, his feet stayed grounded. All those, who've achieved greatness in life have been people with a sense of grounding and rooting. The legendary thespian Soumitra Chatterjee, who recently passed away would call it,"Oteeter proti kritagyota" (The gratitude towards the past). He came from a humble background but he reached a level often dreamt about but seldom achieved. Remembering our roots makes us more human, nay humane. This is the summum bonum of human life and the essence of humanity.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/never-forget-your-roots-917338.html
19-11-2020||Opinion||How Asaduddin Owaisi could spoil Didi’s West Bengal game plan||After winning five assembly constituencies in Bihar, Assadudin Owaisi’s All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has emerged into the national spotlight. And not for no reason. The Muslim party can be next expected to make its presence felt in the West Bengal Assembly polls, scheduled for the summer of 2021, where, if current trends persist, it could even impair the chances of Mamata Banerjee’s return to power. In fact, AIMIM's performance in Bihar could have a direct bearing on the way the Bengal contest plays out. AIMIM claims to have large membership base in Muslim-dominated Murshidabad, a district which falls in Bengal’s Muslim belt and is contiguous with parts of Bihar where the AIMIM won. More on that later, but first let us see how the AIMIM is going about wooing voters. In its attempt to consolidate Muslim voters behind it, the party is fashioning itself as the sole saviour of the community’s interests. The AIMIM's main argument is that the secular parties will not fight for Muslims when it comes to the crunch. The party’s campaigners tell their listeners that although the AIMIM is ready for an alliance with the secular parties, like the Trinamool Congress (TMC), these outfits do not respond to them. Their message is that parties led by Hindus are inclined to use the minorities as vote banks, and will not join hands with AIMIM out of fear of losing out heavily on Hindu votes. Whether or not this is an insidious attempt to communalise Muslims is a separate issue. It could be argued both ways, depending on the prism through which one chooses to look at it. After all, it is a fact that like India’s Dalit population, a vast majority of Muslims too are still languishing in backwardness. The scenario is no different in Bengal, which was ruled by the Left for 34 years and is now being governed by TMC for the last next-nine-and-half-years. A customary look at the figures of per capita income for Bengal’s districts makes it clear that it is the Muslim-dominated Murshidabad that has the lowest figures. AIMIM, for its part, has been trying to exploit this situation for the last couple of years. The anti-CAA movement gave it a boost, and it is believed that in Bengal, Owaisi’s men are quite popular among Hindi-speaking Muslims and illegal Bangladeshi migrants, a large section of whom have voter cards. That makes up a sizeable chunk of the nearly 30 per cent minority voters of Bengal. To return to where the AIMIM's chances are best in Bengal, let’s look at the Bihar results. All the five constituencies where AIMIM won in Bihar are adjacent to North Bengal’s Muslim-dominated districts of Uttar Dinjpur and Malda. Next to these two districts of Bengal is Murshidabad. These three districts make up the Muslim belt of Bengal and have 43 (of 294) Assembly constituencies. Here Mamata Banerjee’s TMC has finally emerged a dominant force, though the Left-Congress combination is not far behind. BJP’s best chances in these 43 constituencies lie in a tough three-cornered contest – for only in a division of Muslim votes can can the BJP hope to win. Even until a few months ago the BJP could not dream of winning more than 10 seats here. But with distinct possibility of AIMIM emerging as a strong third contender for Muslim votes, political watchers say the BJP could even win half of the seats from these areas now. AIMIM could also damage the TMC in another 80-90 seats in South Bengal, where the Muslim vote is more than 30 per cent. If AIMIM can spread its tentacles to South Bengal (where too its campaigners have been active for quite some time), it could turn into a political nightmare for the TMC. AIMIM may not win many seats or an impressive vote share, but could still spoil Didi's electoral strategy by securing as less as three per cent of the votes. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, when for the first time the BJP emerged as the challenger to the ruling party in Bengal, it secured 40.64 per cent votes. This translates to nearly 58 per cent of Hindus (who totally make up 70.54 per cent of the voters of Bengal). Now, desperate to make an impact in South Bengal, where it failed to take off in 2019, the BJP believes that its vote percentage can be increased by a few more notches. No doubt, the additional percentage will come from the Hindus. Mamata Banerjee could perhaps see the shape of things to come when she put up a spirited opposition to the NRC-CAA. Her aim was to make the Muslims accept her as the messiah of the community. TMC can rival the BJP in the upcoming elections only by retaining the 43.69 percent vote it had secured in 2019, at least half of which came from Muslims. That means Mamata Banerjee and her party have to get at least three-fourth of the Muslim vote. In this situation, if the AIMIM manages to get even 2.5 per cent vote, it may badly damage TMC’s prospects in an election that even the TMC’s strategist, Prashant Kishor, had pegged at 50:50 for TMC and BJP.

19-11-2020||Panorama||Gestational diabetes needs attention||This year has been a remarkable year for not just doctors but for all frontline workers in the medical fraternity. Besides fighting the ongoing pandemic, our frontline workers are overburdened with managing and handling patients with non-communicable diseases. A recent WHO survey of 155 countries conducted in May 2020 showed that more than half (53%) of the countries surveyed have partially or completely disrupted services for hypertension treatment; 49% for treatment for diabetes and diabetes-related complications; 42% for cancer treatment, and 31% for cardiovascular emergencies. A significant area which is overlooked and poses threat to maternal and child health is that of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), that is diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy. Parallel to an increase in diabetes prevalence, there seems to be an increasing prevalence of gestational DM (GDM) which affects approximately five million women each year. Just like other types of diabetes, it causes high blood sugar that can affect the health of both pregnant women and unborn child. It is important to understand that the management of diabetes and its complications imposes a huge economic burden on society. Hence, effective strategies are urgently needed to control this epidemic too. The prevalence of gestational diabetes has been reported to range from 3.8% in Kashmir to 6.2% in Mysore, 9.5% in Western India and 17.9% in Tamil Nadu. In more recent studies, prevalence rates are as high as 35% in Punjab and 41% in Lucknow. Our own unpublished data suggests that 30% of expecting mothers attended by consultants have Gestational Diabetes; we are also looking at the possibility of identifying biomarkers to diagnose them earlier. The geographical differences in prevalence have been attributed to differences in age and/or socioeconomic status of pregnant women. It is estimated that about four million women are affected by GDM in India, at any given time point. GDM not only influences immediate maternal (preeclampsia, stillbirths, macrosomia, and need for cesarean section) and neonatal outcomes (hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, increased risk of congenital heart disease) but also increases the risk of future type two diabetes in mother as well as the baby.  Existing literature indicates that prediabetes and diabetes affect approximately six million births in India alone, of which 90% are due to GDM. Children born in GDM pregnancies face an increased risk for obesity and type two diabetes. The cornerstone for the management of GDM is glycemic control and quality nutritional intake. GDM management is complex in India, and existing challenges are multifactorial.  The diagnosis of GDM may affect women’s mental wellbeing, functioning and quality of life, with potentially negative effects on treatment adherence. Identifying and addressing the psychological and emotional needs of women with GDM could have benefits for sustainable long-term behavioural change. Nurses are educators as they are greatly involved in educating patients to manage their disease. Existing literature has shown positive outcomes through “education” on expecting mother’s condition when nurses are involved and diabetes education helps in improving glycemic controls. We need our nurse educators to be skilled in this teaching-learning process and enable them to listen to the demands and needs of their patients. Better education of the diabetic patient does provide improvement in patient self-care through a better understanding of his illness.  As we stride towards a global shortage of nurses, there is a need for immediate action including increasing nurse recruitment through traditional university routes and expanding new roles and apprenticeship routes. Nurses are advanced caregivers and motivators they play a crucial role in advising the patients about many non-pharmacological modalities which help them to reduce the medications - dietary advice, lifestyle changes etc. Nurses have a crucial role in educating expectant mothers and nursing mothers on this. Non- communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death globally, killing more people each year than all other causes combined but these diseases are largely preventable.  These diseases can be effectively treated and controlled. We can turn the tide. But we have a long way to go.  (The writer is neonatologist and founder-chairman at a chain of hospitals)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/gestational-diabetes-needs-attention-917336.html
19-11-2020||Panorama||The rise of monopolies in ‘New India’||John D Rockefeller Sr (1839-1937) was an American business magnate and philanthropist. He is widely considered the wealthiest American of all time. Rockefeller founded the Standard Oil Company in 1870, at age 31.His wealth soared as kerosene and gasoline grew in importance, and he became the richest person in America, controlling 90% of all oil in the US at his peak. Further, Rockefeller gained enormous influence over the railroad industry which transported his oil around the country. The US Supreme Court ruled in 1911 that Standard Oil had to be dismantled for violation of federal anti-trust laws. It was broken up into 34 separate entities, which became companies such as ExxonMobil, Chevron and others. Rockefeller once said, “own nothing, control everything.” This was the philosophy behind one of the richest men of the 19th century. He was the first businessman to put modern monopoly principles into practice. He ruthlessly blocked any competition from individual businesses through massive monopolies and cartels. Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), in present-day India, comes closest to Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company of the early 20th century. Ambani holds a near monopoly, or at least the highest ability to influence markets and policy, in every sector in which RIL has a presence -- telecom, oil, petrochemicals, retail. Many industry experts believe that Ambani has used his political clout to twist the regulatory framework in his favour. The spectacular entry of Reliance Jio into the telecom sector was a case in point. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) defied conventional wisdom by allowing Jio to offer about 200 days of promotional free services. The COAI (Cellular Operators of India Association) had called on the government to intervene as Jio was breaching TRAI’s order that promotional offers cannot exceed the 90-day upper limit. TRAI said in a letter to operators that, “on examination” they have found out that the Happy New Year offer launched by Jio “is distinct from their earlier Welcome offer and cannot be treated as an extension of the earlier promotional offer as the benefits under both sets of promotional offers differ.” The after-effect of Jio's entry into the telecom industry was astonishing -- revenue and EBITDA margin for incumbent operators fell by 15-40%. Idea's debt-equity ratio has reached a dangerous level. The predatory entry of Jio has thrown the telecom industry into a near-irreversible, long-term damage.   In 2018, the government allowed RIL's backdoor entry into India’s largest public sector bank, SBI. Jio Payments Bank (JPB) was launched as a 30:70 joint venture between SBI and Reliance Jio in April 2018. The payments services of JPB are provided through SBI’s 'You Only Need One’ or YONO platform, a digital banking application launched by SBI in 2017. Reliance now has the enormous resources of the SBI at its disposal. Former SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya, who closed the deal, joined the board of RIL as an independent director after serving the one-year cooling-off period after retirement from SBI.  Equally worrisome is the concentration of economic power in aviation infrastructure in a few hands. The Adani Group bagged the 50-year concession to operate all the six Airports Authority of India-operated airports – Lucknow, Jaipur, Guwahati, Ahmedabad, Trivandrum, and Mangaluru – which were put up for auction. The ports-to-energy conglomerate has also acquired a controlling stake in Mumbai airport from GVK Airports. Adani Group will also construct the Navi Mumbai International Airport. Airports are natural monopolies. To have one private owner controlling eight or more airports can't possibly be great news for airlines or fliers. Adani Group is also a formidable monopoly in sea ports and green energy. The group is also eyeing to grab a slice of Indian Railways during privatisation. Mukesh Ambani has been ranked as the richest person in India for the 13th consecutive year by Forbes Magazine. As per Forbes India Rich List 2020, his net worth stands at $88.7 billion, making him the fourth-richest man in the world. In the top 10 richest list, he is the only businessman from the BRICS countries and from the developing world. A giant leap, indeed. In 2014, before the Narendra Modi government came to power, Ambani was ranked by Forbes only as the world’s 40th-richest man, with a net worth of $18.6 billion. Since 2014, Ambani's wealth has grown by nearly five times. So has the wealth of Gautam Adani, now at No 2 on the India rich list. He has a net worth of $25.2 billion for the year 2020. In 2014, Forbes had estimated Adani’s net worth at only $7.1 billion. While there is no doubt that Ambani’s rise has been remarkable, the larger question is, what’s fuelling his skyrocketing fortune? Innovation or crony capitalism? Over the past decades, if India’s economy was not able to grow as fast as China’s, it was mainly because of a lack of innovation and productivity. In fact, India ranks poorly on the global innovation indices. India's current ranking is 48 in the Global Innovation Index. China is at 14. Disrupting the marketplace through innovation is capitalism at its best, but doing so piggybacking on regulatory support is crony capitalism. There was a consensus among Indian policymakers at the time of the 1991 economic reforms that economic liberalisation would eliminate the nexus between the business elites and the policymakers. On the contrary, the relationship between these two groups got further strengthened.    The key to Mukesh Ambani’s soaring wealth is not innovation but monopoly and policies that suit his businesses. If the government changes the rules of the game in every sector and puts a serious question mark on the basic focus of regulatory laws, then it’s not difficult to pick winners and losers. One can guess the winners, but the real losers are certainly the Indian public and the Indian economy at large, whose fate is being decided by a handful of billionaires.

19-11-2020||Right in the Middle||Incredible encounter||I met Sony by mere coincidence. Some meetings are predestined. Due to my penchant for writing, I sit for long hours typing on my laptop.  At times my laptop misbehaves and I am at a loss.  During one such moment, my PA suggested contacting Sony. On the other end of the phone, I heard a warm cheerful voice. A meeting was arranged for the next day. At the appointed time Sony arrived, a back-pack slung around his shoulder and a huge grin on his face. His very presence brightened me up. He worked on my laptop for two hours and during that time we had a lively, jovial chat amongst him, my PA and me. Once repaired Sony got up to leave. When I asked him how much I owed him for his services, he waved me aside and said nothing. I was surprised and when I insisted once again and was amazed by his answer that he had spent a delightful and happy morning chatting with me and that was more than any payment. Sony left with a happy gait in his feet, back-pack slung on his shoulders and a grin on his face. As time passed, Sony and I met and spoke to each other regularly. Sony was a professional computer engineer who had worked in Dubai for several years and returned to India to spend time when his mother fell ill.  He took a part-time job of four hours a day and in the time available to him thereafter was spent attending to his ill mother and spending quality time with his wife and two children. He also attended two or three clients in a day for computer repairs. Sony gave up a lucrative job because he realized that money was necessary and instead chose to prioritise relationships. Sony had taken a choice to be happy and make others happy and was determined to succeed in this choice which he had made to live his life.   In today's materialistic world, power, status, recognition in society are determined by money. Personal character, integrity, loyalty are relegated to non-essentials. I had met a man who had taken a choice to relegate money the place it was due and spread joy and happiness around him through good relationships. A man who no doubt would have a deep impact on the people he met. A man who would spread happiness where ever he went. Undoubtedly, the type of people we needed in the world. I had been very fortunate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/incredible-encounter-917335.html
19-11-2020||Second Edit||Pakistan is playing to a game plan||Even as India’s border with China continues to bristle with tension, the situation along the Line of Control (LOC), the de facto border between India and Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir, is deteriorating. Over the past week, Pakistan has engaged in heavy firing and shelling of Indian border posts, bunkers and also villages. Pakistani aggression was particularly lethal on Friday when it resulted in the death of five Indian security personnel and six civilians. Its ceasefire violations have soared this year. According to Indian Army officials, Pakistan has violated the ceasefire more than 4,000 times since January this year, the highest number in a year since the two countries signed a ceasefire agreement in November 2003. Indian officials say that the escalation of Pakistani firing is aimed at deflecting attention away from its infiltration of militants across the LoC into India. In a couple of weeks, heavy snowfall will make mountain passes inaccessible. Pakistan appears to be pushing militants into India ahead of the winter months. However, Pakistan seems to be acting as per a larger game plan as it is targeting India on multiple fronts. Last week, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi presented a ‘dossier’ of supposedly ‘irrefutable evidence’ of India allegedly sabotaging China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects. Recently, Prime Minister Imran Khan announced that Gilgit-Baltistan will be conferred with ‘provisional’ provincial status. Elections to the ‘Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly’ were held on November 15, despite India’s objections to Pakistan’s illegal steps towards altering the status of the region. It is evident that Pakistan’s recent moves are aimed at playing up to China. Islamabad is signalling the priority it accords to protecting China’s interests and its willingness to act to protect Beijing’s interests. This is worrying, especially in the context of the current situation along the LAC with China. India has always had to factor in the possibility of a two-front war with Pakistan and China. Pakistan’s recent moves are significant as they reaffirm the possibility of Beijing and Islamabad coordinating their bellicosity from across the LAC and LoC, respectively. Additionally, by stepping up aggression and provoking India to retaliate, Pakistan is seeking international attention. Is it back to playing its old game of destabilising the region to attract American attention and meddling? The incoming Joe Biden administration is expected to be more critical of the Narendra Modi government’s handling of the Kashmir issue. Pakistan’s recent moves seem aimed at getting Washington to pressure New Delhi. India should avoid falling into Pakistan’s trap. It must focus on initiating political measures to calm Kashmir.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/pakistan-is-playing-to-a-game-plan-917332.html

So, he did not have any vivid memory about how his father, Mooppan, had lived in his early days by gathering and selling small-scale forest products like wild honey and frankincense ('kunthirikkam' in local parlance). But, the 21-year old Sudheesh is now getting ready to script a new chapter in the history of the Cholanaikkan community, one of the most primitive tribes and the last remaining hunter-gatherer group in the state, by becoming its first-ever member to contest elections. Hailing from remote Alakkal colony, an elephant infested tribal settlement located inside a dense forest in the district, Sudheesh is contesting in the upcoming local body polls from the Vazhikkadavu division of the Nilambur block panchayat. He is also one of the youngest candidates in the state to seek electoral luck in the three-tier polls, due next month, as a candidate of the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF). Sudheesh said his community was still away from mainstream society even after many generations have passed and he wants to usher in some changes in the life of fellow community members. Saying that his candidature was totally unexpected, he said he got the seat as it was a reserved ward. "My community still faces several odds and my objective is to bring them to the forefront of the society. I wish to do something to get all children in our community good education. Good roads and adequate transportation facility are still our concerns," he told P T I. A plus two pass out, Sudheesh said hewants to do all possible things for the uplift of his community men especially women and children. Known as the 'cavemen of Kerala', the Cholanaikkan a.k.a. Cholanaikkar, the primitive hill tribe, mainly inhabits the Nilambur valley of Malappuram district in north Kerala. According to researchers, members of this ethnic community had inhabited in 'alakkal' (caves) in deep forests as small groups till the 1970s and lived by hunting small animals and gathering honey and wild tubers. Later, they started living in hamlets like Alakkal and Punchakkolli in Nilambur forest division. Many of its members have become tappers in the rubber plantation under the state-run Plantation Corporation. Amidst his busy campaign schedule, Sudheesh said he has to travel eight kilometres through forests to reach any place outside of his colony. "Wild elephants are a big threat while travelling through interior paths. The public road, which is full of the gutter, is yet to be tarred and only four-wheelers can traverse through this when it is raining," he said. Sudheesh has to cross two rivers to reach his elephant-infested colony. It was only two years back that electricity had reached this hamlet. According to N C John, a social worker and a Marxist party activist, the candidature of the young man was part of efforts to bring the Cholanaikar community to the forefront and make them part of mainstream society. All possible efforts should be extended to them till they attain some efficiency to be self-reliant, he said. "It is very difficult to change the old community members as they are very rigid in their outlook. So, our target is the young generation. Only through them we can enter into the community and bring some change," he told PTI. He said the Cholanaikkans did not even have ration cards or got registered in any official records till some decades back. Though there are several government funds to support the backward group, it was not reaching them completely as the community members were unaware of it. The number of school and college dropouts is also high as it was very difficult for them to live in tribal hostels under restrictions or in the control of some others, he said. According to figures, there are over 400 Cholanaikkars living in about 100 families in tribal hamlets of Nilambur. There are 200 voters also among them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/in-a-first-21-year-old-man-from-cholanaikkan-tribe-in-kerala-set-for-electoral-foray-917444.html

N Raja Senthoor Pandian, Sasikala's counsel, met the Chief Superintendent of the central prison in Bengaluru and submitted a formal application. Sasikala's legal team feels she should have walked out of the jail in September or early October as she is eligible for a remission of 129 days if one takes into account unavailed leaves during her prison term. Since they paid the fine amount of Rs 10 crore and ten thousand only on Wednesday due to a slew of factors, including the Covid-19 situation, Sasikala's counsel knocked at the doors of the prison on Thursday. The fine amount was deposited before the 34th city civil court, Bengaluru on Wednesday after which the court intimated the prison about the same. “I personally met the jail authorities today and submitted a petition seeking ordinary remission for my client, V K Sasikala. She is eligible for remission of 129 days and the petition explains the grounds on which we are seeking her early release,” Pandian told DH. The Parappana Agrahara prison has already made it clear that the probable date of Sasikala's release is January 27, 2021 provided she pays the fine amount. With the fine amount deposited, Sasikala's legal team feels she should be granted the remission which is given to other prisoners. The team also contends that the Karnataka Prisons Manual does not say ordinary remission cannot be granted to those convicted under Prevention of Corruption Act. Sasikala, a long-time aide of former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, has been cooling her heels in the prison since February 15, 2017. The fine amount was paid by Sasikala's extended family members as four demand drafts with the value of Rs 10 crore and ten thousand were submitted before the court. Sasikala surrendered before the jail authorities on February 15, 2017 after her conviction in the disproportionate assets (DA) case was confirmed by the Supreme Court. Jayalalithaa was also an accused in the case, but her conviction was set off as she died two months before the judgement. Her release from the jail could be a major political event in Tamil Nadu as her physical presence in the state might alter political equations, especially when the Assembly elections are due in the first half of 2021.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sasikalas-counsel-meets-prison-authorities-in-bengaluru-seeks-her-early-release-917558.html

Several elephants in Kerala are waiting for their tusks to be trimmed, which has been delayed due to the outbreak of Covid-19. While elephant rights activists have questioned the need for pruning the tusk of captive elephants, mahouts claim that overgrown tusks are heavy and affect the food intake of jumbos. The forest department had initially planned to trim the tusk of Sree Vallabhan, who is attached to the Malayankeezhu Sree Krishna Temple here, in February. But the procedure was delayed first because he was in musth and then owing to the lockdown. Biju, Vallabhan's mahout for the past eight years, said the elephant is showing discomforts due to overgrown tusk and is not able to take coconut leaves which is one of its feed. Vallabhan, aged around 20, was in news earlier for his drawing skills. Kerala Animal Welfare Board member M N Jayachandran said the main intention behind trimming the tusk of pachyderm is to beautify the elephants so that its demand goes up. He also asked how non-captive elephants manage without any sort of tusk trimming process. However, the caretakers of captive elephants claim that elephants in forests have natural options for trimming tusks during their routine activities in the forests. For captive elephants, there was no such scope and hence periodical trimming was required. The forest department is only empowered to trim the tusks after examination by veterinary doctors. The pruned pieces are kept in a strong room of the forest department as trading of the tusk is banned. Forest department sources said that every year tusks of around 15 elephants are trimmed. Usually, the tusks require trimming in every two to five years depending upon the pace at which it grows.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-jumbos-long-wait-for-trimming-tusk-nears-end-917559.html
19-11-2020||South||India's economy now in recession, says TRS' K T Rama Rao||Stepping up the attack on the BJP, the ruling TRS on Thursday hit out at the handling of the economy, alleging it was now in a recession, preceded by a slowdown for eight consecutive quarters prior to the Covid-19 lockdown. "While the NDA government may call it an act of God, I would call it an act of fraud....What they have done, what they have perpetrated on this country, is an act of fraud, without a question. Lakhs of workers have suffered," said TRS Working President K T Rama Rao. Rao, who is the Municipal Administration minister, made the comments at a 'Meet the Press' at the Press Club of Hyderabad, a day after his father and Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao launched a scathing attak on the BJP while sounding the poll buge for the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polls. He noted that there has been eight consecutive quarters of slowdown, "which has now led to a recession and is a fact." On BJP's reported claim that the development in Hyderabad (with Rs 67,000 crore as announced by TRS government) has been possible with the Centre's support, he recalled late N T Rama Rao's comments that "the Centre is a myth." The ruling party at the Centre should show at least one thing it has done for Hyderabad, he said. While people in Telangana paid Rs 2.72 lakh crore as taxes to the Centre in the last six years, the state received only Rs 1.40 lakh crore through Central devolution, which is the state's right, he said. "The BJP made tall claims by returning 25 paise after having taken Rs one," he said. While the NDA government released Rs 600 crore to Karnataka just four days after its Chief Minister wrote to the Centre, there was no response to one written by the Telangana Chief Minister six weeks ago, seeking assistance for flood relief works in Hyderabad, he claimed. Asked if the CM's comments of convening a conclave of opposition parties against the disinvestment and "anti- farmer" farmer policies of NDA government would materialise or if was a knee-jerk reaction to TRS' loss in the Dubbak Assembly bypoll, Rama Rao said he was focusing on local issues and would leave the matter to party chief (Chandrasekhar Rao). He brushed aside reports of an understanding between TRS and AIMIM for the December 1 GHMC polls and said the party would contest all 150 wards and defeat them. "AIMIM may have supported TRS government's policies but it should not be construed as friendship and interpreted incorrectly," he said. TRS had also supported BJP on issues like GST, he said. Rama Rao dwelt on the TRS government's achievements since coming to power in 2014 like addressing shortage of water, electricity,industrial investments and other matters, "without putting any burden on the people."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/indias-economy-now-in-recession-says-trs-k-t-rama-rao-917564.html

While the Kerala police as well as the prison's department launched a probe into the matter, opposition parties alleged that it was a political ploy to defend the Chief Minister in advance. It was on Wednesday night that the audio conversation came out in which 'Swapna' could be heard saying that central investigation agencies were pressing her to state that she and Chief Minister's former principal secretary M Sivasankar made financial dealings for Vijayan during their trips to UAE and the central agencies also offered to make her an approver in the case. The issue assumed seriousness especially since Swapna is in judicial remand and Kerala BJP president K Surendran alleged on Wednesday that prison authorities were allowing many influential people to meet Swapna by flouting norms. The audio surfaced hours after prison officials denied the allegation and warned Surendran of legal action. Director general of prisons Rishi Raj Singh told reporters on Thursday that a deputy inspector general of prisons was probing into it. The police cyber cell was also examining the audio's veracity. Meanwhile, BJP leader and Minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan alleged that the audio was a political ploy of the Left Front to defend Vijayan, fearing that the ongoing investigations by central agencies would lead to him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/row-erupts-over-audio-of-gold-smuggling-accused-alleging-pressure-to-issue-statement-against-kerala-cm-917571.html

The searches were spread at 25 locations at Guntur, Andhra Pradesh and Hyderabad, Telangana at the premises of various private persons, including former TDP MLA Yarapathineni Srinivasa Rao in an ongoing investigation of the case registered by the CBI on August 26, they said. "During searches, several incriminating documents, mobile phones, material objects and cash have been recovered," CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said. The Central Bureau of Investigation had taken over 17 cases of illegal limestone mining during the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) rule from the CB-CID of the Andhra Pradesh Police registering an FIR against 17 accused. After taking over the case, the CBI employed use of satellite imagery to assess the damage to the natural resources, officials said. "It was alleged that the accused had fraudulently conducted illegal and unauthorised mining, quarrying and transportation of limestone in Konanki village of Piduguralla Mandal, Kesanupalli and Nadikudi villages of Dachepalli Mandal, Guntur district for several years," Gaur said. The illegal mining resulted in crores of revenue loss to the government and genuine lease holders, they said. "It was further alleged that illegal mining of several lakh of tonnes of limestone was conducted by the accused during the period from 2014 to 2018, as a result of which, natural resources worth several crore of rupees have been plundered," the spokesperson said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cbi-carries-out-searches-at-25-locations-in-andhra-pradesh-telangana-917582.html

The former Tamil Nadu Minister was admitted in an unconscious state, Shifa Hospitals here said adding "at present she remains awake, responsive and her vital parameters are satisfactory." The hospital's medical director Dr Mohammed Arafath, in a bulletin said her current clinical condition warranted stay in the Intensive Care Unit and she is being continuously monitored by a team of doctors. The MLA fell ill after she consumed 'sleeping pills' last night, party sources here said, without elaborating. The DMK, meanwhile, dismissed as baseless reports that she was brought to the hospital following an intra-party 'squabble' at a meeting on Wednesday during which she was allegedly insulted at Kadayam near here. Senior leader and Rajya Sabha MP, R S Bharathi asserted there was no truth in the allegation. "I met her today at the hospital after our president (M K Stalin) asked me to visit her. She is conscious. I am confident about her discharge from the hospital on Friday," he told PTI. DMK district office-bearers also accompanied him to the hospital and there was no disagreement or squabble within the party, Bharathi said. However, a video clip of Poongothai in the midst of a party meeting and touching the feet of some party functionaries, indicating a bickering, has gone viral in the social media. Some party workers were seen approaching her, but the MLA, seated on the floor, could be seen gesturing to them to leave. Party leaders were not available immediately for comments on the clip. Hospital authorities said the legislator's health condition has now improved, hours after her admission earlier in the day and following treatment. "She is conscious and her condition has improved now," they said. The 56-year old Aruna, hails from a family of DMK loyalists and she is an obstetrician and gynaecologist. She represents the Alangulam Assembly constituency in this district.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dmk-mla-poongothai-aladi-aruna-hospitalised-in-unconscious-state-917655.html

A division bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar, was hearing a batch of PILs on Covid-19 related issues. In the previous hearing, the court had directed the state government to file an affidavit explaining in what manner and within what period each student, entitled to midday meal scheme, will be compensated. The court had asked the government to state in what manner obligation will be complied with by providing either midday meal or food grains to each and every student. The state government filed an affidavit by Dr Nagambika Devi, additional chief secretary, Department of Social Welfare and Department of Women and Child Development. The affidavit stated that totally 46.15 lakh beneficiaries in the state were provided supplies under the ICDS scheme and the process of distribution had been completed up to the month of October 2020. The affidavit further stated that the process of distribution of supplies was underway for the month of November. The court said that the state will have to come up with a proper compensatory scheme for distribution of food grains to children in view of non-implementation of the scheme for sixmonths. The court also said that giving tur dal in lieu of cooking expenditure runs contrary to rules governing midday meals. The court also said that there is apprehension whether the food grains reach the real beneficiaries since schools are stillclosed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/midday-meal-during-covid-karnataka-hc-asks-govt-for-better-action-plan-917304.html

Also, Marathis are living in Karnataka like Kannadigas. Marathis are core Hindutva followers. During the Belagavi Vishwa Kannada Sammelana, Marathis participated in large numbers. Still, Ajit Pawar is trying to stoke fire,” Yediyurappa said. “I condemn this. He should stop speaking so defiantly going forward.”  Echoing similar views, Yediyurappa’s Cabinet colleagues S T Somashekar, Shashikala Jolle and Prabhu Chouhan said Belagavi, Nippani and Karwar are integral part of Karnataka and will remain so and that there’s no need to give any importance to the statements by Maharashtra leaders on the issue. Speaking to reporters in Belagavi, Cooperation Minister S T Somashekar said, “No need to give importance to the statements by Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on border issue. They rake up the issue to gain political mileage.” When asked about appointing a minister in-charge of border affairs, Somashekar said, “There are four ministers from the district.

Hampi was the capital of the Hindu empire and we want to upgrade it into a prestigious place,” Singh, who anchored the effort for the new Vijayanagar district, said.  “We don’t want to hurt anyone. We want to do this by taking everyone into confidence,” he added.  The mining district of Ballari is politically significant, comprising nine Assembly constituencies of which the Congress represents five and the BJP four.  Ballari has 11 taluks and splitting it will ease administration, it is argued. According to the earlier plan, five taluks — Ballari, Kurugodu, Siraguppa, Sandur and Kudligi — will be part of Ballari district, while six other taluks — Hosapete, Kampli, Hagaribommanahalli, Kottur, Hadagali and Harapanahalli — will constitute the new Vijayanagar district.  “We will share the final details of the district after the next Cabinet meeting,” Madhuswamy said.  ​  ​ The plan for a new Vijayanagar district was first officially mooted by Yediyurappa himself in September 2019 when Singh was a disqualified legislator; Singh had resigned from the Congress when the Congress-JD(S) coalition was in power citing that his demand for a new district fell on deaf ears. He went on to join the BJP.  After the plan created a rift, with some BJP legislators including the Reddy brothers (G Somashekhara Reddy and G Karunakara Reddy) threatening to raise a banner of revolt if Ballari was split, Yediyurappa deferred a decision on this.  Social Welfare Minister B Sriramulu, a native of Ballari, had opposed the plan to create a new district. After the Cabinet meeting, however, he appeared to have come on board. “There was confusion about this. It’s a long-pending demand. We’ve decided informally thanks to all our efforts. The CM and the government will take the final decision,” he said.   Yadgir was the last district created in Karnataka when it was carved out of Kalaburagi in 2009.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/informal-approval-to-carve-out-a-new-vijayanagar-district-917322.html

"One of the key goals of the State is to achieve 50 per cent market share of the national bio-economy target of 100 billion US dollars by the year 2025 and necessary steps have already been taken," Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa said at Bengaluru Tech Summit.

To realise the goal, the State government has instituted the Karnataka Digital Economy Mission (KDM). This is a technology mission to further accelerate and promote the growth of the State's digital economy, the Minister said. "KDM will use the 'Invest India' model to build global linkages for promoting Karnataka's tech industry and enhancing the states brand equity," he said.

Speaking to media persons, here on Thursday, he said BJP's divide and rule policy is more dangerous than that of Britishers and Mughals. BJP which came to power in the name of building corruption-free India and Hindu nation, has indulged in caste-oriented politics. The government is trying to woo castes by forming development corporation.  It is dividing the religion on the basis of castes. If it continues, people would reject BJP in the coming days.  He charged that the state is not witnessing development at all. The government which looted money in the name of Covid-19 is dividing the Hindu religion in the name of development. He said many towns and cities in the country have circles or roads named after British officers and Mughal emperors. Similarly, there must be a circle named after Nathuram Godse in the country. The bust of Godse must be established without fail.  He also alleged that the Centre and the states are misguiding children by calling Mahatma Gandhi as the father of the nation. Mahasabha State Working President Rajesh Pavitran said the birth anniversary of Godse would be celebrated as Akhanda Bharat Sankalpa Diwas.  The mahasabha would extend support to state bandh called by pro-Kannada organisations on December 5 over the formation of Maratha Development Authority. He also alleged that BJP is set to make Karnataka as the state of Muslims. So, the leaders must rename it as Bharatiya Jinnah Party, he ridiculed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/bjp-reign-more-dangerous-than-britishers-and-mughals-rule-dividing-hindu-religion-hindu-mahasabha-917563.html

19-11-2020||State||Poll petition: Karnataka HC imposes Rs 5 lakh cost on Eshwar Khandre||The high court has imposed a cost of Rs 5 lakh on Congress MLA Eshwar Khandre from Bhalki for non-appearance in the election petition. Justice Krishna S Dixit ordered Khandre to pay the cost to the Chief Minister’s Covid Care Fund within three weeks and allowed him to participate in the EP as a respondent.   The petition was filed by D K Siddarama, a candidate who contested the 2018 Assembly elections on a BJP ticket. After Khandre remained unrepresented in the petition, his name was dropped from the petition. Subsequently, Khandre appeared before the court and submitted that he was not aware of the petition because of a health issue with his personal assistant. The counsel, representing Khandre, said that the personal assistant was suffering from a disease of forgetfulness. The disease got escalated and later diagnosed to be acute encephalopathy and he passed away on October 11. The relevant documents, including the copies of the medical discharge summary, were placed before the court. Khandre contended that he got to know about the petition only recently through media reports. “…It may be a bit difficult to assume that nowadays, people's representatives, subject to all just exceptions, invest much time in reading/studies, the priorities of their job arguably being different,” the court said. The court directed Khandre to pay the cost and said it is open to him to file the written statement within six weeks. The court also warned Khandre against seeking an adjournment, except for genuine reasons.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/poll-petition-karnataka-hc-imposes-rs-5-lakh-cost-on-eshwar-khandre-917615.html

The plan is to give bicycles for students of class 8 and 9, during the next academic year,” explained an official.  As per the information from the department, ever since the free bicycle distribution programme started in 2006-07, this is for the first time that bicycles are not being provided to kids.  “There had been delays for some years. But the government had never stopped the programme. This year, due to unavoidable circumstances, we are forced to withhold the process,” another official said.  Officials said the tender process alone will require three to four months. “By then, the academic year itself will get over. Hence, we have decided to defer the distribution of cycles to next year,” the official said. An estimation by the department revealed that at least 5.5 lakh cycles are required this academic year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-no-bicycles-for-schoolkids-this-academic-year-917622.html

Its president Dr B T Rudresh funded the construction with his own savings. The board is an autonomous body under the Department of Health and Family Welfare and was set up in 1973 to bring about uniformity of training and codify professional standards of homoeopathy. It represents 15,000 registered homoeopathic practitioners in the state. It was earlier functioning out of a rented premises in the campus of the Directorate of AYUSH. The office space was not sufficient to manage the growing number of registered practitioners and the general public visiting the office to seek information on homoeopathy. Spread over a quarter acre, the new building will have a library, a free homoeopathic dispensary, a counselling centre and a public utility auditorium, besides the officespace. Dr Rudresh told DH: “I donated my entire salary and admissible perks amounting to Rs 50 lakh for the construction of the office complex. “With some other measures, we could save up another Rs 30 lakh without any financial burden to the government or to the board. In all, Rs 80 lakh was mobilised for the Homeopathy Bhavan’s construction.” The bhavan will be inaugurated by Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa and Health and Medical Education Minister Dr K Sudhakaron Friday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-homoeopathic-board-has-new-building-fully-funded-by-its-president-917309.html

The people of Kudligi and Sandur taluk have sought that they be brought under Vijayanagara district.

He said that the formation of new district would have no meaning if Kudligi was not included in it. He even warned of launching a protest if Kudligi was left out from the new district. Meanwhile, Srishaila Aldalli, the leader of Janasangrama Parishad said that the new district would be "unscientific" if Sandur, situated at a distance of 28 km from Hosapete was not included. In a Facebook post, he stated that Sandur was close to Hosapete than Ballari and it would be easy for Sandur residents to travel to the district headquarters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/new-district-splits-people-along-taluk-lines-917314.html

The two-day fair is likely to be shorn of its attractions, especially the groundnut sale along the stretch of Bull Temple Road, and will be restricted to the temple premises. The fair is held annually on the last Monday of ‘Kartika’ month with farmers lining the road with heaps of groundnuts along with vendors selling traditional artifacts and fancy items. However, fearing the Covid spread, Basavanagudi MLA Ravi Subramanya has written to the Muzrai commissioner to restrict the celebration to the temple and ban sales outside. Similarly, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has written to the Endowment Department to ban traders from setting up stalls and only hold rituals in the temple. “As the fair attracts huge  crowds, we have recommended barring traders from selling on footpaths. We want a simple celebration keeping the pandemic in mind,” Veerabhadra Swamy, joint commissioner (South), BBMP, said. The executive officer of the Bull Temple has also sought permission from the deputy commissioner (Muzrai) to hold a symbolic event in the presence of priests, invitees and officials. Since farm produce was exempted from lockdown, the Muzrai department may seek permission for groundnut sale.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/covid-19-shadow-on-kadalekai-parishe-in-bengaluru-917318.html

Singh is expected to visit Bengaluru soon and meet state leaders. A section of party leaders are also of the view that Yediyurappa might have ordered formation of the Maratha Development Corporation and Veerashaiva-Lingayat Development Corporation to consolidate his power in the state. Several ministerial aspirants are waiting to join the Cabinet and any further delay in accommodating them would leave Yediyurappa fighting disgruntlement. There are seven vacant ministerial berths. This is the second time the party’s leadership has kept Yediyurappa waiting. In September, too, Yediyurappa visited New Delhi and spent three days, failing to get their approval. During their meeting, Yediyurappa is said to have even discussed the possibility of reshuffling his Cabinet by dropping a few ministers and inducting new faces. But Nadda assured him that the central leadership would decide soon.  Emerging out of the meeting, Yediyurappa told reporters that he sought Nadda’s permission to expand or reshuffle his Cabinet by inducting new faces before the start of the winter session of the Legislative Assembly. “Nadda assured me that I will get an intimation from the central leadership on its decision in 2-3 days,” he said. “The national president said he will communicate to me after discussions with other leaders,” Yediyurappa said. To a question whether he will take up a reshuffle or expansion, the CM said, “It will depend on the direction given by Naddaji. Unless I get communication from them, I can’t tell.” Yediyurappa is under pressure to induct MLCs A H Vishwanath, R Shankar and M T B Nagaraj -- who helped the BJP return to power. He has also promised a berth to eight-time MLA Umesh Katti. Plus, Yediyurappa would have to keep space for Munirathna following his Rajarajeshwarinagar bypoll win. Yediyurappa said he also discussed his government’s development initiatives in the state. “Nadda said he will tour Karnataka for three days as part of his 100 days all-India tour,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/b-s-yediyurappa-fails-to-get-nadda-nod-for-cabinet-reshuffle-917319.html
19-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Premium Floor Area Ratio draft rules for Karnataka out||Citizens who want to buy premium floor area ratio (FAR) will have to shell out 50% of the guidance value of the additional area that they will construct using the extra space, according to draft rules notified by the government.   The premium FAR is expected to bring revenue to the government while also giving a fillip to vertical growth in the real estate sector. FAR is the ratio of the total plot area to the total building area, and is determined by the size of the plot and width of the road in front of the plot.  First mooted three years ago under the draft common zoning regulations, the Urban Development Department (UDD) has now published the Karnataka Planning Authority (Amendment) Rules, 2020 that is open for citizen feedback. This comes after the government recently amended the Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act.  Calculation of premium FAR charges will be based on guidance value of the additional (notional) land and guidance value of the building. Sample this: If a building site measures 1,000 sqm and the permissible FAR is 2.5, then the total allowable built-up area will be 2,500 sqm. If the premium FAR is 1 and the guidance value of the building site is Rs 50,000, then the charges applicable will be 50% of the increase in value of land and building, working out to Rs 16,500 per sqm, according to an illustration by the government.   All civic bodies governed under the Act will be allowed to levy charges for the additional FAR in “impact zones of transport infrastructure projects and any other public infrastructure projects within the Local Planning Areas and in other areas of the approved Master Plans,” the draft rules state.  The rules will be applicable to all cities in the state. However, individual civic bodies will have to take a final call on implementing it. Currently, only Mangaluru City Corporation is selling premium FAR in its limits. According to the existing Bengaluru master plan, the maximum permissible FAR is 3.25. Money collected through premium FAR charges will be used by the local planning authority towards development. According to the draft rules, 50% of the charges collected should be utilised for acquisition of land reserved for roads and road widening. Another 50% will be used for development of infrastructure. Satish Bangalore, managing director, Skydealz India Property Services, welcomed the move. “On the one hand, this will help developers get more returns on investment, while making houses more affordable for buyers,” he said. However, he said the government should sanction FARs only in areas with relevant road width. Otherwise, premium FAR will lead to traffic congestion, he warned.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/premium-floor-area-ratio-draft-rules-for-karnataka-out-917321.html

Sources attributed this to a fallout Maramkal had with one of Yediyurappa’s family members. Both Prakash and Maramkal are Lingayats, the dominant community to which Yediyurappa belongs.

19-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka MLAs, ministers lobby as Cabinet mystery lingers||Some ministerial aspirants held talks with BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel on Thursday even as Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa said he was awaiting word from the party’s central leadership on whether he should expand or reshuffle his Cabinet.  Chief minister’s political secretary M P Renukacharya, Mayakonda MLA N Linganna, Navalgund MLA Shankar B Patil Munenakoppa are said to have reached out to Kateel, apparently to secure his support to become ministers.  Yediyurappa’s Cabinet has seven vacant berths and there are over a dozen ministerial aspirants. If the top brass goes for a reshuffle, Yediyurappa will have to drop some incumbent ministers to make way for fresh faces.  Hectic political activity has come to the fore with ministers lobbying to secure their place on one side and legislators ganging up to mount pressure to bag ministerial berths on the other side.  CM waits for nod Earlier in the day, Yediyurappa told reporters that he was awaiting directions from the BJP top brass. “Delhi will clear it in 2-3 days. What next will be decided once Delhi clears it,” he said.  While ministerial aspirants wait, disgruntlement is brewing. “It’s been one and a half years since our party came to power. It’s time that some incumbent ministers are dropped. This is the opinion of many legislators. There are many MLAs who have won 2-3 times who need to be given an opportunity,” Renukacharya, a ministerial aspirant, said. “But ministers are lobbying to stay on, by holding meetings. In that case, we told Kateel that we MLAs will also hold separate meetings,” he added.    There is also heartburn among a section of BJP MLAs over the possibility of MLC C P Yogeeshwar being inducted as a minister. Their grouse is that Yogeeshwar should not be made a minister as he lost the 2018 Assembly elections.  Kateel is said to have subtly told ministerial aspirants to stay put till BJP Karnataka incharge Arun Singh takes stock of the situation. Some say the Cabinet expansion or reshuffle will not happen until after the winter session of the legislature that is scheduled to start on December 7 and end on December 15.  “MLAs had come to discuss about their constituencies and the party’s organisation ahead of the panchayat elections,” Kateel said. “I have already advised ministers to respect MLAs and address their problems,” he said, when asked about the disgruntlement among MLAs.  Expanding the Cabinet is the CM’s prerogative, Kateel added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-mlas-ministers-lobby-as-cabinet-mystery-lingers-917626.html
19-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Small chance of Covid surge after schools reopen in Karnataka: experts||As the government mulls reopening schools amid the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak, medical experts said a surge in cases is likely to occur depending on how much children end up driving disease transmission. “We still do not know about the level of transmissibility of the virus by children, but some studies have shown that transmissibility is low,” said Dr Gnanam R, consulting emergency paediatrician with Manipal Hospitals, Old Airport Road. Speaking to a large online audience comprising parents and medical professionals brought together for a specially curated session organised by DH on Thursday, Dr Gnanam and Dr Jagadish Chinappa, consulting paediatrician at Manipal Hospitals, examined the issue of school reopening and Covid-19 preparedness. Parents expressed not only fear over children developing complications due to the disease, but also that they will bring the disease home to infect vulnerable adults. Birmy Bastian, a parent, said “many parents with comorbidities or other high-risks could potentially orphan their children if exposed to the disease brought home from school.” The concern has some validity. Studies showed that disease rates from school-going children may have contributed to a second wave of Covid-19 cases in Israel. A South Korean study of nearly 6,000 patients which was published in Emerging Infectious Diseases in July found those aged 10 to 19 spread the virus as much as adults did. Dr Sankarshana Thimmarayappa, an ENT specialist, suggested that the government declare the 2020-2021 academic year a zero year. “The government is hiding data on the Covid outbreak for economic reasons and is opening schools. There is a risk that the system will be inundated as before,” he said, adding that paediatric infrastructure is extremely limited in Bengaluru, and could potentially not be able to handle a large inflow of child Covid-19 cases.  Dr Chinappa said most children do not develop serious symptoms of the disease, which means less hospitalisation is required. “A combination of preventive measures including staggering classes and adherence to social distancing measures could potentially address the problem,” he said. “We simply cannot restart classes in the old way. The government must carry out a risk assessment and consult all stakeholders, especially parents, before taking the decision to open schools,” he said. At the same time, monitoring outbreaks in schools could be challenging as, Dr Gnanam clarified, regular testing of children before entry into schools is also not viable as it is not easy to collect swab samples from children. Besides, regular testing has a negative impact on the mental health of adolescents and teens. Chinappa said children are also at the tail end of priorities for a vaccine, as the degree of severity of the disease among children is low.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/small-chance-of-covid-surge-after-schools-reopen-in-karnataka-experts-917627.html

A circular-cum-advisory issued by the state Directorate of Health Services last week said the second wave of the pandemic is likely in January-February and asked officials concerned to ramp up Covid-19 testing in the state. It also asked authorities to identify potential 'super-spreaders', like grocery shop owners, people providing door-to-door services, those working in the transport field, labourers, security guards deployed in housing societies, police and home guards. "Several European countries are witnessing the second wave of Covid-19 currently. On the basis of that there is a possibility we may also get a second wave in January- February," said the circular. It has asked district administrations, municipal corporations, and medical officers to ensure there is no laxity in laboratory testings, and asked them to do all testings as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), there should a ratio of 140 tests per million population, it said. The circular also asked authorities to continue the survey of people having an influenza-like illness, with the help of flu centres in urban and rural areas of the state. The house-to-house survey and contact-tracing should be done on war-footing, the circular said, and also asked to take proper care and screening of co-morbid population. Authorities have also been asked to ensure better bed management of Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients in hospitals. The government has also asked the district and civic administrations to ensure an uninterrupted supply of oxygen and proper management of ambulances in hospitals. "People have been advised to wear masks and follow all the social distancing and hygiene norms such as regular hand wash, avoiding spitting in public areas and unnecessary travel," Health Services Director Dr Archana Patil said in the circular. Pune Collector Rajesh Deshmukh told PTI that as the number of infections has seen a decline in the district, the administration had allowed hospitals to use oxygenated COVID-19 beds for non-coronavirus treatment, but if the need be, they can be taken over again. "We are fully prepared to handle any situation. We have everything in place, be it testing, infrastructure or manpower," he added. Maharashtra's Covid-19 tally has gone up to 17,57,520 with the state reporting 5,011 new cases of infection on Wednesday. With 100 new deaths recorded on Wednesday, the state's death toll rose to 46,202, according to the health department.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-officials-asked-to-ramp-up-covid-19-testing-ahead-of-2nd-wave-917412.html

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in a statement hit out at the Shiv Sena over its worker "threatening" the shop owner, and asked Mumbai police to take cognisance, saying this the last thing the city needs during a pandemic.

Sawant on Thursday said that his government would be lifting a self-imposed ban on government recruitment and undertaking new development projects on November 30. "The office memorandum was issued in March because of Covid which had weakened the financial situation of the state. We have taken a review now and the financial situation has improved considerably. The memorandum will be lifted from November 30 and from December 1, new projects will be undertaken," Sawant told reporters outside the Chief Minister's official residence in Panaji. The ban had been imposed by the Sawant-led administration in order to focus energies on the Covid-19 pandemic, along with a series of austerity measures to curtail excessive funding. "There are around 10,000 vacancies in various departments right now. Most departments have vacant posts. Ads will be issued for recruitment to the new posts soon," Sawant said. The announcement of the job bonanza is crucial considering elections to 11 municipal councils and two zilla panchayats are expected to be held over the next couple of months and the announcement of the code of conduct for the twin polls is expected to be made soon. The polls were postponed on two occasions on account of the pandemic, which has claimed over 650 lives in the coastal state.

The curfew will be effective from 9 pm to 6 am till further notification. During this period, only shops selling milk and medicines will be permitted to remain open. The city will have a complete curfew from Friday night to Monday morning. "It is further clarified by way of abundant caution that complete curfew is imposed in the city of Ahmedabad from 9.00 pm: 20/11/2020 to 23/11/2020 6.00 am. The night curfew every day from 9.00 pm to 6.00 am shall continue thereafter as well," a government statement said.  Hours after announcing the decision, the state government also postponed the reopening of schools and colleges which were scheduled to resume from November 23.  The government had lifted the night curfew in August as part of easing curbs after the pandemic situation showed signs of improvement. The health department reported 1,340 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours, out of which Ahmedabad city reported 230. The state reported seven deaths due to the virus, of which three patients died in Ahmedabad. These are the highest numbers since mid-October. The curbs were relaxed before Diwali, allowing the market to remain open till midnight which led to large gatherings of people, ignoring the social distancing and other Covid-19 guidelines. With the number of infected persons increasing, pressure on designated Covid-19 hospitals has started mounting leading to scarcity of beds, doctors and other medical facilities.  Announcing the decision, additional chief secretary Rajiv Kumar Gupta said that besides imposing a curfew, the government has increased nearly 1,300 beds in Covid-19 hospitals in government as well as private hospitals in Ahmedabad. He added that there are 2,347 beds available in government hospitals and over 500 in private hospitals. Besides, 600 additional doctors and medical students are being roped in Ahmedabad to manage the crisis. Meanwhile, three sitting judges of the Gujarat High Court have also got infected with the virus in the last 10 days. Sources in the high court administration said that the three judges have been advised home isolation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/night-curfew-in-ahmedabad-from-november-20-as-covid-19-cases-spike-917565.html
19-11-2020||West||Goa's beaches have a stinging problem, and it's not Covid-19||Jellyfish appear to be adding a sting in Goa's tourism revival tale. As many as 90 tourists and beachgoers have been stung by jellyfish, schools of which have been preying along Goa's famed beaches over the last 48 hours, forcing the state's private lifeguard service to issue an advisory and advise caution while wading into sea water. "Over 90 cases of jellyfish stings were reported along the coast between yesterday and today. Drishti lifesavers posted along the beach were inundated with first aid cases related to jellyfish stings," a statement issued by the private lifeguard agency Drishti Marine late on Thursday said. "In one particular incident which occurred in Baga, a male who went parasailing developed chest pain and experienced breathing difficulty after being stung by a jellyfish. As he was short of breath, oxygen was administered while an ambulance was called for and the victim was rushed to the hospital," the statement said. The jellyfish attack comes at a time when Goa's tourism prospects are witnessing a revival of sorts after the crippling pandemic and lockdown, with tourists slowly trickling into the state. Most of the cases were reported along the state's most popular beach stretch from Sinquerim beach to Baga beach in North Goa. A jellyfish sting often results in mild irritation, but a sting from particularly toxic species of jellyfish can require expert medical care. The advisory issued by Drishti Marine has urged tourists "to be cautious of the presence of jellyfish that could possibly be present in the waters or along the shoreline". "If stung by a jellyfish inform the nearest lifesaver or approach the lifesaver tower. Wash the stung area with hot water (as hot as you can stand it) as heat further breaks down the toxins. Generously spray the stung area with vinegar. It is known to diffuse any poison that may be more active in the nematocysts present in the tentacles," the advisory also said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/goas-beaches-have-a-stinging-problem-and-its-not-covid-19-917589.html
