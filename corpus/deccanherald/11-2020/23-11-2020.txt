Officials are expected to present Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa with the information and options to consider on the matter on Monday and a decision may be taken immediately. Yes, there is a case for reopening schools as they have been closed since March and online classes haven’t been quite satisfactory from anybody’s point of view — students, parents or teachers. Yes, we are rapidly approaching a time when governments will have to decide whether to declare the current academic year a zero year or to use only online classes and assignments to promote students to the next class. Yet, it’s cold winter now and many parts of the world and the country are seeing a surge in Covid-19 cases, whether one chooses to call it a second wave or a continuation of the first being immaterial. In Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh, a new rise in Covid-19 cases has forced those governments to declare new restrictions such as night curfews. The Centre is rushing special teams to Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and other states to help them contain the surge. The Centre is considering not holding the winter session of Parliament at all in view of the situation in Delhi. While Karnataka is said to be seeing a declining curve – as opposed to over 80,000 new cases recorded in the first 20 days of October, the same period in November has seen only just over 21,000 -- Health Minister K Sudhakar has warned of a potential second wave of Covid-19 and has urged people to continue to be cautious and observe measures such as wearing masks and maintaining physical distance. These measures cannot be effectively observed once schools reopen. When it is being seen that most adults on the streets are not observing these precautions, it would be foolhardy to expect schoolchildren to do so. The experience from reopening colleges must also inform the decision on schools. Colleges have seen very thin attendance since they have reopened, forcing authorities to go back to online classes only. Most students have wisely stayed away from the colleges, given that there is no way to assuredly protect oneself against the spread of the virus. While it is all well to provide guidelines to schools on how to prepare for reopening and conducting classes, one can be sure from the record that these guidelines will be observed mostly in the breach. Providing safe transportation, conducting Covid-19 testing at schools, ensuring that school staff and children maintain precautions at all times are all things that cannot be enforced. Even if they could be done, parents still cannot have the confidence that it is safe to send their children to school.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/defer-reopening-of-schools-918841.html

The central government has imposed a 30-day moratorium on the bank on the recommendation of the RBI, and it has given an assurance to depositors and employees. The regulator has also announced a draft scheme for amalgamation of the bank with the Indian unit of DBS Bank, a bank controlled by the Singapore government, which will take over all the assets and liabilities of the LVB. The situation in the wake of the collapse of the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank last year, which created much misery and hardship for most depositors, may be averted. The choice of DBS as the rescuer is appropriate for many reasons. It would be difficult for a bank in India to effect such a deal. DBS is bringing upfront an additional capital of Rs 2,500 crore to the distressed LVB, whose capital base has badly eroded, NPAs have shot through the roof and all other parameters have deteriorated. DBS is an Indian subsidiary, not a branch of a foreign bank, and so will be subject to Indian laws and the RBI’s regulatory scheme. Its gain is that it will inherit 563 branches, 974 ATMs and Rs 20,973 crore of deposits. One downside of the deal for LVB’s investors, especially minority shareholders, is that they will lose all their money because the entire paid-up capital and services will be written off, reducing the shares to zero value. The investors’ concern is legitimate, but the norm to be followed in such situations is that primacy should be given to depositors’ interests.  While the measures taken by the RBI are welcome, there is a view that the regulator could have acted before the crisis reached this stage and the rescue process could have been scripted differently. The RBI had placed the bank under its Prompt Corrective Action framework in September 2019. The crisis kept worsening while many inadequate solutions were considered, and finally the RBI had to act. There was a case for a detailed valuation exercise and invitation of bids from interested parties to decide who offered the best terms and conditions for the rescue act. It is also a matter of concern that there are increasing cases of collapse of financial firms. In the last two years, LVB is the fifth firm to collapse, after IL&FS, Dewan Housing Finance, Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank and Yes Bank. Many smaller firms have also gone under. There is a need for greater caution in the months ahead, as Covid-19 may make the situation worse.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/learning-lessons-one-bank-collapse-at-a-time-919210.html
23-11-2020||In Perspective||Decelerating rural-urban migration ||The Covid-19 pandemic outbreak in India has caused a severe economic and employment distress. A major result of this is the migration of nearly four crore urban unorganised workers back to their native villages, that are poor in productivity and income.  This has entailed migration from general manifold urban misery into rural poverty and chronic lack of employment opportunities, of capital and entrepreneurial initiative and investment, and high increase in multi-dimensional poverty.  Migration of rural youth to towns and cities is general, traditional and expected and is looked at as a necessary, inevitable part of the development process.  But this pandemic-induced reverse migration has laid bare the accrued infirmities, rather the unprepared and ill-planned urban apparatus to receive and retain migrants from villages - lack of amenities like housing, transport, potable water, sanitation, electricity, of access to Public Distribution System (PDS) grain, facilities for education of children, health, social security etc.  Retaining rural youth in their native villages has gained importance provoking compunctions about extant urbanisation policies and measures.  Though urbanisation is supposed to be planned through the creation of satellite towns, special economic zones (SEZs), smart cities and countervailing census towns, these have remained ineffective and bigger cities have become ever overcrowded.  This Covid-provoked accentuation is manifest in reverse migration to poor native villages, particularly in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Also, complementarily, we have plans and the idea of creating or provision urban amenities/facilities in rural areas, the well acclaimed PURA (Provision of Urban Amenities to Rural Areas).  With regard to expenditure affordability and allocations for creating or augmenting civic amenities, doing it in smaller towns is easier financially as well as logistically. Also, neighbouring rural areas will benefit both from non-traditional employment opportunities and incomes. Skill training of youth also gets a possible socio-economic inducement or Philip—demonstration effect.    Clearly, retaining village labour in their native places involves creation of employment opportunities and increased incomes or wages to the employed. Since 2006, this effort towards rural employment has taken the form of MNREGA (The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005)  -  working as benchmark wages and decelerator of drift migration to larger towns and cities.  This has created millions of man days of employment variously in states and ensured additional incomes to rural people and women. Also, in turn, retention of youth and girls from rural areas in schools, and skill training for additional years has been noticed. International agencies have acknowledged this and poverty-reduction and steady increase in rural incomes is noticeable. Provoked by the politico-economic-social pressures, 2020-’21 has witnessed an increased allocation of Rs 1.1 lakh crore for this employment-poverty alleviation, rural productivity enhancement programme.  This has entailed various rates of daily wages anywhere from Rs 202 in Uttar Pradesh and Rs 260 in Goa. Setting aside the question or issue of comparability with sanctioned minimum wage, this MNREGA payment has acted as additional incomes to the family, particularly women. The latter are thus got to be treated with dignity in families and their neighbourhood.  Urban distress In response to growing poverty and unemployment and urban distress owing to Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, an urban employment programme has also been suggested—Decentralised Urban Employment and Training scheme (DUET).  As far as possible, this has to be put in place and requires planning and organisation, allocation and deploying due manpower. But, in view of the need and tradition of higher levels of wage in urban areas, DUET will entail far larger allocations. Funds needed for one unit of DUET jobs will possibly suffice for creation of two units of rural MNREGA jobs. Moreover, urban unemployment is far more readily manifest and DUET, if implemented, will provoke greater urgency.  Complementarily, retaining more people in rural areas through MNREGA and other kinds of farm and non-farm activities and investment, dry land farming, transport, cold storage, construction, rural roads, water body refurbishing etc, unemployment distress can be overcome locally.  Sustained reaching of additional incomes to the rural poor will result in the prospect of capital investment at the individual level including in manpower improvement over the next generation. This holds out the hope for lowered poverty in the next generation, over the next 8-10 years.  Provoking productivity improvements in rural areas, dry land farming and nutrition reach will pave the way for all-round economic development, spilling over to industry and urban areas in an entirely organic or continuum way.

23-11-2020||In Perspective||Combating malnutrition requires granular approach||Malnutrition rates have been declining in India, but the absolute numbers of stunted (short for age) (46.6 million), wasted (low weight for height) (25.5 million), and anaemic children (73 million under-3 children) are still a concern. With a prodigious challenge of triple burden of malnutrition -- under-nutrition, over-nutrition and micro-nutrient malnutrition -- facing India and due to the cultural and geographical variance across states, combating malnutrition requires a granular approach. Achieving the World Health Assembly’s Global Nutrition Target of a 40% reduction in the number of under-5 stunted children and to reduce wasting to less than 5% by 2025 is challenging. According to the recent CNNS survey, 35% of under-5 children in India were stunted while 17% were wasted. Hence, efforts to reduce malnutrition must be accelerated. Malnutrition is multi-factorial, caused by the lack of wholesome and nutritious food, poor hygiene and sanitation, frequent illness, poor care practices, and lack of access to services. Most of these are preventable or treatable through effective health and nutrition interventions. Maternal literacy, status of women in society, economic and social factors including poverty and income distribution are strong determinants of child health and influence care practices at home. Hence, we find higher levels of malnutrition in rural areas, especially among ST families. In a study published in Lancet in 2013, researchers found that scaling up proven nutritional interventions to 90% coverage could reduce global stunting by 20% and under-5 child mortality by 15%. The key health and nutrition interventions which are already a part of Government of India (GoI) programmes include ante-natal care (ANC) coverage, iron and folic acid supplementation, institutional delivery, early and exclusive breastfeeding, timely and age-appropriate complementary feeding, complete immunisation, growth monitoring with special focus on severe and acute malnutrition (SAM) and moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) identification and referral. Multiple initiatives have been taken up by GoI to address malnutrition, including welfare schemes like Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), Poshan Abhiyaan, Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, Anaemia-mukt Bharat, health schemes like Mission Indradhanush, Intensified Home-based Newborn Care, livelihood promotion through MGNREGS, sanitation and hygiene through Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan, etc., to improve nutritional status. However, according to NFHS-4, only 21% of pregnant women had full ANC check-up, 41.6% of infants were breast-fed within one hour of their birth, 54.9% were exclusively breast-fed for six months, 42.7% were given timely complementary food, and about 9.6% of under-2 children received an adequate diet. Full immunisation coverage was also 62% only among infants 12-23 months of age. The coverage of Supplementary Nutrition Programme (SNP component) of ICDS remains around 48% for children and 52% among pregnant women. Hence, while interventions on the supply side are critical in realising progressive nutrition outcomes, it is important to realise that the success of all these initiatives rests with the mother and the family, as they influence the demand and offtake of these suggested interventions. Evidence suggests that improving social capacities of beneficiaries – empowerment, self-efficacy, aspiration, agency and well-being – can play a key role in the degree to which people access and utilise nutrition services that are available to them, thus improving nutrition outcomes. Mothers need to be empowered with knowledge and a facilitative environment by involving communities and families, especially husbands. Extensive use of communication channels should be made to reach the mothers in their local language, with a solution to the issue at hand. Thus, the key to improving the outcomes is through change in the care giving behaviours of mothers. Reaching mothers through behaviour change communication to enhance their knowledge, attitude and practices with regard to availing ANC, institutional delivery, early and exclusive breast-feeding, timely and age-appropriate complementary feeding, inclusion of proper dietary diversity, immunisation and other services is crucial for reducing malnutrition. Women’s participation in groups such as self-help groups (SHGs) has shown effective and measurable impact on a range of health outcomes, such as maternal and neonatal mortality. This collective action by communities imparts a sense of psychosocial well-being, self-efficacy and confidence to the group members. By challenging restrictive gender norms, these groups are able to address the demand-side of programming. Preliminary findings from Uttar Pradesh (where 120 geographic blocks received intervention) and Bihar (where eight districts received intervention) suggest a significant increase in maternal and child-healthy behaviours. In just two years of integrating health programmes into self-help groups, there is a marked improvement in life-saving maternal health and newborn care practices. This has also helped to increase awareness and has generated a sense of ownership amongst the people towards resolving their health issues. By adopting a Jan Andolan strategy as outlined in Poshan Abhiyaan, there is an opportunity to forge a consensus around nutrition at the community level and raise awareness about malnutrition as a problem that the community must collectively act upon.

In the report, the place where she underwent Covid test was referred to as ‘Shivamogga Institute of Medical Sciences’. However, the seal by the district surveillance officer had Shivamogga’s old spelling‘Shimoga’. Begum was scheduled to take the flight at 1.45 am on Saturday. Officials from Shivamogga district tried to explain the matter to the airline staff. They said the institute in question was a government hospital approved by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). However, all efforts went in vain. The woman had undergone Covid test on November 18 and she received the report on November 19. Zakir Hussain, brother of Chand Begum, said, “we tried our level best to convince the airlines staff to allow her to board the flight. When they did not heed our request, we had to return. Begum again underwent a Covid-19 test on November 21 in Mangaluru.” SpiceJet representatives said that the airlines was just following the guidelines issued by the Indian government and the authorities in the UAE. The rules stipulate that there should not be any error in the Covid negative certificate. “We have intimated the problem to officials in UAE and Chand Begum will be accommodated in the next flight,” the airlines said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/error-in-covid-19-report-spells-trouble-for-thirthahalli-woman-918884.html
23-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Covid-19 death rate negligible in children in Dakshina Kannada||Dakshina Kannada district has recorded more number of Covid-19 fatalities, but the death rate among children is negligible as per the statistics of the Department of Health and Family Welfare. The district has recorded 702 fatalities as of November 19. Of which, 159 are from other districts and nine from other states. No child between the age group of 5 years to 10 years has succumbed to Covid-19.  Although, one child has succumbed to the virus in the age bracket of 11 years to 15 years. One fatality was reported in the age bracket of 16 years to 20 years. Three fatalities were registered in children below five years of age. Eleven persons have succumbed to the virus in the age bracket of 21 years to 30 years; 42 persons in the age bracket of 31 years to 40 years and 70 persons in the age bracket of 41 years to 50 years while 574 persons in the age bracket of 51 years to 95 years have succumbed to the virus. Though the district administration and health department have been asking people not to delay in consulting doctors soon after noticing the symptoms, many a time, it is the late admission to the hospital and comorbid conditions that are responsible for fatalities in the district, Dakshina Kannada Covid-19 Nodal Officer Dr Ashok told DH. A total of 114 persons have died within 24 hours of admission to the hospital while 64 persons have breathed their last within 48 hours of admitting to the hospitals, he added. Covid deaths Of the 702 fatalities, the cause of 17 deaths was due to Covid-19. While 506 deaths were Covid-19-associated deaths, 173 were Covid-19-coincidental deaths, according to the statistics. ‘Be cautious’ Though the Covid-19 graphic continued to show a declining trend in Dakshina Kannada, the continuing of the same trend depends on how the people behave. If people continue to be cautious and follow the guidelines issued by Health Ministry like wearing a mask and maintaining social distance, there will be no problem, said Dr Ashok. From November 13 to 19, the total positive cases have come down to 1.31%. It was 16% in the past. The target for the district is to conduct 3,500 tests daily. With the increase in samples due to the reopening of final-year degree and PG classes, the lab at Wenlock Hospital has conducted 1,700 tests in a day recently. The first Covid-19 case was confirmed in the district on March 22 when a Dubai-bound youth from Bhatkal was tested positive. The first death was reported in the district on April 19 when a woman from Bantwal succumbed to the virus.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/covid-19-death-rate-negligible-in-children-in-dakshina-kannada-918900.html
23-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Higher education institutes must be set up in regional language: NAAC Director||National Assessment & Accreditation Council (NAAC) Director S C Sharma opined that higher educational institutes should be established in the regional language in each district. He noted this while speaking at a webinar on 'Challenges of higher education: the road ahead' organised by Sahyadri Arts college here on Monday. He suggested that the government should focus on establishing higher educational institutes in regional language in backward areas. Besides, the number of multidisciplinary universities should be increased in the country rather than inter-disciplinary universities. The New Education Policy formed by the Centre also advocates the same, he added. On quality and impact of researches carried out by universities, he said, the universities should give primary importance for quality research works and inventions. There is a need to conduct research work that would address the current issues of society, he stated. Kuvempu University Vice-Chancellor B P Veerabhadrappa said, higher educational institutes in the country are facing many challenges. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) is the major challenge. The government should focus on increasing it in higher education, he suggested. He said, the universities have the responsibility of enrolling girls in higher education. Kuvempu University has done it successfully. The current GER in higher education in India is 26.3%. The new education policy aims to increase it to 50% by 2035. Brazil's GER is 51.3%, China-49.1%. India is still far from many countries, he stated. Kuvempu University Registrar S S Patil, Sahyadri Arts College Principal K B Dhananjay, Sahyadri Arts College NAAC Convener Siraj Ahmed, teachers and students were present on the occasion.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/higher-education-institutes-must-be-set-up-in-regional-language-naac-director-919092.html

Due to shortage, they have been working without weekly holidays, incentives or other benefits of facilities. There is a shortage of 80 workers, approximately. Though the workers are trying to keep the city clean, it is not possible for them to clear the vacant sites and other places, where the residents dump garbage, if the door-to-door collection is delayed.  There are 80 permanent workers in Hassan City Municipal Council (CMC), 105 workers on direct contract and 20 outsourced. Besides, there are 35 garbage auto drivers. As the CMC does not have the power for direct recruitment of workers, it is managing the work with available workforce. A civic worker said that around 20 workers were infected with Covid-19 and were cured after treatment. "The remaining civic workers had to face the burden, during their absence. The administration should provide special facilities for the civic workers, who work hard to keep the city clean. Though many have been working for the CMC, for more than 10 years, they have not been regularised," he complained. Parashuram, supervisor of the contract workers, said, "All measures are being taken to keep the city clean, with available pourakarmikas. The residents too dump garbage at public places, which adds to the burden of the workers. Those disposing garbage at public places should be penalised." CMC Commissioner Krishnamurthy said, "As per the government order, 50% of the appointments should be permanent and the remaining 50% on contract basis, under reservation. Most of the workers belong to SC/ST communities and many of them have been regularised." "Covid affected civic workers were provided treatment at the Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences and all have recovered. They are subject to test every month on the CMC premises," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/shortage-of-civic-workers-affects-waste-management-in-hassan-919138.html

Participating in the function at Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar Hall of the MCC, here, on Monday, the Mayor directed the Commissioner to initiate strict action against the erring officials, for breach of protocol. She said that earlier also, during the inauguration of the Dasara festivities, on October 17, atop the Chamundi Hill, the district administration had failed to follow the protocol in front of Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa. “Such violation has occurred for the third time in the MCC. Even though the officials concerned are present in the office, they did not care to inform me about the function. I got the information through a call from the Control Room. I will not tolerate such insult,” she said. She also said that the event was delayed, making the family members of the Covid warriors to wait for a long time. She alleged that the negligence of the officials was the cause of the delay. Cheques for Rs 30 lakh each, as compensation to the families of two civic workers, were distributed on the occasion. The event, which was earlier scheduled for Tuesday, was preponed for Monday, in the wake of the visit of the Chief Minister to Mysuru, on Tuesday and Wednesday. Tasneem, who was elected as the first Muslim woman mayor of Mysuru on January 18, said that due to the Covid crisis, she could not function properly and would appeal to the government, to see if it is possible to extend her term. Her one-year-term will end in mid-January 2021.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/mcc-mayor-tasneem-sore-over-officials-for-not-following-protocol-919139.html

Criticising the government over its response to Kannada activists who are protesting against the decision to set up the Maratha Development Board, Kumaraswamy said he was not opposed to the government's decision. “The state could have avoided a controversy by convincing pro-Kannada activists about the necessity for such a body,” he said. Kumaraswamy was speaking to reporters ahead of events held at Dasarahalli constituency on Sunday, to prepare for the upcoming BBMP elections. He also lashed out at Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah over the latter’s criticism of JD(S) aligning with BJP for the Mandya District Central Co-operative Bank elections. “Siddaramaiah should avoid discussing other parties,” he said, adding that Congress too had aligned with BJP in Chamarajanagar, Mysuru and Navalgund in Dharwad district.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/vokkaligas-deserved-a-corporation-first-hd-kumaraswamy-918817.html

As ‘necessity is the mother of inventions’, certain vicissitudes, natural or unnatural, extract the best of people in terms of innovation and salvation for survival. Covid-19 is a formidable health hazard necessitating standard operating procedures [SOPs] for our activities in a host of sectors. Prevalence of corona pandemic is a bewildering incident that has threatened human lives globally despite the phenomenal progress mankind has made in a slew of domains including science and technology. However, it is hoped that human ingenuity would succeed in redressing the miseries of this draconian disease of the present as well, as it did in the past in controlling several dreaded infectious diseases.  Good education is the driving force underneath any development schemes such as ‘perform, reform and transform’ and ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’. Deployment of digital technology for online and distance education henceforth will not be a temporary measure but is a long-lasting one with or without pandemics. The sooner our schools, colleges and universities train teachers and students alike in digital skills, the better it is for improvisation of academic activities. Use of today’s tools and technologies to surmount today’s challenges will greatly enhance the impact of teaching and learning. Sound and sustainable learning involves learning, unlearning and relearning. This mantra implies that our teachers must stay informed, updated and relevant to the profession. Nobody wants, much less in teaching, non-performers and deadwoods. It is the intellectual vigour and scholarship of our graduates that decide the pace of progress of a knowledge economy, and in this modulation, the role of conscientious, competent and technology-savvy teachers is indeed crucial. The pandemic Covid-19 has affected a large spectrum of our activities including the vital aspect - education. This has emerged as a great shock to our age-old, if not archaic, education system with the dual characteristics of teaching and learning in a ‘closed’ and well-established teacher-centric system. However, in today’s world, technology is indispensable to fields such as business, industry, health and education. In the corporate world, nearly 30% of employees have already started working from home [WFH]. Employees are also encouraged to work from anywhere [WFA]. Upskilling and reskilling are mandatory to retain jobs. In tandem with this scenario, a large number of new start-up enterprises for skilling - both technical and managerial staff - have sprung up in recent times. In the IT sector, it was reported that nearly 50% of the employees need reskilling. Someone who remains unskilled becomes obsolete and redundant.  Looking around, our teachers in schools, colleges and universities appear to be keeping their fingers crossed in a state of helplessness. Only a few private institutions are believed to have taken recourse to online education although its impact is yet to be assessed. It is gathered that majority of our teachers are either not atuned to offer online courses that require meticulous preparation and excellent articulation for effective communication or have no appetite for reorientation and relearning.  NEP-2020 This is really worrisome and frustrating. The objectives of the National Education Policy-2020, however lofty and laudable, cannot be realised unless our teachers at all levels develop a frame of mind to radically change their approach to teaching and learning. This is not an option but wanton obligation that mandates serious cognizance.  Inasmuch as the teachers need to reorient, our students also have to switch to new modes of online learning (barring laboratory exercises) by giving up the age-old practice of ‘rote learning’ -  a memory recall system based on well-preserved, if not fossilised, notes of teachers. The adaptive radical change is required by both sets of stakeholders. As regards plasticity to adopt new modes, this is not applicable to Covid-19 alone. In fact, nobody knows what is in store for us in the near/distant future in respect of natural and unforeseen disasters. Apart from medical, social and economic preparedness, we should now earnestly consider technological channels to ameliorate the impact of natural calamities. Therefore, it is inevitable that our system of education for the present as well as the one for future is adequately ‘loaded’ with learner-friendly keys and safeguards. No country can progress in the absence of a vibrant, productive and responsive education system. In private sectors, employees are compelled to switch jobs depending on exigencies. In the current trying situation, our teachers cannot remain docile, degenerative and obsolete by being complacent of job security and good salary. They have to respond to the vicissitudes of the situation and exhibit high degree of adaptability. Digital learning and online education shall stay even during the post-Covid period. Hereafter, we need to adopt a kind of hybrid strategy in that conventional classroom teaching is reinforced by virtual mode as a complementary approach to learning. Use of technology is not only the prerogative of elite schools and technical courses but is also quite relevant to a gamut of non-technical programmes. University degrees, either in singles or multiples, in course of time, may not be lifetime guarantees of jobs and careers.  The NEP-20 promises to rejuvenate our education  system through i) vocational and skill-oriented education ii) inclusion of technology like AI, robotics, cloud computing and machine learning iii) online learning and distance education iv) increased expenditure (6% of GDP) v) freedom to study the subject of choice, etc. The challenge is to implement its envisioned goals with passion, mission and aggression. Whether one desires it or not, future programmes of teaching-learning will be replete with technological innovations, invasions and interventions.  (The writer is former Vice Chancellor, University of Mysore and President, Forum of Former Vice Chancellors of Karnataka)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/main-article/reorienting-teaching-learning-918842.html
23-11-2020||Main Article||What the Bihar polls tell us about BJP, Cong and Owaisi||There are several takeaways from the recent Bihar elections: Despite all the State power and money power, the BJP did not win the largest number of seats; that credit goes to the Tejashwi Yadav-led Rashtriya Janata Dal. Despite being called the ‘Yuvaraj of Jungle Raj’, Yadav seemed to have captured the imagination of the people and almost ran away with victory, but for some grievously wrong calculations of his coalition partner Congress’ strength. Nitish Kumar, the three-term Chief Minister, is back in power, but without mandate, thanks to the strength of the BJP in the alliance. Congress has become irrelevant in the Hindi heartland states of UP, Bihar and MP (where it had won popular mandate but lost power). The Leftists have made a strong comeback, but most remarkable has been the success of the CPI (M-L), a party that, not long ago, did not believe in parliamentary democracy, but seems to have realised the value of popular mandate acquired through peaceful means. And finally, there is the emergence of Asaduddin Owaisi as a factor of political significance beyond the limits of Hyderabad city. Much has been written on the implications of the Bihar poll results. But what’s most significant in terms of an emerging trend is the rise of Owaisi as a possible pan-India Muslim leader. Owaisi, a politician from Hyderabad, parachuting into Bihar and contesting in the Muslim majority region of Seemanchal and taking away five seats has been seen by Congress leaders as an important factor for their debacle. An implied argument is that Owaisi was brought into the Bihar electoral scene by the BJP to deprive Congress of Muslim votes. This is a poor excuse for a party that lost 50 other seats where Owaisi made no difference. The importance of Owaisi is much larger. He could potentially reshape the nature of our politics. Before we examine the larger issue, certain facts first. The AIMIM began as Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) in 1927 as a party to support the Nizam of Hyderabad in his intent not to accede to the Indian Union in 1947. It aimed to form a Muslim Dominion, with Hyderabad as the capital of ‘South Pakistan’. By 1944, its new leader, Qasim Rizvi, set about organising the Razakars as the ‘storm troopers’ for the Islamist party to fight against annexation by the Indian Union. However, the ‘police action’ ordered by Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel quickly overcame the resistance and Qasim Rizvi was arrested and imprisoned from 1948 to 1957. He was released by the Nehru government on the condition that he would go to Pakistan, where he was granted asylum. Before Rizvi left for Pakistan, he handed over the reins of MIM to Abdul Waheed Owaisi, the grandfather of Asaduddin Owaisi.    The MIM, renamed as AIMIM in 1975, has held the Hyderabad Lok Sabha seat since 1984 and at present has two seats (one from Hyderabad and another from Maharashtra). It has a presence in the Legislative Assemblies of Maharashtra (2/288) and Telangana (7/119) and in the Legislative Council in Telangana (2/40). And now, with 5/243 seats in the Bihar Assembly, the party has opened a good account in a state where it failed in the 2019 parliamentary elections. Though the ideology of this party is ‘Islamic nationalism’, it claims to be a ‘secular’ party in its political position. Can a party openly promoting the sectarian interest of a community (whether majority or minority) claim to be secular? The truth is that the ‘soft-secularism’ of Congress led to the success of ‘hard-Hindutva’ of BJP, and the BJP’s majoritarian politics has now led to the AIMIM trying to aggregate Muslim votes under its banner. Neither Narendra Modi nor Asaduddin Owaisi are flattered by terms such as ‘secular’ and are happy doing what they do, because that gets them votes. Objectively speaking, in the long run, the aggregation of Muslim votes under one party, should actually work in favour of the BJP, for it helps to weaken the ‘centrist’ parties and narrows down the choice to either a Hindutva party or an Islamist party. And encouraging Owaisi could be part of such a plan. Fortunately, our society has not been so polarised yet, though no efforts have been spared by the ruling party in the last six years.   The more important question is, will Owaisi succeed in becoming a pan-India leader of the Muslims? Is Owaisi the ‘New Jinnah’ for the Muslims of India? Well, one thing can be said with certainty: the Muslims in India do not want another Jinnah, as they are yet to recover from the Partition of 1947. And nobody in their right senses would like to go to Pakistan, not even the Kashmiri youth who are fighting the Indian Army in the Valley. It must be noted, however, that the Muslim community is neither uniform nor homogenous in its social, cultural and economic conditions and aspirations across the country. A Muslim in Kerala or Karnataka has nothing in common with his co-religionists in UP and Bihar. So, Owaisi could well remain a marginal player. Moreover, Muslims have always found more resonance with the liberal, centrist mainstream parties rather than with Islamic parties. Owaisi might have won five seats in a Muslim majority region of Bihar, but the Mahagathbandhan has 13 Muslim MLAs, 8 from RJD, 4 from Congress and 1 from CPI (M-L). This should clearly inform Owaisi’s politics and his alignment. Despite this, if Owaisi wins a sizeable number of seats in the forthcoming Bengal elections, it will be clear as to who has done all the heavy lifting for him. Notwithstanding all this, India’s plural and multicultural politics cannot be held hostage to the demands of either Hindutva or Islamic nationalism. Both fail to fulfil the basic minimum promise made by ‘We, the people’ in the Preamble to our Constitution.

23-11-2020||National||Bharat Biotech says its Covid-19 vaccine 'Covaxin' will have 60% efficacy||"World Health Organization (WHO), United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), and Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) only approve a respiratory disease vaccine if it is at least 50 per cent effective," Executive Director of Quality Operations at Bharat Biotech Sai D Prasad told the publication. “Chances of the vaccine being less than 50 per cent effective are remote, as suggested by our trial results so far," the firm said indicating positive news for the largest clinical Covid-19 vaccine trial in India. According to the WHO guidelines, a “clear demonstration of efficacy (on a population basis) ideally with ∼50 per cent point estimate should be a minimum criterion for any acceptable candidate. The body also said that efficacy can be assessed against “disease, severe disease, and/or shedding," the report said. The indigenous vaccine, which is being developed by Bharat Biotech and ICMR, has received the approval of the CDSCO for initiating the third phase trial. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and privately-held Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech this month started third-stage trials of Covaxin, in a process that would involve 26,000 volunteers. It is the most advanced Indian experimental vaccine. Earlier, reports had suggested that Covaxin could be licensed by the second quarter of 2021.  "If we get all the approvals after establishing strong experimental evidence and data, and efficacy and safety data in our last stage of trials, we aim to launch the vaccine in Quarter 2 of 2021,” the company told the publication confirming the same. Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE reported final trial results that showed the vaccine was 95 per cent effective in preventing Covid-19. Five vaccine candidates are currently undergoing clinical trials in India. Among them, three that are in advanced stages of trials -- the Oxford-AstraZeneca candidate for which the Pune-based Serum Institute is conducting Phase 3 clinical trials, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin which is also in Phase 3, and Russia’s Sputnik V which is expected to start Phase 2/3 trials next week.

23-11-2020||National||Govt mulls air freight stations for fast transportation of Covid-19 vaccine: Report||The government is planning to set up air freight stations (AFS), an off-airport common user facility that offers service for handling and temporary storage of import and export cargo, for direct movement of vaccines from pharmaceutical factories to the aircraft. As per the plan, export and import clearances for cargo, including Customs activities will be provided at the AFS and it will be constructed near the sites of vaccine production. Other cross-border regulatory agencies such as the plant quarantine office and drug controller office will also be accommodated in the AFS. This move will help to reduce the dwell time, the time that a cargo consignment takes to leave the airport premises after obtaining all the Customs permits and security clearances. As per reports, in airports like Delhi and Mumbai, it takes more than 75 hours for a cargo consignment to get clearance whereas it is less than six hours in Singapore, Dubai, and Hong Kong airports. “We are discussing if it is possible to move vaccines directly from the factory to the aircraft. We are also discussing the concept and procedure with security agencies like the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security and Customs,” before adding that it is necessary for the vaccine to quickly reach to the aircraft from the manufacturing sites. The government is already planning to vaccinate a large population by mid-2021 and has formed a task force to carry out the operation. A sub-committee of this task force is focusing on building cold storage facilities and smooth transfers of vaccines from airports to vaccination centres. The Airports Authority of India’s (AAI’s) subsidiary AAI Cargo Logistics and Allied Services Company may be tasked with building the AFS if permitted by the government. The task force has also asked the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to ensure a faster approval process for overflight and landing permits for foreign freighter jets carrying vaccines. But, executives of private airports are learnt to have opposed the move. “Commercial business viability would be a challenge for airport operators as well as for AFS operators. Both will offer similar services, leading to work duplication, impacting the viability of airports that have invested in building cold chains,” an executive of a private airport told the publication. The chairman of Cargo Service Centre (CSC) Tushar Jani, which operates the cargo terminal at Mumbai airport, said the facility could handle eight 747 freighters daily. CSC has the capacity to handle 25,000 tonnes per month and is ordering 10 additional cool dollies.“We are ready to handle Covid-19 vaccine. Every day we handle 300 tonnes of pharma products, including 30-40 tonnes of vaccines,” he said The distribution of vaccines like Pfizer, which needs to be stored at minus 70 degree Celsius and Moderna, which needs to be stored at minus 20 degree Celsius will be challenging in India for such storage facilities are scant in the country. While the Covid-19 vaccines developed by the Indian companies are expected to have a storage requirement of 2-8 degree Celsius. “Most of the infrastructure here is geared to handle products in that temperature range,” Jani said. SpiceJet, which is the only passenger airline to have freighter aircraft, is looking to set up cold chains and temperature-controlled warehouses. "We have developed sufficient capacity for transporting Covid-19 vaccines,” an airline spokesperson said. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Sunday that a locally-developed Covid-19 vaccine candidate could complete its final trials in a month or two, raising hopes for a rapid roll-out across the country. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Bharat Biotech this month started third-stage trials of Covaxin, in a process that would involve 26,000 volunteers. It is the most advanced Indian experimental vaccine. The other experimental vaccines on trial in India are the one being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University that is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India; Russia's Sputnik-V; Zydus Cadila's ZyCoV-D and lastly one that Biological E Ltd is developing with Baylor College of Medicine and Dynavax Technologies Corp.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-mulls-air-freight-stations-for-fast-transportation-of-covid-19-vaccine-report-918908.html

Dhupelia’s sister Uma Dhupelia-Mesthrie confirmed that her brother died on Sunday of Covid-19 related complications after he contracted the disease in hospital where he had been under treatment for a month due to pneumonia. "My beloved brother has passed on after a month of illness with pneumonia, a superbug contracted in hospital and then Covid-19 also contracted while he was being treated. He suffered a major cardiac arrest this evening," Uma said in a social media post. Besides Uma, Dhupelia leaves back another sister, Kirti Menon, who lives in Johannesburg, where she is active in various projects honouring the memory of Gandhi. The three siblings are descendants of Manilal Gandhi, who Mahatma left behind in South Africa to continue his work in India after spending two decades in the country. Dhupelia, who spent most of his life in media, especially as a videographer and photographer, was also very active in assisting the Gandhi Development Trust to continue the work started by the Mahatma at the Phoenix Settlement near Durban. He was renowned for assisting the needy in all communities and was active in a number of social welfare organisations. Tributes poured in from his friends and dear ones. "I am in shock. Satish was a great humanitarian and activist," political analyst Lubna Nadvi said. "He was also a great friend of the Advice Desk for Abused Women, and always assisted the organisation in whichever way he could,” Nadvi added. Dhupelia was also a member of the Board of the 1860 Heritage Foundation, which on Monday November 16, commemorated the arrival of the first indentured labourers from India to work on the sugar cane fields of Durban. On the day, in one of his last Facebook posts, Dhupelia, who was known for his humour, wrote: "Let us also not forget that we still need to stand together to achieve our final goals of equality for all and an eradication of poverty”.

The CBI, in its affidavit of November 20, has told the apex court that the Tamil Nadu Governor has to take a call on grant of remission to Perarivalan. The CBI said Perarivalan is not the subject matter of further investigation carried out by the CBI-led Multi-Disciplinary Monitoring Agency (MDMA) which is conducting a probe on the aspect of “larger conspiracy” as per the mandate of the Jain Commission report. The top court is hearing the plea of 46-year-old Perarivalan seeking suspension of his life sentence in the case till the MDMA probe is completed. On November 3, the top court had expressed unhappiness over the pendency of a plea by a convict seeking pardon in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case for over two years with the Tamil Nadu Governor. The CBI, in its 24-page affidavit, said, “It is for the His Excellency Governor of Tamil Nadu to take a call on the issue whether remission is to be granted or not and in so far as relief is concerned in the present matter CBI has no role”. "Present petitioner is not the subject matter of the further investigation carried out by MDMA. The further investigation conducted by MDMA is only limited to the mandate provided to it by the Jain Commission Report…” it said, adding that a progress report by MDMA on further investigation and its status is submitted to the designated court in Chennai. The Jain commission of inquiry in the assassination of the former prime minister has recommended a probe into “larger conspiracy” by MDMA and it required monitoring/tracking of absconding suspects and the role of Sri Lankan and Indian nationals in the case. The probe agency further said that the top court had already on March 14, 2018, dismissed an application by Perarivalan for recall of the May 11, 1999 verdict of the top court, holding him guilty in the case. It said, “The claim of the petitioner that he is innocent and did not have knowledge about the conspiracy to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi is neither acceptable nor maintainable”. The top court had earlier asked the counsel for the petitioner, A G Perarivalan, whether the court can exercise its jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution to request the Governor to decide his plea of pardon filed under Article 161. Article 161 empowers a Governor to pardon a convict in any criminal case. The top court had said, “We don't want to exercise our jurisdiction at this stage but we are not happy that a recommendation made by the government is pending for two years”. The state government had earlier told the top court that the Cabinet has already passed a resolution on September 9, 2018, and recommended to the Governor for the premature release of all seven convicts in the case. The MDMA was set up in 1998 on the recommendations of the Justice M C Jain Commission of Inquiry which had probed the conspiracy aspect of Gandhi's assassination. Perarivalan's counsel had earlier said his role was only limited to procuring nine-volt batteries, which were allegedly used in the improvised explosive device (IED) that had killed Gandhi. The top court had earlier dismissed a plea of Perarivalan seeking recall of the May 11, 1999, verdict upholding his conviction. It had said the material brought on record before it does not inspire confidence to interfere with the verdict in which Perarivalan and three others were initially awarded the death sentence, which was later commuted to life term. Perarivalan's counsel had earlier said that he was just 19 years old when the incident took place and had no knowledge of what he was doing and for what purpose the batteries were purchased. Gandhi was assassinated on the night of May 21, 1991, at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu by a woman suicide bomber, identified as Dhanu, at a poll rally. Fourteen others, including Dhanu herself, were also killed. Gandhi's assassination was perhaps the first case of suicide bombing which had claimed the life of a high-profile leader. In its May 1999 order, the top court had upheld the death sentence of four convicts -- Perarivalan, Murugan, Santham and Nalini. In April 2000, the Tamil Nadu Governor had commuted the death sentence of Nalini on the basis of the state government's recommendation and an appeal by former Congress president and Rajiv Gandhi's widow Sonia Gandhi. On February 18, 2014, the top court had commuted the death sentence of Perarivalan to life imprisonment, along with that of two other prisoners -- Santhan and Murugan -- on the grounds of an 11-year delay in deciding their mercy pleas by the Centre.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rajiv-gandhi-assassination-case-convict-a-g-perarivalan-gets-1-week-parole-for-medical-check-up-918944.html

According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) mobile app, SAMEER, the city's air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 281 on Monday morning. It was 274 on Sunday. It was 251 on Saturday, 296 on Friday, 283 on Thursday and 211 on Wednesday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". The stations which recorded 'very poor' AQI include Anand Vihar, Ashok Vihar, Bawana, Dwarka sector 8, Jahangirpuri, Mundka, Narela and Rohini. The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi on Sunday had said that Delhi-NCR's air quality is likely to deteriorate on Monday due to unfavourable meteorological conditions. The central agency said the AQI is likely to deteriorate to the upper end of the "very poor" category between Tuesday and Friday. A total of 649 farm fire counts were observed over Punjab, Haryana and adjoining regions on Saturday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences'' air quality monitor, SAFAR. Stubble burning accounted for 12 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on Sunday. It was 13 per cent on Saturday, 15 per cent on Friday, 20 per cent on Thursday and eight per cent on Wednesday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhis-air-quality-remains-in-poor-category-918949.html

These include "collaborative contributions" from Russia, France, Sweden and Germany, sources in the Bengaluru- headquartered space agency said. ISRO was earlier eyeing June, 2023 for the country's first mission to Venus. "But we are currently reviewing this mission timeline due to delays arising from the pandemic situation", an ISRO official said. "Future launch opportunity is either in 2024 or 2026". It was noted that the optimal launch window (when Venus is closest to the Earth) comes about every 19 months. Of the Indian and international payload proposals it received in response to an announcement of opportunity for novel space-based experiments to study Venus, ISRO has short- listed 20. "These 20 payload (scientific instruments) proposals, including collaborative contributions from Russia, France, Sweden and Germany, are currently under review", the ISRO official said. The one already selected, according to French space agency CNES, is France's VIRAL instrument (Venus Infrared Atmospheric Gas Linker) co-developed with the Russian space agency Roscosmos, and the LATMOS atmospheres, environments and space observations laboratory attached to the French national scientific research centre CNRS. "Swedish Institute of Space Physics is engaged with India's mission to Venus", sources said. According to ISRO, scientific objectives of ISRO's Venus mission are investigation of the surface processes and shallow subsurface stratigraphy; and solar wind interaction with Venusian Ionosphere, and studying the structure, composition and dynamics of the atmosphere. Venus is often described as the "twin sister" of the Earth because of the similarities in size, mass, density, bulk composition and gravity. It is believed that both planets share a common origin, forming at the same time out of a condensing nebulosity around 4.5 billion years ago, ISRO had noted in its announcement of opportunity. Venus is around 30 per cent closer to the Sun as compared to Earth resulting in much higher solar flux. Exploration of Venus began in the early 1960s. Venus has been explored by flyby, orbiter, a few lander missions and atmospheric probes. "In spite of great progress made in exploring Venus, there still exist gaps in our basic understanding about surface/sub-surface features and processes, super rotation of Venusian atmosphere and its evolution and interaction with solar radiation/solar wind", ISRO had said. The payload capability of the proposed 2500-kg satellite, planned to be launched onboard GSLV Mk II rocket, is likely to be 175 kg with 500W of power. The proposed orbit is expected to be around 500 x 60,000 km around Venus. This orbit is likely to be reduced gradually, over several months to a lower apoapsis (farthest point).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-venus-mission-attracts-international-payload-proposals-918975.html

The SIM card was allegedly used for inciting violence during the protests here in February against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). A bench presided by Justice Ashok Bhushan rejected the appeal of the police against the October 23 order of the Delhi High Court granting bail to the accused. The HC had then noted that the police have not shown that he was party to a conspiracy to organise protests against the CAA. The police had invoked the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) against the accused alleging that the SIM card obtained on a fake ID was used to coordinate protests against the CAA. However, the high court had said in its order that there was no allegation against the accused, Faizan Khan, that he had "engaged in any form of terror-funding or such other ancillary activity". It had also said the embargo under the UAPA against the grant of bail would not apply in the instant case as the probe agency has not shown that the accused was party to any conspiracy to organise protests against the CAA.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-rejects-plea-of-delhi-police-challenging-bail-granted-to-man-in-riots-case-918977.html

In a statement, the guild said Mukhim's case is an example of how multiple legal provisions can be used against free speech and therefore against free press. The statement comes days after Mukhim resigned as member of Editors Guild in protest against what she called, the organisation's "complete silence" on the recent high court ruling which refused to quash an FIR against her and held her guilty of creating communal disharmony through her Facebook post in July. In its statement on Sunday, the guild said it is deeply concerned to see Padma Shri awardee and Editor of Shillong Times, Mukhim, being "dragged through a cumbersome criminal charge procedure that is borne out of a complaint on one of her social media posts". The criminal complaint was filed in response to her Facebook post in July 2020 over a skirmish between tribal and non-tribal youth in Lawsohtun at a basketball court. "Mukhim's case is a reflection of the larger threats to freedom of speech in India, which operates under an unwieldy framework of laws that are often used indiscriminately by government and law enforcement agencies to muzzle dissent," the guild said. "Several provisions across multiple laws give a handle to government agencies and law enforcement authorities to lodge criminal cases against journalists wherein the criminal complaint procedure itself becomes an exacting punishment, and acts as deterrent against exercise of free speech," it said. Media's prime responsibility is to question the affairs of the government and report information, however harsh and disturbing it may be, the guild said. They cannot be held liable for relaying information that may bring to fore details on fault lines within the society, or for that matter, mismanagement and corruption in government affairs, it said. The guild said it underlines the need for higher judiciary to take cognizance of these crucial issues that impede freedom of speech and issue guidelines to ensure that wanton use of laws does not serve as a deterrent to a free press.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/reflection-of-larger-threats-to-freedom-of-speech-editors-guild-on-case-against-meghalaya-scribe-918983.html

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan issued notice to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs seeking its stand on the petition by an individual who provides online content creating services. The petitioner, Dhruv Sethi, has contended that the rule under challenge forces sole proprietorships like his to register as an incorporated company for carrying out e-commerce business. Senior advocate Anand Grover and advocate Samyak Gangwal, appearing for Sethi, told the court that the effect of the impugned rule was that every business enterprise which is not a company is excluded from the e-commerce space or they will have to sell through platforms like Amazon or Flipkart. The bench, during the hearing, suggested that the petitioner can get listed on Amazon to sell his goods and services. To this suggestion, his lawyers said that then he would have to pay Amazon for the same which he would not have to do if he is selling it himself. The petition claims that the norm is beyond the rule making powers of the central government under the Consumer Protection Act. Sethi, who also sells custom merchandise like t-shirts through his portal 'Where Next Daily', has said he would be personally affected by the rule. He has contended that the rule is ultra vires the Constitution "as it discriminates against all forms of legitimate business organisations like sole proprietorships, limited liability partnerships, hindu undivided families, etc."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hc-seeks-centres-reply-on-plea-against-rule-to-register-e-commerce-business-as-company-918987.html
23-11-2020||National||Unnao custodial death: Delhi HC grants time to CBI for reply on Sengar's appeal against jail term||The Delhi High Court Monday granted time to the CBI to file status report on disqualified Uttar Pradesh MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar’s appeal challenging his conviction and 10-year imprisonment in the custodial death case of the Unnao rape victim's father. Justice Anu Malhotra directed the agency to submit its reply within two weeks to the plea and listed the matter for further hearing on January 12. The high court on November 6 issued notice to the CBI on Sengar’s appeal against his conviction and jail term and had also asked the agency to respond to his application seeking suspension of the sentence till the pendency of the appeal. During the hearing, CBI’s counsel sought more time to file the status report saying that the investigating officer of this case is also probing the UP’s Hathras rape case due to which he could not file the reply. Advocate Kanhaiya Singhal, representing Sengar, submitted that he has a strong case for suspension of sentence and let the CBI file its reply then he would advance his arguments. Sengar, who was also sentenced to the "remainder of his natural biological life" for raping the minor Unnao girl, was stripped of his membership on February 25 as the lawmaker of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly following his conviction in the rape case. The father of the rape victim was arrested at the behest of Sengar in the Arms Act and had died in custody on April 9, 2018 owing to police brutalities in custody. On March 4, Sengar, his brother and five others were convicted for the death of the victim's father in judicial custody by the trial court which on March 13, sentenced them to 10 years imprisonment. The trial court had also imposed a fine of Rs 10 lakh on Sengar. He has sought setting aside the verdict of the trial court by which he was convicted and sentenced in the case. In the appeal, he said, “It is imperative for a fair trial that the investigating agency, prosecution and witnesses present the true facts before the court and that the court, in turn, must ensure that a free and fair trial…” It said the trial must not only be fair but also remain free from biases and prejudices. It would not be preposterous to submit that in the instant case neither the justice was done nor seen to be done which has certainly shaken the confidence of the public in the entire justice delivery system. Sengar claimed this case was an offshoot of a long-drawn political rivalry and deep-seated animosity existing between two political factions. The trial court, which did not hold the accused guilty of murder under the IPC, awarded maximum sentence for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder to convicts under section 304 of the IPC after holding that there was no intention to kill. It had said "no leniency" can be shown for killing a family's "sole bread earner". The trial court, which sentenced all the convicts to maximum punishment under Indian Penal Code (IPC) section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and some other offences under the penal laws, also said that the four daughters and a son of the deceased has lost the protective cover of their father. Besides ten years in prison for culpable homicide, Sengar, his brother, the then in-charge of Makhi Police Station in Unnao Ashok Singh Bhadauria and then sub-inspector K P Singh, Vineet Mishra, Birendra Singh and Shashi Pratap Singh have been also sentenced for other offences. They were held guilty for the offences of criminal conspiracy, punishment for false evidence, giving false information respecting an offence committed, causing disappearance of evidence of offence, false charge of offence made with intent to injure, voluntarily causing hurt, wrongful restraint under the IPC and under the Arms Act. The court had earlier acquitted other accused -- constable Amir Khan, Shailendra Singh, Ram Sharan Singh and Sharadveer Singh -- giving them the benefit of doubt in the custodial death case. On December 20 last year, Sengar was sentenced to jail for "remainder of his natural biological life" in a separate case for raping the minor daughter of the deceased in 2017. The case was transferred to Delhi from a trial court in Uttar Pradesh on the directions of the Supreme Court on August 1 last year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/unnao-custodial-death-delhi-hc-grants-time-to-cbi-for-reply-on-sengars-appeal-against-jail-term-918993.html
23-11-2020||National||Bihar MLA from Owaisi's party takes oath in Urdu, but insists word 'Hindustan' be replaced with 'Bharat'||A controversy erupted on the floor of the Bihar Assembly on Monday when a legislator from AIMIM insisted that the draft for the oath in Urdu should have "Bharat", as it is in the Constitution, instead of the seemingly eclectic "Hindustan". The demand was made by Akhtarul Iman, state president of Asaduddin Owaisis AIMIM no sooner than he rose to take oath in Urdu. It left the pro-tem Speaker Jitan Ram Manjhi visibly bewildered who pointed out that as per convention those who take oath in Urdu said "Hindustan". The chair, however, permitted him to use the word Bharat. Iman whose party champions the cause of minorities while wearing its patriotism on the sleeves, was stormed by journalists who wanted to know why he had an objection to "Hindustan" which is used by people of the country in common parlance. The MLA replied "I had raised no objections. I had simply made a point that whenever we read the Preamble of the Constitution, in whichever language, it mentions the word Bharat. In the light of this fact I felt that since we are taking oath in the name of the Constitution, it would be proper if use the same term for the name of our country". He asserted that he had "no problems with the word Hindustan", having grown up reciting Iqbals famous poem "Saare jahaan se achcha, Hindustan hamaara" and appreciated "personal choice" exercised by leaders like Congress MLA Shakil Ahmed Khan who prefered to take oath in Sanskrit. He also dismissed suggestions that his stand would "hurt Urdu-speaking population" who have been opposed to Sanskritisation holding it to be an assertion of Hindu majoritarianism. However, the ruling NDA reacted with predictable distaste to the development, which helped All India Majlis-e-Ittehad- ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) hog some more limelight after having caused a splash in the assembly elections in which it won five seats and is said to have affected the outcome in a number of others. "Hindustan is a commonly used word but some people create unnecessary controversy in a bid to look different", said former minister and JD(U) MLA Madan Sahni. BJP MLA Neeraj Singh Bablu appeared nonplussed and remarked "those who have a problem with uttering Hindustan, should go to Pakistan".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bihar-mla-from-owaisis-party-takes-oath-in-urdu-but-insists-word-hindustan-be-replaced-with-bharat-918996.html

In 2019, a total of 2,93,993 accidents occurred on straight roads, which claimed 96,624 lives, while on curved roads, 60,888 accidents were recorded that killed 20,141 persons. Of the total road accidents in the country,  65.5 per cent happened on straight roads, while just 17.6 per cent occured on curved roads, according to Road Accidents in India-2019 data, prepared by Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. "Vehicle speed tends to be high on straight roads in open areas which corroborates the high percentage of road accidents and deaths," says the report. Due to potholes, a total of 4,775 accidents happened, which killed 2,140 persons last year. Among road junctions, T-Junctions were most dangerous as those witnessed 11,479 accidents and 2,083 deaths. With 4,173 accidents and 813 deaths, roundabout junctions are least dangerous. As per the Union Ministry of Road Transport data, a total of 449,002 accidents took place in the country during the calendar year 2019, leading to 151,113 deaths and 451,361 people being injuried. Earlier, Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said that the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has identified over 5,000 black spots on national highways and the process for their rectification, including temporary and permanent measures, is being carried out on urgent basis. So far, temporary measures on 1,739 newly identified black spots and permanent measures on 840 newly identified black spots have already been taken, he said. Under Indian Road Safety Assessment Programme, the Ministry assessed a total of 21,000 km roads are under technological upgradation. The Ministry officials are hoping that upgradation programmes will bring about a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/straight-roads-saw-more-accidents-than-curved-ones-in-2019-919021.html

Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, who appeared for the NCB, told a bench of Justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik that Sawant had been arrested on September 5 following due procedure and that there was nothing illegal about his arrest. ASG Singh was responding to a petition filed by Sawant in October this year claiming he had been arrested illegally by the NCB, and had sought a compensation of Rs 10 lakh. On Monday, Sawant's counsel, Amir Koradia, told the bench that contrary to NCB's claim, Sawant was arrested from his office in the city on September 4. "I should have, therefore, been produced before the magistrate on September 5 but this was done only on September 6," he said. ASG Singh, however, told the court that the above was not true. "The NCB has an arrest memo signed by him (Sawant) that says he was arrested and brought to the NCB office on September 5. His brother Vivek also accompanied him to the NCB office," Singh said. "He (Sawant) was allowed to make a phone call to his family after his arrest, and the next morning, he was provided breakfast. How can his arrest be a case of illegal detention then?" Singh said. He also said Sawant was arrested along with several others in a case that involved an active drug syndicate and, therefore, there was no question of quashing his remand. The bench, however, said that unless an "independent" body or officer conducted an inquiry into the allegations made by Sawant, it would be unable to adjudicate upon the prayers made in the plea. The NCB, however, said Sawant's allegation were untrue and, therefore, there was no need for any inquiry. The court adjourned the matter for further hearing on December 4.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sushant-death-drug-probe-ncb-denies-man-illegally-detained-919023.html
23-11-2020||National||PM Narendra Modi says 2014-29 period 'very important' for India||Asserting that the 2014-29 period between the 16th to 18th Lok Sabha is "very important" for a young democracy like India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the last six years have been "historic" for the country's development and a lot remains to be done in the remaining period. As the age of 16, 17 and 18 years is very important for the youth, so is the time between the 16th and the 18th Lok Sabha for a young nation like India, he said while digitally inaugurating 76 multi-storeyed flats in the national capital for Members of Parliament. The 16th Lok Sabha (2014-19) has been historic for the country's progress, and the 17th Lok Sabha has already become a part of history due to a number of decisions it has taken, he said, referring to the passage of landmark legislations aimed at reforming farm and labour sectors besides abrogation of Article 370 and the citizenship law. "I am confident the next Lok Sabha (2024-29) will also play a very important role in taking the country ahead in this new decade... There is so much for the country that we have to achieve. Be it 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' campaign, or economic targets or many other pledges like these, we have to achieve them during this period," he said to an audience of parliamentarians, including ministers and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla. People of Jammu and Kashmir have also joined the mainstream of development, with many new laws coming into effect in the union territory for the first time, he said in a reference to the abrogation of Article 370, which had granted the erstwhile state a special status. "It is our responsibility that when history evaluates different terms of Lok Sabha, this period is remembered as a golden chapter in the nation's development," Modi stated. The second term of the Modi government is scheduled to end in 2024 when the next general election will be held. The ruling BJP has already set its sight on the next Lok Sabha polls with its president J P Nadda set to undertake a 120-day nationwide tour to tone up the saffron party's organisational machinery with a focus on regions and seats where it had not done well in 2019. In his speech, Modi referred to the GST rollout, enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and a law proposing death sentence for those convicted of raping children as among the major achievements of his government's first term between 2014-19. India now has resources and a strong resolve to fulfil the dreams of its 130 crore citizens and attain the goal of self-reliance, he said. Asserting that the country's "new mindset and mood" is reflected in the composition of the 16th Lok Sabha, which had over 300 first-time MPs, and the current lower house, which has 260 MPs elected for the first time, the prime minister noted it has over 400 parliamentarians who are in their first or second terms. The current Lok Sabha also has a record number of woman MPs, he said. This is a reason why Parliament has been taking decisions quickly while also having more debate, he added, observing that the 16th Lok Sabha passed 15 per cent more bills and while the productivity of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha was 135 per cent. Rajya Sabha's productivity was also 100 per cent, he added. Parliament's performance is at its best in two decades, Modi said. MPs have focussed on "product and process" as well be passing more bills and also debating more, he added, noting that they engaged in two-three hours of debates in passing more than 60 per cent of bills in the last Lok Sabha. On this occasion, he also greeted Birla on his 58th birthday and lauded him for his focus on quality while also saving time in running the House. This was also reflected in the building of these 76 flats for the MPs, the prime minister said, noting that the three residential towers have adhered to green technology. The government said the construction of the flats has cost 14 per cent less than the projected expenditure and it was completed well in time despite the adverse circumstances due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The high court said an amendment in the Act does not apply to the offences already taken place. Justice Brijesh Sethi held that the 2018 amendment to the Prevention of Corruption Act relating to Section 13(1)(d) would not come to the rescue of the acquitted accused in this appeal. "Amended Act does not apply to offences that have already taken place. There was no intention to obliterate the earlier law. There is no impediment in hearing the appeals. The applications are dismissed,” the judge said, while pronouncing separate verdicts on various applications and petitions. Justice Sethi is going to demit the office on November 30 and due to paucity of time, he released the 2G case appeals from his board stating that the pleas will be listed before another bench on December 1. Raja had told the high court that the CBI's appeal against the acquittals in the 2G case has become infructuous with the coming of the new anti-corruption law. His counsel had told the court that the graft charges levelled against him and others in the case have been omitted in the new Prevention of Corruption Act of 2018 and therefore, prosecution in the instant matter cannot go on. Apart from Raja, his then private secretary R K Chandolia, former telecom secretary Siddharth Behura and Bollywood film producer Karim Morani had also raised the issue in separate applications filed by them. The CBI had contended that the applications were not sustainable as this specific issue had been raised in the replies filed in response to the agency's appeal. Section 13(1)(d) of the PC Act was repealed in 2018 when the law was amended by Parliament. Section 13(1)(d) of the Act spoke about criminal misconduct by a public servant if he obtained for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage by corrupt or illegal means; or by abusing his position as a public servant, or while holding office as a public servant, obtained for any person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage without any public interest. The CBI and the Enforcement Directorate have challenged the acquittal of all the individuals and companies in the 2G scam corruption and money laundering cases by the trial court. The CBI had also filed an appeal challenging the acquittal of Essar Group promoters Ravi Kant Ruia and Anshuman Ruia and six others in a separate case arising out of the 2G scam probe. A special court on December 21, 2017 had acquitted Raja, DMK MP Kanimozhi and others in CBI and ED cases related to the scam. It had acquitted 17 others, including DMK supremo M Karunanidhi's wife Dayalu Ammal, Vinod Goenka, Asif Balwa, film producer Karim Morani, P Amirtham and Sharad Kumar, director of Kalaignar TV in the ED case. On the same day, the trial court had also acquitted Behura, Chandolia, Unitech Ltd MD Sanjay Chandra and three top executives of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (RADAG) -- Gautam Doshi, Surendra Pipara and Hari Nair -- in the CBI's 2G case. Swan Telecom promoters Shahid Usman Balwa and Vinod Goenka and directors of Kusegaon Fruits and Vegetables Pvt Ltd Asif Balwa and Rajiv Agarwal were also acquitted in the CBI case. On March 19, 2018, the ED had approached the high court challenging the special court's order acquitting all the accused. A day later, the CBI too had challenged in the high court the acquittal of the accused in the case. The ED, in its charge sheet, had alleged that Rs 200 crore was paid by STPL promoters to DMK-run Kalaignar TV. The CBI had alleged that there was a loss of Rs 30,984 crore to the exchequer in allocation of licences for the 2G spectrum which were scrapped by the top court on February 2, 2012. Special Judge O P Saini (now retired), however, held that the prosecution had "miserably failed" to prove the charges. The special court, which was set up on March 14, 2011 for hearing 2G cases exclusively, had also acquitted Ruias and others in a separate case arising out of the 2G scam probe. In the CBI case, Raja, Kanimozhi and 15 others were tried under provisions of the IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2013 dealing with offences of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery, abusing official position, criminal misconduct by public servant and taking bribe.

Yechury said the CPI(M) had opposed the NEP 2020 inside Parliament for 'several important reasons' and it is being implemented without any Parliamentary approval. He said various elements of NEP 2020 are being rolled out in different parts of the country in an 'ad-hoc piecemeal manner' without discussing it with important stakeholders like the state governments, students, teachers, non-teaching staff, educationists and other experts. "This is creating grave uncertainties and confusion regarding the actual direction proposed for the Indian Education system under this new policy by your government," Yechury wrote. He said the omission of mention of quota is one particular issue is causing 'great anxiety', especially among SC, ST, OBC communities and the disabled. "It is truly shocking that NEP 2020 makes no mention of reservations for these sections, either for admissions or for appointments to teaching and non-teaching positions. In fact, even the word 'reservation' does not appear anywhere in the policy document," Yechury said.  "This has led to widespread concern whether this act of omission is deliberate, conveying the intention to reverse many decades of efforts to integrate quality, quantity and equity in the Indian education system," he said. "I am, therefore, seeking your clear and categorical response to the following question viz., does NEP 2020 seek to end the policy of reservations for SC, ST, OBC and disabled in educational institutions? If not, could you please clarify as to why NEP 2020 does not contain any mention of reservations?" he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/does-nep-2020-seek-to-end-quota-policy-in-education-sector-yechury-to-pm-919041.html

The sleuths from the CBI office here searched two locations including the residence of expelled Congress leader Baig in Pulakeshi Nagar, the agency sources said. "The searches at two places started at 7.30 am and concluded by 4 pm," said a CBI source without divulging information on the outcome of the searches. The premier investigation agency arrested Baig on Sunday after day-long interrogation in the Rs 4,000 crore multi-crore I-Monetary Advisory (IMA) ponzi scam, in which over a lakh investors have been duped. Baig, who was disqualified as a Congress MLA after he revolted against the party last year, was summoned to the CBI office on Sunday morning and "based on material evidence" he was arrested. He was later lodged in the central prison here after a court remanded him to 14 days judicial custody. Meanwhile, former chief minister and Congress Legislative Party leader Siddaramaiah said the party has no relation with Baig. "Baig is not in our party and we have no connection with him," Siddaramaiah told reporters in Maski in Raichur district. The scam came to light in June last year when the ponzi scheme operator Mohammed Mansoor Khan fled the country accusing Baig and some government officers of cheating him. He had alleged that Baig had taken Rs 400 crore from him, a charge rejected by the latter. He had also accused an IAS officer, two IPS officers and a KAS officer of collecting bribes from him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ima-ponzi-scam-cbi-searches-former-congress-minister-roshan-baigs-residence-919043.html

Shringla is expected to call on Nepalese Prime Minister apart from holding a meeting with his counterpart Bharat Raj Paudyal. He will also call on other political leaders of Nepal. “The visit is in keeping with the tradition of regular high-level exchanges between the two countries and the priority India attaches to its relations with Nepal,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement issued in New Delhi on Monday. “India has historical and civilization linkages with Nepal. In recent years, bilateral cooperation has strengthened, with several major infrastructure and cross-border connectivity projects completed with India’s assistance. The visit will be an opportunity to further advance our bilateral ties,” said the MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava. New Delhi’s relations with Kathmandu came under stress after the Oli Government lodged protest over a new 80-kilometre-long road New Delhi built from Dharchula in Uttarakhand to the Lipulekh Pass – an India-Nepal-China tri-junction boundary point. It alleged that the road passed through Nepal – a claim dismissed by India. Kathmandu, however, went ahead, published a new map, which showed nearly 400 sq km of India’s areas in Kalapani, Lipulekh Pass and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal. It also got the Nepalese Parliament amend the country’s constitution to endorse the new map.

While the daily rise in new cases nationally has slowed, there has been a surge of infections in the capital, which officials said was because of the sprawling city of 20 million had remained fully open, with crowds gathering for religious festivals during recent weeks. On Sunday, Delhi recorded more than 6,700 new cases, the highest daily rise among major cities. India's overall caseload stood at 9.14 million after the addition of 44,059 new cases over the previous 24 hours, the health ministry said on Monday. The government has begun making moves to delay the winter session of parliament, which usually begins in late November, to avoid the risk of the virus spreading between the hundreds of lawmakers, their staff, visitors and security personnel. "The government will hold consultations with all the political parties and club the winter session with next year's budget session," a government official aware of the plans told Reuters. Parliament's budget session usually opens at the end of January. A previous session in September was cut short after dozens of lawmakers and employees in parliament caught the disease despite various preventative measures, including physical distancing. The city government has asked private hospitals to reserve 80 per cent of critical care beds for coronavirus patients, and it has also airlifted doctors from paramilitary forces to help deal with the crisis. India's Supreme Court also based in New Delhi weighed in on Monday asking the city authorities and three other states to submit a report on the situation. "We are hearing of a huge spike in the current month. We want a latest status report from states. Worse things may happen in December if states aren't well prepared," the top court said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/plans-to-put-off-parliamentary-session-due-to-coronavirus-surging-in-delhi-919045.html

A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, Hemant Gupta and Ajay Rastogi also directed the Tamil Nadu government to provide police escort to Perarivalan during his visit to doctors in a hospital. Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayana said the parole, granted to the convict by the Madras High Court was ending on Monday. He asked the court to extend the parole by one more week. In a hearing conducted via video conferencing, the bench said the issue of grant of remission would be now dealt by it on January 19. The court asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to address it on all the issues raised in the petition on the next date of hearing. The CBI has last week told the court that an ongoing probe by its multi-disciplinary monitoring agency was going on as per the mandate of Jain Commission about the role of some Sri Lankan and Indian suspects and was not related to Perarivalan, already convicted in the 1991 Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. "The CBI is conducting further investigation on the mandate given to it and its progress report is submitted to the designated court at Chennai. The further investigation spread over to different countries and its status have already been shared with this court," it said. In an affidavit filed on November 20 to a plea by Perarivalan for his release, the CBI said the relief sought by him was an issue between him and the office of Tamil Nadu Governor where it was to be decided whether remission can be granted or not. "In so far as relief is concerned in the present matter, the CBI has no role," it said. The probe agency also pointed out that the top court had already on March 14, 2018, dismissed an application by Perarivalan for recall of May 11, 1999 judgement holding him guilty in the case. The petitioner had then relied upon confessions by the accused that he was unaware of about the purpose of 9-volt battery purchased by him and handed over to the prime accused Sivarasan.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rajiv-gandhi-assassination-case-sc-extends-parole-of-a-g-perarivalan-by-a-week-919046.html

A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian will deliver the judgement at 12 noon. The court had wrapped up hearing in the matter on November 18, rejecting repeated requests by petitioner's counsel for adjournments. "We cant give you indefinite time to hear this case. You show us the evidence. Is it so important to take pass over in the case? The adjournment have gone so long for  three months in the case," the bench had then told advocate Pradeep Yadav, appearing for Tej Bahadur. The court said it was hearing the counsel as respondent was the Prime Minister here. The bench also pointed out that the matter had earlier been adjourned four times. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Modi, that this gentleman (petitioner) filed two nomination papers, one as independent and another for Samajwadi Party. In one, he said, he was dismissed from job, and in another, he denied it, Salve added. Tej Bahadur's nomination papers were rejected as the Samajwadi Party candidate in Varanasi constituency in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. He challenged validity of the High Court's judgement of December 6, 2019. The High Court has dismissed his election petition as having no locus and further that he was neither a registered voter nor the resident of Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency. In a special leave petition, he contended that his nomination papers were rejected by the returning officer under "illegitimate pressure" from BJP. "The officer acted in arbitrary manner and the High Court also committed grave error by ignoring the fact when any person filed nomination in a constituency and his candidature has been rejected, then he has locus to file election petition," his plea contended. The petitioner sought a direction to set aside the rejection of his nomination papers on May 1, 2019 also action against the returning officer for misuse of his official powers. The petitioner was sacked from the BSF after a video in which he showed alleged poor quality of foods served to jawans went viral on social media networking sites.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-to-pronounce-order-on-sacked-bsf-constables-plea-against-rejection-of-election-petition-on-tuesday-919074.html

Further steps would be taken after discussing the matter in the state assembly and considering opinions of all sections of the society, he added.

The app aims at providing emergency help to those in distress and instills confidence among women, especially those traveling alone. Speaking on the occasion, Reddy said his government was taking several steps towards women empowerment, including their safety and security. “The app is brought not because of lack of trust in auto, taxi drivers, but to build confidence among women passengers of safe travel in those vehicles. Like Ola, Uber, even our local autos and taxis offer a much safer transport, and women need not fear to board these vehicles,” Reddy said. The chief minister said the first Internet of Things (IoT)-based women safety project aims to bring one lakh autos under the Abhayam initiative. Five thousand vehicles will be equipped with tracking and IoT devices by February 1; 50,000 vehicles by July 1 and reach one lakh target by November 2021. IoT devices were installed in 1,000 autos in Visakhapatnam as a pilot project and will be introduced soon in Vijayawada and Tirupati. How it works Women travelling by autos and taxis need to install the Abhayam application on their mobile. The QR code affixed on the vehicle should be scanned before boarding the vehicle. With this, the driver's photo and vehicle details will load on the mobile.  If a woman encounters any difficulty during her journey, she can send the relevant vehicle number to the police from the mobile app and the whereabouts of the vehicle are tracked through the GPS. Passengers who do not have a smartphone can press the panic button on the IoT device fixed to the vehicle and the information is sent to the Command Control Centre. This would make the vehicle stop immediately and alert the nearest police station. The AP police department had earlier brought the Disha app, for women safety and Abhayam is developed by the transport department on the same lines.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/jagan-launches-abhayam-app-to-enable-safe-travel-of-women-in-autos-taxis-919085.html

The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited (IRCTC), a public sector undertaking (PSU) of the Ministry of Railways, had restarted the operation of its fleet of Tejas Express trains from October 17, after it was suspended due to the pandemic. According to the IRCTC, the services were resumed as the Covid situation appeared to move towards normal. "However, lately there is a surge in the number of Covid cases.

Justice Navin Chawla asked the counsel for national carrier Air India to take instructions on paying one month's salary to the contractual pilots, who number around 61. The services of these pilots were terminated in August. The court also asked the airline to hear out the grievances of the pilots, who were engaged on contract after they superannuated, and to see whether something, like a "golden handshake", can be done for them. With the suggestions, the court listed the matter for hearing on December 16. The court was hearing two pleas moved on behalf of the terminated contractual pilots who have sought quashing of the April 2 order suspending their services and the subsequent order of August 7 by which they were all terminated. The pilots, represented by advocates Lalit Bhardwaj, Krishan Gopal and Jatin Anand Dwivedi, have sought a direction to AI to restore their contractual engagements or pay them salaries along with flying allowances with effect from April 1 till their licenses are restored to current ratings. Air India, defending its decision, told the court that after lockdown 90 per cent of its regular pilots are sitting at home as most of its fleet has been grounded and added that it was suffering huge losses of Rs 1,300 crore each month. It also said that contractual obligations cannot be sought to be enforced by way of a writ petition and a civil suit has to be filed. The court, during the hearing, asked the airline why it did not terminate the pilots in April itself if it could not afford to employ any more pilots after the lockdown. The airline said it was not sure how long the flying operations would be affected and therefore, had not terminated their services. The court said it understands the problems being faced by the airline in the prevailing extraordinary situation, "but we cannot also let the employees be left to hang high and dry". "Give them at least one month's salary," it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/consider-paying-one-months-salary-to-terminated-contractual-pilots-hc-to-air-india-919094.html

He also asserted that the freedom of press has to be preserved at any cost in a democracy but media should remember that freedom comes with responsibility. “TRP-centric journalism is not good. The meters installed in 50,000 houses cannot measure the opinion of 22 crores. We would expand its circumference so that we know what the people watch and what they wish to watch,” he said at an IIMC event. He advised media students not to be trapped in sensational or TRP-centric journalism and asked them to imbibe the skills of healthy journalism, ensuring that anything good happening in society also becomes news. Inaugurating the orientation programme of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC) for the academic session 2020-21, Javadekar stressed that people should welcome the change emerging in the education sector through digital technology and draw benefit from it. The minister said that the freedom of press has immense value in a democracy and it has to be preserved at any cost. “But we should keep in mind that freedom comes with responsibility. Therefore, every one of us has to be responsible. As a journalist, you understand both the aspects of the story, but your reporting should lead society in the right direction," he said at the virtual event. The minister said journalism is a responsibility, "not a tool to mislead people". “There is no need for any drama or sensation if your story is based on facts. There are plenty of constructive stories in society, but sadly nobody in the media has time to publish them,” he said. Javadekar said the first lesson of journalism is that everything impacting the lives of people is news and it should find adequate space in the media. In this regard, he listed several schemes of the central government that have helped citizens. The minister said fibre connectivity in about two lakh villages has transformed the lives of millions of people in rural areas. “One can now watch 104 channels and 50 educational channels free of cost through the Doordarshan free dish. Three hundred community radio stations offer new opportunities to local artists and a change is clearly visible in those areas. "About 2.5 crore people have received houses under Pradhanmantri Grameen Aawas Yojana. “About 12 crore people have received toilets. Equally, eight crore gas connections have been provided under Ujjawala Yojana. Forty crore people have bank accounts now and about 50 crore people have the facility of free treatment up to Rs five lakh. Is this all not news?” he asked. “I say, other happenings are also news, but these too are news. Contribution to the growth of society is the duty of journalism,” the minister added. Apart from Director General of IIMC Professor Sanjay Dwivedi and Additional Director General K Satish Nambudiripad, all faculty members of IIMC from regional centres and students joined the orientation virtually. Dwivedi, interacting with the students, said nothing is dear to a teacher than his/her students. “All our efforts in IIMC aim at ensuring high-quality education and training to our students. “Our objective is not merely to produce journalists. We want to produce global leaders who lead the world of journalism and mass communication in the coming decade,” he said. On Tuesday, eminent filmmaker Subhash Ghai, editor of 'Hindustan Times' Sukumar Ranganathan, editor of 'Organiser Weekly' Prafulla Ketkar, Vice-Chancellor of Gautam Buddha University Bhagwati Prakash Sharma and director of Centre for Policy Studies, Chennai, J K Bajaj will interact with the students on different topics.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ib-minister-javadekar-criticises-trp-centric-journalism-says-media-has-no-time-for-constructive-stories-919098.html
23-11-2020||National||RIP Tarun Gogoi: 'A different politician' who brought peace to Assam||He was 86 and survived by his wife Dolly Gogoi, daughter Chandrima and son Gaurav. Gogoi, who served as Chief Minister for three consecutive terms between 2001-2016 was put into ventilation on Saturday at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) where he was undergoing treatment for post-Covid complications. He tested positive for Covid-19 on August 25. On Monday morning, he was provided complete life support as most of his organs stopped functioning. Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who served as a cabinet minister under Gogoi's ministry before switching over to BJP in 2015 announced that Gogoi died due to multi-organ failure. Gogoi's demise not only ended his decades-old political career but left behind a political legacy, which people irrespective of party affiliations described as something to be followed by present day politicians. "He was a different politician. The accommodating nature Gogoi had even with those having political differences is something which amazed me. His capacity to promote communal harmony is something a diverse state like Assam will definitely miss," described Akhil Ranjan Dutta, a political observer and a teacher of Gauhati University. Born in Rangajan tea estate in Sivasagar district (now Jorhat) in 1934, Gogoi was elected to Lok Sabha six times, first from Jorhat (1971-85) and later from Kaliabor (1991-96 and 1998-2002). His son Gaurav Gogoi is now a Lok Sabha member from Kaliabor. Gogoi was elected as joint secretary of All India Congress Committee in 1976 during Indira Gandhi's tenure as Prime Minister. He also served as AICC general secretary (1985-90) under Rajiv Gandhi. Gogoi was inducted as union minister of state for food processing under PV Narasimha Rao's ministry between 1991-96. Gogoi was also a member of Congress Working Committee till his death.  He has been a MLA from Titabor constituency in upper Assam's Jorhat district since 2001 when he first became the Chief Minister. Bringing the militant groups like Ulfa, KLNLF, DHD to negotiating table for bringing peace to Assam, successful conduct of the 2007 National Games despite militant threats and constantly focussing on improving livelihoods at the villages severely hit by long militancy and annual floods are some of the major contributions during Gogoi's 15-year in power. He, however, lost power to BJP and its allies in 2016 following a spell of dissidence led by his former cabinet colleague Himanta Biswa Sarma. Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Monday remembered how Gogoi promptly accepted his invitation to attend the swearing in ceremony in 2016 despite facing a debacle in the elections. "I requested him to guide me as i didn't have the experience to run the state. He was prompt and promised me all assistance," Sonowal said. "His sense of humour, amiable and outspoken nature attracted everyone. He set high ethical values in the field of politics with his simple life-style and contributed profusely in strengthening democratic values in the country," Sonowal said in a message. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a tweet described Gogoi as a popular leader and a veteran administrator with political experience both in Assam and at the Centre. "My thoughts are with his family and supporters in this hour of sadness," Modi tweeted. Congress leader, Rahul Gandhi tweeted, "For me, he was a great and wise teacher. I loved and respected him deeply. I will miss him. My love and condolences to Gaurav and the family." His constant support for media freedom also earned praise from media fraternity in the state. Gogoi was very active till he tested positive for Covid-19. He had convinced the Congress leaders to go ahead with an alliance with Maulana Badruddin Ajmal-led All India United Democratic Front with a target to defeat BJP in the Assam Assembly elections slated next year. The process, however, was stalled due to Gogoi's illness. People, irrespective of party affiliations thronged the GMCH since Saturday when Gogoi became unconscious. Since Monday morning, many crowded the hospital with prayers on their lips and the crowd swelled by the evening when the news of his demise spread.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rip-tarun-gogoi-a-different-politician-who-brought-peace-to-assam-919103.html

Checkbrand, an online sentiment analysis company, analysed online sentiment for top 95 political leaders as well as top 500 influencers on social media between August and October this year. It analysed more than 100 million online impressions for the maiden edition of the report. "Prime Minister Modi has ruled the maximum Trends (Twitter, Google Search, Wiki, YouTube etc) in the last quarter with 2,171 trends, followed by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy with 2,137 trends," the report said. Other leaders who led significant trends include West Bengal Chief Minister Mamta Banerjee, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Congress President Sonia Gandhi, it added. For the report, 86,400 'Trends' -- which refers to the top 20 topics driving highest engagement in a day on various digital platforms -- were analysed. As per the report, Modi had a consolidated brand score of 70, which is almost double that of the nearest political leader. Brand score is based on five parameters -- followers (20), trends (10), sentiment (30), engagement (20) and mentions (20). Home Minister Amit Shah's score was 36.43 followed by the late former Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi at 31.89, Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Prema Khandu at 31.89 and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath at 27.03. Gogoi passed away on Monday. "The brand value in monetary terms basis the engagement and followers for Prime Minister Modi stood at Rs 3.36 billion (Rs 336 crore), for Amit Shah at Rs 3.35 billion (Rs 335 crore), followed by Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal at Rs 3.28 billion (Rs 328 crore)," it added. Brand value was calculated on the basis of followers, engagement and trends of the person, and then deducting negative mentions and sentiments. ADG Online and Checkbrand.online Managing Director Anuj Sayal said the company has developed a tool that can help brands understand their worth and improve it further wherever required. "Despite (there) being almost 25 per cent negative sentiment for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his brand value is the highest amongst 95 chosen leaders," he added. The report also said that Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had 40,000 mentions on social media in the last three months. "... the collective engagement of PM Modi, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Home Minister Amit Shah of 4.9 million was more than rest of the collective engagement of 92 political leaders of various parties, including other BJP leaders," the report added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-narendra-modi-led-trends-across-social-media-bjp-topped-engagement-in-august-october-report-919108.html
23-11-2020||National||Will Anthony Blinken attempt to broker peace between India, Pakistan once again?||Antony Blinken played a key role as the then-United States Deputy Secretary of State in nudging India to announce resumption of formal dialogue with Pakistan in December 2015, although the process was derailed just three weeks later in the wake of the terror attack at the Indian Air Force (IAF) base at Pathankot in Punjab. Blinken, whom US President-elect Joe Biden is set to appoint his Secretary of State, visited New Delhi and met top officials of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government just before the then External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj’s visit to Islamabad, where she joined her counterpart Sartaj Aziz on December 9, 2015 to announce resumption of the talks that the erstwhile United Progressive Alliance government had suspended in January 2013. He was also present in Islamabad to attend a conclave on Afghanistan when Swaraj and Aziz jointly made the announcement – just about a fortnight before Modi himself made his “surprise visit” to Lahore to greet the then Prime Minister of Pakistan, M Nawaz Sharif, on his birthday and to attend the wedding ceremony of his granddaughter. The peace process, which the senior US diplomat subtly nudged India and Pakistan into, could not take off though. A series of attacks carried out by the terrorists from Pakistan in India in 2016 brought the relations between the two nations back to square one. It is however too early to guess whether Blinken will once again make an attempt to broker peace between New Delhi and Islamabad as the Secretary of State of the Biden Administration and how Modi or Imran Khan’s governments would respond to any such move by Washington, DC. But if the comments Blinken made as the Chief Foreign Policy Advisor to Biden during the run-up to the presidential elections in America over the past few months are any indication, the 58-year-old former diplomat apparently values strategic partnership between India and the US. He said during a webinar at the Hudson Institute on July 9 that strengthening and deepening US-India relationship would be “a very high priority” for the Biden Administration. “It’s usually important to the future of the Indo-Pacific and the kind of order that we all want; it’s fair, stable, and hopefully increasingly democratic and it’s vital to being able to tackle some of these big global challenges.” He also described China as a “common challenge” for both India and the US during an address to Indian-American community on behalf of the Biden Campaign on August 15. He took note of China’s aggression along its Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India. Biden, himself, as well as several lawmakers of the Democratic Party in the US made critical remarks about the Modi Government over the past few months – not only over the shutdowns imposed in Jammu and Kashmir in the wake of December 5, 2019 move to strip Jammu and Kashmir of its special status and to reorganize the state into two Union Territories, but also over the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act. “We obviously have challenges now and real concerns, for example, about some of the actions that the government has taken particularly in cracking down on freedom of movement and freedom of speech in Kashmir, some of the laws on citizenship,” Blinken said in response to a question at the Hudson Institute. “But you’re always better engaging with a partner and a vitally important one like India, when you can speak frankly and directly about areas where you have differences even as you’re working to build greater cooperation and strengthen the relationship going forward. That would be the approach (of the Biden Administration) and again, I think we’ve seen evidence that it works.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/will-anthony-blinken-attempt-to-broker-peace-between-india-pakistan-once-again-919120.html

"It's very important we take care of our country first, then go on to COVAX after that and then other bilateral deals with countries. So I've kept it in that priority," said Poonawalla, referencing the global COVAX facility, which has been set up to provide Covid-19 vaccines to poorer countries. He said the vaccine in the Indian private market would be priced at Rs 1,000 per dose ($13.50), but that governments signing large supply deals would likely buy it at lower prices. The company remains in discussion with the Indian government about inking a purchase agreement for the vaccine, Poonawalla said in an interview with CNBC-TV 18, adding that Serum should have quantities of it ready to sell into India's private market in the first quarter of 2021. Poonawalla's comments came shortly after AstraZeneca said on Monday its vaccine could be around 90% effective, giving the world's fight against the pandemic a new weapon, cheaper to make, easier to distribute and faster to scale up than rivals. Serum is hoping the data released earlier on Monday, along with preliminary data from the ongoing trial of the vaccine in India, will allow it to seek emergency use authorisation for the vaccine by year-end, before gaining approval for a full rollout by February or March next year, said Poonawalla. Poonawalla also said that although Serum has the right to strike direct bilateral deals with more than five dozen nations, on the basis of its licensing deal with AstraZeneca, the company may include the government in some of these discussions. Poonawalla said the company will be able to produce 400 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine by July 2021 and scale up further from there.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-vaccine-to-cost-rs-1000-per-dose-in-india-likely-to-be-available-in-first-quarter-of-2021-919136.html

The Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing mobile laboratory, a joint initiative of the SpiceHealth and the government, came up after Shah stepped in to fight the recent spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi with a close coordination of various wings of the Centre and the Delhi government. The laboratory was inaugurated by the home minister. The tests would be conducted free of cost for the people of Delhi and the reports will be available in six to eight hours, an official spokesperson said. The cost of the test is Rs 499 and it will be borne by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the official said. Earlier, a home ministry statement had said that the test at the mobile RT-PCR laboratory could be conducted at an affordable price of Rs 499. The rate for an RT-PCR test, considered to be the most accurate Covidtest worldwide, in other laboratories was fixed at Rs 2,400 by a government-appointed committee and the report is normally available in 24-48 hours. The SpiceHealth, part of the aviation group SpiceJet, in a statement said the laboratory can process up to 3,000 test reports per day and it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The SpiceHealth said it will set up 20 laboratories in different parts of the country in the first phase and a significant proportion of the tests will be conducted in collaboration with agencies of the Centre and the state governments. Delhi's health infrastructure has started improving after Shah chaired a high-level meeting on November 15 and gave 12 instructions, following a fresh spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the national capital. The spurt in the number of coronavirus cases in Delhi was witnessed since October 28, when the daily rise breached the 5,000-mark for the first time. It crossed the 8,000-mark on November 11. The city recorded 6,746 fresh Covid-19 cases on Sunday, taking the total number of cases to 5,29,863, while 121 more fatalities pushed the death toll due to the disease to 8,391 in the city. The fresh cases came out of the 54,893 tests conducted on Saturday, including 23,433 RT-PCR tests, according to a bulletin issued by the Delhi health department. On November 20, the Union home ministry had said the capacity of daily RT-PCR tests in Delhi was increased to 37,200. A total of 30,735 RT-PCR tests were conducted in Delhi on November 19 and the number of such tests carried out on November 15 was just 12,055, the home ministry had said. As part of the efforts to ramp up Delhi's medical infrastructure, a total of 205 ICU beds and 116 oxygenated beds were added in various city hospitals on Friday. The Delhi government has also launched a door-to-door survey for possible coronavirus patients and till Friday, 3,70,729 people were surveyed. "For the first time, the number of RT-PCR tests in Delhi has exceeded that of the rapid antigen tests," a home ministry spokesperson said on Sunday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/amit-shah-launches-mobile-rt-pcr-lab-in-delhi-will-conduct-free-covid-tests-919161.html

Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla had a meeting with the envoys of the United States, Russia, France, Japan and a few other nations and briefed them about the latest attempt by the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a terrorist organization based at Bahawalpur in Pakistan, to carry out an attack in Jammu and Kashmir, albeit foiled by the security forces of India. The other secretaries at the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) will similarly brief the foreign envoys based in New Delhi about Pakistan’s attempt to “sabotage the DDC elections” in the Union Territory of J&K of India, sources said. The eight-phase DDC election is scheduled to commence on November 28 and is going to be the first electoral exercise in J&K after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government stripped the erstwhile state last year of its special status and reorganized it into two Union Territories. Shringla conveyed New Delhi’s concerns to the foreign envoys about sustained efforts by Pakistan to destabilize the situation in J&K and to subvert local elections and democracy. The JeM’s plan to carry out a major attack was foiled when its four terrorists, who had sneaked into India from the territory controlled by Pakistan, were killed in an encounter with the security forces on November 19. The terrorists were hiding in a truck and they had a three-hour-long encounter with the security forces near Nagrota on Jammu-Srinagar National Highway before all of them were killed. Two policemen were injured during the encounter. A large number of weapons, including 11 AK-47 rifles, three pistols and 29 grenades, were recovered from the possession of the slain terrorists. The driver of the truck however managed to escape from the scene. New Delhi suspects that the terrorists had come from Pakistan to India to carry out a major attack. Shringla shared with the foreign envoys a dossier giving the details of the incident as well as the lists of the items and the munitions that were recovered from slain terrorists clearly indicating that they had sneaked into India from Pakistan. He also briefed them how the terrorists used an underground tunnel to cross the Line of Control (LoC) in Samba Sector of J&K. A source said that Shringla shared with the foreign envoys how preliminary investigations by the police and intelligence authorities, markings on the recovered AK-47 rifles and other items had led New Delhi to believe that the terrorists belonged to the JeM in Pakistan. It was pointed out how the foiled attack was a part of Pakistan’s ongoing terror campaign against India in J&K. The Foreign Secretary noted that India had seen 200 terrorist attacks in the current year itself and 199 terrorists had been neutralized by the security forces.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-exposes-pakistans-plan-to-sabotage-first-election-in-jk-after-abrogation-of-article-370-919162.html

"The accused in four cases were in touch with each other and this was revealed through their call details. They trapped girls of other religions. However, the SIT did not find any conspiracy or proof of funding," he said. Agarwal said a charge sheet has been filed in 11 cases and the accused have been arrested. Those arrested are accused of trapping minor girls using wrong names, allegedly raping them, abducting them and compelling them for marriage. The eight-member SIT led by SP (South) Deepak Bhukar was formed following complaints lodged by some Hindu organisations. The IG said their aim is to protect girls from any conspiracy. "If it is real a love, then police and law have no problem. If boys trap girls stating a false name or the girl is minor, then the law will take its own course," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/love-jihad-sit-submits-report-to-kanpur-range-ig-919180.html
23-11-2020||National Politics||Modi sets eyes on 2024 Lok Sabha elections||Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who in his first tenure talked of his government plans for 2022, on Monday spoke about the importance of 18th Lok Sabha, which will be constituted after 2024 general elections, and indicated that the BJP is confident of a third consecutive term in power. Seeking to give a unified time frame of 15 years since 2014 when the BJP formed the government, becoming the first to get a single party majority in the last 30 years, Modi said the 2014-29 period between the 16th to 18th Lok Sabha is very important for a young democracy like India. Asserting that the last six years have been historic for the country's development, he also stressed that a lot remains to be done in the 'remaining period'. Drawing the allegory of young age, the Prime Minister said as the age of 16, 17 and 18 years are very important for the youth, so is the time between the 16th and the 18th Lok Sabha for a young nation like India. Modi's remarks came during a programme to digitally inaugurate 76 multi-storeyed flats in the national capital for Members of Parliament. Modi said he is confident that the next Lok Sabha will also play a very important role in taking the country ahead in this new decade. "There is so much for the country that we have to achieve. Be it 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' campaign, or economic targets or many other pledges like these, we have to achieve them during this period," he said. Modi's talking of plans up to 2029 comes as his second term is scheduled to end in 2024 and BJP chief Nadda has already announced plans for a 120-day nationwide tour targeting to win those Lok Sabha seats in the 2024 general elections which the party lost in 2019. More than two years before his first tenure ended in May 2019, Modi had in early 2017 itself started talking of his Vision 2022. In his speech after BJP winning UP and Uttarakhand polls in March 2017, Modi called the election results a foundation for a 'New India' and exhorted people to take a pledge to build it by 2022, sending the political pundits into a tizzy as the time frame Modi mentioned was three years beyond his government's tenure at Centre. Since then Modi and his ministers have talked umpteen times about pursuing big goals to mark the 75th anniversary of the country's independence in 2022. In 2019, Modi won a bigger mandate for the BJP and his government went on a spree to fulfill BJP's core promises. Before the buzz in Opposition could begin for 2024 polls, now the party has set its eyes on 2024 polls. After securing victory in Bihar, the BJP election machinery has rolled out in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam and Kerala, which are going to polls in 2021. The focus of the BJP in the four states is with different intensities in the same order as West Bengal, where it had won 18 seats, a nine time jump from 2014, being the main focus. Nadda's 120-day ‘Rashtriya Vistrit Pravas’ throughout the country during which he will spend the maximum of eight days in UP with 80 Lok Sabha seats, is aimed at toning up the organisation and hunting for new allies before 2024 polls.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/modi-sets-eyes-on-2024-lok-sabha-elections-919126.html

Chowdhury, who also is the President of the West Bengal unit of the Congress, said he was not aware of the five star culture that Azad was referring to. He said he has very little funds to run the West Bengal Congress, and perhaps “those who have held key posts may know about the five star culture”. Former Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam said organisational elections were not a panacea for the betterment of the Congress, which has truly shattered its structure at the block and district level. “The party will remain powerless and skeptical till such time when the top leadership of the party gears up to take up the challenge,” he said. “There is only one solution, Rahul Gandhi should become the Congress President immediately and bring about radical changes in the organisation. Hardworking and energetic leaders and workers should be brought forward,” said Nirupam. Asked about Azad’s remarks on internal elections, AICC spokesman Pawan Khera pointed out that the same person had criticised the elections held for Youth Congress appointments at the instance of Rahul Gandhi. “We feel hurt when someone raises internal issues on a public platform, particularly senior leaders who have every party platform available to them to air their views,” Khera told reporters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-leaders-rally-behind-gandhis-slam-ghulam-nabi-azad-919133.html

"The reason behind the coronavirus outbreak becoming so severe in the region is that people huddle in a one-room in front of the fireplace because of the cold," he said. Six people in his family tested positive too. However, he managed to isolate himself in a different room where he cooks his own food.  Deputy Commissioner of Lahaul-Spiti Pankaj Rai said that the population of the village is around 160. Because of the extreme cold during winters most people moved to other places. Only 42 people were left of whom 41 tested positive for coronavirus.  A religious gathering was held in the village on October 13, which may be the reason for the spread of the infection. “We can't ascertain the exact reason but due to change in weather conditions the movement of people increased and maybe that could also be one of the reasons,” Rai added.

Because of the contribution of those involved in dealing with the pandemic, international organisations like the WHO has praised the coronavirus management of Uttar Pradesh, he said, after digitally inaugurating BSL laboratories in government and private medical colleges and other facilities here. When the first Covid-19 case was detected in the state, there were no testing facilities nor beds. The medical colleges, district hospitals as well as private hospitals and central institutes have together worked as a team. From 72 tests per day on March 23, the state's testing capacity has grown and 1.75 lakh Covid-19 tests were conducted on Saturday, the Chief Minister said. Now, there is no problem as far as testing is concerned, he said, adding that a total of 1.80 crore Covid-19 tests have so far been conducted in Uttar Pradesh and the capacity will further improve from Monday. Stressing that the BSL laboratories will not only help in dealing with the coronavirus but also other similar diseases, Adityanath said it would reduce the state's dependence on the Pune institute. He said it is a matter of happiness that not just government medical colleges but private medical colleges are also contributing in a big way and trained manpower is available in the private sector. The state's efforts have also shown good results in checking encephalitis, the Chief Minister said, adding that no attention was paid to it in the last 70 years. With effective planning, a medical college in the state that used to witness up to 1,200 encephalitis deaths annually has recorded 21 fatalities due to the disease this year, he pointed out and said an audit will be conducted in order to see how the number can be brought down further. It is the duty of the administration and others connected with it to contribute to providing better health facilities to every citizen, the Chief Minister said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/uttar-pradeshs-covid-19-management-has-been-acknowledged-globally-yogi-adityanath-918971.html

However, sources said, there has been little or virtually no response from the officers willing to serve in cold desert Ladakh, mainly because of harsh weather conditions there. In an Office Memorandum on October 26, addressed to all cadre-controlling authorities, the MHA had “requested that the willingness of Central Civil Services Officers, selected through Central Civil Exams conducted by the UPSC (Union Public Service Commission)… may please be obtained” for a stint in the two UTs. “Several officers from different Central services, including some locals, have offered for posting in J&K UT and their service record is being verified before giving them a nod,” sources told DH. “The Center will depute the officers to the UTs only after verifying their service record and experience,” they said. Out of the stipulated cadre strength of 137 IAS officers, there are only 58 serving officers in J&K and of these, at least nine are on deputation to the government of India. Similarly, while the cadre strength for IPS officers is 147, only 66 are currently serving. To overcome the shortage of the offices, the UT government has sought return of two senior IAS officers of J&K cadre from the government of India deputation. Besides, it has also sought posting of three IAS officers-one each from Nagaland, Tamil Nadu and AGMUT cadre for their posting in the UT. Sources said that the MHA also wants to post some experts in particular fields in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh so that they could deliver in the areas where expertise in the two UTs is required. A senior officer in J&K General Administration Department (GAD) attributed shortage of all India civil service officers in Jammu and Kashmir to the new pattern of deployment of 67:33 by the BJP government reverting 50:50 of the previous UPA government. As per 67:33 proposal, there should be 67% direct recruits in the IAS while 33% will be promoted from J&K Administrative Services. Earlier, there used to be 50% direct recruits and 50% JKAS officers inducted into the IAS||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/center-to-deploy-all-india-service-officers-to-jk-ladakh-to-meet-shortage-918998.html

Tough upper reaches in the Valley had received snow several times in the last month, the plains received light snowfall bringing cheers in Kashmir. The higher reaches of the Valley including the tourist resort of Gulmarg in north Kashmir, Pahalgam in south Kashmir and Pir Panjal mountainous range received heavy snowfall which led to the closure of 270 km-long Srinagar-Jammu National Highway. An official said the Srinagar-Jammu highway was closed after snowfall at Jawahar Tunnel and other places. Efforts are being made by Beacon to clear the snow and re-open the road, he said. People expressed excitement over the season's first snowfall on social networking sites. “Kashmir without snow is incomplete. Though snowfall increases problems for people as the government fails to provide basic amenities, still winter is the best season in Kashmir,” said Rouf Ahmad, a student.

23-11-2020||North and Central||Stubble-burning led to high Covid death rate in Delhi, downtrend expected in 2-3 weeks: Satyendar Jain||Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Monday attributed the high Covid-19 death rate in the city to the pollution caused by stubble-burning and expected a downtrend in it in the next two-three weeks. The minister told reporters here that the pollution due to stubble-burning created a big problem in Delhi. It caused problems in breathing and those who had Covid-19 inhaled the smoke, which aggravated the seriousness, he said. Its effect on the city's Covid-19 death rate will go away in the next two-three weeks since pollution due to stubble-burning has lessened in the last few days, he said. "There was heavy pollution due to stubble-burning amid the Covid-19 pandemic and it came as a double attack. Since the pollution due to stubble-burning is less now, the downtrend in deaths will be there in a few weeks," Jain said. Delhi recorded 6,746 fresh Covid-19 cases on Sunday and a positivity rate of 12.29 per cent, while 121 more fatalities pushed the city's death toll due to the disease to 8,391, authorities said. This was the fifth time in 11 days that the daily number of deaths crossed the 100-mark in the national capital. The authorities reported 111 deaths on Saturday, 118 on Friday, 131 on November 18, the highest till date, and 104 on November 12. Delhi has reported a death rate of 1.58 per cent among Covid-19 patients as compared to the national fatality rate of 1.48 per cent. Experts attribute the high figure of daily Covid-19 deaths in the national capital to a large number of "critical" non-resident patients coming to the city for treatment, an unfavourable weather, pollution and a better "reporting and mapping" of fatalities. They say the easing of restrictions has exposed the vulnerable population, such as the elderly and those having comorbidities, to the deadly virus. Jain said the number of fresh cases as well as the positivity rate are gradually going down in Delhi, showing that the Covid-19 situation is improving. Since November 7, when the positivity rate was more than 15 per cent, it has come down to over 12 per cent now.

Addressing the inaugural function, Modi said the residential units were a long-standing requirement as MPs were forced to stay in hotels and guesthouses for want of adequate residential units, leading to huge expenditure on the national exchequer. “The problem which has persisted for years should not be overlooked but the solution should be found, not only the residential complex of MPs, many projects which were stuck for years have been completed,” the prime minister said through a video link. The function was also attended by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi, Urban Affairs and Housing Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, among others. The multi-storey flats have been constructed in three towers – Ganga, Jamuna and Saraswati – each having 13 storeys with a common terrace garden at the top. Speaker Birla said the total expenditure sanctioned for the project was Rs 218 crore, but it was completed at a cost of Rs 188 crore, thus achieving a saving of Rs 30 crore. The foundation stone for the project was laid in February 2018. Several green building initiatives have been incorporated in the construction of these flats. They include bricks made from fly ash and construction and demolition waste, double glazed windows for thermal insulation and energy efficiency, energy-efficient LED light fittings, low power consumption air conditioners, rainwater harvesting system and rooftop solar plant, Birla said. “Many projects started in this government has been completed in due time. Ambedkar National Center, which was discussed during Atalji's time, has been built during this government,” Modi said. Modi said discussions on Ambedkar National Memorial had started during Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s tenure but it was built by the present government after a long wait of 23 years. He said that the new building of the Central Information Commission, the War Memorial near India Gate and the National Police Memorial were built by this government which were pending for a long time.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/eight-80-year-old-bungalows-in-delhi-make-way-for-76-flats-for-mps-919050.html

The FIR has named Monika Shergill, Vice President, Content (Netflix) and Ambika Khurana, Director, Public Policies (Netflix), said Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra. They are booked by Rewa police on a complaint filed by Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) National Secretary Gaurav Tiwari who demanded an apology from Netflix and makers of the series, and removal of "objectionable scenes", which he stated were also "encouraging love jihad". "I had asked officials to examine the series A Suitable Boy being streamed on Netflix to check if kissing scenes in it were filmed in a temple and if it hurt religious sentiments. The examination prima facie found that these scenes are hurting the sentiments of a particular religion," Mishra said in a video statement. "On the basis of a complaint filed by Gaurav Tiwari, an FIR is being registered under section 295 (A) (malicious acts to outrage and insulting the religious feelings and beliefs) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in Rewa against Netflix officials - Monika Shergill and Ambika Khurana," he added. Rewa superintendent of police Rakesh Kumar Singh told reporters that the FIR had been registered and further investigation was underway. On Saturday, Gaurav Tiwari had submitted a memorandum to the Rewa superintendent of police demanding an apology from Netflix and makers of the series and removal of "objectionable scenes" from A Suitable Boy. "Kissing scenes (filmed) inside a temple of Lord Maheshwar (a historic town located on the banks of Narmada in Madhya Pradesh) have hurt the sentiments of Hindus. This is also encouraging 'love jihad'," Tiwari had stated. He had named Monika Shergill and Ambika Khurana in his complaint application. The six-part Netflix series has been directed by renowned filmmaker Mira Nair, who is known for her critically-acclaimed films such as Salaam Bombay, Monsoon Wedding and The Namesake.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/a-suitable-boy-controversy-madhya-pradesh-police-book-2-netflix-officials-919055.html

Sources said that the Sangh functionaries favoured the enactment of a stringent law to check 'love jihad' (Muslim youths marrying Hindu girls under false pretenses) and religious conversion. The speakers at the meet, including RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, stressed the need to create social awareness to check the menace (of love jihad and conversion). They also emphasised the need for having a strict law to ensure cow protection. According to the sources, the RSS also reviewed the ways and means to increase the participation of the public in the construction of the Ram Temple at Ayodhya so it could be made grander. The Sangh contemplated setting up a university and a hospital in the district. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also reached out to them on Monday and met Bhagwat and other senior RSS leaders. Although Adityanath did not attend any of the sessions at the meeting, he briefed the RSS chief and other leaders about the steps taken by the UP government over cow protection. The chief minister also apprised the RSS leaders about the law to check 'love jihad' and religious conversion, sources said. Shriram Janmabhoomi Teerth Trust, which was overseeing the construction of the Ram Temple at Ayodhya, also met the RSS leaders and sought their cooperation in reaching out to the people to increase their participation. This issue was also discussed at one of the sessions during the meeting.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/love-jihad-cow-protection-and-religious-conversion-in-forefront-of-rss-meet-in-uttar-pradesh-919081.html

Although we are vigilant, it is hard to check whether someone is surreptitiously consulting notes or a textbook. We urge our students to be honest but, of course, we cannot enforce integrity. There will always be those who gain marks through unfair means. This stems from a desperate desire to excel. ‘Nothing succeeds like success,’ young people hear and believe. We need to repeatedly remind them that while the quest for glory is not wrong, success must not be purchased at the cost of one’s principles. In fact, even when success is attained in an ethical manner, it is not an end in itself. Sometime ago, a Grade IV teacher proved that point by playing a video for her class. It portrayed an incident that occurred in December, 2012. At a cross-country event, in Burlada, Spain, Abel Mutai of Kenya was comfortably in the lead, when a strange thing happened. Confused by the signs indicating the distance he still had to cover, Mutai came to a halt about 10 metres short of the finishing line. Ivan Fernandez Anaya of Spain, who was just behind Mutai, called out to him to keep moving. Ignorant of Spanish, Mutai continued to stand motionless. Anaya could easily have seized his advantage and charged past his rival. Instead, the chivalrous athlete pushed Mutai forward, allowing him to win the race.  When questioned by incredulous reporters, Anaya said that since Mutai had been way ahead of him, he could not bring himself to deprive the Kenyan of the gold medal he deserved. He added that had he done so, there would have been neither honour not merit in such a victory.  The response of the children to the climax of the competition was heartening. All of them who had been watching with bated breath hailed Anaya as a hero. He might not have outshone his opponent but he had surpassed success!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/surpassing-success-918845.html
23-11-2020||Oasis||Think about others too ||In the name of self-care, protecting our interests or not letting any person or thing, remotely influence our decisions or focus, we sometimes become selfish to the core. We begin to believe that there is absolutely nothing wrong in thinking that everything is about us. That only the loser, and the service-minded think of the world at large. This is really flawed thinking. There will be times in life when one is entirely is dependent on the largesse and the goodness of someone else. Whether it is when stranded in a different city or on the highway, when one is travelling away from home and needs a neighbour – the examples are numerous. Recently I read the heart-warming story of a young child who protected her little brother who had accidentally slipped from the terrace on to the sunshade below by holding on to his arm all the while, to prevent him from falling. A passer-by rushed to their rescue and saved the boy in good time. I found myself in a less precarious but not happy situation once, when I got locked out of the house as I was rushing out for a meeting. My husband was travelling and the spare house key was also inside. What was I to do? I couldn’t hire an unknown carpenter and put myself at risk. Scrolling through my contacts list I sent an SoS to a family friend who was kind enough to promptly send his maintenance staff to break open the lock of the side door and let me in. Finally, if there is one change that Covid-19 is forcing us to make, it is to put others before ourselves. Everyone knows that wearing masks protects both the wearer and those in proximity. Sadly some selfish, ill-advised people are clearly setting the wrong example by brazenly flouting safety norms. We are all connected in more ways than we know and we need each other more than we anticipate. Keeping this in mind, in all of our actions, would benefit all of us.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/think-about-others-too-919209.html
23-11-2020||Opinion||Butterflies are born free||One summer afternoon, when I was a young girl of eight years, living in New York City, I would go on forays to huge spacious meadows to catch butterflies. The mellowed balmy breeze played havoc with my hair, yet the air had a nip in it, enough to entrance the most lethargic of persons. The weeds scratched our bare legs and the pastel-coloured wildflowers helped in camouflaging the butterflies nearby. Our spirits were not dampened nor did we find this exciting sport of catching the mischievous butterflies hackneyed. On the other hand, waving our huge butterfly nets we used to feel positively refreshed, for it set our adrenalin pumping. We would swoop down on them with our huge, billowy nets and catch them unawares!  After they were caught, we transferred them to bottles which had holes in the lids so that the butterflies were not suffocated. In childish abandon, we caught these creatures, drew their structures in huge drawing books; and, finally, when they eventually died kept their wings pressed in notebooks for posterity. The next year, however, when I was nine years old, I happened to read one of Gerald Durrell's famous books on animals, "My Friends and Other Animals", which left a deep and lasting impact on my impressionable brain. It made me think through his humourous weaving of a suspenseful story about the sacredness of animals, which includes our winged beauties. Indeed, butterflies are the beautiful creations of an omniscient God and like all living creatures, they deserve a life which should not be cut short. Upsetting the balance in the cycle of nature causes a serious imbalance in nature. Was not then the capture of them in glass bottles a restriction of their freedom and independence and weren't their natural rights curtailed by this inhuman bondage?    Yes, it was cruel to harm these wonderful creations who are decorative and functional. Being in the prime of youth, we had been unable to introspect and dwell at the bigger picture of nature and its cycles, which are not necessarily vicious!  As my mind was reverberating with all these thoughts of freedom, my friends came home with the spoils of butterfly catching. In a blinding frenzy, I took the bottles boisterously away, opened the lids and slowly let out the lovely gorgeous butterflies!  Oh, how happy they were to be freed from their glassy prisons! As they flew away joyfully and soared into the distant horizon off set by the glowing embers of the setting sun, tears streamed down my face as I whispered softly, "Butterflies are born free, and should therefore live free...."||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/butterflies-are-born-free-918843.html
23-11-2020||Opinion||We need national institute of climate change and health||If there was any lingering doubt that climate change threatens human health and well-being, this year put it to rest. Wildfire smoke aggravated heart disease and lung disease up and down the West Coast and across the country. A record-breaking hurricane season killed and injured people from North Carolina to Texas, and left tens of thousands homeless and at risk of PTSD and other mental health problems. Oppressive heat across the Southwest imperilled outdoor workers and athletes, the elderly and the poor, and people with underlying health problems, with risks ranging from heatstroke to heart attacks and even death. What is true for Covid-19 is true for climate change. We’re not prepared. Part of the gap is a knowledge gap: We haven’t done the needed research, and we lack critical information. As former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Environmental Health, we are alarmed by this neglect of a major climate and public health emergency. And so we recommend a solution: the urgent creation of a new National Institutes of Health division—the National Institute of Climate Change and Health. With a budget of over $40 billion, the NIH is the largest, best-funded health research institution in the world. Yet currently a measly $9 million is spent annually on research directly related to climate change and health, according to the NIH’s tally. If the NIH budget were scaled to $100, climate change and health funding would amount to two-hundredths of one penny—what’s called “budget dust.” How could NIH spend so little on one of our greatest health threats? The longstanding culture of reductionist biomedical thinking—approaching health research as if an organ-by-organ approach meets population health knowledge needs—plays a role. (If you’ve ever been shunted from specialist to specialist, wishing for a doctor who could care for you as a whole person, you’ll know how well that works.) So does the undue emphasis on disease over health, on treatment over prevention. Lobbying by special interests such as disease advocacy groups, and in recent years political meddling, inappropriately shape priorities. The result is long-standing neglect of what should be a health research priority. A climate change institute within NIH would support research to answer critical questions related to climate and health. This would help Americans be better prepared for mental and physical health risks and identify effective prevention and treatment strategies. The research could quantify the health benefits, and cost savings, from cutting carbon emissions across the economy, to help chart the healthiest path forward. It could provide a blueprint for reconfiguring hospitals and clinics to be climate-ready and to reach net-zero carbon emissions as soon as possible while delivering top-quality care to all. The United Kingdom’s National Health Service, for example, has already launched an ambitious plan to eliminate nearly all of its carbon emissions. In addition to supporting research, NIH funding helps train young researchers—a critical role. For a comparison, consider the Pentagon, which robustly supports the nation’s military academies and other training infrastructure. Military leaders know that failure to maintain a pipeline of smart, competent service members would undermine U.S. defense capability. The same is true for health and medicine, particularly in the face of inexorable threats such as climate change. We need a cutting-edge research workforce for years to come. Today, dangerously, there is no research training pipeline on climate change and health. A climate change institute at NIH could meet that need. Nobody wants another government agency if it is not needed. It’s fair to ask: Could an existing NIH institute deliver the needed research and training? NIH does have an environmental health institute, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. But it is almost entirely focused on chemical toxins and pollutants. Its history and expertise make it unsuited to a major climate change research effort. We need a new NIH institute. A climate change and health institute would break new ground at NIH. Even with a mid-range budget (by NIH standards)—say, $1 billion/year, smaller than 10 of the existing institutes—such an institute would revolutionize research on climate change and health. It would deliver needed insights to protect the public from the ravages of climate change, and it would create a world-class research workforce. Existential threats call for groundbreaking innovations. It’s time for a National Institute of Climate Change and Health.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/we-need-national-institute-of-climate-change-and-health-918863.html
23-11-2020||Opinion||Banking rules need to close door to tycoon cronyism||Is India opening the door for big businesses to take over its banking industry?  A working group set up by the Reserve Bank, the regulator, has suggestions for what to do with ownership of private-sector banks. Large industrial houses may be permitted to own controlling stakes, it says, but only after strengthening regulation and supervision to deal with the problem of “connected lending” — basically diverting depositors’ funds to their other businesses.  From the conditional nature of the recommendation, it doesn’t appear that the regulator will soon reverse its policy of keeping conglomerates away from banking. But the report could pave the way for backdoor entry. Large groups could acquire nonbank finance firms, which may be allowed to convert into banks. In India’s post-Covid desperation for capital, the financial system might go from being state-dominated to tycoon-led. The 1997-98 Asian financial crisis ought to be a cautionary tale. In Indonesia, unchecked commingling of financial and non-financial activities within a corporate group pushed up the cost of bank rescue to 40% of 1998 GDP. From telecommunications to transportation, India’s business landscape is already starting to resemble a Monopoly board. An Indian reprise of JP Morgan, the US banker-businessman who used finance to control railroad pricing and stitch together a steel behemoth, would bring the country even closer to the American Gilded Age of the late 19th century.  Crony capitalism has built up slowly in India, emerging as a Frankenstein’s monster a decade and a half after politicians began to unchain the private sector in the early 1990s. That’s when — in the name of public-private partnership and rapid economic growth — serious misallocation of credit got under way. In 2018, financier IL&FS Group, which wrote the playbook on how to cynically exploit a poor country’s desire for better infrastructure, went bankrupt. The ensuing funding crunch brought down several titans who were controlling hefty assets with slivers of equity.  The great churning since then has reduced competition and raised concentration. Today, the names of domestic balance sheets available to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for any serious heavy lifting can fit on the back of a postage stamp. But his need to find fresh risk-taking private capital is high, especially after the carnage from the pandemic. Per capita gross domestic product in 2025 may be 12% below pre-virus estimates, “implying the largest amount of scarring among major economies globally,” says Oxford Economics’ Priyanka Kishore. That’s the backdrop to the RBI internal group’s review of bank ownership. The report came just as the regulator solemnised the sale to Singapore’s DBS Group Holdings Ltd of one such lender, the third failure of a major deposit-taking institution in 15 months. Before that shotgun marriage, the country had 22 universal banks (and 10 so-called small finance banks) in the private sector, with a 30% share of deposits, up from 13% two decades ago. Foreign banks’ low 5% share has remained unchanged. Dominant public-sector banks’ market share is down to 65%, from 82% in 2000.  This process will only accelerate as state-run institutions consolidate to four from 12. More private banking capital will no doubt be needed. Still, should the country really look to big business to provide it?  There are less risky options. For instance, the RBI can stop insisting that bank licensees  — who typically come from another corner of the financing industry — must in the long term dilute their stakes to 15%. The working group wants the ceiling on a controlling stake raised to 26%, but it could have gone higher. The monetary authority seeks a minimum 40% shareholding for a bank’s controlling owner in the first five years. It could easily say: “Keep it at that level if you want for 15 years. Enjoy a greater share of the spoils of sensible risk-taking. If you misbehave, give credit against kickbacks, evergreen bad loans, or run a competing business on the side, we’ll restrict your voting rights to 5%, replace your board, and make your bank an M&A target.”  The argument in favour of diversified bank ownership — and hence shareholding limits of 15% or 26% — works when boards do their jobs. That didn’t happen at Axis Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd, which failed to rein in their long-standing chief executives as bad loans piled up. The regulator had to seek or bless their ouster. Why pretend that the future will be any different?  For overleveraged groups, bank licenses are a ticket to too-big-to-fail nirvana. Savers trust the explicit deposit guarantee and have implicit faith in the regulator. In Lakshmi Vilas Bank Ltd., where the central bank got DBS to mount a rescue, deposits fell just 2% in the six months to September. This is when everyone knew that the lender — with a negative capital adequacy ratio — was toast.  The regulator mustn’t take the public’s trust for granted. The IL&FS debacle shows little institutional capacity to stop mischief outside the balance sheet of a traditional bank. To roll out the red carpet to wannabe JP Morgans would be an abdication of the RBI's financial stability mandate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/banking-rules-need-to-close-door-to-tycoon-cronyism-918911.html
23-11-2020||Panorama||Labour reforms: Will they lead to decent service conditions?||The Industrial Relations Code (IRC) was published in the gazette on September 29, 2020. Much of the commentaries on IRC have concentrated on the provisions relating to labour flexibility, strikes and fixed-term employment. But they have missed out an important amendment made to regulations concerning Standing Orders (SO) in IRC which will have adverse implications for both employers and workers.   The Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act (IESOA) was passed in 1946. Prior to the enactment of IESOA, there prevailed unequal power setting industrial relations system (IRS). Most of the employers did not put in place the common (collective) terms of service governing all the workers across the departments/sections in a firm nor did they serve employment contracts to individual workers. As a result, employers discriminated between the workers at will. They resulted in considerable labour unrest and disputes. The four major objectives of the law as gleaned from several judgements of the Supreme Court are: to cure the unequal bargaining power in the labour market; standardise and universalise terms and conditions of service in a firm; ensure fair and reasonable conditions of employment; and, ensure industrial peace.   The IESOA requires the covered employers to define with “sufficient precision” conditions of employment formally in an SO, get it certified by the government and disseminate it to workers in several ways. The certified SO is a statutory document and overrides the corresponding provisions in the individual contracts.   It covers regulations concerning types of employment (probationers, permanent, casual, temporary etc, tenure of employment, acts of misconduct, inquiry process and punishment for proven misconduct, termination of employment, means of redress for workers against unfair treatment and wrongful exactions by employers, among others. As we see, the SO then is a powerful instrument to protect the rights of both employers and workers and to ensure fairness and justice.  In the initial stages of industrial development in the 1940s and 1950s, it was natural to apply laws to large establishments. Hence, IESOA was applied to industrial establishments employing 100 or more workers.   Section 2-A which has legalised individual disputes, and Section 11-A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (IDA), empower labour courts to review the fairness and legality of the domestic inquiry process and the punishment meted out by employers to the affected workers. It could even reinstate them if employers’ actions were mala fide, arbitrary, perverse and did not conform to the principles of natural justice. Together, IESOA and IDA provide substantial employment security to workers.  The Second National Commission on Labour (SNCL) recommended application of SOR to establishments employing 20 or more workers and providing for a Model SO for establishments employing 20-50 workers. However, SOR in IRC have increased the threshold from 100-300 or more workers.  The Parliamentary Standing Committee (PSC) did not recommend such a measure and hence it is rather shocking.   The government has also amended the threshold in IRC for hire and fire from 100 to 300. These two provisions will leave out around 90% of working factories and around 40% of workers employed therein in the organised factory sector (Annual Survey of Industries, 2017-18).   The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) results for 2017-18 show that a little more than 70% of regular wage/salaried workers did not have a written employment contract, a condition mentioned by the judiciary in explaining the reason for IESOA. The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code (OSHC) contains the statutory duty of employers to serve written employment contracts to workers though logically and structurally it should be contained in IRC. In fact, the lawmakers must include “non-provision of written employment contracts” as a component definition of “industrial disputes” [(2)(q)] in IRC. This will empower the workers to secure the same right. The OSHC does not have corresponding penalty for this non-compliance. The SNCL recommends issuance of appointment letter as a part of SOR.  Redress to workers The SOR in IRC will result in undesirable outcomes in IRS. For example, employers uncovered by SOR can now discriminate between workers in terms of conditions of employment (say shift working, leave, probation period, or notice period for employment termination), avoid providing means of redress to workers against unfair acts of employers, frame charges against undesirable workers say union leaders or those promoting unions and victimise them by mala fide actions including transfers, suspensions or even dismissals, among others.   Research evidence shows that the probabilities of union presence will be increased and be higher as we move up the size of establishments (measured by workers). In neo-liberal times, as employers adopt union-avoidance or union-busting, trade unions have been waging strikes and legal battles for their acceptance and survival even in larger firms. On the other hand, the OSHC has increased the threshold for regulations governing contract labour employment. Provisions relating to strikes have been toughened up which make legal striking virtually impossible.  Uncovered workers will now be at the mercy of the employers.  This will mean absence of decent conditions of employment common to all workers in a firm and much worse employment insecurity. Employers will more likely employ workers on full time equivalent (FTE) and contract workers. Employment insecurity and voice deficits in smaller establishments will usher in an employment regime characterised by informality and precarity.   Apart from the possible adverse outcomes in the IRS, there are other reasons which must compel the government to revisit the clauses concerning SO. Firstly, the objective of law is to prevent not only unilateralism but also opportunistic behaviour on either party to a contract, workers and employers. Secondly, an unregulated IRS will produce sub-optimal outcomes. Thirdly, the lawmakers have not appreciated the fact that SOR will also benefit employers as they would help in creation of disciplined workforce. The law makers have completely lost sight of these three incontrovertible and time-tested propositions and made reforms in blind faith that these will enable ease of doing business.  (The writer is Professor, HRM Area, XLRI, Xavier School of Management, Jamshedpur)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/labour-reforms-will-they-lead-to-decent-service-conditions-918844.html
23-11-2020||Panorama||Chinese interference in Nepal’s internal politics is rising ||With the rift within the Nepal Communist Party widening, the Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi held a meeting with the Prime Minister of Nepal, K P Sharma Oli, for about two hours last week. The two chairmen of the Nepal Communist Party, Pushpa Kamal Dahal and K P Sharma Oli, who are at odds, had even declined to meet each other until Tuesday but on Wednesday, they held the party secretariat meeting. It was a change that came about overnight, and there were clearly multiple factors behind it. Not least the fact that on Tuesday evening, Nepal’s President Bidhya Devi Bhandari held a meeting with Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Around the same time, the Chinese Ambassador met with Prime Minister Oli. The contents of the two meetings are not clear but it's not hard to guess that they played some role in the two men agreeing to meet each other. Earlier, the rift in the party had widened over convening the party secretariat meeting. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Madhav Nepal, Jhal Nath Khanal, Bamdev Gautam and Narayan Kaji Shrestha were pressing on for the meeting but Prime Minister Oli, Bishnu Poudel, Ishwar Pokhrel and Ram Bahadur Thapa were reluctant to call for it.  To somehow skip the meeting, Oli had even summoned a Cabinet meeting at the same time. Earlier, Pushpa Kamal Dahal had put out a 19-page political document in which he had accused the Prime Minister of failing to carry out his responsibilities. He also directed the Prime Minister to make a sacrifice for being unable to keep his word and for disobeying the party and the election manifesto. He said Oli had failed to deliver good governance and to deal with Covid-19. In the past, too, the Chinese ambassador had held multiple meetings with the leaders of the party whenever trouble brewed inside it. In July, many leaders had demanded an explanation from Prime Minister Oli after the Nepal Communist Party had come to the verge of splitting, but many subsequently guessed the role of the Chinese ambassador’s meeting in saving the party.  The active engagement of a diplomat in Nepal’s internal political affairs has raised many questions. Earlier, one used to see such engagement in Nepali politics by Indian diplomats. While foreign diplomats can meet the Prime Minister, it is inappropriate and wrong when they meet him in relation to the ongoing rift in the Nepal Communist Party. It sends out a message that the country’s ruling party isn’t functioning on its own and is being controlled by external forces. Nepal is giving foreign diplomats space to interfere by giving them easy access to the highest offices. As Nepal’s powerful neighbours want to increase their clout with the ruling dispensation, other countries may also intensify their engagement with internal politics, and that’s decidedly not good for Nepali sovereignty. Such activities by the diplomats show that there are problems with Nepal’s foreign policy and that it is not balanced.

23-11-2020||Right in the Middle||Living presence||“Queens are born in April” my father used to say proudly, making my young mind imagine myself with a crown. Yes, for every father his little girl is a princess. In the darkest days when I feel inadequate and unworthy, I remember whose daughter I am, and I straighten my crown – (unknown author.) A father promises his daughter, among so many other things, that he will never leave her, not in a million years, his love is so vast.  Yes, most fathers even after passing away physically do leave traces of their presence behind. Sometimes, you can feel it strongly. During lovely moments, their presence will surround you strongly.  I was interviewing Prof. B.N. Goswamy, India’s most distinguished Art historian, who received the Padma Sri and Padma Bhushan for his immense contribution to the field of Art. He is a major cultural figure and a living master of Indian Art history At the end of a very inspiring interview, followed a small tête-à-tête, I learnt that Prof Goswamy also got selected for the Indian civil services. After a small stint, he left to pursue serious research in the field of Art. I mentioned to him that my father too was from the 1954 IAS batch. His eyes lit up and he asked me, "don’t tell me you are talking about Narayan Rao, that tall dark handsome person from Andhra." When I smiled and nodded, he instantly exuded so much warmth and affection and conversed as though he was talking at his own daughter. When I told him that my father passed away at the young age of 52, due to renal failure, I could see the glint of pain and empathy in his eyes. When I touched his feet before leaving, he put his hand on my head and said “ Khush raho beti..’  My eyes welled up. Did I imagine, even for a second, before stepping out from my house to do the interview that I would find a father figure in a world renowned art historian?  Though there were few more such poignant moments, another meeting stands special, when I, by chance, met in a huge conference, my father’s childhood friend – as she held my hand loving affection held my hand and started reminiscing tender moments of their friendship, I became, in my imagination, a cuddly child in my father’s arms again.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/living-presence-919216.html
23-11-2020||Second Edit||Get serious on climate change||A recent study of climate change, published in Scientific Reports, a Nature journal, which suggests that global warming is now irreversible and that the earth is past the tipping point on climate, has caused alarm, and also scepticism, and even anger. The study is based on a model developed by Norwegian researchers who charted changes in climate from 1850 to 2500. Two scenarios were envisaged, one in which there is immediate achievement of zero greenhouse gas emissions and another in which gradual reductions are made till 2100. It was found that the earth will continue to warm over the next five centuries and it will be warmer by 3.0 degrees Centigrade by 2500. The only difference between the two futures is that the extreme situation will happen faster in the second scenario. The conclusion is that the earth is set to get hotter, whether the emissions are cut or not.  Many scientists have found fault with the study on various grounds. Modelling need not be accurate, especially if the inputs are not correct. Many factors that influence climate are still not known and there is a paucity of data on events of the past. It is not possible to predict climatic events of the coming year with reasonable accuracy. Then how can the state of climate over the next few hundred years be predicted? These are legitimate doubts and questions but the scientists who developed the model claim that the study is based on an adequate amount of reliable and necessary data. Opinions are sharply divided on climate change. There are some who deny it altogether, and others who exaggerate it. If the predictions are taken seriously, the decisions under the Paris Accord will fall far short of meeting the challenge. The Paris Accord is the best agreement made so far, and even its limited efficacy is conditional to US participation. All countries are found wanting on compliance and there is still no agreement on how its 1.5 degree Centigrade temperature target can be achieved. The authors of the study suggest that it is time to think of unconventional solutions like sucking out carbon from the atmosphere, along with implementing more drastic actions than prescribed under the Paris Accord. Whether the doomsday scenario comes true or not, the study underlines the need for the world to get more serious about climate change. It should be noted that every day of non-action on climate might make it more difficult to take effective action later, and bring the doomsday closer by more than a day. The study should be taken as a reminder of that.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/get-serious-on-climate-change-918840.html
23-11-2020||Second Edit||Donald Trump’s closing Biden’s options in Afghanistan||It is hard to dispel the feeling that the Donald Trump administration is using its last months in power to make things difficult for the incoming Joe Biden administration on several foreign policy issues, specifically Afghanistan, which impacts India. Last week, the Pentagon announced plans to accelerate American troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and Iraq. It proposes to reduce its troops there from 4,500 to 2,500 soldiers by January 15, pre-empting Biden, who will take office on January 20, from attempting any rethink on the matter. The decision is ill-conceived and badly timed. Talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban are proceeding in Doha, albeit in fits and starts and lurching from one impasse to another. Maintaining its troop presence would have provided America with leverage over the Taliban and kept up pressure on the group to remain engaged in talks with the Afghan government. The accelerated troop pull-out will embolden the Taliban, instead, to intensify pressure on the Kabul government through attacks on Afghan forces and civilians. It will encourage the Taliban to adopt even more inflexible positions at the negotiating table. Afghanistan is already roiled in violence. The Taliban, the Islamic State of Khorasan Province and the Haqqani Network are unleashing unprecedented levels of violence on civilians. By downsizing its troops at this point, the US is abandoning the Afghan people and the Afghan government at a critical time. A few hours before US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo began his talks with the Taliban and Afghan government representatives at Doha last week, terror groups were raining rockets on Kabul. This, and the recent string of major attacks across Afghanistan, should underscore to the Americans that the security situation in the country is not conducive to a troop pull-out at this time, a point that even US generals have made to President Trump. But Trump is more focused on tying the hands of his successor on policy options in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Biden, too, is in favour of keeping just a small number of combat troops in Afghanistan. But should he want to increase their numbers, he will have to go back to the US Congress for approval. That could prove to be a difficult process. Trump should have left decisions on American troop deployment to the new administration. A whittled down troop presence in Afghanistan will leave the Biden administration with little leverage over the Taliban. It is unfortunate that Afghan civilians will end up paying the price for Trump’s churlish point-scoring against Biden.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/donald-trump-s-closing-biden-s-options-in-afghanistan-919212.html

As the IMD predicted heavy rainfall due to the influence of the depression, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) rushed six teams to Cuddalore district, which is prone to cyclones, from its base in Arakkonam near here on Monday morning for pre-positioning. If the depression intensifies into Cyclone Nivar by Tuesday, this will be the first cyclone of this season. The well-marked low-pressure area over south-west and adjoining south-east Bay of Bengal concentrated into a depression over the south-west Bay of Bengal and lay centred at 02.30 am about 700 km south-south-east of Puducherry and 740 km south-south-east of Chennai. “It is likely to intensify further into a cyclonic storm during the next 24 hours. It is very likely to move north-westwards and cross Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts between Karaikal and Mamallapuram around 25 November 2020 noon/afternoon,” the IMD said in its latest bulletin issued on Monday morning. Tamil Nadu Revenue Minister R B Udhayakumar told reporters that the administration was prepared to meet any eventuality. He said district collectors have been instructed to move people living in low-lying areas to safety. The IMD said the rainfall activity is likely to increase over south peninsular India from Monday with fairly widespread to widespread rainfall or thunderstorm activity over Tamil Nadu. The Tamil Nadu State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) also sent out an advisory to fishermen in coastal districts of Tamil Nadu not to venture into the sea for the next few days. The MeT department said squally weather with a wind speed of 45-55 km per hour gusting to 65 km per hour is likely over the south-west and adjoining west-central and the south-east Bay of Bengal and along and off Tamil Nadu and south Andhra Pradesh coasts on Monday. “It would increase gradually becoming 65-75 km per hour gusting to 85 km per hour over the south-west and adjoining the west-central Bay of Bengal and 55-65 km per hour gusting to 75 km per hour along and off Tamil Nadu and adjoining South Andhra Pradesh coast and over Gulf of Mannar from November 24 morning,” the IMD bulletin said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/heavy-rains-likely-in-tamil-nadu-as-cyclone-nivar-to-make-landfall-on-nov-25-918899.html

23-11-2020||South||Kerala withdraws amendment to Police Act after backlash||In wake of the mounting criticisms, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in Kerala has decided not to implement the controversial amendment in Kerala Police Act that warranted up to three years jail term and a fine up to Rs 10,000 to those defaming or threatening individuals through 'any mode of communication'. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a statement that in view of concerns raised even by those supporting the left-front, as well as from those who stand for protecting democracy, the government did not intend to implement the fresh amendment in Kerala Police Act. Further steps would be taken after discussing the matter in the state assembly and considering opinions of all sections of the society, he added.  The Kerala government introduced the amendment through an ordinance the other day. As per the ordinance, a new section, 118-A, was inserted in the Kerala Police Act. It provided for up to three-year imprisonment or fine up to Rs 10,000, or both, for expressing, publishing or disseminating through any mode of communication any matter threatening, abusing, humiliating or defaming a person or class of person or any other person in whom they have an interest, knowing it to be false, and thereby causing injury to the mind, reputation or property. Even as the state government's justification for bringing in the amendment was rampant complaints of misuse of social media for defaming others, the ordinance was made applicable to 'any mode of communication' and hence it also triggered allegations of attempts to gag the media, apart from curbing freedom of expression. After the ordinance triggered widespread criticisms, the CPM national leadership said in a tweet on Sunday night that the LDF government in Kerala would certainly consider all creative opinions and suggestions that were being aired with regard to this amendment. According to sources, the state committee leader of the party in Kerala met on Monday morning and decided to swiftly shelve the ordinance. Local body elections in Kerala is hardly three weeks away and hence the party was also quite concerned that the criticisms against the ordinance would affect the party in the elections. The Supreme Court had earlier scrapped section 66-A of IT Act and section 118-D of Kerala Police Act which dealt with publishing of objectionable contents of social media. The CPM had then welcomed the decision. Hence the fresh ordinance by the CPM government also raised allegations of double standards.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-withdraws-amendment-to-police-act-after-backlash-918957.html

Karthikeya Sivasenapathy, who shot into limelight during the 2017 'Jallikattu' protests on the Marina Beach, will be the first secretary of the Environment Wing of the DMK, party general secretary Durai Murugan announced. Forming a separate wing for environment issues by the DMK comes close on the heels of the party opposing several projects and coming out against the Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Rules, 2020. This is probably the first time that an established political party in the country has constituted a dedicated wing to focus on ecology and related issues. “I am humbled with my appointment as the first secretary of DMK's Environment Wing. The Constitution of a separate wing for the environment speaks volumes about the party's commitment to issues that concern the people. This is yet another example that the party adapts itself to meet the needs and aspirations of the people,” Sivasenapathy told DH. Sivasenapathy is the Managing Trustee of Senaapathy Kangayam Cattle Research Foundation (SKCRF), which functions as a resource and research centre working on conservation of native breeds of cattle. The institute creates awareness on native breeds with a special focus on Kangayam breed and the Korangadu, a unique silvi pastoral land and farming system which is unique to Kongu region or western Tamil Nadu. He said that protection of environment is an integral part of the lives of Tamils and pointed to references in 'Thirukkural' and Sangam literature on the need to conserve and harvest rain water and preserve ecology. Sivasenapathy has been working at the grass roots creating awareness about conservation of biodiversity by planting tree saplings in several parts of Western Tamil Nadu and restoring water bodies. “DMK wants balanced growth. We are not against development but at the same time we do not want ecology to also be affected. We are clear that policies should not be short-sighted, that only economic growth is looked at and not the harm it could have on the environment. I will continue with my work at the grass roots,” Sivasenapathy added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dmk-constitutes-dedicated-wing-for-environment-appoints-new-secretary-918973.html

Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala alleged that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's statement that the amendment would not be implemented was just a gimmick. The fresh law aimed at curbing freedom of expression and the media already came into force. Hence its implementation could not be stopped just with a statement of the chief minister. Instead, it should be repealed, he said. Government sources said the Cabinet on Wednesday would take a decision on the matter.

The Tamil Nadu government swiftly took enough precautionary measures by asking administrations in seven districts that are likely to be affected by the cyclone to be on high alert. Public transport in Pudukkottai, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Cuddalore, Villupuram, and Chengalpattu will be suspended from 1 pm on Tuesday till further orders. Coastal districts of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai, began experiencing rains due to the influence of the cyclone since Monday evening. Rains will continue till Thursday. In 2018, Cyclone Gaja left a trail of destruction across the Cauvery Delta region. In its latest bulletin, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said the depression in the Bay of Bengal is very likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm by Tuesday morning. "It is very likely to move north-westwards and cross Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts between Karaikal and Mamallapuram around November 25 afternoon as a severe cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 100-110 km per hour gusting to 120 km per hour," the bulletin said. After holding a review meeting, Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami ordered collectors of the aforementioned seven districts to evacuate people living in low-lying areas and those vulnerable to flooding and cyclone to safety immediately. He also asked them to ensure that the relief centres are equipped with facilities to accommodate people who are evacuated from their homes. In a statement, Palaniswami asked people not to step out of their homes on November 24 and 25 due to Cyclone Nivar. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) rushed 12 teams across Tamil Nadu, and Puducherry and pre-positioned them as part of its precautionary measures, while three teams were kept on standby at its base in Arakkonam near Chennai. Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) announced that it will suspend power supply when the cyclone makes its landfall on Wednesday, even as it contended that it has kept electric poles ready in case some are uprooted due to the wind speed. Southern Railway fully cancelled two trains, and partially cancelled nine trains on November 24 and 25. In New Delhi, Union Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba chaired a meeting of the National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) to review the status of through video conferencing with the Chief Secretaries of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. “The Cabinet Secretary mentioned that we all are aiming at zero loss of life and early restoration of normalcy in the affected areas.

A bar hotel owner who raised the bribery allegations in 2014 on Monday said that Kerala opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and his wife had pleaded him not to raise bribery allegation against Chennithala. He also alleged that Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan sabotaged the probe into the bribery allegations. Biju Ramesh, who runs a chain of hotels, kicked off the bar bribery allegations in 2014 October by alleging that the then Kerala Finance Minister K M Mani took Rs 1 crore bribe offering relaxations in the then Congress government's liquor policy. Recently Biju Ramesh, who was also working president of Kerala Bar Hotel Owners Association, had alleged that bribes were also paid to Chennithala, former excise minister K Babu and former health minister V S Sivakumar from the Rs 10 crore raised from various bar hotel owners for paying bribe to political leaders in 2014. On Monday, Biju Ramesh said that he did not reveal the allegation against Chennithala earlier as Chennithala and his wife pleaded to him not to cause trouble to Chennithala. Denying the allegations, Chennithala said that he would move legally against Biju Ramesh for raising such allegation. Recently the left-front government in Kerala decided to go for a vigilance inquiry against Chennithala an the two other former ministers based on Biju Ramesh's fresh allegations. The matter is pending nod from Governor and Assembly speaker. However, Biju Ramesh said on Monday that he had no confidence in a probe by state government's agency as Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had sabotaged the probe aginst K M Mani. He said that central agencies should probe into the bribery allegations. Though the Vigilance earlier probed into the allegations that K M Mani took Rs 1 crore bribe, the vigilance could not find any convincing evidence. The proceedings were closed in 2019 following Mani's death.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/six-year-old-bribery-allegations-resurface-in-kerala-919123.html

KCR, as the TRS chief is popularly known, on Monday released his party's manifesto for the 1 December Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polls. The most striking among the freebies announced is the promise of providing up to 20,000 litres drinking water per month per household for free, from December. The election promise is evidently inspired by a similar scheme of the Arvind Kejriwal government in Delhi where same amount of water is supplied to the households without charge. The free water among other such programs is evaluated as having allowed Kejriwal keep his chief minister seat in the Delhi Assembly polls held in February this year. This is not the first time a Kejriwal welfare initiative has apparently motivated the KCR administration. The basti dwakhanas (urban health centres) operated in Hyderabad by the TRS led GHMC and state government since 2018, are seen as modeled on the lines of Delhi's mohalla clinics. KCR claimed that 97 percent of the city's households need not pay for water from now on, while appealing the valuable resource use with care. KCR has also promised free power for hair saloons, dhobi-ghats, laundries, aimed at drawing the Nayi-barhmin and Rajaka community votes respectively. The CM offered repairs of the ghats damaged by the floods and construction of such modern amenities in required places. The civic body polls in the Telangana's capital are taking place within two months of the incessant rains and devastating floods of 13-14 October – which has become the main election issue. While the BJP has been targeting the ruling side over the flood caused widespread miseries, a Rs 10,000 relief announced by KCR for the flood struck families has evidently not reached all the affected. People queued up in serpentine lines to claim the benefit last week, before the state election commission halted the dole because of election code. On Monday, KCR chose to add to his party's GHMC poll manifesto, some of the standing demands of various sections of public affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The CM said that his government took the decision to waive the March to September tax of about Rs 267 crore pertaining to 3.37 lakh transport vehicles across the state. The electricity minimum demand charges for applicable industries including cinema theatres is also discounted for the same period.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/hyderabad-polls-chandrashekar-rao-emulates-arvind-kejriwal-offers-20k-litre-free-water-per-household-919157.html

The Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha chief, who is in Hyderabad as part of the party's Change-Hyderabad campaign for the GHMC polls, has likened AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi to Pakistan's Md Ali Jinnah. “It is laughable that Asaduddin and Akbaruddin Owaisi speak about development. They did not let the metro, or any new infrastructure projects inside the old city. The only thing they allowed there is the Rohingya Muslims,” Surya said on Monday. Asaduddin is the Hyderabad Lok Sabha MP, while Akbaruddin, his younger brother, is a MLA representing Chandrayangutta area of the old city. Branding the Owaisis as communal and divisive, Surya said that the AIMIM has no right to lecture the BJP on secular, constitutional values. “Every single vote for Owaisi is a vote against India and everything India stands for. He speaks the language of rabid Islamism, separatism, and extremism spoken by Jinnah,” the MP said after his reference to Asaduddin as “new avatar of Jinnah.” The BJP leader accused the TRS government in Telangana of functioning for the welfare of only one family, while attacking K Chandrasehkhar Rao's rule. The Bangalore (South) MP said faced flak on twitter on Monday for his citing of Hyderabad as Bhagyanagar, the word the BJP uses for the city with over 400 years history. Several social media users applied the hashtag #ItsHyderabadNotBhagyanagar to make their point.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tejasvi-surya-dubs-owaisis-as-jinnahs-new-avatar-says-aimim-allowed-only-rohingya-inside-old-city-919186.html
23-11-2020||State||DH Deciphers | Flood relief: Why is Karnataka asking for more but Centre may not give it?||Karnataka has suffered nature’s fury in the form of floods for three years now. In order to help provide relief and post-disaster reconstruction, the Centre gives states financial assistance under the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF). Recently, Karnataka received Rs 577 crore under the NDRF, but Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa said his government would try to get more. Here's the lowdown on how disaster relief works: What is the National Disaster Response Fund? The National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) was constituted under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. It supplements the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), allocated annually by the Centre to the states. If SDRF funds are inadequate — as was the case in the past two years when Karnataka battled some of its worst floods — money is released from the NDRF to compensate for the losses suffered during disasters such as floods, droughts, cyclones and so on. How does the funding work for disaster relief? States, once they exhaust the SDRF funds, have to petition the Centre for additional funding under the NDRF. The Centre also contributes 75% of the SDRF allocation to states like Karnataka, as mandated under the Disaster Management Act. Karnataka has sought a revision of SDRF and NDRF funds, noting that relief released as per guidelines was insufficient.  How is eligibility determined? Soon after a natural disaster occurs, the deputy commissioners concerned submit reports of losses. These reports are compiled to calculate the overall loss suffered and eligible compensation. The report is then forwarded to the Centre, which sends an inter-ministerial team of officials to visit disaster-hit areas and submit their own assessment. Based on the team's assessment, funds under the NDRF are released to the state. But over the past three years, Karnataka has released compensation over and above the eligible limit. For example, it released Rs 5 lakh for houses completely damaged by floods, against the eligible compensation of Rs 95,100 as per SDRF and NDRF norms.    What does the funding cover? The funds cover flood relief and compensation for damage to public infrastructure. Under flood relief, crop loss (agriculture, horticulture, sericulture and plantation crop), house damage, animal death, expense for relief camps, cattle camps and other relief items are covered. The damage to infrastructure includes damage to roads, bridges, minor irrigation projects, tanks, government buildings, and water supply and sanitation projects.  How much has Karnataka sought and got recently? In 2019-20, Karnataka received a total of Rs 3,544.28 crore as relief — Rs 336 crore under the SDRF and Rs 3,208.28 crore under the NDRF. Karnataka had estimated the losses at Rs 35,160 crore and was eligible for a relief of Rs 3,891 crore as per the norms. The floods in August, September and October this year had caused losses to the tune of Rs 24,941 crore, according to the state government. It is eligible for Rs 2,384 crore as compensation. Though SDRF funds increased to Rs 1,054 crore as per the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission this year, Karnataka had to spend two-thirds of it on Covid-19 relief, leaving only Rs 276.08 crore for flood relief. This month, the Centre released Rs 577 crore from the NDRF. The amount released is yet to cover the actual losses.  Why is there politics around it? Politics around fund allocation came to the fore ahead of the 2018 assembly elections after national BJP national leaders made extravagant claims about allocating funds to Karnataka. The tables turned after the BJP came to power, and Karnataka faced severe floods in 2019 and again in 2020. Initial estimates by the state government on the extent of losses also allowed the Congress to corner the BJP, saying 25 of its MPs from the state were unable to get the required funds from the Centre for Karnataka.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/dh-deciphers-flood-relief-why-is-karnataka-asking-for-more-but-centre-may-not-give-it-919071.html

23-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||23 medicinal plants of Karnataka on endangered list||At a time when climate change and infrastructural projects are wreaking havoc on forests, an exhaustive study commissioned by the Karnataka Biodiversity Board and National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB) has revealed that 23 rare medicinal plants in various forests of the state are on the verge of extinction and listed as 'endangered' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) list. The red-listed rare medicinal plants include sandalwood, wild clove, red sanders, wild jamun, wild cinnamon and other species endemic to the Western Ghats. The study spanning five years by forest officials, botanists and field experts helped document more than 4,800 flowering plant species in various circles of the forests. Out of these, 60 rare species are medically prominent, including the 23 endangered species. Highlighting the importance of these species, a detailed report was released by the State Biodiversity Board in Bengaluru on Saturday. Based on the findings, the board, in association with the forest department, is chalking out plans to safeguard the species. Giving details of the study, Ananth Hegde Ashisara, Chairperson, Biodiversity Board, told DH that the species are facing various levels of threats. "Destruction of forests for projects, damage caused while extracting forest produce, increasing demand for herbal products, smuggling of these plants and wildfire in the summer season have put these species in peril,” he said. He said the study included all varieties of species and that experts have covered a distance of 12,820 km, documenting the species. "We need to chalk out plans under the Forest Protection Act and Biodiversity Act to prevent exploitation of these species and take up conservation on a large scale," he added. Of the 13 forest circles, Canara (Uttara Kannada) and Mangaluru have the highest density of medicinally important plants. They also have several endangered plant species. Similarly, Kalaburagi and Mysuru circles, with dry deciduous forest cover, have revealed a considerable presence of medicinally important plants. The board has proposed stringent measures in the Forest Working Plan to protect these species by adopting sustainable harvesting methods to extract forest produce and large-scale propagation of the species in association with villagers, nurseries and village forest committees.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/23-medicinal-plants-of-karnataka-on-endangered-list-918830.html

NIA sources said a three-member team of the investigation agency questioned Raj in the Parappana Agrahara central prison where he has been lodged after his recent arrest by the Central Crime Branch Police, which is simultaneously probing the violence case. They said the agency obtained court permission to question the Congress corporator for two days to ascertain his role in the attack on two police stations. The CCB police arrested Raj on charges of hatching the conspiracy for the violence on August 11 night. About 3,000 to 4,000 vandals set on fire the houses of Pulakesh Nagar Congress MLA R Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy and his sister over a social media post by Murthy's nephew. They also torched the Devara Jeevanahalli and Kadugondanahalli police stations. Three people were killed in the police firing while the fourth one died due to abdomen injuries in the hospital. Raj, Congress corporator from Devara Jeevanahalli municipal ward, has been charged with hatching a conspiracy for the violence to finish off the MLA politically in connivance with others. The Congress has alleged that the former mayor has been framed on false charges to give a twist to the violence and defame the party.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/nia-grills-ex-congress-mayor-sampath-raj-in-bengaluru-violence-case-919028.html
23-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Govt orders forming Karnataka Veerashaiva-Lingayat Corporation with a fund of Rs 500 crore||In a big dole, the B S Yediyurappa administration on Monday allocated Rs 500 crore to the newly-established Karnataka Veerashaiva-Lingayat Development Corporation. The move is seen as Yediyurappa’s attempt to consolidate the community’s support amid talks of a change in leadership. Yediyurappa is a Lingayat. The Veerashaiva-Lingayat community is estimated to form about 16% of the state’s population and is considered to be the BJP’s core support base. According to a government order, the initial cost of setting up the new corporation will be borne by the Backward Classes Welfare department. It will be reimbursed by the Veerashaiva-Lingayat Development Corporation later. The new corporation was first announced on November 17 amid pressure from a section of Lingayat BJP legislators. They asked for a corporation to be set up for the dominant community days after Yediyurappa ordered the establishment of the Maratha Development Corporation, leading to controversy. The CM ordered Rs 50 crore to be set aside for the Maratha body. But the non-budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore for the Veerashaiva-Lingayat corporation came as a surprise, especially in a year of financial stress. The allocation also came in the wake of rumours that the BJP central leadership was considering a change in leadership, which the party has consistently denied. As per the government order, the new Veerashaiva-Lingayat corporation will be registered under the Companies Act. The procedures involved in setting up the new company will be helmed by the Backward Classes Welfare commissioner until a managing director is appointed, the order stated. The order was issued after the Finance department, headed by Yediyurappa, gave its concurrence on the same day.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/govt-orders-forming-karnataka-veerashaiva-lingayat-corporation-with-a-fund-of-rs-500-crore-919090.html
23-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Stakeholders differ over Karnataka government's decision on school reopening||Several stakeholders including education experts, doctors and parents are divided over the government’s decision to defer the reopening of schools until the year-end. While some academicians and sociologists argue that the delay in reopening of schools especially in rural areas had led to rise in child marriages and child labour, a few parents express concern over the learning abilities of the kids. Appealing to the state government to reconsider its decision, V P Niranjanaradhya, senior academician said, “If the schools are not reopened now, it will have a negative impact on the minds of the children, particularly on kids studying in the government schools. There is no scientific reason to withhold the decision on reopening of schools if you look at the demographic data on Covid-19 infection.” Kavita Gupta Sabharwal, Founder and Managing Trustee of Neev Academy said, “Our request to the government is to allow schools, parents and kids who are ready to get back to schools. Policy all over the world has recognised the importance of school reopening despite soft lockdown for other sectors.” Disha Mohit, a parent said that she was worried about her daughter preparing for board exams. “She could not comprehend subjects during online classes. I am disappointed with the government’s decision.” However, Parinitha B, another parent, was happy with the government decision. “It is good that the government has decided not to reopen the schools. We have been reading reports about the second wave of Covid infection. When a similar situation is expected in Karnataka as well, how can we send our kids to schools?” she sought to know. D Shashi Kumar, General Secretary of Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka said that that the government has to decide on the issue keeping in mind the safety and health of lakhs of students.  Mansoor Ali Khan, General Secretary of Management of Independent CBSE Schools Association said, “All our internal surveys have pointed out that parents prefer online classes at the moment and they are not ready for off-line classes. I agree that it will be a matter of concern for the students of Classes 10 and 12, who are eager to visit schools for subject consultation with the teachers.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/stakeholders-differ-over-karnataka-governments-decision-on-school-reopening-919143.html
23-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||B L Santosh meets Karnataka CM Yediyurappa, cabinet exercise reportedly discussed||BJP National General Secretary (Organisation) B L Santosh on Monday met Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa and reportedly discussed the long awaited Cabinet expansion or reshuffle exercise. Santosh met the Chief Minister at his official residence and the meeting lasted for about 15-20 minutes, official sources said. Both leaders are said to have discussed the expansion or reshuffle of the state cabinet, they said. The meeting assumes significance as Yediyurappa on Friday had said that he was expecting a communication from BJP national President J P Nadda on the cabinet exercise in two days and that arrangments would be made in three-four days for the swearing in of new ministers. BJP state President Nalin Kumar Kateel too met the Chief Minister after Santosh did and held discussions. Though it is not clear what actually transpired at these meetings, party sources said that it was most likely about the cabinet exercise. Earlier in the day, Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, along with BJP MLC C P Yogeshwar, met Santosh. Jarkiholi reportedly lobbied for a ministerial berth to Yogeshwar and Congress-JD(S) rebels who joined BJP along with him (Jarkiholi) last year and helped the party come to power. Yogeshwar was said to be instrumental in managing rebel MLAs during their stay in Mumbai ahead of the collapse of the Congress-JD(S) coalition government last year. Yediyurappa had met Nadda in New Delhi last week to discuss expansion or reshuffle of his cabinet, but was asked to wait for clearance from the central leadership to go ahead with the process. Political activities have intensified within the ruling BJP camp after Yediyurappa on November 10 soon after the party's victory in bypolls to two assembly constituencies, indicated that cabinet reshuffle was on the cards. He had then hinted about a reshuffle by dropping or inducting some Ministers, in consultation with the high command. The cabinet expansion or reshuffle is expected to be a tightrope walk for Yediyurappa, considering that there are too many aspirants. While several of the old guard like Katti are waiting for a chance to be inducted into the Ministry. Congress-JD(S) rebels like A H Vishwanath, R Shankar and M T B Nagaraj, who helped BJP to come to power and are now party MLCs, are also aspiring for slots. As per the agreement, Yediyurappa will have to keep space for Munirathna, following his win from Rajarajeshwari Nagar seat in the November 3 bypoll and also for Pratap Gowda Patil, who needs to win the Maski bypoll that is yet to be announced. The cabinet currently has 27 members and seven berths are still vacant. There has also been intense speculation in some quarters that the BJP high command is mulling leadership change in Karnataka in the coming days, considering Yediyurappa's age (77 years), though the party's state unit had earlier rejected such reports.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/b-l-santosh-meets-karnataka-cm-yediyurappa-cabinet-exercise-reportedly-discussed-919184.html

The woman lodged a police complaint, based on which a case was registered on Saturday against the man at Bhingar Camp police station in Ahmednagar under sections of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, which bans the practice of instant triple talaq. The woman had done some beauty parlour-related courses and used to work in Mumbai. She later moved to Dubai, but recently returned to Ahmednagar, where she owns a flat, the police said. The couple has a three-year-old daughter.

However, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari is yet to give a nod to the list. An MVA delegation comprising Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab of Shiv Sena, Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik of NCP and Medical Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Amit Deshmukh called Koshyari on November 6 and submitted the list. “It’s a fortnight now but the list has not yet been cleared,” MVA sources said. The MVA dispensation may write to the gubernatorial office and request him to clear the names, however, there is no official confirmation. The government was expecting the list to be cleared by November 21. With the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government set to complete one year in office on November 28,  it does not want any kind of a run-in with the Governor. The three parties have agreed on a 4-4-4 formula for the 12 vacant seats. The term of 12 legislators nominated to the Upper House from the Governor’s quota had expired in June. The Governor nominates 12 MLCs for tenure of six years – based on the recommendations of the state Cabinet. According to Article171(5) of the Constitution: “(5) The members to be nominated by the Governor under sub clause (e) of clause (3) shall consist of persons having special knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as the following, namely: literature, science, art, co-operative movement and social service.” While the Governor has to go by the recommendations of the Cabinet, there is no deadline by which the Governor has to clear the nominations.  Before sending the names, the MVA trouble-shooters have vetted each and every name and checked all the details so that there are no hiccups. The names were discussed in the Cabinet meeting on October 29 and the minutes were confirmed in the next meeting on November 5 - and a day after it was handed over to Koshyari.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-guv-yet-to-respond-to-mlc-nominations-918902.html

Investigations done in a local hospital found thrombosis and massive gangrene in his small intestine, a condition in which the blood supply to the intestine is lost and the intestine is dead. Immediate surgery was conducted to remove his intestines to avoid further spread. After the removal of the intestine, the boy was referred to Jupiter Hospital in Thane for further management. An antibodies test and bowel RT-PCR showed Covid-19 infection in the removed organ. This brought to light the fact that the boy and his father had tested positive for Covid-19 with mild symptoms a month ago.  “Thrombosis and bowel perforation is well known in severe Covid-19; however massive bowel gangrene is very rare,” explains infectious disease specialist Dr Rajiv Soman from Jupiter Hospital in Pune.  “Only one such case has been reported in Italy so far, with fatal outcome. In this case, apart from intestinal gangrene, there were many secondary infections in the abdominal area, making it a complicated one,” he said. On losing his entire small bowel, the child was unable to eat anything and was put on artificial nutrition, also called parenteral nutrition. His condition was labile as there were high fluid losses and electrolyte disturbances that was managed diligently by chief pediatric intensivist Dr Paramanand Andankar and pediatric gastroenterologist Dr Dimple Jain in Jupiter Hospital in Thane. Speaking about the surgery, Dr Gaurav Chaubal, chief multi-organ transplant surgeon, Jupiter Hospital said: “The child was listed for a cadaveric small intestinal transplant and was on the waiting list for three months. During this time, the child was longing to eat and also started developing complications related to parenteral nutrition. The waiting period was extremely difficult for the child as well as the family”. With no cadaveric organ offer in sight, the prospects of a living donor small intestinal transplant were discussed with the family. Living donors can safely donate 40 per cent of their intestine as the remnant intestine has a tendency to undergo adaptation and fulfil normal digestive and absorptive functions. The child's father volunteered to donate a part of his intestine and underwent assessment.  On November 5, a team of surgeons led by Dr Chaubal performed the surgery, wherein 200 cm of intestine was carefully harvested and transplanted from the father to the child. The surgery lasted for eight hours with anaesthesia being administered by Dr Bhagyashree Arbhi.   The post-operative intensive care is being provided by paediatric intensivist Dr Shrinivas Tambe and pediatric gastroenterologist Dr Vishnu Biradar in Jupiter Hospital Pune.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/minor-undergoes-living-donor-small-intestinal-transplant-918914.html

These are the first elections in the state in a year's time and are being held in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic. The electorate is small and it does not reflect the sentiments of the entire state," said veteran political analyst Prakash Akolkar. The Leader of Opposition in Assembly Devendra Fadnavis and his counterpart in Council Pravin Darekar are directly overseeing the campaign. For Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, it is going to be a sort of litmus test as the results would be compared with his performance of one year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/direct-mva-vs-bjp-fight-in-maharashtra-legislative-council-polls-918959.html

The Mumbai Police issued three summons to the sisters over a month. However, the sisters have failed to appear before the police. They were summoned on 26-27 October, 9-10 November, and 23-24 November. The sisters are currently in their home state of Himachal Pradesh. On 16 October, the Bandra Magistrate’s Court had asked the Mumbai Police to lodge an offence against them following a complaint by Munawwarali alias Sahil A Sayyed, a Bollywood casting director and fitness trainer. Sayyed’s lawyer Ravish Zamindar had said that the complaint was the court, seeking its direction for registration of an FIR under IPC sections 153A (promoting enmity), 295A (malicious acts intended to outrage the religious feelings), 124A (sedition) against the actor and her sister. On the behalf of Kangana and Rangoli, their counsel Rizwan Siddiquee filed the petition seeking quashing of the Mumbai Police FIR and Bandra Magistrate Court’s order.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/kangana-ranaut-her-sister-rangoli-move-bombay-high-court-to-quash-mumbai-polices-fir-against-her-918978.html

Talking to reporters here, Raut said some key BJP leaders in Maharashtra are seeking a law against 'Love Jihad'. Notably, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis last week said incidents of 'Love Jihad were taking place in the country and therefore, laws to curb the practice were justified. Some BJP-ruled states have announced plans to prevent the so-called 'Love Jihad, which refers to an alleged conspiracy to convert Hindu women by marrying them. Raut said the BJP may be raising the issue in view of the forthcoming Assembly elections in West Bengal. "Key BJP leaders in Maharashtra are asking when a law against 'Love Jihad' will be framed (in the state). I spoke to the chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray)in the morning," the Rajya Sabha member said. "On this issue, we only want to say that let the laws be formed in (BJP-ruled) Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. But, when a law will be framed in Bihar, when Nitish Kumar ji will frame it, we will study that law in its entirety. "After that we will think about it in Maharashtra," the Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson said. Kumar, whose party JD(U) secured only 43 seats in the recently held Bihar Assembly polls as against the ally BJP which bagged 74 seats, is leading the state government. In the run-up to the Bihar polls, the BJP announced that Kumar would be the chief minister. Without naming the BJP, Raut said the economic slowdown, unemployment and price rise are key issues, but "let them flag the 'Love Jihad' issue if they think it is more important".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/let-nitish-bring-love-jihad-law-then-we-will-think-sanjay-raut-918982.html

The five-member team that was attacked was led by NCB Mumbai’s Zonal Director Sameer Wankhede. Two NCB personnel were injured in the attack that took place late on Sunday. However, so far NCB officials, either from Mumbai or New Delhi, have not commented so far on the issue. A case under section 353 of the Indian Penal Code has been lodged in the Goregaon police station, which has detained three persons for investigations. According to reports, a group of 50 to 60 persons, which included drug peddlers, attacked the NCB team. The NCB alerted the Mumbai Police, which came in to help out the team of the federal anti-drug agency. In the last two-and-a-half months, the NCB has been carrying out two big probes – one into the drug angle behind the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput and another the larger nexus of the entertainment industry and drug cartels.  Wankhede, an Indian Revenue Service officer, is leading the investigations. He is the Joint Director of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) in Mumbai and is currently attached to the NCB.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/ncb-team-attacked-by-mob-in-mumbais-goregaon-2-officials-hurt-919001.html

Fadnavis, talking to reporters in Aurangabad, went on to add that if the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government falls, the oath ceremony of the dispensation that would replace it would not take place at dawn as was the case a year ago. Last year, amid hectic parleys between the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress to form a non-BJP government in the state after the October polls threw up a hung Assembly, Fadnavis and Pawar were sworn in at dawn in a ceremony at Raj Bhavan. "If the present government in the state collapses, the oath ceremony will not take place at dawn. But such incidents need not be remembered," the former CM said. Speaking on other issues, Fadnavis said projects like the water grid and city water pipeline aimed at developing Marathwada were in coma under the MVA regime. The MVA government is working for specific regions and constituencies, and proposals announced by ministers are set aside by the chief minister or deputy chief minister, Fadnavis alleged. Replying to a query on the MLC polls, Fadnavis said the BJP would fare well despite the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena coming together.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/devendra-fadnavis-downplays-his-teaming-up-with-ajit-pawar-to-form-govt-919005.html

The team, led by NCB Mumbai’s Zonal Director Sameer Wankhede and comprising Superintendent V V Singh, Investigating Officer Vishwanath Tiwari and Sepoys P S Reddy and P D More and driver Anil Mane, was attacked on Sunday evening, during which two personnel were injured. According to reports, a group of 50 to 60 people attacked the team when the operation was underway. In a statement, the NCB said they seized 20 LSD blots from a peddler Kerry Kelvin Mendes near the Cinemax Theatre at Goregaon and a panchnama was being drawn at the Goregaon police station. While the process was on, Vipul Krishna Angre, Yusuf Amin Shaikh and Amin Abdul Latif Shaikh attacked the NCB team. "They started abusing and pushing the team members and fought with the NCB team. They surrounded and damaged the official vehicle and also damaged a pair of handcuffs. Their efforts were directed towards freeing the accused," the NCB said. The agency pointed out that they gathered a mob that surrounded the NCB team. "The NCB officers showed exemplary courage and thwarted the attempts of these persons. They also tried to calm down the mob. The Goregaon police station was called by the NCB team and they responded promptly and helped the team secure the accused and seize the drugs," the NCB stated. The Goregaon police station has registered a case under Section 353, 323, 504 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. In the last two-and-a-half months, the NCB is carrying out two big probes —one into the drug angle behind the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput and another the larger nexus of the entertainment industry and drug cartels. So far, over 25 accused have been arrested, of which some are in bail. BJP hits out at govt Meanwhile, the BJP has attacked the Maha Vikas Aghadi government on the issue.

"Feni has a tradition of the production process and needs to be preserved with auctioning of cashew groves and setting up of pot stills which is unique. The government must refrain from changing Excise Laws to facilitate entry of liquor barons and commercialisation of the heritage drink of Goa," Kamat. "Any change to the existing Excise Act or Rules will bring about senses of cultural disarray, economic insecurity, confusion and monopolistic culture which will have a lasting detrimental effect on Goan traditional industry and Goa at large," Kamat also said. Cashew feni is a double distilled alcohol sourced from fermented juice extracted from the cashew apple and is a popular alcoholic beverage in Goa. Feni is also the state's first Geographical Indication (GI) and it is also the first local liquor in the country to obtain the GI status, thanks to the unique traditional method employed to manufacture the drink. Over four lakh bulk litres of cashew feni is distilled in Goa every year, according to state excise department statistics.   Experts fear that by not auctioning government-owned cashew plantations to farmers, it would be impossible for local distillers to obtain the key raw material -- cashew apple juice -- required to process feni in the first place.  According to Hansel Vaz, a member of the All Goa Cashew Feni Distillers and Bottlers Association, the alteration to the excise laws was an ominous sign for the local distillers as well as stakeholders like traditional feni brewers, cashew farmers, etc.  "The sinister plan is to remove, dilute and change all existing licensing, laws or governing hurdles in order to allow the mass production of feni and thereafter the wholesale takeover of the feni industry from Goans into the hands of big multinational corporations or the wolves of the Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) lobby. This is about more than Feni – Goa and our entire way of life is under threat," said Vaz, who is a renowned feni distiller in the state and promotes a brand called 'Cazulo Premium Feni'. In 2016, the state government had passed a law in the state legislative assembly elevating feni to a state heritage drink status.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/opposition-distillers-warn-goa-govt-against-corporatising-feni-919030.html
23-11-2020||West||A year ago, Devendra Fadnavis-Ajit Pawar govt was formed in Maharashtra. What happened next?||In one of the biggest political surprises of Maharashtra – exactly a year ago on Nov 23, 2019 - Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari swore in Devendra Fadnavis as the Chief Minister and Ajit Pawar as Deputy Chief Minister. The government, however, lasted only for nearly 80 hours and collapsed on Nov 26, 2019. Two days later, on Nov 28, 2019, Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray was sworn in as the chief minister. It has been a year since – but there is still a mystery over what happened that midnight of Nov 22-23, preceding with the early morning swearing-in at the state's Raj Bhavan. The 'coup' panned out after the Shiv Sena walked away from its three-decade-old ally BJP and joined hands with the diametrically-opposite in ideals, Congress-NCP, to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi. This three-day government is the shortest regime in Maharashtra's history, but the discussion over the matter is not as short-lived. At this position, NCP founder-President Sharad Pawar, who is often referred to as ‘Chanakya’ and ‘Bhishma Pitamah of Indian politics’, salvaged the situation and ensured the MVA came to power. That his nephew would walk away when a new formation was taking shape, came as a jolt to the 'Trimurti' union of Sena-NCP-Congress. Pawar recently wrote a letter to the Governor, in his book ‘Janrajyapal: Bhagat Singh Koshyari'. Pawar wrote: “…when I previewed the coffee table book, it revealed the photographs of ceremonies - except a particular swearing-in ceremony.” 'Pawar Jr' has, so far, maintained stoic silence on this issue and has never spoken out. Fadnavis, however, had claimed that 'Pawar Sr' was aware of what was going on but has backed out at the eleventh hour. “In 2017, there were a couple of meetings but things didn't work out. The same thing was tried in 2019. Sharad Pawar ditched us despite coming up with the proposal of forming the government. He changed his decision at the eleventh hour,” Fadnavis had said, earlier in June 2020. The interesting development was the Nov 20 meeting between Pawar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. "Modi had offered me to work together. I told him that our personal relations are very good and they will remain that way, but it is not possible for me to work together," Pawar had said. He even revealed that there was also an offer from Modi to make his daughter Supriya Sule, a Cabinet minister.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/a-year-ago-devendra-fadnavis-ajit-pawar-govt-was-formed-in-maharashtra-what-happened-next-919033.html
23-11-2020||West||Maharashtra makes Covid-19 negative report compulsory for travellers from Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Goa||As Covid-19 cases rage in parts of India and a possibility of a second wave looming large, the Maharashtra government on Monday made RT-PCT negative reports compulsory for people arriving by air and rail from the National Capital Region of Delhi and Gujarat, Rajasthan and Goa. Apart from this, land border districts will have to make arrangements to test for symptoms and take their body temperature of people from these places by road. The fresh set of guidelines will come to effect from Wednesday. The fresh SOPs related to travel are in addition to those issued by the Maharashtra government earlier. For those who travel by flight, the RT-PCR should have been done within 72 hours of scheduled landing at airports in Maharashtra. For those travelling by train, the RT-PCR should have been done within 96 hours before the scheduled arrival in Maharashtra. The order was issued by Chief Secretary Sanjay Kumar on Monday evening – a day after Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar expressed concern over the overall situation in the state and elsewhere. The order states that those who are coming by flights and have not undertaken Covid-19 tests would have to undergo the tests in Maharashtra airports at their own cost. They would also have to provide addresses and in case the report is positive would have to undergo treatment as per the state’s protocols. Those coming by train and not carrying RT-PCR negative reports would have to undergo screening at railway stations. The passengers with no symptoms would be allowed to go. Those showing symptoms would have to undertake Rapid Antigen tests – and those negative would be allowed to go and if found positive would be sent to Covid Care Centres. The cost of care would be borne by passengers. A similar drill would be followed for those who are arriving by road  at the state’s border. The detailed circular has been sent to District Collectors and Municipal Commissioners. "There is a possibility of a second wave. The West is affected by it....I wonder whether it is a second wave or a tsunami," Thackeray has warned. On the other hand, Pawar had said that the government has asked all the departments to review the situation over the next 8 to 10 days and if needed a call on lockdown measures would be taken.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-makes-covid-19-negative-report-compulsory-for-travellers-from-delhi-rajasthan-gujarat-and-goa-919057.html
