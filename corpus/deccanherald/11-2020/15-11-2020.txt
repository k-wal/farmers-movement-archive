The police have also recovered Rs 56 lakh, 40 vehicles, and 65 cellphones from the accused persons. Police, who conducted the raids based on a definite tip-off, arrested political leaders, including Ismail Tamatagar, Thavanappa Astagi, hotelier Mahesh Shetty, casino king Samundar Sing and others. Speaking to a section of media persons, IGP (Northern Range) Raghavendra Suhas said, the police team raided Ramya Residency and other places and recovered Rs 56 lakh, 40 vehicles, and 65 cellphone sets. He said, the raids were following a tip-off that the people were playing three-cards and ‘Andar-bahar’ which amount to gambling. Ironically, four constables were also found gambling during the raid near Mummigatti and according to sources, the SP has suspended them pending an enquiry. The suspended are Manjunath Bagavi, Atmanand Betageri of Garag Police Station, Ismail Sayyednavar of Rural police station, and Moiuddin Mulla of District Armed Reserve, Dharwad. Speaking to media persons, Tamatagar said: “It is true that I along with Thavanappa and Congress leader Deepak Chinchore had been to Ramya Residency on Saturday night. The hotel owner had invited us for the pooja at the hotel, and we were having food when the police raided. However, I was not part of the gambling and have no connection with it,” he said, and added that if the police include his name in the case, he would take the legal course. Astagi said, Ramya Residency is an authorised club and playing cards is legal here. There is a police conspiracy here, he said. A case has been registered at Rural police station.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/hubballi-dharwad/gambling-dens-raided-126-held-including-politicians-rs-56-lakh-seized-in-dharwad-district-915911.html

I also had written to Chief Secretary of Karnataka to conduct a detailed probe into the illegal extraction of Red Bauxite,” he said. But MLA Rajesh Naik in a recent press meet had claimed that the allegations were baseless and had directed Rai to submit documents to prove his allegations. Rai said Usha R Naik had availed permit for laterite stone quarry at Thenka Edapadavu. But red bauxite was supplied to cement firms in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh since May 2019. This has been proved with the trip sheet issued by mines department. “Why laterite stones need to be supplied to cement factories ?" he asked and alleged that with help of permit red bauxite was supplied illegally. Rai also accused a PDO of a gram panchayat being in nexus with the MLA. The PDO had given permit for levelling 6.26 acres of land and 14,000 tone red bauxite was supplied illegally to the cement firms in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, in the name of the PDO. Reacting to the allegations, MLA Rajesh Naik said that the allegations are politically motivated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/rai-accuses-bantwal-mla-of-illegal-red-bauxite-extraction-915751.html

The southern state is followed by Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, with their state discoms being sanctioned loans of Rs 20,940 crore and Rs 14,310 crore, respectively. Other major beneficiary states/Union Territories (UTs) in terms of sanctioned credit are Telangana (Rs 12,652 crore), Jammu and Kashmir (Rs 11,024 crore), Karnataka (Rs 7,247 crore) and Andhra Pradesh (Rs 6,600 crore). State-run non-banking finance firms Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and REC Ltd, which are implementing the scheme, have sanctioned loans worth Rs 1,18,273 crore so far under the liquidity infusion scheme for discoms. In May, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced Rs 90,000 crore liquidity infusion into cash-strapped discoms facing demand slump due to the COVID-19 crisis. This package was later increased to Rs 1.2 lakh crore by the Ministry of Power. "Loans worth Rs 1,18,273 crore has been sanctioned by the PFC and REC together under the liquidity infusion scheme for discoms. Tamil Nadu has been sanctioned loan worth Rs 30,230 crore under the package followed by Rs 20,940 crore for Uttar Pradesh and Rs 14,310 crore for Maharashtra," a source told PTI. The loans were sanctioned under the scheme as per the demand as well as the eligibility of the states. The source also said that as far as disbursal of loans is concerned, Uttar Pradesh has already received Rs 10,470 crore followed by Telangana (Rs 6,287 crore), Andhra Pradesh (Rs 3,300 crore), Jammu & Kashmir (Rs 3,290 crore), Maharashtra (Rs 2,500 crore) and Rajasthan (Rs 2,032 crore). Under the scheme, a total of Rs 31,135 crore has been disbursed to states discoms so far to pay off their outstanding dues. According to PRAAPTI portal (Payment Ratification And Analysis in Power procurement for bringing Transparency in Invoicing of generators), discoms' total outstanding dues as of September stood at Rs 1.37 lakh crore. As per the portal, Tamil Nadu has an overdue amount of over Rs 21,838 crore as of September this year. Power producers give 45 days to discoms for paying bills for the supply of electricity. After that, outstanding dues become overdue and generators charge penal interest on that in most cases. Similarly, the overdue outstanding amount of Uttar Pradesh is Rs 11,539 crore as of September and that of Maharashtra stands at Rs 7,469 crore. Telangana and Jammu & Kashmir have been sanctioned loans worth Rs 12,652 crore and Rs 11,024 crore, respectively under the scheme. The overdue amount of Telangana and Jammu & Kashmir is Rs 5,162 crore and Rs 7,728 crore, respectively as of September this year. Rajasthan has a Rs 37,635 crore overdue amount as of September this year. The state has been sanctioned loans worth Rs 4,063 crore under the scheme. Karnataka has been sanctioned Rs 7,247 crore and Andhra Pradesh Rs 6,600 crore credit facility under the scheme. Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh have overdue amounts of Rs 8,912 crore and Rs 3,933 crore, respectively as of September this year. Punjab has been sanctioned a credit facility of Rs 4,000 crore under the scheme while Bihar and West Bengal got Rs 3,503 crore and Rs 1,021 crore respectively, the source added. The package would help to reduce outstanding dues of the discoms considerably. Besides, it would reduce stress on the power generation companies (gencos) and transmission companies (transcos) as their payments are stuck with discoms. Besides the package, in order to give relief to gencos, the Centre had enforced a payment security mechanism from August 1, 2019. Under this mechanism, discoms are required to open letters of credit for getting power supply. The central government had also given moratorium to discoms for paying dues to power generating firms in view of the COVID-19-induced lockdown. The government had also waived the penal charges for late payment of dues.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/discoms-liquidity-infusion-tamil-nadu-tops-chart-of-states-with-rs-30k-crore-sanctioned-loan-915764.html

15-11-2020||National||Veteran Bengali actor Soumitra Chatterjee passes away||Legendary Bengali actor Dadasaheb Phalke awardee Soumitra Chatterjee passed away on Sunday due to multiple ailments at the age of 85. One of the brightest film luminaries in the country, and known to film students across the globe, Chhaterjee died at a private hospital in the city after a 40-day-long battle first against Covid-19, and then with several other health complications, including neurological and kidney disorders. He is survived by his wife Deepa Chatterjee, daughter Poulomi Basu, and son Sougata Chatterjee. “'Feluda' is no more. 'Apu' said goodbye. Farewell, Soumitra (Da) Chatterjee. He has been a legend in his lifetime. International, Indian and Bengali cinema has lost a giant. We will miss him dearly. The film world in Bengal has been orphaned,” tweeted Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Often referred to as the “alter ego” of film maestro Satyajit Ray, the suave actor’s perfectionist approach can perhaps best be summed up by the famous phrase “mogojastro”, or brain power, which was used to describe the keen observation and analytical ability of his character of the iconic silver screen sleuth Feluda. The character was a creation of Ray. Born on January 19,1935, Chatterjee discovered his passion for acting when he watched a play by legendary Bengali thespian Shishir Kumar Bhaduri during his college days. He made his silver screen debut in ‘Apur Sansar’( 1959), the concluding movie of Ray’s famous Apu trilogy. He proved his mettle not only to the national audience but also to the global cinema fraternity. The sight of him as a man with a thick stubble and carrying his son on his shoulders made an everlasting impression on film enthusiasts. His legendary partnership with Ray comprised of 14 films and he also acted in 300 others. One of the high points of Chatterjee’s partnership with Ray was his portrayal of the sophisticated and soft spoken Bengali sleuth Pradosh Chandra Mitter popularly known by his nickname Feluda. Despite being well versed in martial arts, Feldua preferred to solve cases with brain rather than brawn. Ray directed two Feluda movies-Sonar kella (1974) and Joy Baba Felunath (1978) with Chatterjee in the lead role. His other notable movies with Ray include Devi (1960), Arayner Din Ratri (1970) and ‘Ghrare Baire’.He also worked with film maestros such as Tapan Sinha, Mrinal Sen and Tarun Majumdar. From essaying the role of the intellectual sleuth Chatterjee went on to portray the famous character of a swimming coach Khidda in the National Award winning movie Kony. His dialogue to encourage his student “fight Kony! Fight” has become iconic as an example of indomitable spirit. However, he was not just confined to portraying positive characters. His performance in the film Jhinder Bondi (Prisoner of Jhind) as the suave villain Mayurbahan thrilled the audience. Tributes poured in for the Légion d' honneur (the highest civilian award in France awardee from people of all walks of life. Condoling his death Prime Minister Narendra Modi described it as “a colossal loss to the world of cinema, cultural life of West Bengal and India.” Union Home Minister Amit Shah also condoled his death. The film and theater fraternity mourned the death of the Padma Bhushan awardee. His first heroine in his debut movie Apur Sansar, Sharmila Tagore, fondly remembered him as a “charming person well versed in several fields such as cinema, theater and recitation. He was a rare man with an ability to speak on any subject at length.” “Tragic loss!! Rest in peace Sir!! Your contribution to the Indian Cinema will always be remembered and inspire the generations to come,” tweeted actor Manoj Bajpayee.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/veteran-bengali-actor-soumitra-chatterjee-passes-away-915781.html

Born in Kolkata in 1935, the powerhouse performer began his acting career with the Satyajit Ray-directed Apur Sansar, leaving a deep mark on cinema lovers across the world with his measured performance. He subsequently teamed with the maverick filmmaker on several occasions, becoming an inseparable part of Indian cinema. Some of their most notable films include Abhijan, the anthology Teen Kanya, Kapurush and Charulata. Chatterjee also collaborated with the likes of Mrinal Sen, Ajoy Kar, Asit Sen and Tapan Sinha, redefining the tenets of Bengali cinema.In 1974, played the iconic detective Feluda in Ray's Sonar Kellar and this proved to be a turning point in his career. He reprised the role in Joi Baba Felunath, becoming the face of the iconic character. A section of the audience drew parallels between him and Uttam Kumar marking the beginning of a new 'rivalry' in Bengali cinema. He teamed up with the 'Mahanayak' for films such as the iconic Devadas, Stree and Jhinder Bandi, proving his mettle. According to most critics, Chatterjee was no less than Uttam Kumar in acting abilities even though the Amanush actor enjoyed a wider fan following.  Chatterjee had once remarked that the fierce rivalry between the two was 'mitigated' by the bond they shared with each other.In the late 80s/early 90s, he made a transition to supporting roles and this marked the beginning of a new chapter in his career. He played a supporting role in the Fatakeshto franchise, starring Mithun Chakraborty. In 2015, Chatterjee starred in the critically-acclaimed Bela Shesh. Unlike 'Uttam Da', Chatterjee never pursued a career in Hindi cinema. He, however, acted alongside Bollywood actress Radhika Apte in the short film Ahalaya, garnering attention for the right reasons His death marks the end of an era for Bengali cinema.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rip-soumitra-chatterjee-a-stellar-performer-who-became-an-inseparable-part-of-bengali-cinema-915782.html
15-11-2020||National||Broadband definition should be upgraded to 2 Mbps speed: BIF to Trai||Industry think tank BIF has said a revision of broadband definition and speeds in India are long overdue and that it should be reviewed and upgraded to 2 Mbps from current 512 kbps which is "dismally low". The Broadband India Forum (BIF) has said communications technology has transformed radically over the past years and entirely new markets for data services have emerged across the nation. Numerous modern internet applications and use cases now require higher speeds than prescribed by the current definition, it said. "It is our view that since the current definition of broadband captures neither the development of the technology nor the Indian consumers' appetite for high speed broadband services, it must be reviewed and redefined," the BIF said in its submission to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai). The submissions form part of BIF's response to the regulator's consultation paper on 'road map to promote broadband connectivity and enhanced broadband speed'. Trai had floated the discussion paper to seek stakeholder views on various issues including whether existing definition of broadband need to be reviewed along with threshold download and upload speeds; possibility of defining different categories of broadband depending on speeds; need for speed measurement programmes in the country amongst others. When contacted, BIF President T V Ramachandran said that current definition of broadband in India at 512 kbps is dismally low, and the upgrade to 2 Mbps for the same is long overdue, even as per the national policy mandates, apart from the global benchmarks. According to the BIF, the broadband speeds in India, even post the introduction of 4G, are less than half of the global good practices. In its written response to the regulator, the BIF suggested that a network must comply with the requirement to provide 2 Mbps download and upload speeds to be considered a broadband connection, regardless of the medium or technology used to deliver the service. Different categories of broadband such as 'Basic, Fast, and Ultra-Fast' would help set optional thresholds that can serve distinct use cases, it said. Reviews must also be conducted periodically to keep pace with the development of access services and customer expectations, the BIF added. "We also recommend the creation of additional tiers that represent increasing levels of quality and enhance transparency in the provision of services, but are entirely optional for service providers to guarantee," the BIF has said. Connectivity, faster than the 2 Mbps standard is now a "mainstream requirement" in the market for internet access. It further recommended that Trai provide additional guidelines for higher quality broadband services, as the industry body mooted minimum downlink and uplink speed of 15 Mbps to define 'fast broadband', and 30 Mbps for 'ultra-fast broadband'. However, it added in the same breath that these could be just guidelines to help the customer have a uniform and valid comparison between offerings.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/broadband-definition-should-be-upgraded-to-2-mbps-speed-bif-to-trai-915789.html
15-11-2020||National||Amit Shah to review Covid-19 situation in Delhi||With a spike in the number of coronavirus cases in Delhi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah will review the situation arising due to the surge of the infection in the national capital on Sunday, officials said. Delhi Lieutenant Governor (LG) Anil Baijal, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Health Minister Satyendra Jain and senior officers of the central government are expected to attend a meeting with Shah in the evening. The home minister will take stock of the situation arising due to the spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi and discuss ways to deal with it, a home ministry official said. On November 2, a meeting convened by Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla had attributed the third surge in coronavirus cases in Delhi to festivals and a greater movement of people, accompanied by laxity in adhering to the basic principles of Covid-appropriate behaviour. However, Kejriwal last week blamed pollution for the spike in the cases. The meeting chaired by Bhalla had resolved that efforts would be made for testing, contact-tracing and treatment, especially in the critical zones. It also emphasised that travel by metro should be carefully regulated, in accordance with the standard operating procedures (SOPs). While the numbers of fresh Covid cases and active cases are going up, the administration is focussing on testing, contact-tracing and treatment. At Sunday's meeting, a strategy is expected to be devised to contain the spread of the virus in Delhi, especially in view of the festive season and the decreasing temperatures, accompanied by rising pollution. The national capital recorded 7,340 fresh Covid-19 cases and 96 more deaths due to the disease on Saturday. The fresh cases were detected from 49,645 tests, including 19,635 RT-PCR and 30,010 rapid-antigen tests, conducted on Friday. The positivity rate in the city was 14.78 per cent, according to a bulletin issued by the Delhi health department. The highest single-day spike of 8,593 cases and 85 fatalities were recorded on Wednesday. On November 12, the number of deaths was 104, the highest in over five months. The total number of cases has now climbed to 4,82,170 in Delhi, while the city's death toll due to the disease stands at 7,519. The tally of active cases rose to 44,456 in the national capital on Saturday. The recovery rate stood at over 89 per cent. The number of containment zones in Delhi was 4,288 as on Saturday. The sudden spike in coronavirus cases comes amid the festive season and rising pollution levels. While Durga Puja celebrations ended on October 25, Diwali was on Saturday and Chhath later this week. The National Centre for Disease Control, in a report drafted recently, had warned that Delhi needed to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh Covid-19 cases per day, taking into account the winter-related respiratory problems, a large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings. In June, when the number of Covid-19 cases was on the rise in Delhi, Shah had swung into action after criticism in different quarters of the Delhi government's handling of the crisis. At that time, there were complaints of non-availability of beds in hospitals and difficulty in getting tests done in laboratories. By leading from the front, the home minister improved the facilities by increasing the numbers of daily testing, hospital beds and setting up temporary hospitals and Covid care centre. A committee set up by Shah also fixed the rates for testing, beds in private hospitals, ICUs and isolation beds. At a meeting on June 18, the home minister had said a common strategy should be framed for Delhi and the National Capital region (NCR) to tackle the coronavirus pandemic and added that suburbs like Gurgaon, Noida and Ghaziabad cannot be separated from the national capital in this battle.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/amit-shah-to-review-covid-19-situation-in-delhi-915794.html

The mines ministry had earlier sought suggestions from the general public, mining industry and other stakeholders on the proposed reforms in the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. "We want to bring these reforms very shortly... In another month or so reforms (proposed mining reforms) should come out," Joshi said in an interview to PTI. The government, he said, is looking into the feedback it has received on the proposed reforms and stressed that the Centre wishes to auction at least 500 mineral blocks in the coming two to three years. The slew of reform proposals includes amending the contentious provisions of 10A(2)(b) and 10A (2)(C) of the MMDR Act, a move that would pave the way for auctioning of around 500 potential leases stuck in legacy issues now. Section 10A(2)(b) deals with leases where reconnaissance permit or prospecting licence were granted while 10A(2)(c) relates to grant of mining leases. Joshi said there is mixed opinion on 10A(2)(b) and 10A (2)(C) of the Act and stressed that it does not want to go into the details on the same. The mines minister was of the view that the Centre would have to convince state governments before the auction of mineral blocks as the mines ministry was just the policymaker and "rest (with regard to auction) is with the state government." Under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat scheme, the Centre had in May announced enhancing private investments in the mineral sector and bringing in other reforms. In order to implement the announcements, the mines ministry has proposed legislative amendments to the MMDR Act, 1957 for undertaking structural reforms in mineral sector with the objective of accelerating growth and employment generation. The proposals include increasing mineral production and employment generation by redefining the norms of exploration for auction of mineral blocks and ensuring seamless transition from exploration to production. They also include resolving legacy issues to move towards an auction only regime for allocation of mineral resources, removing the distinction between captive and non-captive mines, developing a transparent National Mineral Index and clarifying the definition of illegal mining, among others.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/modi-govt-mulls-mining-reforms-500-blocks-to-be-auctioned-in-2-3-years-915797.html

The decision to conduct the human clinical trials of the vaccine was taken after Dr Reddy's Laboratories got approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) in this regard, an official said. Speaking to PTI, college principal R B Kamal said the human clinical trials of the vaccine will start from next week. "As many as 180 volunteers have registered for the trials. Head of the research Saurabh Agarwal will determine the dosage of the vaccine to be administered. One dose will be administered and the condition of volunteers will be monitored to determine whether they need further doses or not," he said. Kamal said the volunteers’ vitals and condition will be checked periodically and the data will be analysed to determine whether the vaccine is a success or not. He said the effect of the vaccine on the volunteers will be studied for seven months after the same is administered once, twice or thrice within an interval of 21 days. After observing the effects of the vaccine for a month, authorities will be apprised of the results of the trial and they will then make a decision accordingly. The Ethics Committee of the college has also given permission for the trials, he said. The vaccine has to be kept at a temperature of -20 to -70 degrees Celsius. In September, Dr Reddy's and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Russia's sovereign wealth fund, entered into a partnership to conduct clinical trials of Sputnik V vaccine and its distribution in India. As part of the partnership, RDIF shall supply 100 million doses of the vaccine to Dr Reddy's upon regulatory approval in India. On August 11, the Sputnik V vaccine was registered by the Ministry of Health of Russia and became the world's first registered vaccine against Covid-19 based on the human adenoviral vector platform.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/first-batch-of-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine-to-arrive-in-kanpur-medical-college-for-phase-2-3-trials-915798.html

The month-long series of online sessions, which will be conducted for 1,040 schools, is scheduled to begin from November 23. The lessons are being conducted against the backdrop of increased usage of gadgets and exposure to social media during the COVID-19 pandemic. "Threat through the unknown and anonymous cyber world is a harsh reality nowadays. Ease of access and unmonitored reach has exposed the children to unscrupulous elements on the net," Deputy Director of Education Mohinder Pal said. "The series on 'Responsible use of Social Media' will create awareness about the various kinds of threats on the internet and also ways to secure oneself from these threats. The children will also be sensitised about responsible use of social media," he said. Pal said students will also be mentored on how to be digitally smart As per the plan, a total of 52 sessions will be held online for addressing 7.3 lakh students from classes 9 to 12 of 13 districts (136 clusters) in Delhi. When a nationwide lockdown was announced in March to contain the spread of the coronavirus infection, all teaching and learning activities had to be moved online to avoid disruption of learning. The National Council of Education Research and Training (NCERT) had in May sent the detailed guidelines to schools defining the role of teachers as well as parents in promoting the safe, legal, and ethical use of the internet by students. Allowing only authorised people to access computer labs, banning the use of USBs, blocking pop-ups and keeping a check on the appearance of new and unfamiliar icons on desktop were among the cybersecurity and safety guidelines issued to schools and parents by the NCERT.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-school-students-in-delhi-to-get-lessons-on-responsible-use-of-social-media-915813.html
15-11-2020||National||Soumitra Chatterjee: Acting titan who took Indian cinema to the world||He was the actor who epitomised the best of world cinema, transcending the boundaries of country, state and language to give expression to Satyajit Ray’s cinematic vision and get framed in celluloid greatness. But the legacy of Soumitra Chatterjee, who died on Sunday at the age of 85, is not limited to the Ray firmament, just as he was never only a Bengali star of Bengali cinema. The suave actor of the world, sometimes called last of the Mohicans and familiar to students of cinema anywhere in the globe, acted in 14 Ray films and over 300 others, gracefully transitioning into commercial cinema in a variety of roles. He made his presence felt on the stage too – as actor, playwright and director. One of the acting world's greatest luminaries slipped away just a day after the festival of lights -- and more than a month after he was admitted to a Kolkata hospital with Covid-19. The actor is dead, his work lives on.  As debuts go, his was one for the history books, the image of a bearded young man with his son on his shoulders in that still from “Apur Sansar” imprinting itself in filmic greatness. His portrayal of a grieving widower who ultimately reconnects with his estranged son in the 1959 film that completed Ray’s famous Apu trilogy made him the toast of world cinema community. And the rest as they say is history. According to film lore, Chatterjee auditioned for Ray’s “Aparajito” in 1957, the second movie in the trilogy that began with “Pather Panchali”, but the director found the actor, then 20, too old to play the adolescent Apu. Chatterjee, however, remained in touch with Ray and eventually landed the role of Apu. His bearded look, it is said, reminded Ray of a young Tagore. In the decades that followed, Chatterjee became the go-to actor to play characters of certain age and intelligence in movies and theatre while also writing poetry and plays. It was a lifelong pursuit of the arts that ended today.  Born in Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1935, Chatterjee, spent his early years in Krishnanagar in Nadia district where he completed his schooling. He was introduced to acting through family stage plays by his grandfather and lawyer father, both amateur theatre actors. Chatterjee did his masters in Bengali literature from Calcutta University. Interested in the arts from a young age, he saw a play by Bengali theatre doyen Sisir Bhaduri. It was a turning point, making him realise he wanted to be an actor. However, it was only when he reached the sets of “Apur Sansar” on August 9, 1958 for his first day of shooting that he knew he had found his calling. There was no looking back after that and Chatterjee became an integral part of Bengal’s art and cultural life with his movies. But he represented India too on the world stage. A black and white photograph of a dapper Chatterjee in a white Nehru jacket and black trousers -- with Shashi Kapoor and Madhur Jaffrey and Felicity Kendall between them -- at the Berlinale in 1965 where his film “Charulata” won Ray the best director award resurfaced recently and was widely shared on social media with men and women old and young sighing at the elegance and charm of the days that once were. But copybook handsome Chatterjee may not have agreed. In a 2008 interview with CNBC he described himself as the ugly duckling of his family. This lack of confidence, he said, helped him focus more intently on his craft. “And my substantial work in theatre has established that I am not just a Satyajit Ray puppet,” he added famously. After all, Chatterjee was often referred to as Ray’s “alter ego”, their cinematic relationship giving expression to one of the greatest eras in the history of world cinema. The maestro's favourite actor played the lead in masterpieces such as “Devi” (1960), a taxi driver in “Abhijan” (1962), “Arayner Din Ratri” (1970), “Ghare Baire” (1984) and “Sakha Prashakha” (1990). The three-decade camaraderie ended only with the film maestro's death in 1992. Their collaboration has often been compared to celebrated actor-director pairings such as Toshiro-Akira Kurosawa, Marcello Mastroianni-Federico Fellini and Max von Sydow-Ingmar Bergman, “… he influenced me enormously. He was one of my mentors I would say. I would not be here had he not been there,” Chatterjee told PTI in 2012. He also worked with other greats -- Mrinal Sen, Tapan Sinha and Tarun Majumdar. His role as the swashbuckling villain Mayurbhan in Sinha’s "Jhinder Bondi" saw him team up with the legendary Uttam Kumar. They worked together in eight films and were known for their different approaches to cinema – Kumar, the romantic hero of the masses, and Chatterjee the intellectual, maybe more cerebral star. Chatterjee was also considered one of the first proponents of the naturalistic style of acting in Bengali cinema – a trademark of Ray's movies. His role as Kshit da, a swimming coach in the movie "Kony", with the dialogue “Fight, Kony, fight!" is still remembered as an example of indomitable spirit and inspiration against all odds. Known to be a perfectionist, Chatterjee in his later years worked with Goutam Ghose, Aparna Sen and Rituparno Ghosh The consummate actor, a pancreatic cancer survivor, kept going even in his 80s -- in the National Award film "Mayurakshi” (2017), “Bela Sheshe” (2015) and "Posto” (2017). Standouts in his theatre career include his rendition of Shakespeare's King Lear in Suman Mukhopadhyay's play that earned him accolades both nationally and globally. He also wrote over 15 plays and directed more than 30 stage productions. Despite several offers, Chatterjee never ventured into Bollywood as he felt he wouldn't get the freedom to pursue his other literary genres. A yoga enthusiast, he edited the magazine Eksan (Now) for more than two decades. But Chatterjee was not just about cinema and theatre. Unlike many celebrities, the die-hard Marxist was vocal about his views and spoke out on controversial issues such as societal intolerance and the 2016 demonetisation exercise. And he never hungered for awards, in fact often demonstrated his aversion for them. He turned down the Padma Shri twice. In 2001, he also refused the National Award to protest the alleged "biased attitude" of the Awards committee which gave his film “Dekha” a Special Jury honour while giving the main award to Hindi film “Pukar”. However, he later received the Padma Bhushan in 2004. In 2006, he won the National Award for "Poddokhep". He became the first Indian actor to receive the 'Officier des Arts et Metiers', the highest award for arts given by the French government in 1999. He also received a Lifetime Achievement Award from Italy. In 2012, he won the Dadasaheb Phalke Award and in 2018 Légion d' honneur, the highest civilian award in France. French filmmaker Catherine Berge had directed a full-length documentary named "Gaach" on life and work on Chatterjee. Chatterjee is survived by his wife Deepa Chatterjee, daughter Poulomi Basu and son Sougata Chatterjee.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/soumitra-chatterjee-acting-titan-who-took-indian-cinema-to-the-world-915815.html

The air quality had turned "severe" on Saturday evening with stubble burning accounting for 32 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution, but firecracker emissions and calm winds made the situation even worse. The levels of PM2.5 – which is about three per cent the diameter of a human hair and can lead to premature deaths from heart and lung diseases – were 396 microgram per cubic metre (µg/m3) in Delhi-NCR at 6 am, above the emergency threshold of 300 µg/m3. The safe limit is 60 µg/m3. PM10 level stood at 543 µg/m3 at 6 am, above the emergency threshold of 500 µg/m3, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India. According to the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), the air quality is considered in the “severe plus” or “emergency” category if PM2.5 and PM10 levels persist above 300 µg/m3 and 500 µg/m3 for more than 48 hours. A large number of people burst crackers across the national capital and its suburbs on Saturday night, flouting the ban imposed by the National Green Tribunal.   Delhi Police arrested 10 people and seized 638 kg of firecrackers on Saturday. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had on Monday imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying "celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases". According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, the PM2.5 concentration in Delhi on Diwali could have been the “lowest” in the last four years if there were no fireworks. The city recorded an overall AQI of 414 at 4 pm on Saturday. It soared to 454 by 10 pm. On Sunday, it stood at 465 at 9 am. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (438), Ghaziabad (483), Greater Noida (439), Gurgaon (424) and Noida (466) also recorded their AQI in the severe category.  Delhi recorded a 24-hour average AQI of 337 on Diwali last year (October 27), and 368 and 400 in the next two days. Thereafter, pollution levels remained in the “severe” category for three days on the trot. In 2018, the 24-hour average AQI (281) on Diwali was recorded in the “poor” category. It deteriorated to 390 the next day and remained in the “severe” category on three consecutive days thereafter. In 2017, Delhi's 24-hour average AQI on Diwali (October 19) stood at 319. It, however, slipped into the “severe” zone the next day. This time, the India Meteorological Department has said that a fresh western disturbance is likely to increase the wind speed and improve the air quality in Delhi-NCR post Diwali (Sunday and Monday).   Light rain is likely on Sunday under the influence of a western disturbance. The air quality is likely to improve due to an expected increase in the wind speed, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said. V K Soni, the head of the IMD's environment research centre, said high-velocity east-southeasterly winds (gusting up to 40 kilometre per hour) are expected to disperse the pollutants. There will be a significant improvement in air quality by Monday, Soni said. The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi also said the situation is likely to “improve significantly” on Sunday.  “Under the influence of a Western Disturbance, isolated rainfall over plains of northwest India and adjoining central India is likely on Sunday. Generally cloudy sky, light rain, thundershowers accompanied with gusty winds (speed 30-40 kmph) is likely towards afternoon-evening on Sunday,” the central agency said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/firecrackers-farm-fires-make-delhis-air-quality-severe-relief-likely-915822.html

A bench of Justices U U Lalit, Vineet Saran and S Ravindra Bhat would on November 16 consider the petitions filed by advocate G S Mani and others, NGO Anti-Corruption Council and advocate Sunil Kumar Singh. The petitioner, Mani, and advocate Pradeep Kumar Yadav sought an internal inquiry and order for removal of Reddy as Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister for misusing his power and position for "making a false, vague, political and scandalised remarks and allegations openly in the public and media against the senior most sitting judge of this court". Advocate Singh sought a direction against Reddy not to make "frivolous and unsubstantiated allegations against the institution of judiciary and judges". He claimed Reddy committed contempt of court by levelling allegations as a prohibitory order was passed by the Andhra Pradesh HC on September 15 in this regard. Separately, on a request made by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, Attorney General K K Venugopal had on November 2 declined a consent for contempt proceedings against Reddy. He said it would not be appropriate for him to deal with the matter as the CJI was seized of the matter, though he agreed that the timing of the letter was "suspect" and conduct was "contumacious". He, however, said Upadhyay may seek contempt action against Reddy, himself over two dozen criminal cases, in his pending plea for expediting trial against MPs and MLAs. Earlier, lawyers bodies of the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court and others condemned the decision by Reddy to make public the letter, containing allegations against the judges of high court and the top court. In a resolution, the Supreme Court Advocate-on-Record Association noted with "deep anguish" the contents of the letter concerning Justice N V Ramana, next in line to be the Chief Justice of India.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-to-take-up-plea-for-contempt-against-andhra-pradesh-cm-jaganmohan-reddy-915838.html

WPRs comprise members of Hindu and Sikh communities, who had migrated from erstwhile West Punjab (now Pakistan) after partition in 1947. They settled mainly in border areas of Jammu and while they participated in the parliamentary polls, the refugees had till now never voted for any form of elections in the former state as they were not considered state subjects. As per official data, 5764 families popularly known as WPRs settled down in various parts of Jammu in 1947. Presently, the number of West Pakistan refugees has increased to over 20,000 families or four lakh persons. Apart from WPRs, Valmikis (Dalits) who were brought to J&K in 1975 from Punjab by then state government were given permanent resident certificates but they had to abide by the condition that their future generations could stay in J&K if they continue to be scavengers and safai karamcharis. After the scrapping of Article 370, both WPRs and Valmikis can now purchase land and apply for jobs in J&K, besides, they can also contest elections. The Valmikis can also now change their occupation. As per leaders of the Valmiki Samaj, at present around 10,000 people belonging to the community are residing in J&K. Valmiki Samaj president Gaurav Bhati said that getting voting rights and right to job is a welcome development. “We will contest polls and also vote. We can now switch to other jobs. This was long overdue,” he told reporters. The DDC poll will be the first major political activity in J&K since the abrogation of Article 370 and will be held in eight phases from November 28 to December 22. In the absence of an elected government in the Union Territory, these councils are set to become a new unit of governance in the region.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west-pakistan-refugees-valmikis-to-vote-for-first-time-in-jk-polls-915840.html

In its order, NCLT has observed that the resolution plan provides no lay off for the workmen of the debt-laden company and for the full and final discharge of their dues for the period of 24 months preceding the insolvency commencement date. “There appears to be no discrimination in the resolution plan in respective class of creditors as the same treatment is provided to similarly situated each class of creditors,” the tribunal said. The resolution plan by the consortium has already been approved by the lenders of the company. “The resolution plan has been approved by 77.04 per cent voting share of the member of CoC and has been submitted in compliance of section 30 of the code. In view of the aforesaid discussions and as no infirmity has been brought out upon screening the resolution plan, we hereby approver the resolution plan,” said NCLT. The tribunal observed that the resolution plan was higher than the liquidation value of the company, which was Rs 90.98 crore. “It is well-settled proposition of law that the commercial and business decision of Committee of Creditors (CoC) is not open for judicial review,” it said. Last year, the RP had invited expression of interest (EoI). Two entities, SSG Infratech and a consortium of Rakesh Kumar Verma and Shilendra Khirwar along with N-Homes had expressed their interest. However, later SSG Infratech withdrew contending that the project cost estimates and financials were not viable for them. Afterwards, the proposal of the consortium was placed before the CoC of the company, which had on April 16, 2019 approved it with 77.04 per cent votes. A letter of intent was issued by the CoC on July 27, 2019. NIIL Infrastructures, based in the national capital, had launched this project in 2010, but it is yet to be completed. Around 750 flats were launched in this project, of which around 600 units have been sold. The company has so far completed only four towers comprising around 250 units. The realty firm owes about Rs 50 crore to financial institutions including Alchemist Assets Reconstruction and Bank of Baroda. Home buyers had submitted a claim of Rs 50 crore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-company-law-tribunal-approves-rs-103-crore-resolution-plan-for-niil-infrastructures-915861.html

"Three suspects who could be behind the dreaded murder have been detained. Intensive interrogation is on and efforts are being made to know truth from the detained persons," said Deputy IG (Kanpur) Dr Preetinder Singh. Several police teams have been formed to make sure early arrest of the culprits, he added. Forensic experts, with the help of sniffer dogs, have been deployed to gather scientific evidence at Ghatampur’s Bhadras village. The body has been sent for a post-mortem. The DIG said farmer Karan Sankhwar's six-year-old daughter Shreya had gone missing on Saturday evening while his family was preparing for Diwali prayers. The family could not locate her. They kept looking for her with flashlights towards the jungles but failed to trace her, the DIG added. On Sunday morning, the body was found by some villagers passing from there, DIG said. The injury marks on the upper parts of the body suggested that she was killed with a sharp-edged weapon, said another senior official. The girl's belongings, including slippers and clothes, were also found lying near a tree.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/black-magic-claims-six-year-old-girls-life-in-uttar-pradeshs-ghatampur-three-detained-915871.html
15-11-2020||National||From the Newsroom: Nitish Kumar to take oath as Bihar Chief Minister on Monday||In your evening news brief, From the Newsroom, Nitish Kumar to take oath as Bihar Chief Minister on Monday; West Pakistani Refugees (WPRs) and Valmiki community in Jammu and Kashmir to vote for the first time; BSF says Pakistan used heavy artillery and modern weapons during multiple ceasefire violations along the Line of Control; first batch of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine for Covid-19 likely to reach Kanpur's Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Medical College by next week for Phase 2 and Phase 3 human clinical trials, and The United Arab Emirates has approves granting "golden" visas allowing 10-year residency to certain professionals, specialised degree-holders and others.   Here are the top news of November 15, 2020: After the abrogation of special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 last August, West Pakistani Refugees (WPRs) and Valmiki community in the Union Territory will be voting for the first time in their lives during the upcoming district development council (DDC) polls. WPRs comprise members of Hindu and Sikh communities, who had migrated from erstwhile West Punjab (now Pakistan) after partition in 1947. They settled mainly in border areas of Jammu and while they participated in the parliamentary polls, the refugees had till now never voted for any form of elections in the former state as they were not considered state subjects.   Rajesh Mishra, Inspector General of Border Security Force (BSF) in Kashmir, on Sunday said that Pakistan used heavy artillery and modern weapons during multiple ceasefire violations along the Line of Control (LoC) on November 13 which killed several civilians besides causing huge damage to property. “The Pakistani army resorted to use of heavy artillery and modern weapons. Lot of harm was inflicted on civilians, including damage to their properties. Issue of human rights violation should be raised (against the neighboring country),” he told reporters in Srinagar. “Own troops gave a befitting reply and destroyed Pakistani army camps, launch pads and ammunition depots,” Mishar said.     JD(U) president Nitish Kumar was elected leader of the NDA Legislature Party here on Sunday. He will take oath on Monday as the Bihar Chief Minister for the fourth straight term, although technically it will be his seventh oath, including the one in March 2000, when he took over as the CM of undivided Bihar for seven days. However, soon after being elected as leader of the JD(U) Legislature Party, and eventually as the NDA leader, Nitish clarified that he was not keen on becoming the Bihar Chief Minister this time.   Legendary Bengali actor Dadasaheb Phalke awardee Soumitra Chatterjee passed away on Sunday due to multiple ailments at the age of 85. One of the brightest film luminaries in the country, and known to film students across the globe, Chhaterjee died at a private hospital in the city after a 40-day-long battle first against Covid-19, and then with several other health complications, including neurological and kidney disorders. He is survived by his wife Deepa Chatterjee, daughter Poulomi Basu, and son Sougata Chatterjee.   The first batch of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine for Covid-19 is likely to reach Kanpur's Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Medical College by next week wherein the vaccine’s Phase 2 and Phase 3 human clinical trials will be conducted. The decision to conduct the human clinical trials of the vaccine was taken after Dr Reddy's Laboratories got approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) in this regard, an official said. Speaking to PTI, college principal R B Kamal said the human clinical trials of the vaccine will start from next week.   The United Arab Emirates has approved granting "golden" visas allowing 10-year residency to certain professionals, specialised degree-holders and others, Dubai's ruler said on Sunday. All holders of doctorate degrees, medical doctors and also computer, electronics, programming, electrical and biotechnology engineers are eligible. Also eligible are those with specialised degrees in artificial intelligence, big data and epidemiology, as well as high school students living in the UAE who rank top in the country and university students with a GPA of 3.8 or higher.

15-11-2020||National||SC to consider plea for release of arrested journalist in Hathras rape case||The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider on Monday a plea by Kerala Union of Working Journalists, New Delhi unit for bail to its member, Sidhique Kappan, who arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Kappan had claimed he was on his way to Hathras for coverage of gang rape and murder of 19-year-old Dalit girl. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian would consider the applications filed by the association on December 16, including for meeting with the detenue, denied so far by the jail officials and district court. The association claimed there was violation of fundamental rights, human rights, rule of law, creating "a lot of helplessness among the journalistic fraternity in discharging their duty fearlessly considering the fate of the present dentenue". It sought orders for immediate release of Kappan and allowing its lawyers and family members with regular meeting with the detenue and visit by district judge to new Mathura jail to New Mathura Jail, to enquire on violation ofnhuman rights as well as Covid-19 guidelines. The Uttar Pradesh police claimed to have arrested Sidhique and three others, Atiq-ur Rehman, Masood Ahmad and Alam on Monday, October 5, for they allegedly had links with Popular Front of India, and tried to disturb peace and foment communal disharmony in the state. The association had earlier filed a habeas corpus petition alleging arrest and detention of Kappan on October 5 was illegal. On October 12, the court allowed the petitioner-advocate Wills Mathews to amend the writ petition in view of subsequent developments, including invoking of provisions of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against Kappan and three others. In its fresh plea, the association claimed its lawyers were denied meeting of the accused by jail officials in Mathura and Chief Judicial Magistrate so it was unable to amend the writ petition for quashing of the FIR filed on October 7. It claimed members of the petitioner-organisation were also scared to discharge their duty as a journalist or media professionals independently and impartially, as the arrest of the detenue was without complying the guidelines of the Supreme Court in 'D K Basu vs State of West Bengal' (1997). "The present case has witnessed a complete denial of the fundamental rights of the detenue, from the act of rejecting the oral request of the lawyer of the petitioner for meeting the client and to get the vakalatnama signed at the time of production before the CJM, Mathura on October 06, 2020 to  the act of rejecting the proper application of the lawyer and the officials of the petitioner for an interview with the detenue," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-to-consider-plea-for-release-of-arrested-journalist-in-hathras-rape-case-915909.html
15-11-2020||National||India dismisses Pakistan's terror charges as figment of imagination||A day after Islamabad accused India of sabotaging the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as well as of fomenting terrorism in Pakistan, New Delhi dismissed the allegation as a deliberate attempt by Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government in the neighbouring country to divert attention from its failure in managing domestic political and economic crisis. New Delhi alleged that Islamabad also sought to justify its support to the export of terrorism from Pakistan to India as well as violation of ceasefire by its armed forces along the Line of Control (LoC) and the undisputed stretches of the border between the two nations. The angry reaction by India came a day after Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi addressed a press conference alongside Army spokesman Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar to claim that India was behind some of the terror attacks in that country. Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi joined the spokesperson of its powerful army to address a news conference in Islamabad on Saturday. They shared with the journalists a dossier, which, according to them, had contained “irrefutable” proofs of India’s role in supporting terrorism in Pakistan. They also played videos and audio clips during the news conference in support of their claims. They alleged that officials posted at India’s embassy and consulates in Afghanistan oversee its support to terrorists in Pakistan. "This is yet another futile anti-India propaganda exercise (by Pakistan)," Anurag Srivastava, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said. "The so-called claims of ‘proof’ against India enjoy no credibility, are fabricated and represent figments of imagination," he said. "This desperate attempt will find few takers as the international community is aware of Pakistan’s tactics and proof of its terror sponsorship has been admitted by none other than its own leadership." New Delhi pointed out that the face of global terror, Osama Bin Laden, had been found in Pakistan and the prime minister of the neighbouring country had even glorified him as a ‘martyr’ from the floor of Parliament. "He (Imran Khan) admitted the presence of 40,000 terrorists in Pakistan," Srivastava said, adding that the Science and Technology Minister of Pakistan had proudly claimed involvement and success of Pakistan, led by its prime minister, in the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 Indian soldiers were martyred. "Despite repeated calls for restraint and adherence to the ceasefire understanding of 2003 for maintaining peace and tranquillity, Pakistani forces continue to engage in providing supporting cover fire to infiltrators," the MEA stated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-dismisses-pakistans-terror-charges-as-figment-of-imagination-915930.html
15-11-2020||National||Study finds little difference in air pollution levels between urban and rural India||As urban India battles post-Diwali air pollution, a new Indo-US study has shown that rural India is no better when it comes to inhaling toxic air. When scientists from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay and Colorado State University calculated the amount of PM 2.5 (dust particles of 2.5 micron size) across India from satellite measurements, they did not find much difference in air pollution levels between urban and rural areas in different parts of the country. "We wished to definitively evaluate non-urban versus urban impacts of air pollution through the use of all-India data at high spatial resolution (about 4.5 km) for a whole year,” said Chandra Venkataraman, a professor at IIT Bombay and one of the researchers involved in the study. Armed with satellite data, the scientists looked at the PM 2.5 level in six regions across India and found that the Indo-Gangetic plain was the most polluted one with the PM 2.5 level of 100 microgram per cubic meters throughout the year while in the non-urban areas of the same zone, the contaminant level was in excess of 90 microgram. In the remaining five zones, the level of lethal dust varies between 55-90 micrograms but there is barely any difference between urban and non-urban areas in eastern and southern India. In southern India, PM-2.5 concentrations in non-urban locations are in the range of 30–50 microgram as against the urban average of 50 microgram. “There is little difference between urban and non-urban regions and the annual mean PM 2.5 levels are much larger than India’s national ambient air quality standard of 40 micrograms in all of the six regions,” the scientists reported in a recent issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The researchers also estimated that air pollution killed an excess of 10.5 lakh people early in their lives owing to heart and lung diseases every year. Out of this, 69% of the deaths are in non-urban areas. This means more than 7 lakh people experience early death annually due to air pollution in rural areas. While the sources of air pollution vary, with almost similarly elevated levels of PM 2.5 levels in urban and rural regions, both groups of the population face comparable health risks. Since air pollution is typically considered an urban problem, rural India with 70% of India's population generally escapes attention. As per the study, residential cooking in chulhas (clay ovens) with biomass fuels (wood, crop residue and dung cakes) is the single largest source impacting outdoor air pollution in India, though it does not get the same attention as vehicular and industrial pollution as well as stubble burning. “The biggest challenge in estimating air quality from the ground is the lack of sufficient monitoring stations,” said A R Ravishankara, a team member from the IIT and lead author of the study. Non-urban India, which faces a high risk of health problems and death, hardly has any monitoring setups, which is needed to inform and steer policy decisions. “This is one area where India could significantly enhance its capability,” he added. The new research comes two years after another group of US scientists had shown that the death rate due to air pollution was nearly identical in rural and urban India.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/study-finds-little-difference-in-air-pollution-levels-between-urban-and-rural-india-915935.html

However, the Cricketer received backlash on social media for advocating cracker-free Diwali. In the midst of this, Congress spokesperson Udit Raj made some tweets on Kohli's message that created further uproar. While apparently defending Kohli for his message, Raj dubbed the Indian cricket team captain as his wife Anushka Sharma’s ‘dog’. The Congress spokesperson tweeted that, “Anushka does not have to take care of her dog, Virat Kohli. No one is more faithful than a dog". Further attacking those who targeted Kohli, the Congress leader wrote, “You people need to get your DNA checked to show if you are Indians or not?” अनुष्का को अपने कुत्ते विराट कोहली को सम्भालने की ज़रूरत नही है। कुत्ता से ज़्यादा वफ़ादार कोई नही। कोहली ने तुम लुच्चे ,लफ़ंगों और मूर्खों को सीख दी थी कि प्रदूषण से मानवता ख़तरे में हैं।तुम लोगों का डीएनए चेक कराना पड़ेगा कि तुम यहाँ के मूल निवासी हो कि नहीं? Later, pointing out the uproar that he recieved for his first tweet, Raj said, “Virat Kohli's suggestion was welcome but some rascals started abusing on Twitter. I am sure the government is watching it like there is a silent consensus. Action has not been taken against them yet. They cannot be human. They are calling the dog even worse. There is no one more loyal than the dog.” विराट कोहली के सुझाव का स्वागत लेकिन कुछ दुष्टों ने ट्वीटर पर भद्दी गालियाँ देना शुरू कर दी।हैरान हूँ कि सरकार ये सब देख रही जैसे कि मौन सहमति हो। इनके ख़िलाफ़ कार्यवाही अभी तक नही हुई।ये इंसान नही हो सकते।कुत्ते को भी बुरा कह रहे हैं ।कुत्ता से ज़्यादा वफ़ादार कोई नही।||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-leader-udit-raj-likens-virat-kohli-to-anushka-sharmas-dog-915936.html

The new market intelligence and price information system (MIIS), mandated under the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, would replace the existing AgMarknet that provides details of commodity arrival and prices sourced from over 3,300 wholesale markets across the country. “We are setting up an institutional mechanism that would enable farmers to get to know the prices of farm produce at a market near his farm and other markets across the country. This would allow farmers to know the ongoing market prices of his crop,” Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said. The new mechanism would gather information about prices of various crops from diverse sources such as farmer agreements, commodity exchanges, private markets and digital platforms in addition to APMC markets across the country. Agriculture ministry officials said an artificial intelligence-powered system would analyse the information gathered from diverse sources and disseminate the results through various means to farmers such as call centres, mobile apps, web portals, mass media, social media and private websites. The new system would also seek to fill in the gaps in the existing mechanism such as gaps in daily reporting from APMC markets, lack of grade-wise data on farm produce, and limited access to transaction data. “Currently, only 20% of mandis report data daily and there is no major incentive for ensuring 100% compliance,” an official said adding that the new mechanism would ensure 100% data reporting with zero drop-off. Farmers’ organisations, mostly in Punjab, have been protesting the new farm laws enacted by the Modi government, claiming that the “reforms” would benefit the corporate sector more than the small farmers. Representatives of 30 farmers’ organisations from Punjab held a seven-hour meeting with Tomar and Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal on Friday last. The meeting was inconclusive and another round of talks could be held later this month.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-to-unveil-new-market-intelligence-to-tell-farmers-prices-of-agri-produce-915937.html

15-11-2020||National Politics||BJP, Congress flay firecracker ban, root for workers of industry||The raging debate over the ban on firecrackers in several states continued with BJP national general secretary C T Ravi on Sunday questioning the rationale and flagging concerns about other pollutants. The social media was abuzz with many, including Ravi and Congress MP Manickam Tagore, highlighting the plight of lakhs of workers employed in the fireworks industry's national hub of Sivakasi in southern Tamil Nadu. Several states had banned sale and use of firecrackers this year citing the Covid-19 pandemic and environment concerns with the decision coming as a blow to the industry. A day after the nation celebrated the festival amid the ban, Ravi, the in-charge of the party for Tamil Nadu, said about ten lakh people were dependent on the cracker industry. "Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu is where Crackers are manufactured & nearly 10 lakh people are employed. If activist Govts or tribunals want to ban crackers for #Deepavali, they should ban for all purposes now. No pontificating cricketer or actor should celebrate weddings with Crackers," he tweeted. To a Twitter user, who pointed to the plight of workers and the need for alternative employment for them in view of ban and curbs vis-a-vis firecrackers, the Saffron party leader said he agreed with that view. "I agree. Those in Sivakasi dependent on Crackers industry should be provided with alternate jobs. Only then should crackers be banned across Bharat. Also, other activities that involve the mass killing of animals, cutting trees & causing damage to the environment should also be banned," Ravi, who was here days ago to lead a 'Vetrivel yatra,' that was not allowed by the government citing the coronavirus pandemic, said. In another tweet response, Ravi said he was not for banning crackers at all. "As a Hindu, I don't want anyone interfering or lecturing us about how to celebrate Our Festivals. I am against arbitrary ban on Crackers that affects the livelihood of lakhs of Tamil Makkal (people) dependent on Crackers industry in Sivakasi". The topic 'Sivakasi' trended on Twitter and many users of social media, while discussing firecrackers and pollution highlighted that the livelihood of lakhs of people at Sivakasi in Virudhunagar district hinged on the fireworks industry. The National Green Tribunal, on November 9, imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) till November 30 midnight. It had also said the direction of complete ban will apply to all cities and towns in the country where the average of ambient air quality during November 2019 was in 'poor' and above categories. The NGT, however, had said that in cities or towns where air quality is 'moderate' or below, only green crackers be sold. Tamil Nadu did not ban sale or bursting of firecrackers for Deepavali but restricted its use to two hours. Chief Minister K Palaniswami had also written to his counterparts of some states which banned firecrackers to reconsider the decision. Police said they have registered cases against those who burst crackers violating the two-hour time limit on Saturday. In the city alone, as many as 428 cases were registered this year as against 204 last year, they said. Several social media users protested against the ban on the use of firecrackers citing pollution, questioning why it was only for a day on Deepavali. They questioned what they called the 'silence' of activists about other causes of pollution throughout the year. Some Twitter users even claimed the bid to "destroy # Sivakasi" is to help China, which is noted for its fancy firecrackers and tagged some reports claiming that the neighbouring country "accounts for 94 per cent of US fireworks imports." A number of users tweeted using the hashtag "Save #Sivakasi #VocalForLocal." Senior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi said such a ban should be imposed well in advance. "Have always maintained, if you want to ban firecrackers. Announce it a day after Diwali for the next Diwali. It saves traders/sellers/manufacturers a whole year of not having to prepare for businesses they will never be able to do," he tweeted. Tagore, Congress MP from Virudhunagar, shared a report on the cause of pollution in Delhi which did not feature firecrackers as a contributory factor. Sarcastically, he said on his Twitter handle, "Kindly find Sivakasi #Firecrackers in the list of Pollutants in Delhi but blame it for all others mistakes Face with rolling eyes is it fair ?? "Sivakasi only have the talent and knowledge to compete China on #Fireworks industry but Ministers of Modi Sarkar never supports Sivakasi but ran hashtag #Local4Vocal." "Japan skies lit up with fireworks to brighten mood amid coronavirus...but in our India where Our Sivakasi manufactures Fireworks We have fight to stop lies and spread truth," he said. Also, in his Twitter handle he dismissed claims of child labour in Sivakasi as completely false, baseless and unfounded. The social media was also flooded with claims and counterclaims on vested interests working behind getting firecrackers from Sivakasi banned for Deepavali.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-congress-flay-firecracker-ban-root-for-workers-of-industry-915867.html

15-11-2020||North and Central||Firecrackers heard across Delhi on Diwali night despite ban||Bursting of firecrackers could be heard across Delhi and its neighbouring areas on Diwali night even though a ban was imposed on its sale and use in the national capital region in view of rising air pollution and Covid-19 pandemic. Sparklers were seen lighting up the night sky while crackers went off on the ground in various areas. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had on Monday imposed a total ban on the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) till November 30 midnight. The Delhi government too had earlier this month imposed a total ban on all kinds of fireworks till November 30. However, on Diwali night firecrackers could be seen going off in various residential colonies of the national capital from around 8 pm. A doctor in the Kailash Hills area said, "Everyone was posting images of clear blue skies during the Covid-19 lockdown. Now, we all can see how bad the pollution is. Bursting of crackers will make things worse." "The Delhi government has banned it, but you can see what is happening," he said. The Delhi Police, however, said that it has deployed personnel in many parts of the city and action will be taken against those violating the ban. "We have deployed adequate police personnel to check the illegal sale and bursting of firecrackers. Today also, personnel have been deployed and action will be taken against the offenders," a senior police officer said. In south Delhi's Lajpat Nagar area, a lot of crackers could be heard going off. Chitra, a resident, said, "Amid the pandemic and pollution, this Diwali is different. We usually avoid bursting firecrackers for this reason. For us, Diwali is about spending quality time with family at home and exchange sweets with neighbors and light earthen lamps." Jyothi, another resident of Lajpat Nagar, said it was first difficult to explain to children about the ban. "But we told them that if we don't burst crackers this Diwali, then God will save us from the virus and they will get to play with their friends just like before. You need to find ways to convince children. "They don't understand otherwise. But hearing others burst firecrackers, they did ask us but again we convinced them again," she said. However, Shailesh Kumar, a resident of Patparganj, said no one in his residential society burst crackers this time. In Laxminagar, Kavish Chaudhary, a resident, said last year, he burst crackers along with friends but this time he was avoiding it due to the coronavirus. In Delhi's neighbouring Noida, Pawan Kumar said he could hear a lot of firecrackers. "People burst crackers despite the fact that there was a ban. There should have been strict measures to enforce the ban at ground level," he said. Nitish Tyagi, a resident of Ghaziabad's Sihani area, to had a similar experience. Earlier in the day, Delhi Police arrested 10 people and registered 12 cases for alleged sale of firecrackers in the national capital, officials said. "Of the 12 cases, one was registered in northeast district, four in southeast, two in outer-north, one in outer, three in Dwarka and one in southwest," Additional PRO (Delhi Police) Anil Mittal said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/firecrackers-heard-across-delhi-on-diwali-night-despite-ban-915729.html

Born in 1875 in present-day Jharkhand, Munda had challenged the British rule and is credited with mobilising tribals against the empire. He died in British custody at a young age of 25 years. The state of Jharkhand officially came into being on Munda's birth anniversary in 2000.

15-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi fire service responds to 205 distress calls on Diwali||The Delhi Fire Service received 205 calls related to fire incidents on Diwali, slightly less than the last year, officials said on Sunday. The incidents include a fire at a godown in west Delhi's Mundka in which a 28-year-old man was killed while another was injured, they said. "We received 205 fire-related calls till Diwali midnight and only two calls were specifically related to firecracker bursting while most of the calls were about the blaze in open areas or dump yards," Delhi Fire Service Director Atul Garg said. Of the total calls received, 129 were handled by the fire service department's control room during the peak hours (from 6 pm to 11.58 pm), the time when people usually lit diyas after puja and burst firecrackers. Despite a complete ban on the usage of all kinds of firecrackers, Garg said "we responded to 205 calls this year on Diwali which is slightly less as compared to the last year." "It could be due to imposition of a complete ban but people were still found bursting firecrackers and most of the garbage dumps that caught fire are also due to fireworks," he said. Last year, the fire department had received 245 calls related to fire incidents on Diwali, the officer said. The National Green Tribunal on Monday imposed a total ban on the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region from midnight of November 9 to the midnight of November 30. Ahead of Diwali, the Delhi government too had imposed a total ban on firecrackers, including the environmentally safer green crackers, from November 7-30 to combat rising air pollution amid an increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the city. Out of the 205 calls received on this Diwali, 175 were related to fire while the remaining were related to other requirements, including assistance for rescuing birds and animals, the senior fire official said. Only two of the 175 calls were related to fire due to bursting of firecrackers, while 71 calls were related to fire at dump yards or open areas, including the fire at a cooler-cum-wood godown in Mundka area on Saturday night, he said. The injured and the deceased were identified as Aditya, 20, and Sunil Kumar, 28, respectively. Both were residents of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh, the police official said. The official suspects that Kumar was sleeping inside the godown when the fire broke out. "A call about the fire was received at around 11.05 pm and 12 fire tenders were rushed to the spot," Garg said. The charred body was recovered from inside the godown, he said. The fire was eventually brought under control but what led to the blaze is not known yet, he added. The Delhi Fire Service had deployed 2,500 personnel to deal with any emergency on the occasion. Also, fire tenders were deployed at 24 locations across the city from 5 pm to midnight on both the days, the official said. The vehicles were deployed at Azad Market Chowk, Jaipur Golden Hospital, New Ashok Nagar, Yamuna Vihar, Radha Soami Satsang - Bhati Mines, Bara Tooti Chowk, Tilak Nagar, Lajpat Nagar (Central Market), Lal Kuan Chowk, Lahori Gate, Nangloi, South Extension, Sonia Vihar, Mehrauli, Ghitorni Metro station, Alipur police station, Rani Bagh Market, DTC Deport Katran Market, Gandhi Nagar Market, Mahipalpur Chowk, Sangam Vihar, Mundka Metro Station, Chhatarpur Near Tivoli Garden. Besides, motorcycles with fire fighting equipment and high-pressure pumps were also deployed to douse the fire on the streets and narrow lanes.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-fire-service-responds-to-205-distress-calls-on-diwali-915810.html

Lot of harm was inflicted on civilians, including damage to their properties. Issue of human rights violation should be raised (against the neighboring country),” he told reporters in Srinagar. “Own troops gave a befitting reply and destroyed Pakistani army camps, launch pads and ammunition depots,” Mishar said. Paying tributes to the slain BSF man Rakesh, who was killed in action during the LoC shelling, the IG BSF said, “At present all launch pads are active across the LoC and some 300 militants are ready to sneak into this side.” However, he said, security forces, including the BSF are ready to foil all infiltration bids that will be made before the snowfall would block infiltration routes. Marking a sharp escalation of hostilities along the LoC in north Kashmir, four army men, a BSF jawan and six civilians, including a seven-year-old boy, died in ceasefire violation by Pakistan on November 13. Reportedly eight Pakistani soldiers were killed in retaliatory action by the Indian army.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pakistan-army-used-heavy-artillery-modern-weapons-during-ceasefire-violations-along-line-of-control-bsf-915819.html

Five security forces personnel were among the 11 persons killed in multiple instances of ceasefire violation by Pakistan along the LoC between the Gurez and Uri sectors of Jammu and Kashmir on Friday, even as the Indian Army caused extensive damage to Pakistan Army's infrastructure in retaliation. Those killed in the Pakistani aggression include four armymen, a Border Security Force (BSF) jawan and six civilians. "Pakistan fired heavy artillery without any provocation, but the Army and the BSF fought with bravery, gave a befitting response to them and many defences (installations) of Pakistan were destroyed," Inspector General of BSF, Kashmir Rajesh Mishra said. He was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the wreath-laying ceremony of BSF Sub-Inspector Rakesh Doval, who was killed in the Pakistani firing. Mishra said the Pakistani firing caused loss of lives and a huge destruction of civilian property on the Indian side of the fence. He said the slain BSF man deserves the highest tributes as he fought despite getting injured in the shelling. Mishra said about 250-300 militants were ready at launchpads across the LoC to sneak into the Indian side. "Security forces, including the BSF, have been successful in foiling their designs and will continue to do that," he said. The BSF officer also said human rights organisations should take note of the killings of civilians and the damage caused to civilian properties in the intense shelling by Pakistan.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pakistan-used-heavy-artillery-during-fridays-shelling-in-jammu-and-kashmir-says-bsf-officer-915821.html

The senior Congress leader was undergoing treatment at the Rohtak’s PGIMS hospital where she had been admitted since November 5, an aide said. Chandrawati, who had been a Janta Party leader, became the first-ever woman MP from Haryana in 1977 when she defeated political stalwart Chaudhary Bansi Lal from the Bhiwani constituency. She later joined the Congress and served as the Lt Governor of Puducherry in 1990. Chandrawati was residing in Charkhi Dadri district and was a native of Dalawas village. Former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda mourned her death. In his condolence message, Hooda said, “The death of Chandrawati ji has left a deep void in our public life, both at the national level and in Haryana." “Her integrity, diligence and sense of service were her hallmarks…she served the country in many capacities, including as a legal luminary, MLA, MP and then Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry,” he said. Hooda said he had a close family relationship with Chandrawati, who worked with his father, the late Ranbir Singh Hooda. Congress Party's general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said he was deeply saddened to hear the news of the passing away of the senior Congress leader. “As an able politician, she served the state for a long time, for which she will be remembered forever,” Surjewala said in a tweet. Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Singh Hooda also condoled her demise. “Saddened to hear the news of demise of Chandrawati ji, first woman MLA, Leader of Opposition, first woman MP and former Lt Governor and senior Congress leader,” Deepender tweeted expressing condolences over her death.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/haryanas-first-woman-mp-chandrawati-dies-at-92-915845.html

Bheem Rajbhar, who was coordinator of the Azamgarh division of the party, was appointed state BSP president. He replaced former MP Munkad Ali. Mayawati shared the information on her official Twitter handle. According to sources in the BSP, the rejig was aimed at wooing the OBC, especially the 'Rajbhar' community, which formed around four per cent of the electorate and was a deciding factor on around fifty assembly seats in the eastern region of the state. A senior BSP leader here said that the 'Rajbhar' community had shifted allegiance to the BJP in the 2017 assembly polls adversely impacting the party's (BSP) electoral prospects in the eastern UP districts. He also pointed out that Suehldev Bharat Samaj Party (SBSP), a predominantly 'Rajbhar' party, which had contested the 2017 assembly polls in alliance with the BJP, had already parted ways with the saffron party. The rejig came at a time when the BSP faced revolt from several senior leaders, who have openly criticised Mayawati and hinted at quitting the party. As many as seven BSP legislators had recently met Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav and expressed their willingness to join his party. BSP failed to win any seat in the recently concluded bypolls to seven assembly seat in the state. It finished second on only one seat and was relegated to the third spot on all others.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/after-bypoll-debacle-mayawati-appoints-an-obc-as-uttar-pradesh-bsp-chief-915851.html

PAGD members on Saturday had failed to finalise the seat-sharing formula for the District Development Council (DDC) polls despite holding a marathon meeting, the third in two days, on the issue. The alliance partners continued the consultations on Sunday as well at the residence of National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah, who is the chairman of the PAGD The PAGD is an alliance of several political parties seeking the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status abrogated by the Centre in August last year. Consensus has been reached over seat-sharing for the second phase of the polls in the meeting -- which was the fourth such exercise in the last three days, a PAGD leader said. He said the meeting, chaired by Abdullah, was attended by PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee (JKPCC) president G A Mir, Peoples Conference chairman Sajad Lone, CPI(M) leader M Y Tarigami, Awami National Conference senior vice-president Muzaffar Shah and Peoples Movement president Javaid Mustafa Mir, among others. He said consultations over seat-sharing arrangements for the rest of the phases of the eight-phased election will continue. “We are focusing on one phase at a time. The consultations between the parties are being held in detailed manner and in cordial atmosphere. Such exercises take time, but there is a consensus on how to go about it,” the leader, who did not wish to be identified, said. He said the seat-sharing list was likely to be shared by the alliance with the media in a day or two. Meanwhile, speaking to reporters outside Abdullah's residence after the meeting, JKPCC president G A Mir said there was no rift among the alliance partners as everyone understands that this is part of a larger fight for the rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. “There is nothing like that (rift). Even if you give 100 per cent share to a political party, there still will be some lacunae,” Mir said. He said the parties were contesting the polls as a composition and the Sunday's meeting was held to fine-tune the seat-sharing arrangement. “Everyone has seen this maturely that there is a bigger fight ahead and even if some candidate is not accommodated or some party has lesser seats, it does not matter,” the JKPCC president said. He said when the elections to the DDC were announced, the like-minded parties decided to contest the polls unitedly. So discussions took place over the last few days between the second rung leadership of the parties on seat-sharing, he added. “Today, Farooq (Abdullah) sahab called a meeting to give final touches to the seat-sharing arrangement,” Mir said. He said the discussions have been by and large “satisfactory” and the seat-sharing arrangement is being prepared in a cordial atmosphere. “The parties have come together in an alliance and will appeal to the people to defeat those who have forcibly implemented laws in the state and whose policies have not been in the interests of the people of J-K. This is a right opportunity for the people to protest in a democratic manner by expressing their anger by way of voting for the right candidate or combination,” Mir said. Asked whether the Congress was in the alliance only for the polls or would continue to be a part of it, he said, “Those things will come later.” “First is first. This is practical that election is the basis of politics. We are going to polls together with an agenda and, I think, we should focus on that first,” he added. Awami National Conference leader Muzaffar Shah said the alliance will defeat the BJP. “Party politics and numbers are immaterial. It does not matter whether any party gets three seats or one. Gupkar Alliance stays and God willing, we will win this because even though there was pressure from the government and its agencies to break the alliance, it did not break,” he said. He appealed to people to be united to defeat the BJP. “I appeal to my people because it is the matter of Article 370, our identity, our state…it is an issue of Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists and Kashmiri Pandits. We have done our job and shown unity, now you, as people, should give a tight slap to the BJP in these polls,” Shah said. Asked about PDP patron Muzaffar Hussain Beigh's resignation from the party over the seat-sharing arrangement within the alliance, he said, “Whoever leaves his party right now for another party is the biggest traitor of this nation.” “We request all those who have left their parties for some other party, to return as this is a matter of our identity and respond unitedly to the BJP by defeating it,” Shah said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/no-rift-among-parties-over-seat-sharing-for-ddc-polls-pagd-915863.html
15-11-2020||North and Central||Covid-19: Centre to provide more ICU beds to Delhi, double testing, deploy paramilitary doctors||Amid a surge in Covid-19 cases in the national capital in the recent weeks, the Centre on Sunday decided to add more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, double the RT-PCR tests, deploy doctors and healthcare professionals from paramilitary forces and set up a dedicated team to study the bed availability in private hospitals. These decisions were taken at a review meeting chaired by Home Minister Amit Shah and attended by Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan and senior officials among others. There was no discussion on pollution in the capital and its impact on Covid-19 or imposing restrictions due to rising cases with Kejriwal saying that the Ministry of Home Affairs is likely to have a discussion on Monday to deliberate on putting restrictions in the capital. The capital has been witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases since October 20 with the Delhi government officials attributing it to the festival season and laxity in adhering to norms like ensuring social distancing and wearing masks during a similar review meeting on November 2 chaired by Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla. The number of cases has now 4,85,405 with the Sunday medical bulletin adding 3,235 cases. The number of daily deaths is also near 100, with the bulletin reporting 95 on Sunday, taking the total toll to 7614.  In the past few days, Delhi was witnessing cases above 7,500 but the Sunday bulletin, which reflects the cases of the day before, figures were low due to less number of testing on Saturday, which being Diwali. In the next two-three days, the capital is likely to cross the five lakh-mark in the number of cases. After the meeting, Shah tweeted the decisions taken in the meeting which included the doubling of RT-PCR tests and deploying mobile testing vans of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Indian Council of Medical Research. "There is a need for increasing the capacity of medical infrastructure in Delhi. In this direction, 250 to 300 ICU beds will be added at the DRDO Covid-19 facility," Shah said adding that oxygen-equipped beds will be arranged in another facility run by the ITBP. He also said the Centre would provide oxygen cylinders, high-flow nasal cannula and other essential health equipment to Delhi. Kejriwal put the total number of ICU beds allotted by the Centre at around 750, saying that around 500 will be added within the next two days while adding that Delhi government-run hospitals will also add ICU beds with the help of the Centre that has assured help in arranging necessary equipment. Delhi, at present, has 16,641 beds of which only 8,811 are occupied, leaving 7,830 beds vacant. Of the 1,340 ICU beds with ventilators, only 162 are vacant while of the 2,183 ICU beds without ventilators, 261 are available, according to Delhi government's website on Covid-19. Kejriwal also said that the testing would increase to 1-1.25 lakh in the next few days as against the daily average of 60,000 now. Keeping in mind the shortage of healthcare professionals to handle the rising cases, Shah also said that the Centre would be airlifting doctors and paramedics from paramilitary forces to deploy in the capital. A dedicated team would also go to private hospitals to study the bed availability in private hospitals for Covid-19 patients. Steps will also be taken to shift patients in home isolation to Covid-19 hospitals in case their condition deteriorates. This, Shah said, would enable them to contain the deaths. Directions have also been given to prepare a protocol for plasma donation and administering it on patients.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/covid-19-centre-to-provide-more-icu-beds-to-delhi-double-testing-deploy-paramilitary-doctors-915890.html

Adityanath launched the "Shree Gorakhnath Ashirwad" brand of incense sticks, being made largely by women, hoping that the novel product would lead to women empowerment as well. "Besides giving respect to the faith, this is also a big step towards women empowerment," said the chief minister, noting that the women have already started earning Rs 4000-5000 per month. Referring to the raw material for the product being flowers used in worships of social functions and later disposed of in rivers as garbage, the chief minister recalled the Prime Minister Modi's vision and said, "It is also a belief in our tradition that nothing is a waste on this earth and this is a testimony to this fact." "These flowers were either thrown away or disposed of in rivers as garbage. This was not only hurting the faith of devotees but was also polluting the rivers," he said. The incense sticks are being made by the Mahayogi Gorakhnath Krishi Vigyan Kendra, a district level farm science centre set up in Gorakhpur by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi under host institution Guru Gorakshnath Sewa Sansthan for speedy transfer of technology to the farmers' fields. The venture has also been backed by the technical support of the Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, a Council of Scientific and Industrial Research institute with the Gorakhnath Temple Trust controlling the production and distribution of incense sticks. Speaking about the initiative, Lucknow's CIMAP director Prabodh Kumar Trivedi said it is for the first time that the work has been taken up at a temple in UP. "Incense sticks are already being made from flowers at the Sai Temple in Shirdi and Vaishno Devi Temple. We will soon be making incense sticks with flowers at the Chandrika Devi Temple in Lucknow also," he said. Talking of the production process, he said the flower wastes are first dried in a machine and converted to powder, which is then kneaded along with the wood powder. The resultant paste is then coated on thin wooden sticks which are soaked in liquid scent and packed, said Trivedi, adding Basil leaves too would soon be used for making sticks. With a little bit of training, any woman can start making these incense sticks and by sparing just three to four hours after the daily chores, she can easily earn a decent sum of money, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/yogi-adityanath-launches-incense-sticks-made-up-of-flower-wastes-at-goraknath-temple-915912.html

However, higher wind speed -- up to 25 kilometers per hour -- and light rainfall under the influence of a fresh Western Disturbance brought some relief. The air quality had turned "severe" on Saturday evening with stubble burning accounting for 32 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution, but firecrackers emissions and calm winds made the situation even worse. The levels of PM2.5, which is about three per cent the diameter of a human hair and can lead to premature deaths from heart and lung diseases, were 396 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) in Delhi-NCR at 6 am, above the emergency threshold of 300 µg/m3. PM2.5 levels stood at 329 µg/m3 at 7 pm. The safe limit is 60 µg/m3. PM10 level stood at 543 µg/m3 at 6 am, above the emergency threshold of 500 µg/m3, before it started decreasing. It was 441 µg/m3 at 7 pm, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India. According to the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), the air quality is considered in the "severe plus" or "emergency" category if PM2.5 and PM10 levels persist above 300 µg/m3 and 500 µg/m3 for more than 48 hours. As per Delhi Pollution Control Committee data, hourly PM10 concentrations soared to 1,636 µg/m3 by 1 am at Punjabi Bagh and 1,937 µg/m3 by midnight at Jahangirpuri. A large number of people burst crackers across the national capital and its suburbs on Saturday night, flouting the ban imposed by the National Green Tribunal.   The tribunal had on Monday imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying "celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases". The city recorded an overall AQI of 414 on Saturday. It had soared to 454 by 10 pm. On Sunday, the 24-hour average AQI stood at 435 at 4 pm, which was the worst on the day after Diwali in the last four years. Delhi recorded a 24-hour average AQI of 337 on Diwali last year (October 27), and 368 and 400 on the next two days. Thereafter, pollution levels remained in the "severe" category for three days on the trot. In 2018, the 24-hour average AQI (281) on Diwali was recorded in the "poor" category. It deteriorated to 390 the next day and remained in the "severe" category on three consecutive days thereafter. In 2017, Delhi's 24-hour average AQI on Diwali (October 19) stood at 319. It, however, slipped into the “severe” zone the next day and stood at 403. According to India Meteorological Department, Delhi-NCR witnessed light rain on Sunday and higher wind speed under the influence of a fresh Western Disturbance which aided in dispersion of pollutants. The maximum wind speed was around 25 kilometers per hour on Sunday. It will be around 12 to 15 kmph on Monday -- which will be favorable for dispersion of pollutants, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the magnitude of PM2.5 suggests significant local additional emissions (probably firecracker related) on Saturday night combined with farm fire-related pollutant concentrations led to "such a scenario where hourly average concentrations touched more than 1000ug/m3 at midnight yesterday". However, the boundary layer wind direction has changed to easterly which is not favourable for stubble fire-related intrusion. Stubble fires have reduced to around 350 on Sunday compared to around 2,586 a day before. The share of farm fires in Delhi's PM2.5 was around 4 per cent on Sunday. The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi also said the situation is likely to “improve significantly” on Monday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/firecrackers-farm-fires-give-delhi-worst-air-quality-in-4-years-on-day-after-diwali-915942.html

15-11-2020||North and Central||Gupkar Alliance finalises seat-sharing pact for 2nd phase of DDC polls||The People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration on Sunday finalised its seat-sharing formula for the second phase of the District Development Council polls, allocating eight seats each out of total 27 to the National Conference and the PDP. The seat-sharing list was released by the alliance spokesperson and Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Conference (JKPC) chairman Sajad Gani Lone. The list was approved by PAGD chairman and NC president Farooq Abdullah at a meeting of the alliance partners at his residence on Sunday morning. The last date for filing the nominations for the second phase of the polls is Monday, while the polling would take place on December 1. According to the PAGD's seat-sharing pact, Lone's J&KPC will contest from five seats. The Congress will field its candidates on three seats, while Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Movement will fight for two seats. Awami National Conference (ANC), led by Abdullah's estranged sister Begum Khalida Shah, has been allotted one seat to contest. A difference, however, continued to persist between CPI(M) and PDP over 'Pombay' seat in south Kashmir's Kulgam district, which was represented in the erstwhile J&K's state assembly during its last few terms by CPI(M) leader M Y Tarigami. While the alliance has allocated the seat to the PDP, the CPI(M) is adamant to field its candidate from there. “You can check the ratio of votes when I won against the PDP candidate in 2014 assembly polls or when I supported the NC candidate in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. There should be some justification (for the PDP getting the seat). We will contest this seat. This has already been decided,” Tarigami told PTI. The CPI(M)'s decision to field its candidate will not have a bearing on the alliance, he insisted. “We are for the alliance and will remain on the side of the people. We are part of the alliance to defend the rights of the people of J&K,” he said. “Elections or no elections, on our part, we are for the alliance and we have been arguing more vigorously for it,” Tarigami said, adding “if they deny us even a small seat, I think it is not just”.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/gupkar-alliance-finalises-seat-sharing-pact-for-2nd-phase-of-ddc-polls-915974.html
15-11-2020||Opinion||US Election: Goodbye, golden goose||Many see a wannabe despot barricaded in the bunker, stubby fingers clinging to the levers of power as words that mean nothing to him — democracy, electoral integrity, peaceful transition, constitutionality — swirl above. One presidential historian sees something different in Donald Trump’s swan song. Michael Beschloss has been tweeting pictures of Hollywood’s most famous divas, shut-ins and head cases. Norma Desmond watching movies of herself, hour after hour, shrouded in her mansion on Sunset Boulevard as “the dream she had clung to so desperately enfolded her.” Howard Hughes, descending into germaphobia, madness and seclusion. Greta Garbo, sequestered behind her hat and sunglasses. Charles Foster Kane, missing the roar of the crowd as he spirals at Xanadu, his dilapidated pleasure palace. The president and his cronies are likely to do real damage and major grifting in the next two months. But in other ways, the picture of the president as a pathetic, unraveling diva is apt. Trump has said in interviews and at rallies that two of his favorite movies are the black-and-white classics about stars collapsing in on themselves, “Citizen Kane” and “Sunset Boulevard.” In “Sunset Boulevard,” Max the butler and a camera crew conspire to make the demented silent film star believe she’s getting her close-up when she’s actually just being lured down the staircase to answer for her sins. The Republicans enabling Trump’s delusion are like the camera crew, filming a scene with the disintegrating diva that is never going to be seen. “What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time?” a senior Republican official told The Washington Post. “No one seriously thinks the results will change.” Trump, who once wanted to be a Hollywood producer and considered attending USC film school, never made the pivot to being a politician. He got elected because he played a competent boss and wily megabillionaire on a reality TV show — pretty good acting now that we know he is neither — and he has stayed a performance artist and a ratings-obsessed showman. Even after Georgia and Arizona were called and Joe Biden clinched 306 electoral votes — the same number that Trump declared “a massive landslide victory” when he reached it in 2016 — the president is putting on a play within the play, one in which he’s still the star. Trump Boswell Maggie Haberman reported that there is no grand strategy and the president “is simply trying to survive from one news cycle to the next,” playing his familiar game of creating a controversy and watching it play out. As a growing number of Trump advisers and Republican Party leaders privately admitted the end was nigh — and as the Secret Service was rocked by coronavirus infections and quarantine orders from the president’s mask-defying, superspreader campaign travel — White House officials propped up Donald’s grand illusions. This, even as his lawyers deserted him and judges ruled against him. “We are moving forward here at the White House under the assumption there will be a second Trump term,” Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, said on Fox Business on Friday. Kayleigh McEnany chimed in that the president would “attend his own inauguration.” In his remarks about Operation Warp Speed on Friday afternoon in the Rose Garden, Trump showed how tortoise-slow he has been about accepting that he’s out. “I will not go; this administration will not be going to a lockdown,” he said. “Hopefully, the — the, uh, whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be — I guess time will tell.” Time has told. Do we detect a sliver of reality creeping in? The president, who has never shown much interest in governing, has finally dropped all pretense to focus on the core tenets of the Trump Doctrine: himself, cable news, Twitter, self-pity, and caterwauling about perceived slights. “.@FoxNews daytime ratings have completely collapsed,” he tweeted. “Weekend daytime even WORSE. Very sad to watch this happen, but they forgot what made them successful, what got them there. They forgot the Golden Goose. The biggest difference between the 2016 Election, and 2020, was @FoxNews!” The goose was at Fox’s neck. What an unnatural and delicious sight. The network helped Trump become president and allowed him to maintain his viselike grip on his base. Fox was the oxygen inside his alternate-reality bubble. But because Trump is 100% transactional, he couldn’t accept pure math, training his laser beam on Fox when it dared to veer ever so slightly from total fealty by correctly calling the race early in Arizona. Trump is right about this one thing: He has been a Golden Goose for the news business. Every time he opens his mouth, 50 headlines jump out. But the Golden Goose is also a Silly Goose. He should just recognize that Biden winning is actually the best outcome for him. He doesn’t have to do the job anymore and can simply get on with the branding and the whining and the pot-stirring — the parts that interest him. He certainly branded the Democrats very effectively with socialism, defunding the police, shutting down the country and ending fracking. Biden escaped, but a lot of down-ballot Democrats didn’t. Now Trump should move on and stick to what he knows best: promoting himself. Like Norma Desmond, he should give in to the fantasy of his life that he is so devoted to and leave the rest of us to live in the cold, cruel, unforgiving, inconvenient reality. Mr. DeMille just called, Mr. President. He says he’s ready for your close-up. Keep your pancake makeup on and step on out of the house now. The cameras will be waiting.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/us-election-goodbye-golden-goose-915703.html
15-11-2020||Opinion||As if US didn’t have enough to worry about …||A presidential transition can be a perilous time in the world. That’s particularly true when the departing president denies that he is departing and fires America’s top defense officials. US President Donald Trump dismissed Defense Secretary Mark Esper and several other top national security officials across the government. At the Pentagon, he has appointed four new top officials, one of them an extremist who had publicly called President Barack Obama a “terrorist leader.” Another hard-liner was installed at the National Security Agency over its director’s objections, and two senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security have been forced out. Rumors fly that the purge may continue with the removal of FBI director Christopher Wray and CIA director Gina Haspel. The president’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., denounced Haspel a few days ago as “a trained liar.” The new appointments may increase the risk of aggressive action toward Iran. And the upheaval certainly undermines our national security in a transition period that is already fraught. “Trump has figuratively decapitated our operational civilian leadership in the Pentagon,” James Stavridis, a retired admiral and supreme allied commander of NATO, told me in an email. “Jubilant high-fives are the order of the day in Beijing, Moscow, Tehran and Pyongyang.” He added: “I worry about a North Korean or Iranian miscalculation, thinking the U.S. is too distracted to respond appropriately to a fresh tanker seizure in the Arabian Gulf or a new long-range ballistic missile test — something either might do to gain leverage in negotiations with the incoming administration. Similarly, China could move even more aggressively on Hong Kong or even worse Taiwan, while Russia might be tempted to launch a significant cyberattack.” The greatest risks may be in Asia. North Korea still hasn’t demonstrated that it has a warhead capable of surviving reentry into the Earth’s atmosphere — and Kim Jong Un may feel that this is the time to do so, thus presenting Joe Biden with a fait accompli. North Korea has probably absorbed the lesson that nobody pays attention to it when it’s calm and reasonable, and that it gets rewards only when it threatens mayhem. On the plus side, a negotiated deal is easier to imagine now than a few years ago, and after Trump’s meetings with Kim, it may be more difficult for Republicans to denounce Biden for negotiating with North Korea. The scariest possibility would be a Chinese move on Taiwan. President Xi Jinping may want to signal to the United States and Taiwan alike that any deepening of ties will carry a steep price. If so, Xi might prefer to lay down that marker in the transition so that Biden isn’t forced to respond. The risk isn’t so much an all-out invasion of Taiwan as it is a lesser step meant as a warning shot across the bow: snipping of undersea telecommunications cables that carry the internet to Taiwan, turning out the lights with a cyberattack, impeding oil tankers in ways that alarm investors and tank the stock market — and, from Xi’s point of view, teach Taiwan a lesson. Clashes could quickly escalate, for Taiwan would want China to pay a price for such bullying. “Beijing might calculate that the time is ripe for a move on one of Taiwan’s outer islands, but it would sacrifice any opportunity for a moderated U.S. position toward China once President-elect Biden takes office,” noted Elizabeth Economy, a China expert with Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. Beijing should also realize that any provocation could backfire and result in closer ties between the United States and Taiwan, plus pressure to boycott the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022. One not-so-reassuring sign, Economy noted, is that China recently proved willing to sacrifice its larger relationship with India over a border dispute. As for Iran, most experts believe that it will be on good behavior in hopes of getting a fresh start with Biden — unless it is provoked by some aggressive step concocted by the newly installed hard-liners in the Pentagon. In other words, any dangerous provocation is more likely to originate in Washington, not Tehran. Another risk is that Israel may conclude that the next two months offer a last chance to strike Iranian nuclear sites with support from Washington. The ensuing storm would reverberate through the region and might make it impossible for Biden to get Iran back into the nuclear accord. Robert Malley, president of the International Crisis Group, said that one risk generally is that governments may prefer to take aggressive steps now, while the United States is distracted. For example, Ethiopia’s prime minister has ignited a civil war and Azerbaijan began an offensive against an ethnic Armenian enclave. There’s no proof that the timing for either was shaped by events in Washington — but if you’re an autocrat, this is not a bad time to start a war. “Any transitional period presents foreign policy risks,” Malley said, “but a transitional period involving Trump by definition magnifies them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/as-if-us-didn-t-have-enough-to-worry-about-915709.html
15-11-2020||Opinion||A changing India needs to think of a grand plan for its grandparents||Old people are the closest to my heart, but I can’t handle my emotions when I go to an old age home. I am a coward, I think.” A friend messaged me this when she got to know of my planned drive down to a place that houses 50 senior citizens, some of them even super-seniors, 85 years of age and above. Many of us have that mushy spot in our hearts for the elders; that which melts us when we see an old woman at the traffic signal putting her hands out; that which makes our eyes moist when we see a man, all wrinkles, smiling at us through his crinkling eyes. We adore grandparents more than parents. We admire the old for traits that have gone missing in us, secretly relieved that we don’t have to live up to those ideals – “Oh that generation and their discipline.” “What willpower, man! Once my grandmother decides on something, that’s it.” We are in awe of the kind and scale of work we have seen them accomplish when they were younger. “Those women cooked, pounded, served, washed, walked so much. That’s why they are so healthy. Where did they have our mixi-gixi, washing machines, cars, this, that?” If that elder is someone who you look after, mild murmurs begin. “She is so set in her habits and diets, we can’t change that even one bit.” “He keeps on saying the same thing over and over. How much patience can I have? I am also getting old, no?” When fondness begins to turn into frustration, we don’t realise. But in a rapidly shrinking nuclear family and a house where even the youngest needs her ‘space’, the oldest is the one that begins to feel like an occupier. Illnesses start to appear, from mild ‘sugar’ and BP to debilitating ailments. Expenses shoot up: meds, diapers, attendants. In between, a partner passes on; the parent begins to feel lonely. Social outings seem a chore. One day, a walker comes by courier; the walks to the park get fewer. And then stop. The park friends are now on WhatsApp – if the parent is smart(on the)phone type. But real company is missing -- the children have enough on their own hands, the grandkids have the iPhone on theirs. A new question enters the picture: Am I a burden? A dilemma more pressing if the parent is not a pensioner, or the spouse of one. If there is more than one daughter or son, the ‘rotation’ begins. At first, the novelty feels good, the change. The other house, too, can’t wait to welcome her or him. But when the ‘can’t wait’ is for the elder to leave, that’s when these words begin circulation: Old-age home. For a country that has held its hiriyaru in the highest regard, for a culture where even until a few decades back the decision of the family’s eldest was the final, the concept of banishing your old into some place is a shocker. Even if you are genuinely unable to care for your parents or in-laws, sending them away is a stigma. The West has warmed up to the concept of a care home. The US has what it calls ‘guardianship’ for its elders; where a court steps in to appoint a person to look after a person when s/he loses capacity for self-care. But at least 45 of the 50 states of the US have reported many cases of neglect, abuse and exploitation by the guardian. In India, data says the life expectancy of those above 70 has increased by 18%. The need now is to ensure that the quality of life of that elder doesn’t fall drastically. Many working people, some barely in their 40s, have now begun to save up for their retirement homes. Meanwhile, my trip to the old-age home was anything but sad. Yes, the background of why those old people had landed there was. But a few had come there by choice, to pay and be independent. I sang for them, they told me jokes. There was even a love story brewing, the caretakers told me with a laugh, of a 64-year-old granny spending more time with a gentleman touching 75. At least now, they could do what they wished, without waiting for ‘badon ka asheervad’.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/a-changing-india-needs-to-think-of-a-grand-plan-for-its-grandparents-915783.html
15-11-2020||Opinion||The most important constitutional functionary? It’s the JM||I’ll begin this piece by asking readers this: Who, in your view, is the most important constitutional functionary? Specifically, which person empowered by the Constitution decides the fate of thousands on a daily basis and defends the right to life and liberty? Did you say, the Chief Justice of India or a High Court judge? The Prime Minister or a Chief Minister? Maybe one of the election commissioners? The correct answer is someone you probably didn’t think of at all -- the humble judicial magistrate. Why do I say this? Because of an important right guaranteed under Article 22, specifically Clause (2), which says that any person who has been taken into police custody shall be brought before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours of being taken into custody. The accused doesn’t need to personally go to court to enforce this right -- it is framed as a duty on the police to produce such accused in court. Article 22(2) has been borrowed to a large extent from Section 61 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, and is also implemented in Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, which replaced the earlier code. It is quite interesting to note that the framers of the Constitution considered this little part of criminal procedure so important that they did not hesitate to borrow the language from a colonial law and elevate it to the level of a fundamental right. What was the intention behind the introduction of this clause into the Constitution itself? Recall that Article 21 mandates that no person shall be deprived of life or liberty without following the procedure of law. Some believed that this meant that no matter how unjust or ridiculous the law was, as long as it was followed, life and liberty could be taken away. Ambedkar moved to check this understanding by introducing clauses (1) and (2) of Article 22, which set minimum standards of what is “procedure established by law.” In explaining this to the Constituent Assembly, Ambedkar said: “Article [22] merely lifts from the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code two of the most fundamental principles which every civilised country follows as principles of international justice...But we are, as I contend, making a fundamental change because what we are doing by the introduction of Article [22] is to put a limitation upon the authority, both of Parliament as well as of the Provincial Legislature, not to abrogate these two provisions, because they are now introduced in our Constitution itself.” As with other clauses of Article 22, the first two clauses of Article 22 also saw fierce debate, with members suggesting a number of improvements to make protections for liberty more robust. Thakur Das Bhargava proposed a detailed Article that would protect the right of cross examination, right of appeal, freedom against torture and a speedy trial. His passionate speech in favour of protecting the rights of the accused makes for stirring reading, though eventually only a small part of the suggestions -- the right to be defended by a lawyer -- was accepted. One wonders though what would have been the state of civil liberties in the country if his proposals for making the right to speedy trial, et al, fundamental rights had gone into the Constitution. Enforcing Article 22(2) can sometimes be the difference between life and death -- as we found out in the horrific custodial killings of Jeyaraj and Bennix, who were tortured to death by the police in Sathankulam, Tamil Nadu. As horrific as the police behaviour was, in the words of former High Court judge Justice K Chandru, the judicial magistrate before whom the police produced Jeyaraj and Bennix had committed “judicial impropriety and misconduct” in sending them back to police custody without examining their condition. Justice Chandru went so far as to call for the magistrate’s dismissal. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the magistrate must examine whether any custody is even needed. We tend to discuss civil liberties only when high-profile cases end up in the SC or High Courts, but it is important to remember that the war for civil liberties is being fought every day in thousands of nondescript courts across the country. No judgement of the SC or any HC is as effective in protecting civil liberties as a magistrate exercising her discretion when police produce an accused before her and ask for remand. It may require no more than writing two lines, and involve no more than two questions being answered, but it carries more power than the purplest of prose produced by the higher judiciary.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/the-most-important-constitutional-functionary-it-s-the-jm-915784.html
15-11-2020||Opinion||The joy of Deepavali beyond bombs||In my first year of living in Mumbai, I discovered, most unpleasantly, that the Diwali (Deepavali, down South) festival was not how I thought it would be. I’d envisaged the gentle glow of diyas and fireworks radiantly painting the sky. What I didn’t expect, but experienced, was a bomb cracker exploding right next to me in the street. It was so deafening it affected my unprotected ears for days and left me feeling traumatised. This caused me to dread, and even dislike Diwali. I feared going outside and cringed with every thunderous boom, while wanting to join the dogs of India in hiding under a bed. My despair peaked one Diwali at around 3 am, after bomb blasts at frequent intervals over a preceding couple of hours, despite there being a hospital in the vicinity. Usually, I find that if I understand the reason for something, it helps me accept it. So, I searched for reasons as to why anyone would want to make a din so deathly that it resembles the advent of an apocalypse. Crackers supposedly scare evil spirits away, therefore the louder the better (although, if I was an evil spirit, I’m pretty sure I’d revel in such a cacophony. Light, no thanks). Of course, there’s more to it than that though. Apparently, men feel masculine and brave when they blow up bombs. They get a buzz from it. And they like to show off by being louder than their neighbours and friends. Diwali, it seems, justifies this production of excruciating noise pollution for pleasure, wherever and whenever. Never mind that such reckless actions injure, and kill, people and animals. I couldn’t help wondering, how is it in keeping with the traditional meaning of Diwali? Isn’t peace-loving Goddess Lakshmi, who visits on Diwali, adverse to destructive forces and jarring sounds? Isn’t Diwali a time for introspecting, and shedding light on our own demons and darkness? Isn’t it incongruous to disturb and endanger others for a brief thrill? If it wasn’t for the way my in-laws celebrate Diwali, I dare say I may never have appreciated or enjoyed the festival. They’re from Odisha, where Diwali is dedicated to farewelling ancestors. It’s believed that the souls of ancestors descend to earth on Mahalaya and return to their abode on Diwali. While the ancestors are here, they give blessings and are worshipped, and then on Diwali the path for their journey back to a higher realm is illuminated. This ritual is called Badabadua Daka. It involves lighting diyas and sugarcane (or jute) sticks, and chanting a verse that translates as, “Oh great forefathers, come in darkness and go back along the lighted path.” The whole family participates in the ritual together. Sparklers and low-decibel crackers follow. To me, there’s something profound and uplifting about it all. It’s comforting to be able to connect with ancestors in such a way, to have them present, and to honour and guide them. As Diwali approaches, the focus is again on crackers. Will there be a big shift in behaviour this year? Restrictions are tougher, given the pandemic and air pollution. In Mumbai, all crackers are banned, except for sparklers and flowerpot anars in private on the main day of the festival. However, the government only announced the ban in the week leading up to Diwali. Vendors had already purchased and sold stock, bombs included. According to news reports, turnover was much lower than usual. How many people will choose to put health and the environment first? It’s definitely quieter. I’ve heard just one round of crackers so far before the start of Diwali. I’m not completely against crackers. However, it’s clearly time for change, with regulated eco-friendly options being the way forward.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/the-joy-of-deepavali-beyond-bombs-915785.html
15-11-2020||Opinion||Welcome to a world-class university education||Many years ago, leaning on one of the imposing Corinthian columns of a grand old university’s impressive building, a young, bearded teacher gave flight to his imagination. “One day, I will become Vice-Chancellor,” he told his colleagues. Which academician would not dream of heading a university that was once helmed by poets, eminent journalists, distinguished parliamentarians and literary giants? For years, the teacher worked assiduously to attain his goal. In due course, he went on to become a senior lecturer, a reader and, finally, a professor. He endeared himself as a good teacher and would soon hold almost all top positions in another prominent university. Midway, a taint would stick to his name, though an inquiry cleared him of all charges. The professor was inching forward, slowly but steadily, one step at a time towards his goal. Soon, his target would be within striking distance. His first opportunity came shortly. When the post of a Vice-Chancellor fell vacant in one of the universities in the state, he virtually moved heaven and earth to get selected. The whole experience of lobbying with politicians and middlemen even for a distinguished academic assignment disgusted him. He was even more disappointed to learn that merit was the least of the considerations for the job, the top two being caste and money. As the professor did not belong to a major community, the only option was to ‘buy’ the post. He begged and borrowed and could muster Rs 3 crore, only to be forced to withdraw as his competitor had amassed a kitty of more than double that. Predictably, the post went to the highest bidder. Many such opportunities presented themselves subsequently, but caste and money always remained impediments. Eventually, the professor retired from service. Then, one day, the government once again advertised for a few posts of Vice-Chancellors, and his hopes went up again -- this would be his last chance, before being barred by age. Desperate, this time, he took some reckless decisions. He borrowed a huge sum from various quarters. He even paid an advance of a couple of crores to the ‘contact’ who had promised him the job. His friends tried to dissuade him. Some accused him of adopting unethical means, but the professor countered them: This is the only way available since merit is given no consideration. Others wondered how he would be able to recover the amount and pay back those who had lent him the money – and this time it would be Rs 5-8 crore. Months later, the names of the new Vice-Chancellors were announced. The professor expectantly looked through the list. He frowned. He checked the list again. His name wasn’t there. He called up the ‘contact’, who said the money could not be returned because it had already been “distributed”. “We will do something next time,” he assured the professor. But the aging man knew there was no next time. The next morning, his family discovered him lying dead, a suicide note beside him saying no one was responsible for his death, or that of his dream.

15-11-2020||Opinion||The citizen-councillor in the mirror||For two months now, there has not been an elected council in the city. Has your life been better or worse during this time, or not very different? Chances are, most people don’t really feel the absence of their elected corporator. A few have even told me that it’s probably better this way. I don’t agree. But before we get to that, let’s ask another question. During the last two months, considering that there isn’t an elected representative for each of our wards, how much has each one of us done to step up and do whatever it is that the corporator was supposed to do? That is, how much self-governance are we practising, now that there is a pause on governance? We can look at this hiatus between the last council’s term and the next one as a problem, or as an opportunity. If we believe that all we really need to do to get good administration and governance is pay our taxes, then we’ll see this period as a failure. But if we accept that there are some things that we must do as citizens to self-govern ourselves, and only beyond that we should expect governance by others, then a different world can open up to us. In fact, if we do our parts right now, we may even be in a better position to select a candidate of our choice whenever the municipal elections are held. The next few weeks could be a kind of trial period for those who want to contest the election to show how well they can work with public officials, and seek votes on that basis. The absence of a corporator provides a level playing field for such competition. This do-it-yourself approach to governance is also helpful for another reason. The municipal councillor has a significant voice only in the BBMP. In many other agencies of the government -- Bescom, BWSSB, BMTC, Metro and others -- there is simply no role for your ward corporator. So, any improvements you’re looking for in those places must in any case be taken up in a different way. There’s no reason, therefore, why we can’t make similar efforts to engage BBMP, too, ourselves. A lot of people complain about the futility of trying to engage with government, believing that nothing much will come of it. But in my experience, most people have come to this conclusion without ever trying to make a difference, or after making only a feeble effort. That merely creates self-fulfilling low expectations in our minds, and we quickly conclude that there is a good fit between our poor view of politics and the actual performance of politicians. But the world of public problems is not very different from many others. There is simply no way to be a good pianist without a lot of practice, or a good mathematician or software engineer. This is true when it comes to being a citizen, too -- there’s no way to be a good citizen without practising it a lot. And if we give up on our obligation to practise good citizenship, we’re only setting ourselves up for poor outcomes from those who represent us. For the longest time, we’ve confused our failure to engage our public institutions with their failure to engage us. Having elected representatives also made it seem easy to delude ourselves in this way -- we simply told ourselves it was not our job to do anything. But now that there isn’t anyone wearing the representative’s hat in BBMP, the obligation falls back on us. What are some things we can do? There’s no shortage of answers to this question, since there are so many things that need more attention. The roads are in poor condition, the water pipes are leaking, there isn’t enough supply of water to homes, power supply is creaky, bus services are inadequate...the list is quite long. Pick one of those, and ask yourself -- how can I make this one thing better? If that seems daunting, there is a simple way to overcome that. For any problem that you choose to work on, I guarantee you that there are already dozens of people in the city trying to do something about it. Join them. In fact, joining other people who are already in ‘active citizenship’ mode is the easiest and more powerful step that anyone can take to quickly become effective in working on public problems. This is particularly true because a lot of people tell themselves that they would be willing to do something to make the city better, but they can’t find anyone to work with them on this. Well, then, simply invert the problem by looking for someone else that you can work with, and this problem will go away fairly quickly. A few days ago, in conversation with someone about this, I said that no matter where one lives in the city, it is possible to find another public-spirited citizen within a few hundred meters of one’s home. We really live amidst a lot of others who have the same aspirations and hopes for a better Bengaluru as we do. All that remains is to connect with them. As we wait for a verdict from the High Court to set a date for the next election, let’s also set the course of governance in the city regardless of when that election happens. What we do in society today tends to show up in governance tomorrow. The city’s first councillors are its citizens, and when we take that responsibility seriously, we’ll find a marked difference when the elected representatives take their places.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/the-citizen-councillor-in-the-mirror-915788.html
15-11-2020||Opinion||‘Trumpism’ without Trump is an inkblot without ink||By Virginia Postrel Even in defeat, US President Donald Trump is a master of branding. People are rushing to slap his name on their favorite version of the Republican Party. “Whatever the GOP once stood for, voters today associate it with one thing: Donald Trump,” writes Bloomberg’s Joshua Green. “Trumpism” is the word of the season. But what exactly is it, or was it? Those on the left, long convinced that the GOP is a bunch of hateful, greedy racists who want grandma to die, brandish the word “Trumpism” as an accusation that there’s no gap separating Trump’s worst qualities from Republican policies and Republican voters. “In 2020 his sexism, racism and lie-telling have been legitimised and emboldened,” writes David Smith in the Guardian. “We cannot separate, disentangle, Trump from the Republican Party,” declares Eddie S. Gaude Jr., chairman of Princeton University’s African American studies department. To try is to pretend “that somehow Democrats have to reconcile with Republicans as if these were rational actors who have been behaving in good faith the past 40 years. They haven’t.” In this reading, Trumpism has ruled the GOP since President Ronald Reagan’s day, and it amounts to being hateful and divisive. On the right, politicians and commentators hope to attach Trump’s powerful brand, minus the less savory associations, to their own ambitions and favored policies. “Republicans won elections down ballot because of Donald Trump, not in spite of Donald Trump,” Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton told Wall Street Journal reporters for an article about the “future of Trumpism.” With two Harvard degrees, a nerdy manner and a military bearing, Cotton is an unlikely successor to the flamboyant president. But he’s a torchbearer for Trump’s economic nationalism and populist resentments. “All the high wardens of popular culture in this country, they love to make fun of Donald Trump, to mock him, to ridicule him,” he told an Arkansas fundraising dinner in 2017. “They make fun of his hair, they make fun of the color of his skin, they make fun of the way he talks — he’s from Queens, not from Manhattan. They make fun of that long tie he wears, they make fun of his taste for McDonald’s. What I don’t think they realize is that out here in Arkansas and the heartland and the places that made a difference in that election, like Michigan and Wisconsin, when we hear that kind of ridicule, we hear them making fun of the way we look, and the way we talk, and the way we think.” For Senator Mario Rubio of Florida, Trumpism offers a chance to jettison the GOP’s devotion to free markets and its association with big business. “The free market exists to serve our people. Our people don’t exist to serve the free market,” he told the Wall Street Journal. Before Trump descended his famous escalator to enter the 2016 race, Rubio’s so-called reform conservatism was the next big thing on the intellectual right. That was essentially a U.S. version of European-style Christian democracy, with policies favoring families, workers and stable communities. Protectionism and industrial policy are in. Free markets are out. Now it’s supposed to be the kinder, gentler version of Trumpism. There’s some truth in all these interpretations, but they miss what makes Trumpism distinctive. I often tell new readers of my 1998 book, "The Future and Its Enemies," that they can update the first chapter by replacing the words “Pat Buchanan” with “Donald Trump.” Buchanan — a conservative columnist and TV host who got his start as a speechwriter for President Richard Nixon — was a Republican presidential primary candidate in the 1990s. Like Trump, he advocated a return to a static ideal of mid-20th-century America, with heavy industry unthreatened by international competition or new technologies, and an apparently homogeneous culture unblemished by immigrants. Both men found fans among workers fearful of losing their jobs to outsiders or to unseen, barely understood market forces. When you read Buchanan’s famously dark “culture war” speech to the 1992 Republican convention, however, it doesn’t take long to detect a major difference. As policy, Trumpism and Buchananism may be the same. They even share the ethos of the schoolyard brawler. But Buchanan saw himself, and the Republican Party, as upholding norms. He spoke in the stern voice of traditionalist Catholic schools: against abortion, against homosexuality, against feminism, against pornography, against Bill Clinton’s draft dodging and Hillary Clinton’s legal career. “There is a religious war going on in this country,” he declared. “It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as was the Cold War itself, for this war is for the soul of America.” Buchanan was judgmental. Trump would never give a speech like that, any more than Buchanan would boast about grabbing women by their private parts. Trump is all id, and so is Trumpism. It offers supporters not just policies but emotional release. Trump’s rallies are famously fun. He’s a showman who doesn’t mind his tongue, unless you count making sure he keeps the audience laughing. “It’s a lot easier to act presidential than to do what I do; anybody can act presidential,” he told a Florida rally, stiffening and taking a few paces to great laughter before resuming: “Ladies and gentleman of the state of Florida, thank you very much for being here. You are tremendous people and I will leave now, because I am boring you to death.” Trump cares less about power than about applause. And he wins that applause by telling fans to let it all hang out. Embodied in a man for whom bankruptcy is as routine as divorce, Trumpism’s radical departure from Republican Party tradition isn’t its protectionist economics but its anti-bourgeois character. It avoids hypocrisy, the tribute that vice pays to virtue, by scorning virtue. For people tired of being bossed around, Trumpism offers relief: from minding their manners and policing their speech, from regulatory niggling and environmental pieties, from wearing masks and being nice. Breaking norms is its emotional core. With their message discipline and pristine resumes, conventional politicians like Cotton and Rubio offer no such release, however much they may adopt Trump’s policies and seek support among his followers. Trumpism without Trump is like chocolate chip ice cream without chocolate chips. Missing its defining ingredient, it’s plain vanilla.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/trumpism-without-trump-is-an-inkblot-without-ink-915944.html
15-11-2020||Opinion||Virtual reality and the Covid-19 mental health crisis: A frontline doctor open up||I am being challenged daily. As a frontline doctor, I find that the Covid-19 pandemic has not only tested my clinical abilities but also strained my capacity to bear witness to grievous suffering. This suffering extends well beyond the physical distress of hospitalized patients battling the virus. The pandemic has also spawned a mental health crisis beyond anything I have seen in 25 years of caring for patients. The statistics are overwhelming: CDC research indicates that 31 percent of Americans have reported anxiety and depression during the pandemic, and 11 percent have considered suicide. A national shortage in mental health clinicians existed before COVID-19. Now, health care organizations must decide how to rapidly scale and deploy behavioral health care to a geographically widespread and increasingly isolated populace. There is no time to wait for expansion of the mental health workforce. Doctors are now turning to an unlikely solution: virtual reality (VR). When most people think of VR, they think of a gaming technology—a toy for pent-up teens to play first-person shooter games in their parents’ basement. But for decades, scientists around the world have been quietly discovering the surprising health benefits of VR for ailments ranging from severe pain, to PTSD, to substance use, to existential anxiety. Over 5,000 studies reveal that VR has an uncanny ability to diminish pain, steady nerves, and boost mental health—and best of all, it can be administered at home without a trained clinician. VR works by creating a sense of psychological presence. When VR scientists speak of presence, they mean the technology has a unique ability to convey a sense of just “being there,” wherever there happens to be. It might be relaxing by the ocean or soaring in a hang glider or swimming with dolphins without leaving their couch. VR can even cause people to think and feel like another person altogether. For example, using a headset can enable people with depression to assume the body of Sigmund Freud and engage in self-counseling through his persona, allow people with eating disorders to experience life by way of a healthy avatar, and teleport people outside their own body so that they may gain new insights about the nature of dying. In all of these cases, if the VR is any good, the user feels transported to a new virtual environment and temporarily accepts it as reality. When used in the right way, at the right time and with the right patient, these virtual journeys can change mind and body for the better, all from the comfort of home. Until recently, VR technology has been too expensive, unreliable and unwieldy for doctors to prescribe home-based virtual therapeutics. Now that’s all changed, and the timing couldn’t be better given the mental health crisis of Covid-19. In the past five years, multinational companies, including Facebook, Google, HP and others, have invested billions of dollars into developing and expanding the VR industry. As a result, explosive advances have been made in delivering low-cost, portable and high-quality VR to the masses. We have now reached an inflection point where the technology is cheap enough, its quality good enough and the science voluminous enough to think seriously about leveraging VR to improve mental health at scale with home-based treatments. My lab at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, and others like it, has been on a journey to study whether and how VR can improve mental health. We created one of the largest medical VR programs in the world and have now treated several thousand patients with immersive therapeutics. In my book, VRx, I reveal how our team is using VR in the emergency department for helping patients with panic attacks, treating women in labor who are seeking to avoid an epidural, and managing patients with painful injuries. I discuss the research on how VR can treat irritable bowel syndrome, support stroke rehabilitation, steady tremors, manage schizophrenia and engage patients with dementia. But it was the Covid-19 pandemic more than anything that has pushed us to move VR outside the walls of the hospital and into the community. Now, with the help of research funding from the National Institutes of Health, our team is shipping VR headsets directly to patients where they can receive mind-body treatments in vibrant, three-dimensional worlds—all in the privacy of their home and without the need for a live visit. Instead of prescribing another pill through a traditional in-person session, we might recommend a virtual beach vacation at home to ease aches and pains, or prescribe a course of cognitive behavioral therapy for people suffering from anxiety or depression. In one program, called EaseVR, patients with chronic pain learn to control their mind and body through VR biofeedback therapy in a whimsical forest of glowing trees beside a shimmering lake. As the patient breathes in and out in sync with beating drums, the microphone in the headset detects the respirations and uses the input to drive a metaphorical visual narrative, allowing the user to breathe life into a dying tree or cause the sky to brighten a lustrous shade of blue. Virtual trees expand and contract in rhythm with breathing, like a huge arboreal lung exchanging air in sync with the patients’ body. Evidence shows this type of therapy not only helps in the short term, but can also alleviate pain, anxiety and depression well after the immediate treatment is over. VR does all this by radically changing our perspective of the world. We can imagine being somewhere fantastical and healing. We can practice being the person we want to become. We can see ourselves from beyond and regard ourselves in a new light. We can empathize with ourselves and with others. We can confront our inner voice. We can transform our minds drastically and immediately, and when effective, forge healthy cognitions that last long after the headsets are removed. VR is not just for gamers anymore. It is a new type of mental health treatment that can make things easier when times are hard.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/virtual-reality-and-the-covid-19-mental-health-crisis-a-frontline-doctor-open-up-915983.html

After dishing out a variety of products, including delicious but cost-effective food items, and successfully venturing into organic farming and beauty parlour business to running a petrol pump, the inmates of the Poojappura Central Prison here are now making footwear. As part of a series of welfare measures for the prisoners to bring them to the forefront of society, the Kerala Prisons and Correctional Services Department recently established a manual footwear manufacturing unit at the jail premises. The jail authorities released photos of inmates, in their conventional attire, engaged in chappal making, and the colourful footwear they made. "Each pair of slippers will be sold at Rs 80 and it will be marketed under the brand name-Freedom Walk," Superintendent of the prison and correction home Nirmalanandan Nair said. Director-General of Prisons and Correctional services Rishi Raj Singh, DGP, on Saturday launched the sale of the slippers at a function in the jail premises adhering to Covid protocols. Meanwhile, a prison statement here said the Poojappura central jail has now become a complete Covid-free zone. With the coordinated efforts of the Health and Jail Departments, the central prison has become free of viral infection in one month. "All the 42 inmates, who had remained Covid positive, have now turned negative for the disease. At present, there is no Covid-19 positive patient at this jail," the superintendent said. In the wake of the pandemic, various services provided by the jail had been stopped temporarily. Now, welfare various services, including food unit, cafeteria, gents' beauty parlour, and the sale of organic vegetables, have been resumed now, he added. Seeking to tap the hugely popular online food market, the state Prison Department had recently begun offering biriyani prepared by the inmates. For this, they have tied up with Swiggy, the online food delivery player. The Freedom Food Factory, an enterprise selling food, mainly chappathi and chicken curry combo, prepared by the inmates at prisons in the state, has been engaged in the business since 2011.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/now-jail-made-footwear-to-hit-market-soon-in-kerala-915770.html

Hitting out at Surappa for continuing in office despite the probe, he said it was a 'mockery'. Surappa has asserted he has done no wrong and said he was ready to face any probe, soon after the state government on November 13 announced constituting an enquiry committee under retired high court judge P Kalaiyarasan to go into allegations of corruption in the university, financial irregularities and graft charges against him. Stalin wondered why the state government kept 'pending' the complaints against the top varsity official for nine months and sought to know what transpired during that period of time. The leader of the opposition in the state assembly, in a statement, said during the DMK regime (2006-11), when a corruption allegation was made against a Coimbatore-based university vice-chancellor, he was suspended and similarly, another official in Chennai also faced the same action during the present AIADMK regime as well, he said. Surappa's immediate suspension alone would lead to an honest and fair probe, he said, urging Palaniswami to suspend the official without any further delay. Also, all the documents connected to the allegations of corruption should be brought under the control of enquiry panel, Stalin said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dmk-chief-m-k-stalin-asks-tamil-nadu-cm-to-suspend-anna-varsity-vc-915806.html

The injured had been hospitalised and investigations were on with a case registered over the incident, suspected to have been triggered by a gas leak at a house in nearby Arani, a police official said. When the cylinder exploded, a wall that divided portions of the house between the landlord and a tenant besides that of a neighbour collapsed. J Kamatchi, the tenant, and her son J Hemanath, and neighbour S Chandra, died in the wall collapse. Kamatchi's husband M Janakiraman and another son J Suresh (15) were injured, the official said. "Under the impact of the explosion, 55-year old D Mukthabai who owned the house on Pudhukamur Road and her 15- year old daughter D Meena sustained 90 and 50 per cent burns respectively," the official told PTI. After initial treatment at a state-run hospital in Arani, all the injured have been admitted to a government facility at neighbouring Vellore, he said. Condoling the deaths, Chief Minister K Palaniswami announced a solatium of Rs two lakh each to the families of Kamatchi and Chandra and Rs one lakh each to severely injured and Rs 50,000 to those who sustained injuries. After he got to know about the mishap, Palaniswami said he directed Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department Minister Sevur Ramachandran, who hails from the district, and the collector to immediately reach the spot and take up relief work and ensure top class treatment to those injured. Palaniswami also appealed to the people to take care and exercise caution while using Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders in their households. PMK founder leader S Ramadoss urged the government to come forward to provide an assistance of Rs 25 lakh to the victims of the mishap and Rs 10 lakh for those injured and rebuild the houses damaged in the impact. Negligence in using LPG cylinders could be life threatening, Ramadoss said and requested the people to assimilate information provided by oil companies in their awareness programmes and act with caution.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/three-killed-four-injured-in-lpg-cylinder-explosion-in-tamil-nadu-915832.html

Shah will meet office-bearers of the state unit, district secretaries and members of the core committee separately on Saturday and elicit their views on a slew of issues relating to the elections, including the alliance question. His visit to Tamil Nadu comes amidst strain in relationship between BJP and its senior ally in the state, AIADMK, over the saffron party's 'Vetrivel Yatra' and other issues. “This visit of Shah is very significant since it comes amid visible strain in BJP-AIADMK relationship. He is likely to outline the party's strategy to be adopted for the elections. He will also elicit opinion from the state unit on several issues including on alliance. Cadres are excited about his visit,” a senior BJP leader told DH. The BJP, which is in an alliance with the AIADMK, has kept its cards close on whether the tie-up will continue for the Assembly polls due in the first half of 2021. The party's state unit has also been posturing by maintaining that no party can form the next government in Tamil Nadu without its support. While state unit chief L Murugan said Shah's visit has already created a “scare” among Opposition parties, party leaders exuded confidence that they will get a “clarity” on the party's way ahead vis-a-vis alliance and AIADMK after the visit. Shah, who will participate in government events, is also likely to meet the top brass of the Tamil Nadu government during his visit. BJP is making a concerted effort to emerge as the political alternative to Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu by going on a massive recruitment drive. The party has roped in former IPS officer K Annamalai, and actor Khushbu Sundar in the past few months. Murugan said the BJP will go ahead with the Vetrivel Yatra despite permission being denied. Union Ministers Sadananda Gowda, Prahlad Joshi, and other senior party leaders will participate in the yatra in different places. “We have invited our party chief J P Nadda to participate in the yatra on the last day in Tiruchendur,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/amit-shah-to-visit-tamil-nadu-bjp-leaders-on-november-21-discuss-strategy-for-assembly-polls-915862.html
15-11-2020||South||Kerala: Sabarimala Ayyappa temple opens, devotees to be allowed from November 16||The Sabarimala Ayyappa Temple in Kerala opened for two-month-long pilgrimage on Sunday. Melshanti A K Sudheer Namboothiri opened the doors of the sanctum sanctorum and lit the lamps at 5 pm in the presence of Tantri Kandararu Rajeevaru, heralding the start of the 62-day long pilgrim season. Pilgrims will be allowed from Monday with strict Covid-19 norms like a negative test result certificate obtained within 24 hours prior to trekking and restricting pilgrims only through the virtual queue system. Since Covid-19 negative test result issued 24 hours prior to trekking was required most pilgrims from other states would have to undergo the test after reaching Kerala. Hence coronavirus test facilities were arranged at railway stations and bus stands also. The health department has also made arrangements for antigen tests in various centres including all bus stands and railway stations at Thiruvananthapuram, Tiruvalla,Chengannur and Kottayam, where pilgrims arrive to proceed to the Ayyappa temple. Only 1,000 pilgrims will be allowed on weekdays and 2,000 on holidays. Only on special occasions like Mandala pooja and Makaravilakku up to 5,000 pilgrims would be allowed. Normally, on every day of pilgrimage, thousands of devotees used to visit the temple. According to Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), which manages the hill shrine, about 85,000 devotees will be offering prayers during this pilgrim season. During Saturdays and Sundays, 2,000 people will be allowed darshan. New head priests ('melsanthi') of the Sabarimala Ayyappa Temple, V K Jayaraj Potti, and Malikapuram temple Rajikumar M N, took over on Sunday and were the first to climb the holy 18 steps and offer prayers. The pilgrimage will be allowed till January and the Makaravillaku till January 14. Pilgrims would not be allowed to stay back at the temple premises for conducting offerings. Social distancing would also need to be maintained. The pilgrims can trek only through Swami Ayyappan road. Doctors, including specialists, will be posted on a rotation basis for seven days each while all other staff will be posted on a rotation basis for 15 days from November 15 to January 19, next year.   (With PTI inputs)||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-sabarimala-ayyappa-temple-opens-devotees-to-be-allowed-from-november-16-915866.html

Certain critical remarks of CAG against Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), an agency of the state government for financing infrastructure projects, is the provocation for the Kerala government, especially Finance Minister Thomas Isaac, to take a stand against CAG. However, the opposition Congress in Kerala was accusing the Finance Minister of leaking the contents of the CAG report before it was tabled in the state Assembly. The opposition was also planning to file petitions against Isaac in this connection. The KIIFB draft report allegedly stated that several fundraising acts of the board like issuing Masala bonds, which were even listed in London Stock Exchange, were unconstitutional. Isaac alleged that such remarks in the draft report were part of political ploy of the BJP with Congress's support to attack the Left Front government in Kerala. However, the opposition Congress alleged that the Finance Minister was trying to be in the defensive in advance and hence he was leaking out remarks in CAG's draft report. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan recently alleged that the central agencies like ED were trying to sabotage key infrastructure projects of Kerala like the Life Mission that aims at proving homes for all homeless and Kerala Fibre Optic Network that aims at proving high-speed internet to 20 lakh odd economically weak families. ED had sought details regarding these flagship projects as part of the probe against Chief Minister's former principal secretary. This had provoked the Kerala government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/after-accusing-enforcement-directorate-of-sabotage-kerala-government-turns-suspicion-on-cag-915920.html

Anaadhija, a forum fighting against discrimination, is now planning to seek legal remedy to this. However, the Guruvayur Devaswom that manages the temple situated in Thrissur district maintains that it had not come across any such activities. Krishnan V A, president of Anaadhija which has initiated the campaign, said that it was said to be an unwritten norm over the decades at the temple not to allow people from other castes like Nair, Ezhava and Dalits to perform inside the temple. He said that a query under the Right to Information Act was given to Guruvuyur Devaswom in this regard and based on their reply further action would be taken. Guruvayur Devaswom chairman K B Mohandas said that he was not aware of any such specific bias as he had not come across any such complaints so far. "If there was any specific complaints in this reagrd, I could have enquired if there was any such discrimination. Those raising the allegations in public forum also did not give any complaint to the temple administration," he told DH Krishnan said that they came across this discrimination now only form known percussionist Chandran Peringod. Peringod even said that many percussionists from lower castes were facing similar discrimination at some other temples also and even individual complaints were also raised. However, there were no corrective actions. Hence the forum was planning to seek legal remedy, said Krishnan.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/only-upper-caste-people-allowed-allegations-of-discrimination-against-percussionists-in-kerala-temple-915927.html

Using a hacksaw blade, brothers Ravi Bhat and Vikram Bhat transform a piece of wooden log into a work of art. The brothers, for the past 20 years have been making wooden sculptures for a living. Hailing from Rajasthan, the duo has made Bengaluru their home. As the demand for art work reduced following the Covid-induced lockdown, they came to Mangaluru looking for work and earn a living. “Carving wood sculptures is in our blood. We have been making wooden statues since childhood. These statues can be used as a vase with flowers or as a decorative piece. We have created over 1,000 such sculptures in the past two decades. Our fascination for carving out wooden marvels has turned into a passion,” Vikram Bhat told DH.  The duo has been carving faces of different shapes and sizes with different headgear. The cost of art piece ranges from Rs 1,500 to Rs 5,000 depending on the size. “It takes four to five hours to complete a sculpture. After completing the carving, we apply wood varnish on the art work. We make two to three art works per day. We buy wooden logs of badam tree, kadam tree from authorities concerned to make the sculptures,” they said. The brothers nostalgically recollect how their wood sculptures were eagerly sought out by customers in Bengaluru. After the Covid-19 pandemic, the demand for such art pieces had reduced, they rued. The brothers used to supply such sculptures for North Indian weddings in Bengaluru. But after the lockdown and due to the rapid spread of Covid-19, large gatherings for marriages too have been prohibited. “We don’t have any work related to marriage halls, and other arrangements, “says Vikram Bhat. The brothers disappointingly inform that not many art works were sold in Mangaluru. It looks like people are in no mood to buy for Deepavali due to the losses they incurred during the lockdown. “We thought we could earn something in Mangaluru for Deepavali. But there is not much demand for the wood sculptures. We will return to Bengaluru after a few days,” the eldest among the brothers, Vikram informs.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/wood-sculptors-lost-in-the-jungle-of-uncertainty-915741.html

15-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka govt gives nod for Maski irrigation project, Maratha Development Authority||The Karnataka government has given its approval to the Maski Nala irrigation project in Raichur district and to establish Maratha Development Authority (MDA). Orders to this effect were passed on Friday. The government said it has accorded administrative sanction to the Detailed Project Report (DPR) with an estimated cost of Rs 52.54 crore as allotted in the year 2018 -19 for the remodelling of the left bank and right bank canals and their distributaries. According to sources in the irrigation department, this project was a long pending demand of people in the region, which finally got the government nod. The government also announced setting up the MDA with a grant of Rs 50 crore. In his order, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa said, "In view of the substantial Maratha population in the state, a Maratha Development Authority will be established for their social, economic, academic and religious development and for this purpose an order has been issued earmarking Rs 50 crore with the consent of the Finance department." Sources in the administrative circle said both the decisions were made in view of the upcoming by-polls to Maski and Basavakalyan assembly segments. Maski assembly constituency fell vacant after the sitting Congress MLA Pratap Gouda Patil resigned from the assembly in 2019 along with 15 other MLAs triggering a political crisis in the state with the fall of the coalition government of Congress and the JD(S), led by H D Kumaraswamy. The bypoll for the Basavakalyan assembly constituency was warranted by the demise of the sitting Congress MLA B Narayan Rao due to coronavirus in a hospital in Bengaluru on September 24. Basavakalyan in Bidar district of North Karnataka is located just at the border of Maharashtra. It has a substantial Maratha population. The decision to establish MDA has drawn flak from pro-Kannada activist Vatal Nagaraj, who opined that such precedence will lead to setting up of Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam development authorities in the coming year. He said the Chief Minister should drop the proposal.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-govt-gives-nod-for-maski-irrigation-project-maratha-development-authority-915857.html

Social activist Manjunath Hebsur invited nine transgender women to his home in Navanagar, offered them sarees and other offerings, which a brother gives to his sisters during the festival time. In return, the ‘mangalamukis’ performed the Lakshmi pooja and sang devotional songs. They later lit lamps and burst green crackers. “The entire celebrations was emotional and satisfying,” said Manjunath and added that he came in contact with these transgender persons during the lockdown period. “We were distributing Modi food kits and other essentials to them when they shared that no one invites them home to celebrate any festival or they have no festival to celebrate. That statement disturbed me. So I decided to invite them home.” “They (transgender persons) did not just lit the lamp at our house, but also spread happiness in our family,” he said and thanked his wife Supriya Hebsur and daughter Ashvika for helping him in breaking the stereotypes and barriers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/family-celebrates-deepavali-with-transgender-women-in-hubballi-915908.html
15-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||B S Yediyurappa's Delhi visit for cabinet expansion likely on November 18||Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa is planning a visit to Delhi this week to get the party high command's nod for the cabinet expansion and reshuffle, sources close to him said on Sunday. Yediyurappa's Delhi visit, which is in the offing for quite some time, may happen on Wednesday, the sources added. He had told reporters that the cabinet expansion and reshuffle would be taken up soon after the by-elections to Rajarajeshwari Nagar and Sira Assembly constituencies. With cabinet expansion on cards, hectic political activities and lobbying within the BJP circle have started for ministerial positions. Recently, a few BJP MLAs met at the residence of Irrigation Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi giving rise to speculation that it pertained to those who were aspiring for ministerial berths. Among those who attended the meeting were Chitradurga MLA G H Thippa Reddy and Poornima Srinivas, who expressed their desire to find a place in the state cabinet. Besides them, eight-time MLA Umesh Katti and Honnali MLA M P Renukacharya have expressed their desire to secure the coveted posts. While Umesh Katti said in Hukkeri on Saturday that he would be inducted in the cabinet, Renukacharya recently called on the Chief Minister and reportedly asked him to consider his name whenever cabinet expansion took place. Besides them, Members of Legislative Council M T B Nagaraj, A H Vishwanath and R Shankar, who had rebelled against their parties, resigned from the assembly and joined the BJP are also aspiring for slots. The Chief Minister has already made it clear that he would induct Munirathna in the cabinet once he won the Rajarajeshwari Nagar Assembly bye-election. Now that Munirathna has registered a thumping victory in the bypoll, his induction in the cabinet is certain. The Karnataka cabinet comprises 27 ministers including the Chief Minister while there are seven vacancies. The Chief Minister had hinted that the next change in the cabinet will not just be a cabinet expansion but also a major reshuffle of portfolios. To pave way for the change, the Chief Minister last week forwarded Tourism Minister C T Ravi's resignation to the Governor, which was accepted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/b-s-yediyurappas-delhi-visit-for-cabinet-expansion-likely-on-november-18-915932.html
15-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Dept for Karnataka-run barber shops to curb caste discrimination||Social Welfare Department has come up with a recommendation to set up government-run barber shops to end cases of discrimination at salons in different parts of rural Karnataka. The proposal is along the lines of Kerala government, which started government barber shops in villages, where Dalits were shunned from using a common salon. Since barbers deny service to Dalits in several villages, atrocity cases are being filed. “Therefore it is appropriate to open barber shops, run by the local body, in all gram panchayat limits. The Social Welfare Department can sanction the required funds,” the proposal said. While the government is yet to take a call on the issue, it was, however, part of the agenda tabled during the recent review meeting on SC/ST Atrocities Act, chaired by Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa. Sources said that the recommendation was placed during the meeting, but was not taken up for discussion, even as the CM directed authorities to increase the conviction rate in cases of atrocities against SC/STs. The humiliating practice is still prevalent in few rural pockets of Karnataka and cases are reported frequently. In October 2019, police and tahsildar had to step in to diffuse tension between Dalits and other communities, stirred after barbers refused service to Dalits. Similar cases have been reported in districts such as Koppal and Dharwad. Sources told DH that though the government was yet to take a decision on the issue, it was under consideration and could be taken up in the coming days. MLA N Mahesh, who was part of the meeting, confirmed that the issue was part of the agenda. “The problem is largely in north and central Karnataka districts. The government should tackle the problem,” he said. Mahesh represents Kollegal, a SC reserve constituency. Among other key proposals in the meeting was a joint operation of Revenue, Muzrai and Police departments to prevent discrimination at temples in a few villages, where Dalits are denied entry.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/dept-for-karnataka-run-barber-shops-to-curb-caste-discrimination-915948.html
15-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Leopards unable to thrive in semi-urban areas: Study||As their habitats shrink, leopards have been increasingly trying to adapt to semi-urban conditions. Wildlife conservationists had previously expressed optimism that the animals would thrive in such conditions. A new study has belied that hope. The massive, year-long study examined the patterns of space use by leopards (Panthera pardus) across 23,902 sq km, from natural habitats such as forests, rocky outcrops to human-dominated areas such as sugarcane plantations, maize fields and other areas with little or no natural habitats, and intermediate habitats such as areas that had a mix of natural habitats and human-dominated areas.   The researchers found that the animals numbered the most in their natural habitats such as forests and rocky outcrops, where there was also the availability of wild prey - hoofed mammals weighing 20 kg or more such as chital, sambar, four-horned antelope, barking deer and wild pig. Conservation biologist Sanjay Gubbi of the Mysuru-based group, Nature Conservation Foundation, the corresponding author of the study, explained that in terms of geographical area, it was perhaps the largest field study on leopards ever done in the country.  “The research team physically walked a distance of 2,768 km to carry out the study,” he added. The researchers conducted “occupancy surveys,” a scientific methodology to determine where a species can be found and what factors drive their presence. Researchers split the landscape into 1,058 grids of 30 sqkm each, out of which 267 grids (or 25%) were randomly sampled. Within these, 240 signs of leopards were detected in 86 out of 267 grids. They found that there were fewer leopards in non-irrigated agricultural lands than in natural habitats where there was also an abundance of wild prey. “Where wild prey was limited, leopard attacks on livestock and domestic dogs were more common,” Gubbi said. The study has implications for the estimated 2,500 leopards in Karnataka which live outside protected areas, where there is a general paucity of other wildlife as well, due to infrastructural developments, mining, quarrying, plus poaching. “If leopards are to survive outside protected areas we need to consider introducing scientifically planned zones for wildlife while designating other areas for natural resource extraction. In fact, unless we prioritise this, human-animal conflicts will increase,” Gubbi said. Human-leopard conflict One key finding was the leopard occupancy in human-settled areas is likely occurring at the cost of livestock, which is one of the primary causes of human-leopard conflict in India. “Hence protecting natural, wild prey can be a key factor in reducing such conflict,” Gubbi said. The study, titled “Every Hill has its Leopard: Patterns of Space use by Leopards (Panthera pardus) in a mixed-use landscape in India,” was published in the international journal PeerJ.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/leopards-unable-to-thrive-in-semi-urban-areas-study-915964.html

An association of tourist guides in Aurangabad on Friday wrote to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, demanding that monuments, like the world famous Ajanta and Ellora caves and others, here be reopened for visitors as the shutdown due to Covid-19 has brought many to the brink of "starvation". When contacted, Aditi Tatkare told PTI, "I will not be able to say anything about this as this is a decision of the chief minister. A decision on opening tourist sites is yet not taken."

Talking to reporters here, Raut said there was no question of taking credit for reopening the places of worship. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday announced that places of religious worship in Maharashtra, which have been shut since the Covid-19 lockdown in March, will reopen from Monday. As per the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) released by the state government, religious places located out of Covid-19 containment zones will be allowed to remain open as per the timings decided by authorities, and devotees will be allowed inside in a staggered manner. "The SOPs drafted by the government need to be followed strictly. There is no need to take credit. It was God's will that people stay at home, and now it is God's will that places of worship reopen with precautions," Raut said. To a question on the BJP saying that reopening of temples was a victory of Hindutva, he said not just temples, all places of worship will open. "This is not a victory or defeat of anybody," Raut said. They were closed on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's instructions, the Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson said. Asked about his 60th birthday on Sunday, the Rajya Sabha member said, "I have spent half of my life in 'Saamana' (Sena's mouthpiece), the strength of the Shiv Sena, and will continue to do so."

The woman struggled in the ditch for nearly half a day and passed away after she was taken to a hospital on Saturday. The victim was identified as Savitra Ankulkar (22). The accused Avinash Rajure (25) is on a run and a manhunt has been launched by Beed police to track him down. According to initial investigations, Savitra and Avinash, a live-in couple, were going to Nanded from Pune via Beed district in a motorcycle for Deepawali festivities. In the wee hours between 2 to 3 am, they stopped at Yalanb Ghat in Beed. “The accused attempted to strangulate her but she fought back, then he removed a bottle of acid and threw it on her as she screamed for help in the dead of the night in that remote area,” said Inspector Laxman Kendre, the investigating officer attached to Neknur police station. A local shepherd tending to his flock heard agonizing cries from the ditch around 2 pm— a gap of 12 hours and informed the police. She was shifted to Beed civil hospital, where she breathed her last. “She sustained more than 50% burns because of the acid attack and petrol fire... She could not survive and died,” he said, adding the victim has given a statement before she died. As per preliminary investigations, the accused and victim stayed together in Pune as live-in partners. The motive behind the murderous attack is not clear, he added. Neknur police station has registered a case of murder while Beed Police have sounded a high alert for all district border police outposts from Pune to Nanded. The BJP has lashed out at Maha Vikas Agahdi government over the incident. Reacting to the Beed incident, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh assured that justice would be meted out. “The accused is in custody,” he said, adding that the case will be tried in a fast-track court. “I would be personally monitoring the case,” he added. “This reflects on the women’s safety in the state. We are ashamed that such an incident has taken place,” said Chitra Wagh, leading activist and vice-president of state women’s wing of the BJP. “This is the 8th such incident in recent weeks and reflects poorly on women’s safety in the state. We are ashamed that this has happened. What is stopping the state from implementing a Disha-type in Maharashtra?,” she wanted to know. State’s Social Justice Minister and NCP leader Dhananjay Munde, who hails from Beed and is the district's Guardian Minister, spoke to the district administration and police. “This is a serious incident. I have asked the police and administration to ensure that the accused is caught and justice is meted out,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-live-in-partner-sets-woman-ablaze-leaves-her-in-ditch-to-die-915854.html

When the family members of Lekhaben Chand (65) went to the VS Hospital on Sunday, they were shocked to find the body 'missing' from the hospital's mortuary where it was kept till her son arrived from Canada to perform her last rites. When contacted, a senior official of the hospital told PTI that the "body got exchanged" and the police were conducting an investigation into the matter. The woman's family members had kept the body in the hospital's mortuary here on the morning of November 11 as they were waiting for her NRI son to come from Canada to perform her last rites. When they went to the hospital to claim the body Sunday, they found it 'missing'. Later, it came to light that the body was claimed by another family who even performed her last rites, Chand's distraught family members said. Accusing the hospital authorities of negligence, they said there were no CCTV cameras and the hospital did not keep proper records of such bodies, which increased the risk of them getting exchanged or going missing. The woman died on the intervening night of November 10 and 11 due to a heart attack, they said. On November 11, the family members decided to keep the body in hospital's mortuary so that her son could come from Canada to perform her last rites. "The hospital was paid Rs 400 for the body to be kept there for four days. Documents were deposited, but the hospital did not provide any receipt," said a family friend, Amrish Shah. The deceased woman's son Amit Chand, who has arrived from Canada, said he was shocked and accused the hospital of negligence. "I undertook a journey of around 36 hours to see my mother's face for the last time. All we found here was the body of a man in her place. The officials do not have the documents that we submitted to them along with the body. We were not provided any receipt," he said. After paying Rs 400 initially, the family paid Rs 200 on Saturday to keep the body in the hospital for two more days, he said. "I wanted to hold her hand and cry one last time. It is gross negligence on part of the hospital. They have no proper documentation. I don't know how to express my helplessness," he said. When contacted, VS Hospital's Resident Medical Officer Kaushik Begda said, "The body got exchanged and the people who took the body have been identified. The police are investigating the case."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-womans-body-in-hospital-morgue-handed-over-to-another-family-915873.html

Sumaira Abdulali, founder of Awaaz Foundation, told PTI on Sunday that the credit for the lowest levels of decibels (dB- the unit in which sound is measured) goes to the strict guidelines of the state government on bursting of firecrackers and growing awareness among citizens. "The noise pollution level recorded during Diwali this year is the lowest in the last 15 years," Abdulali said. In a statement, the NGO said the noise level was measured from 8 pm to 10 pm (on Saturday) and then until the next morning (Sunday). The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had banned the use of firecrackers and fireworks in the city in a bid to check the spread of coronavirus. "A noise level of 105.5 decibel (dB) was recorded just before the 10 pm deadline (for bursting firecrackers) at the Shivaji Park ground, a silence zone in the city," the Awaaz Foundation said. "This is the first time since Shivaji Park was declared a silence zone by the Bombay High Court in 2010 that firecrackers were burst there during Diwali. "The maximum noise levels (for Mumbai) stood at 112.3 dB in 2019, 114.1 dB in 2018, and 117.8 dB in 2017," the NGO said, adding that many people who had assembled at Shivaji Park didn't wear masks. However, the NGO also added that the accurate measurement of decibels for the entire Mumbai is difficult. "While the sound of bombs and other aerial firecrackers was audible in parts of the city. Their sound in residential societies cannot be measured," it stated. The NGO said the BMC's ban on not bursting firecrackers after 10 pm was violated at some places in the city. "However, in spite of these violations and the use of green firecrackers, the overall use of firecrackers was significantly less this time compared to previous years," it stated. Mainly, less-noisy firecrackers like sparklers, fountains etc. were used this time, it said. "I would like to thank citizens of Mumbai, the police and the state government for taking up the impossible challenge of reducing noise pollution in our city, one of the noisiest in the world. "It was heartening to see the massive change brought about through active participation of all, which has succeeded in significantly reducing noise pollution from some of its most acute sources including during Ganpati, Eid-e-Milad and Diwali," Abdulali said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/noise-pollution-lowest-in-15-years-during-diwali-in-mumbai-ngo-915924.html

The matter came to light on Sunday when the woman's son landed in the city from Canada for her last rites and found that someone else had cremated his mother. Following a day-long inquiry into the incident, the police registered a case. Police said that on November 11, 70-year-old Lekha Chand had suffered a heart attack and passed away on the way to the hospital. One of her sons is under isolation due to coronavirus infection while the other son Amit Chand lives in Canada. Lekha's relative kept her body at the mortuary of VS hospital awaiting Amit for the last rites. Police said that on November 13, her body was allegedly wrongly handed over to a person identified as Rajesh Begadia, whose mother's body was also kept at the same mortuary, who cremated her. "Prima facie, it seems that Begadia took the body of Lekha and cremated her without suspecting anything. It is a bit strange that none of the family members suspected anything. We questioned two of the family members to understand what all transpired. As of today, we have registered a case and are investigating the possible negligence and people responsible for this mix up," said a senior police officer. Last year, the VS hospital's mortuary had reported a similar case in which bodies of two women were swapped. The police had registered a case against the doctors and medical staffers on the charges of fraud and criminal conspiracy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/son-returns-from-canada-for-last-rites-finds-mother-swapped-cremated-915929.html

Religious places in Maharashtra, which have been shut since a Covid-19 lockdown was imposed in March, are set to reopen from Monday during ongoing Diwali festival. The Siddhivinayak Temple Trust has prepared a mobile application through which devotees can book their appointments for darshan beginning Monday, Bandekar told reporters. "Devotees will have to download 'Shri Siddhivinayak temple' application on their mobile phones to book slot for darshan. They will need to fill in their details and book an appointment, following which a QR code will be generated with a time slot. QR codes for 1,000 people will be generated during the day," he said Bandekar said devotees will have to put the QR code into the scanner at the temple. "They will be allowed inside after undergoing mandatory checks," he added. "The access barrier will open only if a visiting devotee's body temperature is normal and he/she is wearing a mask," he said. To start with, 100 people will be allowed inside the temple every hour except during 'aarti' and 'puja' rituals. Bandekar appealed to senior citizens to avail darshan of Lord Ganesh on the mobile app until the Covid-19 situation returns to normalcy. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday announced that places of religious worship will reopen from Monday. As per the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) released by the state government, religious places located out of Covid-19 containment zones will be allowed to remain open as per the timings decided by authorities, and devotees will be allowed inside in a staggered manner.
