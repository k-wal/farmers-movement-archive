The FIR was registered against the personnel attached to the Bajpe Police station on November 5 on the basis of a complaint by the parents of the girl, they said. The girl, a first year pre-university student, had filed a complaint against a porter who she had befriended on a social media platform. In the complaint, she had alleged that the man was harassing her and forcing to marry him. He had also threatened to create problems at her residence with the support of certain outfits after her parents told him to stay away from her. The girl and her parents filed a complaint with the Bajpe police station on November 3. However, the police did not register a complaint and the girl was allegedly assaulted by the police officers. She was admitted to the Wenlock Hospital where she is undergoing treatment. Her parents later filed a complaint with the city police commissioner about the assault, after which the FIR was registered. Child Welfare Committee chairman Renni DSouza has sought details on the case from the police on the issue, official sources said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/3-women-cops-booked-for-alleged-assault-of-minor-girl-in-karnataka-913037.html

The state government has submitted a timeline for cleaning the lake to the tribunal. As per the timeline, it will clear the garbage dump in the lake bed over the next three months, undertake purification of the lake water in seven months and complete the rejuvenation and beautification in 12 months, which includes preventing entry of industrial waste to the water body. The NGT principal bench headed by Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel asked the government to submit a report on the status of works by March 31, 2021, and posted the matter for hearing on April 29, 2021. The green panel was hearing a plea filed by Sanjay Rao and others, seeking action against pollution in the Kithiganahalli lake due to dumping of garbage and discharging of industrial waste. Earlier, the NGT had imposed an interim penalty of Rs 10 lakh on the state government and Rs 5 lakh on Bommasandra Municipal Council over pollution in the lake and for failure in the discharge of duties, i.e., preventing entry of pollutants into water bodies.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/will-rejuvenate-kithiganahalli-lake-in-1-year-karnataka-govt-tells-ngt-913056.html
08-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Yogeshgouda Goudar murder case: CBI questions ex-minister Vinay Kulkarni on political motive||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officials continued the interrogation of former minister Vinay Kulkarni in the BJP Zilla Panchayat Yogeshgouda Goudar murder case here on Sunday too. A team of five CBI officials led by Rakesh Ranjan continued questioning Vinay for the second day at the new City Armed Reserve ground in the outskirts of Hubballi. Looking at the people summoned by the CBI officials over the day on Sunday, it seemed as the line of questioning was related to political rivalry between Vinay and Yogeshgouda. It can be recalled here that Vinay had publicly ‘warned’ Yogeshgouda against contesting the ZP elections from Hebballi constituency. The officials questioned, for the second straight day, Vinay’s former personal assistant Somashekhar Nymagouda, and AEE S N Goudar, a senior official attached to Dharwad Zilla Panchayat. Local police sources informed DH that Goudar was part of the flying squad during the 2016 Zilla Panchayat elections, and Goudar had registered a case against Yogeshgouda on the night before polling day, resulting in his arrest on the polling day. Later in the day, the CBI officials also summoned Mallamma Goudar, wife of Yogeshgouda, for questioning. Mallamma, who had earlier claimed that Vinay, who was then the district in-charge minister, had got her husband murdered, made a sudden U-turn during the 2018 assembly elections and joined the Congress at the behest of ‘Vinay-anna’. There are rumors that Mallamma was reportedly paid Rs two crore to stop her firing against Vinay, and to join the Congress. The CBI officials are reportedly questioning Mallamma and others about this. Sources also confirmed to DH that CBI sleuths also questioned Nagaraj Gowri, a Congress leader and close associate of Vinay, and Nymagouda’s driver Pundalik Morab at an undisclosed location during the day. While Monday is the last day of CBI custody of Vinay, sources said, the investigating agency is expected to appeal the JMFC Court, Dharwad, to extend his CBI custody for further investigations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/yogeshgouda-goudar-murder-case-cbi-questions-ex-minister-vinay-kulkarni-on-political-motive-913058.html

08-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Initial hiccups mar compulsory online property registration||The pilot project of compulsory online registration under Kaveri Online services for documents of Stamps and Registration Department launched at the sub-registrar offices of Jala Hobli in Bengaluru Rural district, and Tumakuru has been met with a tepid start. Started on November 2, the initiative was marred by technical glitches in the first few days of its launch, apart from reluctance from the general public to adopt theinitiative. The Pre Registration Data Entry and Appointment Booking (PRDE) system has been optional since 2018 for property registration and issuing other documents. The pilot initiative will be extended to a third sub-registrar office at Chincholi in Kalaburagi district from November 10 as the Department planned a pilot in rural areas. Days after the pilot was launched, several complaints were raised regarding the mandatory use of the software. While many found it challenging to upload all documents online, recurrent server issues also hampered the smooth implementation of the project, sources said. Syed Noor Pasha, Assistant Inspector General of Registration, told DH that though there were some initial hiccups over the initiative, technical issues were sorted out. “We had complaints regarding issues faced at the final phase of registration while using the software, which was addressed,” he said, adding that the software was being finetuned. K P Mohanraj, Inspector General of Registration and Commissioner of Stamps, said that while the pilot project had progressed smoothly in Tumakuru sub-registrar limits, registration at Jala Hobli had dipped. There is some resistance to adopting such initiatives among the public, he said, adding that there were plans to implement the mandatory online system at all sub-registrar offices. Under PRDE, property registration can be done online in a simplified manner, with provisions for both the buyer and seller to upload all the documents and also pay registration fees online. Appointment to meet a sub-registrar to finalise the sale of any property can also be booked online.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/initial-hiccups-mar-compulsory-online-property-registration-913118.html

The couple signed the declaration for the donation of their bodies after death, and also distributed saplings to the guests. ‘Parinaya’, a collection of poems by the bride Sumana, was also released during the programme, held at Vokkaligara Samudaya Bhavana in Somwarpet on Sunday. The guests were told about the importance of body donation and eye donation. Gautham and Sumana said blood donation, eye donation and body donation are the best forms of donation in the world. “We can be of use to others when we die, by donating our eyes and body, instead of burning or burying them. With this intention, we have signed the declarations of eye and body donation,” they said. Kickboxing champion Girish inaugurated the programme.

08-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Hampi Krishna temple: 20 years and counting, still no sign of restoration||It’s been 20 years since the restoration of Krishna Temple complex was taken up, the renovation works are far from over. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had taken up the restoration of Krishna Temple in 2000. This followed after the temple complex was placed on the World Heritage in Danger list in 1999 because of poor maintenance and infringement from nearby development. The ASI had roped in the artisans from Tamil Nadu to repair and restore the main arch and its gopura and the group of monuments inside the temple precinct. The restoration started and ended with fixing steel scaffolding to the temple arch and walls. “Seeing the scaffolding, visitors do not even venture near Krishna temple complex, believing that work is under progress. A trip to Hampi is incomplete without visiting the Krishna temple complex. The tourists to the City of Ruins are missing an important slice of Vijayanagara history,” laments Gopal, a government-approved guide. The Krishna Temple complex was built over a period of four years (1513-1517) to commemorate Krishnadevaraya’s victory over Odisha king Gajapati. While returning home, Krishnadevaraya brought a beautiful idol of Balakrishna and installed the idol in the temple. The temple complex, built in Dravidian style of architecture, has yajna mantap, mahamantap, warehouse, sabha mantap and saalu mantaps to house the travellers/visitors. Beautiful stone carving, stucco detailing and towering shikhars define the monument. One can see the remnants of the once-majestic Bazaar in front of Krishna temple. Such was the wealth of Hampi in its heyday (15th and 16th centuries) that gold, pearls and diamonds were openly sold at Krishna Bazaar also known as Somawarapete (after the weekly shandy on Mondays).   Krishna Temple complex, like many shrines and monuments in the erstwhile capital of Vijayanagara Empire, was ruined and plundered by the confederation of the Deccan Sultanates after the Battle of Talikote in 1565.  A few hundred years later, the remnants of the temple complex and the idol of Balakrishna were found during the excavation carried out by the ASI. The idol is currently housed at a museum run by the Archaeological department of Tamil Nadu in Chennai. But the temple complex is languishing for want of government patronage, says guide Gopal. DH’s attempts to elicit response from P Kalimuthu, Deputy Superintendent, ASI-Hampi, on the inordinate delay in restoration of Krishna temple complex did not materialise as there was no response.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/hampi-krishna-temple-20-years-and-counting-still-no-sign-of-restoration-913125.html

The court made the observation while directing the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS) on a petition filed by a medical student. The petitioner is a student of Kurunji Venkataramana Gowda Medical College and Hospital at Sullia in Dakshina Kannada. The petitioner said since there is delay in awarding the MBBS degree, the university may provide an equivalent certificate.  The RGUHS contended that the degrees can be awarded only in a convocation ceremony. The counsel for RGUHS submitted that there is a provision in the statutes for handing a provisional degree certificate. “Some viable alternative has to be devised by the universities in their accumulated experience and wisdom for mitigating the likely hardship/difficulty their students/alumni are put to, in such circumstances because of delayed ceremonial convocation,” the court said.  The court has directed the university to comply with the direction within two weeks. “..delay if brooked would entail the university with a cost of Rs 5,000 per week payable to the petitioner, and that the same shall be recovered personally from the erring officials responsible for the lapse,” the court said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/karnataka-high-court-asks-varsities-to-give-provisional-degree-certificates-913130.html

He made the comments after the successful launch of earth observation satellite - EOS-01- and nine customer satellites onboard its Polar rocket, PSLV-C49, from this spaceport, about 110 km from Chennai. Addressing the scientists at the Mission Control Centre, he said "..we have started this mission (PSLV-C49/EOS-01) after COVID pandemic. Now we have a series of missions on our hands. Immediately we are going to have the PSLV-C50. It is going to launch satellite CMS01 then we will be having the new vehicle SSLV, the first development flight." According to ISRO, those satellites which weigh less and come with limited launch options, can be sent on Small Satellite Launch Vehicles (SSLVs). The earth observation satellite sent on PSLV-C49 was weighing around 630 kg. Currently, small satellites are sent along with other big satellites which are launched using ISRO's trusted workhorse polar satellite launch vehicle (PSLVs) or Geosynchronous Launch Vehicle (GSLV). Sivan said ISRO was also planning to launch Geosynchronous Launch Vehicle GSLV-F10 carrying earth observation satellite -- EOS-03. "I am sure team ISRO will always rise to the occasion and meet the requirements as per the demand put on them," he said. Meanwhile, in a press release, ISRO said following the successful launch of the PSLV-C49/EOS-01 on Saturday, the ISRO Telemetry Tracking and Command Network at Bengaluru assumed control of the earth observation satellite which is the primary satellite. "In the coming days, the satellite will be brought to its final operational configuration," the release said. EOS-01, an earth observation satellite, is intended for applications in agriculture, forestry and disaster management support. The nine customer satellites are from Lithuania, Luxembourg and USA were launched under a commercial agreement with NewSpace India Ltd.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/isro-gearing-up-for-launch-of-small-satellite-launch-vehicles-sivan-912747.html

Ever since the three laws were passed in Parliament in September, farmers have been protesting largely in the Congress-ruled states of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Punjab which have brought their own farm laws to negate the central acts. Speaking to reporters, Tomar said: "If they (Opposition) wear farmers' glasses and see the laws, they will be able to see the benefits for farmers. If they see from the political prism, they cannot see the benefits."     He also reiterated that farmers will continue to get the minimum support price (MSP) for the notified crops and procurement centres will continue to function.       "Opposition is spreading misinformation and lies," he alleged adding that the data on paddy procurement undertaken in Punjab so far in the ongoing kharif season itself shows the Centre's commitment towards MSP buying.       About 169 lakh tonne of paddy has been procured in Punjab alone till November 6 of the 2020-21 kharif marketing season, as against 81 lakh tonne in the same period of 2013-14, he added.     Stating that such protests are confined to Punjab, Goyal said those will wither way. It was not successful in neighbouring Haryana.     "Procurement centres are fully operational even now. In fact, we have increased them substantially this year. So, there is no question of the Centre scrapping MSP procurement...," he said, and urged the Opposition to stop misleading farmers.      He said the total paddy procurement across the country has risen sharply to 745 lakh tonne till November 6 of the 2020-21 kharif marketing season from 318 lakh tonne in the same period of 2013-14.      Goyal also mentioned that unless the protesting farmers do not clear the rail tracks in Punjab and the state government does not ensure law and order, the services cannot be resumed. Paddy procurement commenced from September 26 in Punjab and elsewhere from October 1. It may be noted that Bharti Kisan Union (Lakhowal) had organised road blockade on November 5, while another protest is being planned under the banner of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) in Delhi on November 26-27.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-says-open-for-talks-with-farmers-on-farm-laws-ahead-of-another-protest-912764.html

The findings were originally determined in April in Bengaluru but published in Elsevier’s Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling in October after peer review. They come at a time when a viable Covid-19 vaccine is not in immediate sight. Dr C N Prashantha, Assistant Professor of the Department of Biotechnology at Reva University, who is the corresponding author for the study, explained that the objective of the research was to determine which drugs can be used to inhibit the virus’ S2 protein from binding with the ACE2 receptor of human cells, mediating viral cell entry. The research team said that it studied over 30 commercially available drugs, including eight anti-malarial, 20 HIV-protease inhibitor and several anti-inflammatory drugs besides antibiotics. “Through our computational model, we discovered that antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and artemisinin have poor affinity to the virus spike protein, and that they are not effective against the virus. However, very good effects were observed when HIV protease-inhibitors were tested,” Dr Prashantha said. Among the HIV drugs showing the strongest effect were lopinavir, cobicistat, ritonavir and darunavir. “Among the antibiotics, erythromycin and spiramycin molecules have good affinity,” he added. Three anti-inflammatory drugs also showed efficacy against the virus: thalidomide, ruxolitinib and baricitinib. Interestingly, a March 2020 letter to the journal Lancet claimed that anti-inflammatory drugs (especially ibuprofen and thiazolidinediones) can aggravate Covid infection because they inhibit the ACE2 receptor. The existing scientific literature, however, says this has not been clinically observed.  Dr Prashantha defended the move to test the anti-inflammatory drugs, saying the intention was to give medical professionals access to a wider option of viable drugs to use against Covid-19. Clinical studies needed Dr Anoop Amarnath, a member of the State Covid Task Force and unconnected to the study, explained that insilico studies (where biological experiments are simulated) are fairly good screening methodologies for identifying potential treatment candidate molecules. However, he added that further studies are needed.  “Although pharmacokinetics may be simulated, pharmacodynamic properties, especially invivo (within the body) may be varied and hence the need for robust clinical trials before concluding the clinical efficacy,” said Dr Amarnath, who heads the Clinical Research and Scientific Review Board at Manipal Hospital. Dr Prashantha agreed, saying that the computational study was only a basis for a more robust clinical study. According to Dr Amarnath, three of the drugs examined in the study have been used clinically to treat Covid-19: HCQ, ritonavir and lopinavir.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/antibiotics-hiv-drugs-can-inhibit-covid-19-study-912786.html

As the VP (Vice President), your contribution to strengthening Indo-US relations was critical and invaluable. I look forward to working closely together once again to take India-US relations to greater heights,” Modi posted on Twitter just a few minutes past midnight. The Prime Minister did not wait for outgoing President Donald Trump to concede defeat, notwithstanding the ‘bromance’ the two leaders displayed in public. Modi also posted a picture of him with Biden. The picture was shot during a September 2014 luncheon that Biden, then the Vice President in President Barack Obama’s administration, hosted in honour of Modi, who was then on his first visit to Washington D.C. after being elected as the Prime Minister of India. The Prime Minister also tweeted to congratulate Senator Kamala Harris – the first woman and the first Indian-American set to take over as the Vice President of the US. “Heartiest congratulations @KamalaHarris! Your success is path-breaking, and a matter of immense pride not just for your chittis, but also for all Indian-Americans. I am confident that the vibrant India-US ties will get even stronger with your support and leadership,” Modi posted on Twitter.    Harris, who has been representing California in the US Senate since 2017, referred to her ‘chittis’ (aunts in Tamil) when she accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination for Vice President on August 19 last. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who was born in Chennai, had migrated to the US in pursuit of a career in medical research. Her father Donald Harris was also an immigrant from Jamaica. Modi’s tweets congratulating Biden and Harris signalled New Delhi’s keenness to move fast and engage with the new regime in Washington D.C. - notwithstanding the bonhomie the Prime Minister shared with the outgoing President Donald Trump, who so far showed no sign of accepting the outcome of the elections and concede defeat. The Modi-Trump bonhomie was put on public display twice, first at the “Howdy! Modi” event in Houston on September 22 and then again at its sequel, the “Namaste Trump” conclave in Ahmedabad on February 24 this year. The Prime Minister’s “Aab Ki Bar Trump Sarkar” comment at the “Howdy! Modi” event was interpreted by some as his call to Indian-American community to support the US President’s re-election campaign. New Delhi had to clarify later that the Prime Minister had in fact referred to the US President’s 2016 campaign seeking support of the Indian-American community. Trump kept on talking about his friendship with Modi and even claimed support of the Indian-American community ahead of the elections. He, however, also made at least two critical comments during his pre-election debates with Biden. He alleged during his first debate with the former US Vice President on September 30 that that the Government of India was not making public the actual number of people died of the Covid-19 in the country. He said during the second debate on October 23 that the air was filthy in India, just as it was in Russia and China. The US President apparently made the remark to once again accuse developing nations like India and China of contributing more than the US and other developed countries to global worming and climate change – an allegation dismissed by New Delhi and Beijing in the past as unscientific and politically motivated. Some of the Democratic Party’s members in the US Senate and the House of Representatives made critical remarks about the Modi Government, particularly over detention of political leaders and activists, shutdowns and restrictions imposed in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) last year after the move to strip the erstwhile state of its special status and to reorganize it into two Union Territories. Some Democrats in the US Congress also criticized the Bharatiya Janata Party’s government for the new Citizenship Amendment Act and process of updating the National Register of Citizens in Assam. “We have to remind the Kashmiris that they are not alone in the world,” Harris herself said in October 2019, when she was still in the race for the Democratic Party’s nomination to contest the US presidential elections. She also criticized External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in December 2019, when he cancelled a meeting with a group of US lawmakers, because it included Pramila Jayapal, who introduced a bipartisan resolution in the American House of Representatives asking New Delhi to end restrictions on communication and arbitrary detentions in the J&K. Biden too not only asked New Delhi ahead of the elections to take all necessary measures to restore rights of all people in Kashmir, but also expressed disappointment over the CAA and the NRC. He, however, of late also acknowledged the importance of the US-India strategic partnership to counter the growing belligerence of China. The Modi Government also took note of his promise to withdraw the suspension of the H-1B visas – a recent move by President Donald Trump’s administration that hit hard the interests of the Indian Information Technology professionals. New Delhi underlined ahead of the US presidential elections that its relations with Washington D.C. has been enjoying bipartisan support. “In respect of the United States, successive Governments on both sides have steadily pursued what has become a non-partisan endeavour. A strong economic and technological complementarity, also reflected in their work culture, has laid a strong foundation,” External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said in Sardar Patel Memorial Lecture – just three days before the “Election Day” in America.

On Saturday, a division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik after a day-long hearing in the pleas reserved its order without granting any immediate relief. Goswami and the other accused — Feroze Shaikh and Nitish Sarda — had challenged their "illegal arrest" and sought to be released on interim bail. A notice issued late Saturday night on the high court's website said the bench would assemble at 3 pm on November 9 for pronouncement of the order. The bench on Saturday said pendency of the matter before it does not preclude the petitioners from seeking regular bail from the sessions court concerned. The court said if such bail pleas are filed, then the sessions court shall hear and decide the same in four days from filing of the plea. Goswami and the two others were arrested by Alibaug police in Maharashtra's Raigad district on November 4 in connection with the suicide of architect-interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother in 2018 over alleged non-payment of dues by companies of the accused. After his arrest from his Lower Parel residence in Mumbai, Goswami was taken to Alibaug, where the Chief Judicial Magistrate remanded him and the two others in judicial custody till November 18. Goswami is currently kept at a local school which has been designated as a Covid-19 centre for the Alibaug prison.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bombay-high-court-to-pronounce-order-on-arnab-goswamis-bail-plea-on-november-9-912835.html
08-11-2020||National||Delhi fears the worst amid smog cloud and coronavirus wave||A steady stream of patients is coming out of New Delhi's brownish atmosphere for treatment at the Breathe Better clinic, where lung specialist Davinder Kundra is confronting what he calls the "double whammy" of deadly smog and the coronavirus. Kundra is among a growing number of doctors who are worried as the capital's notorious air again hits peak pollution levels while a new pandemic wave is battering hospitals. Every winter pollution season, demand for beds spikes in the world's most polluted capital because of an increase in lung diseases and chronic bronchitis. Now the coronavirus has come back after a lull, new cases reaching a record 7,000 a day. Some official predictions say the figure could soon exceed 12,000. India already has the world's second-highest number of cases -- 8.5 million -- behind the United States. With studies strongly linking air pollution to increased coronavirus deaths, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the intense annual smog from farm fires, cars and industry was worsening the pandemic crisis. As he fretted over the x-ray of one pneumonia patient, Kundra said he spots at least one coronavirus suspect a day in his small clinic and orders them to get tested. "Tiny microscopic pollutants act as carriers for the virus and go deep into the lungs. So Delhi is facing a double whammy because of pollution and coronavirus cases," he said. "Patients who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and are exposed to increased pollution are prone to have more severe forms of the infection." With more residents on the streets ahead of India's main holiday, Diwali -- the festival of light -- on Saturday, doctors fear dark days ahead for the city of 20 million people. Kejriwal has banned Diwali firecrackers and launched legal action to get private hospitals to set aside more beds for Covid-19 patients. The city has deployed smog guns, which blast out clouds of water intended to bring pollution particles to the ground. But environmental activists such as Vimlendu Jha say the authorities are not serious about the problem, and have demanded suspensions on construction and even some power stations. Every winter, Delhi residents carefully scan pollution indexes, which measure tiny but deadly PM 2.5 particles, up to 2.5 microns in width. A Harvard University study released last month said an increase of just one micron per cubic metre of PM 2.5 causes an 11 percent jump in Covid-19 mortality. Other studies indicate the problem is particularly bad for poorer people -- such as slum dwellers -- who tend to live nearer pollution sources. With no respite in sight, Delhi doctors have little choice but to recommend face masks and air purifiers at home, though few in slums can afford such luxuries. Navjot Kaur, who had started riding her scooter to her job as a lab technician to avoid public transport and the risk of Covid-19, said taking to two wheels had left her exposed to the smog: "Now I get off and my eyes sting, I have to splash water on them." "The pollution has come quicker this year and seems worse," she said. Other Delhi inhabitants such as software engineer Naveen Malhotra, who suffers from a respiratory condition, want to leave the city altogether because "coronavirus attacks the lungs". He said: "I am just waiting for an opportunity to shift to a place where there is less pollution."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-fears-the-worst-amid-smog-cloud-and-coronavirus-wave-912865.html

The October 6 letter sent to the Chief Justice of India with allegations against Supreme Court and High Court judges, was made public in a press conference on October 10. On a plea made by petitioner, BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay for reconsideration of the decision on his request, Venugopal on Saturday said, "it would not be appropriate for me to grant consent and preclude the determination of the CJI in the matter". He also added, "Contempt is a matter between the court and the contemnor and no person as of right can insist upon initiation of contempt proceedings." Venugopal also pointed out the letter was not a private missive as nowhere was it marked confidential. "Hence, there was no reason to change my mind," he asserted. However, he opined that it was open for the Supreme Court to take up the contempt Suo Motu as provided under the Contempt of Courts Act and rules. The A-G also pointed out to Upadhyay that his refusal to grant consent did not preclude the advocate from bringing the relevant facts before the court for Suo Motu contempt proceedings. This can be done on the administrative side by placing the information before the court or bringing it into attention of the court, hearing Upadhyay's petition for speeding up trial against MPs and MLAs, he suggested. Under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, a consent from the Attorney General or Solicitor General was required for initiating criminal contempt proceedings against anyone.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/a-g-refuses-to-reconsider-denial-of-consent-for-contempt-case-against-ap-cm-912869.html

Democrat Joe Biden defeated incumbent Republican President Donald Trump in the closely-fought presidential election. Harris, 56, who is of Indian origin, has become the first-ever woman vice president-elect of the US. She will also be the first Indian-origin, first Black and first African American vice president of the country. Delhi-based Balachandran said he was feeling "proud and happy", describing Harris as a fighter. "Biden-Harris victory is what we wanted to see. And, given the numbers, I told Kamala yesterday (Friday) that she is going to win," he told PTI when asked if the counting process made him tense. Biden, the 77-year-old former vice president, will become the 46th president of the United States. "This election is about so much more than Joe Biden or me. It's about the soul of America and our willingness to fight for it. We have a lot of work ahead of us. Let's get started," Harris tweeted. She was born to two immigrant parents: a Black father and an Indian mother. Her father, Donald Harris, was from Jamaica, and her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, a cancer researcher and civil rights activist from Chennai. In an interview to PTI in August, Balachandran had said that Harris’s nomination as the vice presidential candidate was a "historic moment", but it was not a surprise at all for him. Harris’s maternal uncle had said that she would script many firsts if she won and expressed the hope her top-level position would give Indians in the US "greater access" in interacting with the US administration.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/had-told-kamala-harris-shes-going-to-win-says-proud-uncle-912897.html

On Sunday, three days after flames tore through ‘kotha number 58’ in central Delhi’s G B Road that housed about 45 sex workers, the women gazed blankly at the detritus of their lives, wondering how they will manage. Covid-19 had pushed them deeper into the fringes of mainstream society, snatching their livelihood and the fire has robbed them of their homes and the little savings they had. "Everything is shattered,” said Maya*, stunned by what had happened. On Thursday evening, as the block went up in flames, the women and their families managed to escape with just the clothes on their backs and have been given temporary shelter in a municipal school nearby. There were no casualties. "I have been living here alone for the last 10 years. My children stay with their ‘nani’ in Jaunpur and I was to visit them to fix my daughter's wedding in January. I had bought her wedding dress, some jewellery and new clothes for all my children for Diwali. It’s all gone,” Maya* told PTI. "I have also lost my Aadhar card. It was the only identity proof I had," she added. The thought of tomorrow haunts the women, many who have been staying for decades at the brothels above street level shops in the one-kilometre stretch, once known as Garstin Bastion Road, or more famously G B Road, and now renamed Swami Shradhanand Marg. It is one of India’s largest red light areas and home to 1,500 women packed into about 100 brothels. For now, police officials have arranged their stay in the school and they are surviving on whatever help they have been receiving from police, some NGOs and generous citizens. Their brothel block is gutted, the beams twisted by the searing heat of the fire, the walls singed and their belongings, painstaking gathered over the year, lying in scattered heaps, some reduced to ashes and dust and others damaged beyond repair. The woman, some with children and parents, can’t stay for long in the school either. It is almost impossible to maintain social distancing in the dirty and congested area in which they have been accommodated. They don’t have water to bathe or even wash hands. Sanitation is a problem. Toddlers can be seen with empty milk bottles as their mothers wait for someone to come forward to help them. "Some of my belongings were burnt in the fire and some stolen. I have just this one nighty which I am wearing. We have not taken a bath for the last three days. Nights are getting cold and we don't have any woollen clothes or blankets," said Shaila*. She had saved money to send her teen daughters living with her parents in Andhra Pradesh but now has nothing. Shaila*, like many of the other women, doesn’t have a bank account and would keep her money tucked away in boxes, piggy banks or in a trunk. It is all gone. "We are not educated enough to operate bank accounts and not everyone has proof of identity. The fire literally burnt our money. Our life was already miserable and this fire has finished us,” she said. Their stories are many, the distress the same. Sunila*, who has been living in Delhi for three decades, was recently served a notice from the ‘kotha’ owner and asked to pay a hefty amount as rent for the last seven months . She borrowed money and even arranged for lawyers’ fees to fight a case but lost it all in the fire. "How would I pay rent when I had no income for the last eight-nine months. I was supposed to give the lawyer money on Friday. But the fire claimed it a day before,” she said. She also blamed the brothel owner for not repairing the building. “Who will help us and where do we go? People talk about closure of the brothels but do they understand our problems?" she asked. Echoing her, Sahiba* said they have been exploited and have nowhere else to go. "Who will give us jobs? What about our kids and parents? Our past will follow us everywhere. People come here, make videos and take our photographs but do not come back. What if our kids see those pictures or videos? Nobody has time to think about this," she said. "Many NGOs come with false promises of providing another job but leave us on the road. We have to raise our kids, educate them so that stay away from this. We have been living here for so long that we don't want to go anywhere else. All we want is that our house should immediately get renovated," she said. Is anybody listening?

08-11-2020||National||CIC allows govt to withhold info on deliberations leading to resignation of Anil Goswami||The Central Information Commission has allowed the Cabinet Secretariat to withhold records of deliberations and file notes leading to the resignation of former Union Home Secretary Anil Goswami, who was asked to put down his papers following allegations of his attempts to stall the arrest of a former minister by the CBI. The panel has based its judgement on a Delhi High Court order in a separate case in which it had held that file notings and deliberations of the Group of Officers or the Disciplinary Authority cannot be disclosed. The court had, however, allowed information on action taken in relation to complaints against an officer to be provided to an applicant. Chief Information Commissioner Y K Sinha buttressed his argument to withhold the information citing a Supreme Court verdict, which had held "..professional records, including qualification, performance, evaluation reports, ACRs, disciplinary proceedings, etc. are all personal information... Such personal information is entitled to protection from unwarranted invasion of privacy and conditional access is available when stipulation of larger public interest is satisfied." Goswami was forced to resign in February 2015 for allegedly trying to stall the arrest of a former Union minister in a case by the CBI. RTI applicant and IPS officer Anurag Thakur had sought to know from the Cabinet Secretariat the details of action taken on a complaint against Goswami, including communication exchanged between various authorities and file notings. Not getting a satisfactory response, Thakur appealed before the CIC. During the hearing, he argued that he wanted the information, including file notings, in public interest "to know the sequence of events which led to the forced resignation of Anil Goswami". "The subject matter which forms the basis of the instant case is disclosure of note sheets and other correspondence exchanged by various offices in the process of considering the complaint filed against Sri Goswami," Sinha noted. He said the contentions put forth by Thakur did not establish the larger public interest which would be served by the disclosure of the noting sheet or the file. "Under the circumstances, the response as provided by the Respondent is found to be justified and does not suffer from any infirmity. As such, there is no requirement to interfere with the same," he ruled.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cic-allows-govt-to-withhold-info-on-deliberations-leading-to-resignation-of-anil-goswami-912926.html

The ‘Draft SOP for Safeguarding Persons to be Arrested/Detained by the Police Authorities Against Custodial Violence’ prepared by the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) emphasised that "arresting as a regular act or arresting for the sake of routine issues" must be avoided. The draft prepared under the instruction of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) also advises not to summon any male below 15 years or above 65 years or a woman for questioning to police station and they should be interrogated at their residence. "Do not subject any person in custody to torture, beating or cruel treatment. Ensure not to detain anyone for a prolonged period in the name of interrogation as this may amount to wrongful confinement and illegal detention," it said.  While asking police to ensure that the names of arrested are displayed on notice boards and they are given food and water, the SOP also suggested that those in custody must be provided facility to have a bath and change of clothes – undergarments in particular, on an everyday basis. "This is important for the hygiene of the arrestee as well as the police officers interrogating and dealing with the arrestee," it said. The SOP aims to lay down professional guidelines for police officers to deal with accused persons or détenu in custody and enable the forces to frame mechanisms to stop custodial violence and fix responsibility of the erring personnel, as well as to review the existing mechanism, if one such exists. "Wide coverage of the incidents of custodial violence by the media, including the social media causes a serious loss of face to the police. The image of the police takes a severe beating, as immense good work done by the police is overshadowed by such abhorrent incidents of custodial violence," it said. While advising that arrests should be made only in exceptional circumstances, it said a notice of appearance should be sent to a person against whom a reasonable complaint, credible information or reasonable suspicion exists to appear before police. Only when such a person refuses to appear, then arrests should be made. A police personnel also has to record in writing whether at least one of the eight conditions mentioned in the draft is satisfied while arresting a person. It included that the arrest is necessary to prevent committing further offences or ensure proper investigation or to ensure cooperation from fear stricken victims who will otherwise be reluctant to come forward due to fear of the accused. The draft also suggests that the police personnel involved in arresting any person must wear visible name tags and their names should also be recorded in the police diary. "One person of the arrestee’s choice must be informed about the arrest. Date, place and time of detention must also be conveyed as soon as practicable unless the witness to the memo of arrest was the person of his choice and was present at the venue of arrest," it said. "Police personnel affecting the arrest must do it with minimum use of force and publicity. A person must be informed why and by whose authority, his arrest is being executed. Arrestee should be requested to cooperate," it said. While arresting a woman, the SOP said, if a woman police official is not available, then the woman to be arrested should be allowed to have one person who should be a woman with her as a companion and should be allowed to remain with the arrested woman throughout the process. On the detention and interrogation of children, the SOP wanted police to take special care not to use "accusatory or adversarial language". Such children should be dealt with empathy and great care and they should not be treated at par with adult offenders. In custody, the SOP reminded that an arrested person has a right to consult and have a legal practitioner to defend himself and a lawyer could also be consulted while interrogation is going on but not throughout the duration of the entire interrogation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bprd-issues-sop-for-police-force-emphasises-avoiding-arrests-for-the-sake-of-routine-issues-912938.html

Overworked drivers can cause accidents, Modi said during an interaction with people via video conferencing before inaugurating the Ro-Pax ferry service between Hazira in Surat and Ghogha in Bhavnagar. Asif Solanki, involved in transport business and based in Bhavnagar, told Modi during the interaction that he will be greatly benefitted by the new ferry service as it will reduce the travel time and distance and his drivers will also get rest when the ferry transports trucks by sea route. Modi asked him about how many drivers he has employed, to which Solanki replied that he has eight drivers. The PM further asked him how many trucks he has, to which the transporter said six. "This is not fair, you should employ 12 drivers for six trucks. You take so much work from drivers, this should not be done," Modi said. Solanki said due to the ferry service he would not require more drivers, to which Modi replied that the ferry service is starting from today. "The thing is when drivers are overworked, they fall asleep while driving which can cause accidents and whatever you have earned will go away with that accident," Modi said and took a promise from Solanki that he will employ more drivers. On a lighter note, Modi also said the Income Tax department will not raid Solanki if he reveals his plan to purchase more trucks. The comment came after the transporter smiled when the PM asked him if he is planning to buy more trucks. During the video conference, Modi interacted with people from Surat and Bhavnagar on how their life will be impacted by the introduction of the new Ro-Pax ferry service. The service will reduce the 375-km road distance between Bhavnagar and Surat to 90-km by sea route and the travel time from 10-12 hours to about four hours, a release issued by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) earlier said. It will save time and fuel and boost economy and religious tourism in the Saurashtra region of the state, the release said. The three-deck Ro-Pax Ferry Vessel 'Voyage Symphony' connecting Hazira in Surat district of south Gujarat and Ghogha in Saurashtra's Bhavnagar has a load capacity of 30 trucks, 100 passenger cars, and 500 passengers plus 34 crew and hospitality staff, it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-narendra-modi-rebukes-gujarat-based-transporter-for-employing-less-drivers-912944.html

08-11-2020||National||Shipping ministry to be renamed: PM Narendra Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said the Ministry of Shipping is being expanded and renamed as the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways. He was addressing a gathering after inaugurating a Ro-Pax ferry service between Hazira in Surat and Ghogha in Bhavnagar district of Gujarat, which will reduce the 370-km road distance between the two places to 90-km by sea route. The service will also cut the travel time between the two places to about four hours from 10 to 12 hours. Modi said work is being done so that the country's sea area emerges as an important part of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' (self-reliant India). "To boost the government's effort, one more big step is being taken. Now, the Ministry of Shipping is being renamed as the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways," he said. "It (the ministry) is being expanded. In developed economies, in most places, the shipping ministry also takes care of ports and waterways. In India, the shipping ministry does a lot of work related to ports and waterways. Clarity in name will also bring about clarity in work," he further said. He also said the new Ro-Pax ferry service launched on Sunday will reduce the distance between Bhavnagar to Surat, which is around 375-km by road, to 90-km by sea route. This will also reduce the travel time from 10-12 hours to three to four hours, he said. "The service will help people save both time and cost and also reduce traffic congestion on roads and reduce pollution," Modi said. The three-deck Ro-Pax Ferry Vessel Voyage Symphony connecting Hazira in Surat district in south Gujarat and Ghogha in Saurashtras Bhavnagar has a load capacity of 30 trucks, 100 passenger cars, and 500 passengers plus 34 crew and hospitality staff, as per a statement earlier released by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). The ferry will make three trips daily, annually transporting five lakh passengers, 80,000 passenger vehicles, 50,000 two-wheelers and 30,000 trucks, as per the release. Modi said to strengthen the 'blue economy', it is important to strengthen logistics related to the sea. Compared to other countries, the cost of carrying goods from one part to another is high in India even today. Through water transport, this (cost) can be reduced drastically, he said. "Therefore, our focus is to create such an ecosystem where seamless movement of cargo is ensured. Today, for better maritime logistics along with better infrastructure, we are working on a single-window system," he said. "To reduce the cost of logistics, the country is moving ahead with a holistic and long-term view of multi-modal connectivity. The effort is to improve connectivity between road, rail, air and shipping infrastructure by removing silos between them," the PM said. He said multi-modal parks are being constructed not just in India, but also neighbouring countries. "With all these efforts, we shall be able to reduce the cost of logistics. These efforts will also give a new direction to the economy," he said. Modi said the country always had resources and expertise in waterways, but the past governments lacked the vision to use them, despite the fact that transportation through waterways is much cheaper compared to road and rail, and causes minimum adverse affect on the environment. "Despite this, it was only after 2014 that work was done with a holistic approach in this direction. These rivers and seas existed even before Modi became the prime minister. What was lacking was the vision that the country has experienced after 2014," he said. Modi said to boost the 'blue economy' and fishing business, his government also focused on fishermen and has come up with the 'Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana' with an outlay of Rs 30,000 crore to help improve the fishing infrastructure. "Today, the port capacity of coastal areas across the country is being increased and new ports are being constructed. Efforts are being made to ensure that the 21,000 -km 'jal marg' (waterways) are used for the country's development," he said. For this, work is underway on more than 500 projects under 'Sagarmala'. Many of these projects worth lakhs of crores are ready, he said. Modi said Gujarat accounted for over 40 per cent share of the country's entire trade through sea route last year. Work is on at fast pace to create infrastructure and capacity building for sea routes, like maritime clusters and maritime university, as well as the world's first CNG Terminal in Bhavnagar, he said. TheGujarat Maritime Cluster coming up in the GIFT (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City) City at Gandhinagar will be a dedicated system to address logistics of ports and seaways, he said. "This will help in value addition of this sector," the prime minister said. India's first chemical and LNG Terminal was constructed at Dahej in Gujarat, he said, adding that a 'Ro-Ro (roll on roll off) terminal, a liquid cargo terminal and a container terminal are being set up in Bhavnagar. "The new terminals will increase Bhavnagar's port capacity by many times," he said. The prime minister further said the government is trying to restart the ferry service between Ghogha and Dahej that was launched in 2017, but stopped due to natural reasons. "Many challenges related to nature came up before this project. With the help of modern technology, they are being removed, and I hope people of Ghogha and Dahej will soon be able to take the benefit of this facility," he said. Modi also interacted with a few people like farmers, pilgrims and businessmen, who expressed their happiness over the new ferry service. Union Minister of State for Shipping Mansukh Mandaviya and Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani were present on the occasion.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/shipping-ministry-to-be-renamed-pm-narendra-modi-912952.html

CAIT in a statement demanded that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and chief ministers of other states should "compensate the firecracker traders for the losses they have accrued due to ban on sale of firecrackers". The traders' body also termed the order of Delhi Pollution Control Committee dated November 6, 2020 which states that there will be a "complete ban" on bursting and sale of all kinds of fire crackers from November 7-30, 2020 in the territory of NCT of Delhi, as "null and void and a blatant violation of order of Supreme Court of India". In 2018, the Supreme Court had banned the use of polluting firecrackers and allowed the sale of "green firecrackers" in a bid to control air pollution. The "green crackers" are not as polluting as the conventional firecrackers and they contain at least 30 per cent less particulate matter such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. Ahead of Diwali, the Delhi government has decided to ban firecrackers in the national capital and ramp up medical infrastructure in hospitals, Kejriwal said after a review of the Covid-19 situation recently. The Calcutta High Court has banned the use of firecrackers in West Bengal on Diwali, Kali Puja and Chhat Puja. State governments of Odisha and Sikkim have also banned the sale and use of firecrackers during the upcoming festival season to check air pollution.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/firecracker-ban-cait-demands-compensation-for-traders-losses-912959.html

As a largely immigrant community, but in some cases with American roots reaching back generations, Indian-Americans know firsthand the strength and resilience that immigrants bring to the United States of America, according to a policy document issued by the Biden campaign.   Four security forces personnel, including an Army officer, and three militants were killed during a failed infiltration bid by the ultras along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir's Machil sector on Sunday, officials said. The militants made an abortive bid during the night to infiltrate into the Indian side of the LoC in Machil sector in north Kashmir's Kupwara district, they added.   Over 1,100 candidates with criminal antecedents contested the Bihar assembly polls, according to data collated by the Election Commission. A total of 3,733 candidates were in the fray in the three-phase elections, including 371 women, as per data given out by the Commission on Saturday after the last phase of polling concluded. A total of 1,157 candidates have criminal antecedents, according to the poll watchdog.   Former Karnataka-cadre IAS officer S Sasikanth Senthil, who resigned from civil services last year citing his inability to continue when “fundamental building blocks of diverse democracy are being compromised," will join the Congress in Tamil Nadu on Monday “Yes.

The 41-year-old former bureaucrat will join the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) on Monday, sources said. They said AICC in-charge for Tamil Nadu and Karnataka Congress leader Dinesh Gundu Rao was instrumental in bringing Senthil to the party fold.   Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday slammed the government over demonetisation, alleging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's move four years ago was aimed at helping a few of his "crony capitalist friends" and had "destroyed" the Indian economy. Rahul and the Congress have been alleging that the 2016 demonetisation was not in the interest of the people and had adverse effects on the economy, a charge the government has dismissed repeatedly.   Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said the Ministry of Shipping is being expanded and renamed as the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways. He was addressing a gathering after inaugurating a Ro-Pax ferry service between Hazira in Surat and Ghogha in Bhavnagar district of Gujarat, which will reduce the 370-km road distance between the two places to 90-km by sea route.

His comments came on the day the Congress is observing the fourth anniversary of the note ban as a “Vikshwasghaat Diwas” (betrayal day). Describing demonetisation as a dangerous step, Gehlot said it along with the GST and the coronavirus pandemic adversely hit the country’s economy. In spite of all arguments, the Centre should inform the country whether money from Swiss banks was brought back or black money, terrorism and naxalism were eliminated in the past four years after demonetisation, Gehlot said at a virtual press conference here. “The prime minister should issue a white paper to inform people about the impact of demonetisation, GST and the coronavirus pandemic. People of the country are worried where the economy is headed to," he said. Gehlot said due to the note ban four years ago, farmers, labourers and small traders were destroyed while the rural economy completely collapsed. He said the states are not getting their GST dues, which is a betrayal by the Centre and unjustified in a federal system. It is dangerous the way demonetisation, GST and anti-farmer bills were implemented without a discussion with stakeholders, he said. “It is a thought process of fascists. That's why we say repeatedly that democracy is in danger," Gehlot said. He said the Rs 20 lakh-crore package announced by the Centre during the coronavirus pandemic did not prove any useful. On the ongoing Gurjar agitation over reservation, Gehlot said most demands of the community have already been fulfilled. The government has talked to Gurjar leader Kirori Singh Bainsla but the way people are squatting on rail tracks is not in favour of the community. Gehlot said the government will do justice to all demands as the Congress has worked to give five per cent reservation to the Most Backward Classes. Gurjar leaders should talk to the committee set up by state government and it is ready to hear their issues and demands, the chief minister added. Gehlot also slammed the Centre over unemployment, saying there is resentment over it among the youth, which was visible in the just concluded Bihar assembly elections.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-should-issue-white-paper-about-impact-of-note-ban-gst-on-economy-ashok-gehlot-913027.html

Even as farmers’ protests continued in Punjab and elsewhere, the Modi government is showcasing the case of Jitendra Bhoi, a farmer from Bhatne village in Maharashtra’s Dhule district as a success story of the dispute redressal mechanism available to farmers under the freshly minted farm sector reforms. Earlier, there was no legal framework available to farmers if he sold his crop to traders outside the APMC market limits, a senior Agriculture Ministry official said adding that the new laws empowered the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to ensure payment to farmers within a fixed time limit. The new laws also empower the SDM to attach the properties of the trader to ensure that the farmer is paid the amounts due to him in a timely manner. Bhoi had sold 270.95 quintals of the maize crop to traders Subhash and Arun Vani of Khetia village in Madhya Pradesh’s Barwani district for Rs 3.32 lakh. The traders, who were not license holders under the APMC Act, had reneged on the payment, prompting Bhoi to seek redressal under the provisions of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance. “The farmer from Maharashtra had written to the Sub Divisional Magistrate of Pansemal Sub-Division of Barwani district,,” a senior Agriculture Ministry official said. After hearing the versions of the farmer and the trader, the Sub-Divisional Magistrate issued orders to the traders to make the payment for the farm produce within seven days. The government’s pitch for highlighting the finer points of the farm sector reforms come at a time when farmers’ agitation has not shown any signs of abatement. Farmers’ organisations from across the country are planning a massive rally against the farm sector reforms in the national capital on November 26-27.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/maharashtra-farmer-invokes-new-farm-law-to-settle-pay-dispute-with-madhya-pradesh-trader-913071.html

These claims will be submitted online along with scanned copies of required documents, it added. The ESIC in its meeting held on August 20, 2020, had extended the scheme 'Atal Beemit Vyakti Kalyan Yojana' from July 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021. It was also decided to enhance the rate of relief under the scheme from present 25 per cent of the average daily earning to 50 per cent of average daily earning and also relax the eligibility conditions for the period March 24, 2020, to December 31, 2020, to provide relief to the workers who have become unemployed during Covid-19 pandemic. While analysing the response of the beneficiaries to the scheme under relaxed conditions, it was found that the condition of submitting the claim in affidavit form is causing inconvenience to the claimants, the ministry said. Considering the difficulties faced by the beneficiaries, it has now been decided that the claimant who has submitted the claim under 'Atal Beemit Vyakti Kalyan Yojana' online and uploaded the scanned copies of the required documents i.e. copies of Aadhar and bank details need not submit the physical claim, it added.  If the documents are not uploaded at the time of online filing of the claim, the claimant will submit the printout of the claim duly signed along with the required documents, it informed.  Condition for submitting the claim in affidavit form has been dispensed with, it added.  The ESIC is a pioneer social security organisation providing comprehensive social security benefits like reasonable medical care and a range of cash benefits in times of need such as employment injury, sickness, death etc.  It is covering about 3.49 crore of family units of workers and providing matchless cash benefits and reasonable medical care to its 13.56 crore beneficiaries.  Today, its infrastructure has increased many folds with 1,520 dispensaries (including mobile dispensaries)/307 ISM units and 159 ESI hospitals, 793 branch/pay offices and 64 regional and sub-regional offices.

Needless to say, the Twitterati jumped in with mixed responses: Pehle "Neta Bose", now "Kamal" Harris. Achha hai Kamal Hassan nahin bola.

Waah I See U Becoming India's Prime Minister ❤️ Why you have to degrade someone EVERYTIME?   Biden, who turns 78 on November 20, is the oldest person ever elected to the White House.

The proposal for the Kanjur Marg site was deliberately rejected. It has now been proved that Fadnavis government lied on saying a person will have to be paid Rs 5,000 crore for the Kanjur Marg land,” Maharashtra Congress spokesperson and general secretary Sachin Sawant said. “Despite knowing that the Metro project in Aarey Milk Colony required only 20 hectares of land, 62 hectares of land was earmarked for it so that the remaining 41 hectares of land could be commercially exploited,” he said. Sawant said that the technical committee set up by the Fadnavis government had said that if the state government did not allot land at Kanjur Marg for the Metro car-shed, then in order to save trees from being hacked, the project had to be implemented on 20.82 hectares instead of 30 hectares. “The Fadnavis government kept the land in Kanjur marg under wraps and told the public that the project would be implemented on 25 hectares of land in Aarey, but when the state government filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court in 2019, the affidavit was accompanied by a plan for the Aarey project site in which the area for the project was shown as 61.6 hectares. Fadnavis should answer as to why this additional 40 hectares of land was required,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/devendra-fadnavis-govt-wanted-to-commercially-use-aarey-land-congress-912763.html

His success formula has been fairly straightforward: Hardcore 'Hindutva' ideology combined with a knack for courting controversies. Since he took charge of the politically crucial state of UP, Adityanath has been hitting headlines with statements like, “Ali vs Bajarang Bali”, “Thonk Do” and "throw out Bangladeshi infiltrators". His recent pronouncement warning that those indulging in 'love jihad' should be ready for their “Ram Naam Satya” journey has raised the hackles of his political detractors and rights activists. Adityanath has always had a way of triggering political mini-storms. The 48-year-old, who is also the mahant (chief priest) of the famous Gorakhnath Peeth in Gorakhpur, has been known for making communally-charged remarks.  Back in 2007, he was arrested for delivering a provocative speech in his hometown, resulting in communal violence which killed at least ten people. The UP government, however, withdrew the 'hate speech' case soon after Adityanath became the CM on the grounds that the CD containing the speech was tampered with. Adityanath has only become stronger within the BJP with each passing episode that paints him, and more lately, his government, in a negative light. He also faces opposition from within his own party. Several BJP MLAs have cornered him over the poor state of law and order in UP, corruption and other issues. He was accused of being 'anti-Brahmin' by a senior lawmaker from his party. After the recent brutal murder and alleged gang rape of a Dalit teen in Hathras district, there was speculation that Adityanath might be replaced. However, even his detractors in the BJP knew that the party High Command would find it hard to replace him. "After Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he (Adityanath) remains our biggest hope in UP in the next Assembly polls in 2022," a senior BJP leader said. "In Yogi Adityanath, the supporters of Hindutva have found a politician clad in saffron robes who does not care for niceties... he speaks his mind without fear and without bothering about the consequences," political analyst J P Shukla said. He added that although Adityanath might have been a surprise choice for the post of CM, he has entrenched himself firmly in the position now.  His recent remarks at a Bihar election rally that ‘infiltrators would be thrown out’ was decried by BJP ally and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. But the jibe, with anti-Muslim overtones, has not brought him any kind of opprobrium from his party. Similarly, the ‘love jihad’ statement was followed up by other BJP-ruled states—Haryana, MP and Karnataka—announcing that they too, like UP, would contemplate a law against the so-called ‘practice’.  However, the fact remains that Adityanath is seen as too much of a Hindu hardliner. A political watcher who did not want to be named said that Adityanath was the "biggest polarising" figure in national politics. Also, there may be limits to how much the BJP can gain by deploying the Yogi’s firepower. For example, in the Assembly polls in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi and Jharkhand conducted in 2018-19, Adityanath addressed dozens of rallies but failed to ensure a win for his party. That said, few, however, doubt that he will remain a star campaigner for the BJP in the forthcoming Assembly polls in West Bengal, where the BJP has pinned its hopes on the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens to reap electoral dividends.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/yogi-adityanath-tryst-with-controversy-continues-912807.html

Gandhi and the Congress have been alleging that the 2016 demonetisation was not in the interest of the people and had adverse effects on the economy, a charge the government has dismissed repeatedly. In a video released as part of the party's online 'SpeakUpAgainstDeMoDisaster' campaign, Gandhi said the question is how the economy of Bangladesh "surpassed" the Indian economy as there was a time when India used to be one of the most high performing economies of the world. "The government says that the reason is Covid but if that is the reason, there is Covid in Bangladesh and elsewhere in the world also. The reason is not Covid, the reason is 'Notebandi' and GST," Gandhi said in Hindi. "Four years ago Prime Minister Narendra Modi began an assault on the Indian economy. He hurt farmers, labourers and small shopkeepers. Manmohan Singh ji said the economy will lose two per cent and that is what we saw," the former Congress chief said. The prime minister had stated that it is a fight against black money, but it was not so, Gandhi said. "This was a lie. The attack was on you, Modi wanted to take your money and give it to his 2-3 crony capitalist friends. You stood in lines, not his crony capitalist friends. You put your money in banks and PM Modi gave that money to his friends and gave them a loan waiver of Rs 3,50,000 crore," Gandhi alleged. नोटबंदी PM की सोची समझी चाल थी ताकि आम जनता के पैसे से ‘मोदी-मित्र’ पूँजीपतियों का लाखों करोड़ रुपय क़र्ज़ माफ़ किया जा सके। ग़लतफ़हमी में मत रहिए- ग़लती हुई नहीं, जानबूझकर की गयी थी।   Then Modi implemented a "faulty GST" and small, middle-sized businesses were destroyed as "he cleared the way for his 3-4 crony capitalist friends", the Congress leader claimed. Gandhi alleged that now farmers were being targeted with the three new agricultural laws which, he said, would "finish off" them. Modi has "destroyed" the pride of India -- its economy, Gandhi said, and added, "We have to jointly rebuild india". The Congress is observing the fourth anniversary of demonetisation as "Vikshwasghaat Diwas" (Betrayal Day). On November 8, 2016, Prime Minister Modi announced the decision to ban all currency notes of higher denomination of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 from midnight.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/demonetisation-destroyed-economy-helped-a-few-crony-capitalists-alleges-rahul-912924.html

"I tell Mamata di's people, who do mischief, to correct themselves within 6 months or else their hands, legs, ribs & heads will be broken - you'll have to go to hospital before being able to go home. If they increase mischief, they'll be sent to crematorium," Ghosh was reported as having said by ANI.   Ghosh is known for making controversial statements, and this latest one is likely to garner strong reactions from Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee. Meanwhile, Ghosh on Sunday asserted that the saffron party does not discriminate on religious lines and assured Muslims that they also enjoy the same rights that he does under the Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre. And it is "only the BJP" that believes in this ideology", Ghosh said at a rally at the port city of Haldia in Purba Medinipur district.

And it is "only the BJP" that believes in this ideology", Ghosh said at a rally at the port city of Haldia in Purba Medinipur district. This assumes significance with the 2021 state assembly polls due in April-May. "We do not follow different policies depending upon a person's status, political affiliation or anything else when it comes to distribution of benefits of schemes. "Muslims of Bengal have benefitted from the various schemes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. There has been no differentiation as done by the TMC government. "You (Muslims) are respected citizens having same rights like Dilip Ghosh, and only the BJP believes in this ideology," he said. Ghosh was speaking at the citadel of state Transport minister Suvendu Adhikary who of late has been maintaining a distance with the leaders of the ruling Trinamool Congress and has given several important party meetings a miss. In the past, Ghosh had been quite vocal about the minority community, particularly while speaking about alleged Muslim infiltrators from Bangladesh. He alleged that all political parties who ruled West Bengal be it the CPI(M)-led Left Front, Congress and the TMC, had used Muslims only as "vote bank by keeping them illiterate, jobless and poor". Mentioning that the Mamata Banerjee government in the state had differentiated among people, Ghosh said, "earlier, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government had announced Rs 2,000 as stipend for Imams. And only after realising that Hindus were annoyed, she announced Rs 1,000 for priests. Why this difference?" Moreover, "Only 8,000 priests will receive stipend when there are 80,000 such eligible persons. And unless you are a party follower the stipend is not for you," the BJP leader alleged, asking the priests to decline to accept the stipend as it is "ill-gotten". Ghosh was confident that the saffron party would win over 200 out of the total 294 seats in the 2021 state assembly elections. During his recent visit to the state, Union Home Minister and top BJP leader Amit Shah on Thursday had set a target of winning 200 seats. Shah had asked BJP functionaries to take a vow to work hard to achieve the target. "The party is keeping tabs on police officers who are harassing BJP workers and threatening leaders of other political parties, who wish to switch camps, with false cases," Ghosh said. Holding the West Bengal government responsible for the spiralling potato price in the state, the BJP state president said, the ruling dispensation in the state owes an explanation to people on this issue. Despite having a bumper production of potato this year as well, the market price of potato has ballooned in recent times. Ghosh also claimed that if elected to power, the BJP will withdraw all "false cases" against political activists, including TMC workers, alleging that the "vindictive attitude" of Mamata Banerjee government has resulted in filing of 28,000 such cases against adversaries of the TMC. Describing Ghosh's comments as "baseless and frivolous", TMC Rajya Sabha MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said, "the state is regularly conducting raids in markets to ensure that sellers do not hike potato prices while the tuber is being sold at lower prices from state outlets." The senior TMC leader said, the Centre's recent decision to remove regulatory control on essential commodities has emboldened a section of traders to hoard potato and sell the product at a premium. Senior TMC leader and Lok Sabha MP Sougata Roy said, Ghosh's "dream of coming to power will never be realised. He is prone to make baseless comments."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-does-not-discriminate-on-religious-lines-partys-west-bengal-unit-chief-dilip-ghosh-913076.html
08-11-2020||National Politics||Congress, BJP face-off on fourth anniversary of demonestisation||Congress on Sunday went all out to launch a fresh offensive against Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the fourth anniversary of demonetisation, accusing him of destroying the Indian economy. Even as Congress leaders posted videos on social media slamming demonetisation, Modi hailed it as a success, saying the surprise move had helped reduce black money, increase tax compliance and gave a boost to transparency. “These outcomes have been greatly beneficial towards nation’s progress,” the Prime Minister said. Former Congress President Rahul Gandhi led the party’s social media campaign against demonetisation, claiming that noteban was a “well thought out” plan to snatch money from the common man and hand it over to Modi’s “crony capitalist friends”. Senior Congress leaders such as P Chidambaram, Mallikarjun Kharge, Shashi Tharoor and Salman Khurshid and ordinary party workers joined the online campaign by posting videos and messages slamming Modi over demonetisation. Union Ministers Nirmala Sitharaman, Piyush Goyal among others countered the Congress, listing out the achievements of demonetisation, pitching it as a move to weed out corruption. Congress leaders addressed press conferences across the country to criticise the Prime Minister for noteban and constantly changing the reasons that triggered the move. “The first lesson every ruler and every government must learn is that – even if you do not do good to the people, do not do any harm. The BJP-led NDA government did great harm to India's economy on November 8th, 2016,” former Finance Minister P Chidambaram said in a video message. “Don’t be under any illusion, this was not a mistake but done on purpose,” Rahul Gandhi said adding that demonetisation was a planned attack on the Indian economy which has now fallen behind that of Bangladesh. “The government cites Covid as the reason for slowing down of the economy. But, Bangladesh also faced, Covid as did the entire world. How only India got left behind?,” the former Congress President asked. "The reason is noteban and faulty implementation of the GST,” Gandhi said. “Modi ji's government continuously changed the explanations for carrying out demonetisation,” AICC General Secretary Ajay Maken told reporters here.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-bjp-face-off-on-fourth-anniversary-of-demonestisation-913082.html
08-11-2020||North and Central||Kamal Nath, Congress trying to lure BJP MLAs: MP CM||Ahead of the November 10 results of the bypolls held recently on 28 Assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh, the ruling BJP and opposition Congress have accused each other of horse trading MLAs and claimed respective victories. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday alleged that MLAs of the BJP were receiving calls from state Congerss chief Kamal Nath who is trying to lure them. "The Congress and Kamal Nath are attempting unsuccessfully to contact and lure BJP MLAs. Nath is making calls to them. It was Nath who played the politics of horse trading and effected manipulations. Nath has muddied politics of Madhya Pradesh," Chouhan told reporters. He was responding to a query on allegations raised by Nath on Friday that the BJP was again trying to lure away some legislators of the Congress. By-elections were held on November 3 for the 28 constituencies, 25 of which fell vacant due to resignations by Congress MLAs who joined the BJP earlier this year while the rest three seats have been unrepresented due to demise of the sitting legislators. "...Whenever Congress resorts to this (horse-trading), it's termed as management but when someone comes to us (join the BJP) on his own, then it is called a horse-trading," Chouhan said. Holding Nath responsible for "political corruption", the senior BJP leader said MLAs of the BJP would not fall prey to the attempts being made by the Congress to lure them. "Our MLAs work for principles and ideology," he said. Chouhan further said Congress and Nath were rattled as they have sensed imminent defeat in the bypolls. On Friday, Nath issued a statement accusing the BJP of luring its MLAs with "offers". "The BJP is sensing a crushing defeat in the byelections. They are now resorting to horse trading (of MLAs). I have spoken with several MLAs of the Congress who informed me about the offers and allurements they were receiving from the BJP," stated the former chief minister, who lost power in March this year after 22 MLAs of the Congress joined the BJP under former MP Jyotiraditya Scindia. In the 230-member Madhya Pradesh Assembly, the BJP currently has 107 members and required nine more MLAs to attain a simple majority, while the Congress' tally stands at 87. Among other members, the BSP has two legislators, while the SP has one member besides four Independents.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/kamal-nath-congress-trying-to-lure-bjp-mlas-mp-cm-912749.html
08-11-2020||North and Central||Fall in Covid-19 cases halts in many big states in India; clear rise visible in Delhi and Haryana||After a steady fall of nearly eight weeks, India’s Covid-19 epidemic has slowed down in many states, whereas a clear spike is visible in at least two states – Delhi and Haryana – with several other states reporting an increase in the number of new cases. Even for the country as a whole, there is no further dip in the epidemic with the lowest point reached on October 30, according to the records maintained by the National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai. The halt in the decline is visible in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab and Bihar where the epidemic curve is plateauing. But such a plateauing is yet to be seen in Karnataka. In contrast there is a rising trend in Telangana, Ladakh and Chandigarh. But the spike is the most prominent in Haryana and Delhi, which is witnessing the second and third wave of the pandemic respectively. In the last 24 hours, Delhi with 7,178 deaths topped the country with maximum number of new positive cases overtaking Kerala and Maharashtra. “The observed fall is an initial sign of shift in the transmission areas from fewer densely populated metropolitan cities to areas with relatively lower population density and variable testing strategy. With free population movement, variable mask/distancing compliance and festivities, the rate of decline can’t be steeper any more, given that there are areas which are yet to see a surge in cases,” said Giridhar Babu, an epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India, Bengaluru. The national capital also moved to the second spot in the list of states with the maximum number of deaths in the last 24 hours. "After getting a good control on the transmission, many states are now seeing a large number of new cases, rising at an alarming rate. The virus moves when people move and gather in crowds. Many people on the streets believe that Covid-19 is something that happens to others,” Oommen John, a public health specialist at the George Institute for Global Health, Delhi told DH. "The health systems are fatigued and the health workforce exhausted, so it is important to exercise caution. The death rates will shoot up when the health system's capacity is stretched," Jon added. More than 50,000 new Covid-19 cases were registered again on Saturday, making it the second case of 50,000 daily cases in the last three days in the country. The hike is due to the surges being seen in Delhi and Kerala in the wake of the festivities coupled with a halt in the decline. “Why have the restraints about how many persons can be inside public transport or shops been lifted - was this informed by evidence?” wondered John. India’s Covid-19 tally stands at 84.62 lakh on Saturday, of which 50,356 were added in the last 24 hours. The death toll is 1,25,562, out of which 577 happened in the same period. The toll was on the high on Friday (670) and Thursday (704) too.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/fall-in-covid-19-cases-halts-in-many-big-states-in-india-clear-rise-visible-in-delhi-and-haryana-912769.html

He said the government had no plans yet to rope in hotels and banquet halls to augment the bed capacity for COVID-19 patients as the AAP dispensation had increased the number of beds in hospitals of Delhi. The national capital has been witnessing a fresh surge in coronavirus cases amid the festive season and rising air pollution. On Friday, Delhi recorded over 7,000 COVID-19 cases for the first time. The city on Saturday reported 79 deaths, the highest number of fatalities in over four months. Jain, who is on an official visit to Rajasthan's Dungarpur, said the first wave had hit its peak around June 23 and the second on September 17. "The third wave of COVID-19 is at its peak in Delhi. The number of cases suggests it is the worst wave so far. But the cases will come down soon," Jain told reporters here. Delhi reported its first case on March 1, when a businessman in East Delhi was diagnosed with COVID-19 after returning from Italy. The minister cited aggressive testing and contact-tracing among reasons for the sudden spike in the number of cases being reported. Jain, however, said laxity on the part of the people has also been a major reason behind the surge. "Some people think nothing will happen to them if they don''t wear a mask. They are wrong. Mask is the only medicine for COVID-19 till a vaccine is developed," he added. The National Centre for Disease Control, in a report drafted recently, had warned that Delhi needed to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh COVID-19 cases daily taking into account the winter season-related respiratory problems, large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings. On Friday, Chief Minster Arvind Kejriwal had said that like the previous two waves of coronavirus, the third one would end soon in Delhi as he urged Delhiites to make wearing masks a movement to arrest the spread of COVID-19. "Till there is a vaccine for corona, consider face masks as the vaccine. These are the biggest protection against COVID-19 infection. We need to promote wearing face masks as a movement," he had said. The national capital on Saturday recorded 6,953 new cases of the infection. Daily cases began rising in the city in September. It started to come down a bit by the last week. The number of people in home isolation in the city stood at 24,100 on Saturday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/third-wave-of-covid-19-at-peak-in-delhi-satyendar-jain-912857.html

Two more soldiers were also injured in the encounter which erupted after a Border Security Force (BSF) patrol party noticed suspicious movement near the Anti Infiltration Obstacle System (AIOS) or the LoC fence, about 3.5 KM from the LoC at around 0100 hours, an army spokesperson said. He said in the initial firefight one militant and a BSF soldier were killed. “Firefight stopped at 0400h. More troops were rushed to the area and the movement of militants was tracked by surveillance devices. Contact was re-established at 1020h when heavy fire was drawn by own search parties approximately 1.5 km from the LoC,” the spokesperson said. In the ensuing firefight, he said, two more militants were killed. “Own troops suffered three more casualties and two injured. Injured soldiers have been evacuated. Operation is in progress. Details will follow,” he added. Defence sources said that the infiltrating militants were heavily armed and in two groups. “Either some militants are hiding or some may have gone back to the other side,” they said and added the operation is on. A BSF spokesperson said Pakistani army started a ceasefire violation in support of the infiltrating militants. Today’s infiltration bid was the second biggest along the LoC this year. On March 31, five heavily armed militants and an equal number of soldiers were killed in the Keran sector of Kupwara.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/4-security-forces-personnel-3-militants-killed-during-infiltration-bid-by-ultras-in-jks-machil-912863.html

The senior commanders of the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA), however, agreed to continue dialogue to resolve the six-month-long military stand-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) – the de facto boundary between the two neighbouring nations in the western sector. They also agreed to ensure that the troops deployed on the forward positions exercise restraint and take measures to avoid misunderstanding that could lead to the escalation of tension, according to a joint press release issued in New Delhi and Beijing on Sunday. The senior military commanders of the two nations held the eighth round of talks near the LAC last Friday. Lt Gen P G K Menon, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 14 Corps, led the delegation of the Indian Army. Maj Gen Liu Lin led the delegation of the Chinese PLA. The two governments stated in a joint press release issued in New Delhi and Beijing that the senior military commanders had held “candid, in-depth and constructive exchange of views on disengagement along the LAC in the western sector of India-China border areas.” They agreed to “earnestly implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries (Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Chinese President Xi Jinping), ensure their frontline troops to exercise restraint and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation”. The two sides also agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels, and, taking forward the discussions at the eighth round of meetings, push for the settlement of other outstanding issues, so as to jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.” They also agreed to have another round of meeting soon. The sixth round of talks between the senior commanders of the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA on October 12 saw both sides agreeing to stop further deployment of soldiers on the face-off scenes. They, however, could not reach an agreement to restart the stalled process of pulling back soldiers already deployed on the LAC. The disengagement process the two sides had mutually agreed upon remained stalled since mid-July with the Chinese PLA declining to completely withdraw troops from several “points of friction” along the LAC – like Depsang Y junction, Gogra Post and the northern bank of Pangong Tso.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/india-china-stand-off-no-breakthrough-on-pullback-in-meeting-between-corps-commanders-912875.html

Tyagi, who is popularly known as Computer Baba, was appointed as the chairman of a river trust by the previous Kamal Nath-led Congress government in the state. According to Indore administration officials, during an investigation, illegal constructions and encroachments were found on two acres of government land in his ashram premises on the city's outskirts. The ashram is spread over 40 acres land, the market value of it is estimated at Rs 80 crore, they said. "The preventive arrests were made under Section 151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) during demolition of illegal construction on government land in Tyagi's ashram at Jamburdi Hapsi village on Indore's outskirts," Superintendent of Police (western region) Maheshchandra Jain said. Tyagi and six of his associates have been sent to jail, he added. According to local administration officials, the revenue department imposed a fine of Rs 2,000 on the ashram office-bearers some days back and asked them to remove illegal constructions from the government land. However, as the illegal constructions were not removed, the administration took out the ashram belongings on Sunday and removed the encroachments amid heavy police security, they said. A gaushala (cowshed) and a religious place would be developed on this land now, the officials said. Before being appointed head of a river trust in the Kamal Nath government, Tyagi was given minister of state status by the previous BJP-led government also in the state. Ahead of the 2018 state Assembly elections, Tyagi parted ways with the then Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led government, alleging that illegal sand mining was going on in the Narmada river. Recently, in the run-up to the November 3 by-elections to 28 Assembly seats in the state, Tyagi launched a 'Save Democracy Campaign' and dubbed 22 rebel Congress MLAs who joined the BJP earlier this year as 'gaddar' (traitors). The resignations of the 22 MLAs had led to the collapse of the Kamal Nath-led government in March this year, paving the way for the BJP's return to power in the state. These former Congress MLAs contested the recent bypolls as BJP candidates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/computer-baba-held-during-demolition-drive-at-his-madhya-pradesh-ashram-912962.html

The arrested accused has confessed to his crime. He told police that on November 4 when he saw the girl all alone, he abducted her. The man then took her to a jungle, raped and then killed her, the police officer said.

Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat allowed bail to accused Babu on a personal bond of Rs 10,000 and an equal amount of surety in a case of a victim, Rahul suffering gunshot injuries, after noticing that the injured had given a fake address during the medical and remained untraceable. The court noted that the other accused Imran was already granted similar relief. The excerpts of long poem that the judge wrote: I have heard, heard a lot.Mind is clear, with claims tall;Its my time to take a call.Babu has a sordid past;Proof is scant, which may not last.His omnipotence can't be assumed;Peril to vanished Rahul, is legally fumed.Take your freedom from the cage you are in;Till the trial is over, the state is reigned in.The State proclaims; to have the cake and eat it too;The Court comes calling; before the cake is eaten, bake it too. Accused Babu, with a bad antecedent history, was arrested on April 8, 2020 for the offence committed on February 25 on the basis of a purported identification by constable Satish who is claimed to have been posted at Maujpur Red Light. "Apart from the identification by Satish as the applicant being involved in rioting at near Maujpur Red Light towards Jaffrabad on February 25, there is nothing much that has been brought on record. He stands on even a better footing than Imran who is already enlarged on bail in this case," the court said. The Judge directed the accused not to leave Delhi without prior permission, not influence any witness or tamper with evidence and attend proceedings on each date.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/take-your-freedom-from-the-cage-you-are-in-judge-pens-poem-to-grant-bail-to-delhi-riots-accused-912981.html

The minor, who suffered over 75% burn injuries, was very critical and battling for her life in Banaras Hindu University medical college hospital, where she was referred from the district hospital. According to the police sources here, a resident of the victim's village in Dubahar area in the district has been harassing her for the past several months. Her father had complained to the parents of the alleged offender but the harassment continued. The alleged culprit, who lived in the neighbourhood, barged into the house of the victim in the wee hours of Saturday and set her ablaze after pouring kerosene oil on her body while she was asleep, sources said. By the time her parents, who reached her room after hearing her cries, doused the flames, she had suffered extensive burns. The doctors said that her condition was ''very critical''. Police said that the culprit has been arrested. The incident comes close on the heels of alleged gang rape and murder of an SC teen in Hathras district triggering a nationwide outrage. UP has been witnessing a sudden spurt in the incidents of crimes against the women.

08-11-2020||North and Central||Farm fires continue to deteriorate Delhi's air quality||The national capital's air quality was recorded in 'severe' category on Sunday as stubble fires continued to be reported in Punjab and nearby regions. According to the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) mobile app SAMEER, Delhi's overall air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 426 which falls in the 'severe' category. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said the situation was unlikely to improve unless a drastic reduction takes place in stubble fire counts. "Surface winds have become calm, which were moderate so far, and are forecasted to stay low in magnitude for the next two days. This is the major factor due to which no quick recovery is expected unless a drastic reduction in fire counts takes place," SAFAR said. According to SAFAR, stubble fire counts over Punjab, Haryana, UP, Uttarakhand and neighbouring areas stood high at 3,780 on Saturday and its share in PM 2.5 in Delhi's air was estimated as 29 per cent for Sunday. It was estimated as 32 per cent for Saturday. SAFAR stated the air quality was likely to marginally deteriorate and stay at the 'severe' to the higher end of 'very poor' category for the next two days.  An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". Out of 35 monitoring stations in Delhi, 31 recorded 'severe' AQI. The only stations with AQI in the 'very poor' category were Lodhi Road at 333, NSIT Dwarka at 377 and Pusa at 374. The data for North Campus was not available. NCR area also recorded 'severe' AQI with Gurgaon at 434, Ghaziabad at 456, Noida 428 and Greater Noida at 440. Farm fire count stood at 4,528 on Friday, the highest of this season, with central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi stating that the city's air quality is likely to remain "severe" on Diwali as well. The AQI was recorded at 427 on Saturday evening. SAFAR said the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was estimated at 21 per cent on Friday. It was 42 per cent on Thursday, the maximum so far this season. Last year, the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi's pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farm-fires-continue-to-deteriorate-delhis-air-quality-913042.html
08-11-2020||North and Central||People of J&K have right to decide whether or not to sell property: Jitendra Singh on new land laws||Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Sunday said abrogation of Article 370 provisions and changes in land laws allowing people from across India to purchase property in Jammu and Kashmir do not take away from the people of the Union Territory their right to decide whether or not to sell their property. He claimed that the Kashmir-centric "so-called mainstream leaders" were feeling rattled because they would not be able to purchase properties in Jammu region so easily at low prices. The people of Jammu will now have the advantage of choosing their buyers from a larger pan-India pool and also seek higher price, the minister said. The newly enacted land laws nowhere allow forcible occupation or taking over of anybody's property or even purchasing property without the owner's consent, said Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel. "If that was so, the Gupkar bungalows would have been the first to be taken over," he told reporters here. Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and National Conference President Farooq Abdullah lives in a bungalow on Gupkar Road in Srinagar. "It is a matter of common sense that abrogation of Article-370 grants people across India the right to purchase property in Jammu and Kashmir, but it does not take away from the people their right to decide whether to sell the property or not and whom to sell," Singh said. He said Gupkar Road is the most preferred site, and, therefore, before warning the people of Jammu to protect their land from being taken away by outsiders, the "so-called mainstream Kashmir-centric leaders" should guard their own bunglows. "The so-called mainstream Kashmir-centric leaders should first make sure to guard their own palatial bungalows constructed at one of India's most picturesque locations by the side of Dal Lake on such a majestic scale that they could give a complex to the royal palaces of erstwhile princess," the minister added. In a gazette notification, the Centre has omitted the phrase "permanent resident of the state" from Section 17 of the Jammu and Kashmir Development Act that deals with disposal of the land in the union territory, paving the way for people from outside Jammu and Kashmir to buy land in JK and Ladakh, over a year after the nullification of provisions under Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution. Before the repeal of Article 370 and Article 35-A in August last year, non-residents could not buy any immovable property in Jammu and Kashmir. However, the fresh changes have paved the way for non-residents to buy land in the union territory.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/people-of-jk-have-right-to-decide-whether-or-not-to-sell-property-jitendra-singh-on-new-land-laws-913055.html

Several exit polls on Saturday gave the RJD-led opposition alliance in Bihar an edge over the ruling NDA while at least three of them predicted a clear majority for the 'Mahagathbandhan' which has projected Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial face. Most of the exit polls also predicted RJD to again emerge as the single largest party in the 243-member assembly along with a clear dip in the seat tally of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar-led JD(U). "Mr Modi (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) believes that he can win every election on Hindutva, Ram Temple, Pulwama, repeal of Art 370, CAA, and branding every opposition party and opposition leader as anti-national," Chidambaram said.  "I believe the people of Bihar will send a clear message that they are more concerned with jobs, food, healthcare, inflation, fair prices for farmers, infrastructure and industrial development. Will the PM hear their voices?" he said in a series of tweets. Claiming that the Indian nation is as "divided as the United States", Chidambaram said president-elect Joe Biden's thanksgiving speech is the kind of speech that "we want to hear from every Indian Prime Minister". Counting of votes for the three-phase Bihar assembly polls, which ended on Saturday, will be held on November 10.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bihar-polls-people-will-send-message-that-jobs-inflation-key-issues-says-chidambaram-913062.html

In the last week of the government’s ‘10 Hafte 10 Baje 10 Minute campaign’, he said the participation and support of Delhiites against dengue have set an example by defeating the disease for the second year in a row. According to a statement released by the office of the Chief Minister, the citizens of Delhi have successfully managed to bring dengue cases to 489 this year from 15,867 in 2015. Compared to 60 dengue-related deaths in 2015, there have been no dengue-related deaths this year. Responding to the appeal of the CM, RWAs, children, traders, celebrities, shopkeepers, and the citizens of Delhi came forward to successfully defeat dengue for the second consecutive year, it said. "Congratulations Delhi. Your participation and support in the 10-week campaign against dengue have set an example by defeating the disease for the second year in a row. Not a single dengue-related death has been reported this time. Salute to the commitment of the Delhiites,” Kejriwal said in a tweet. On September 6, the Chief Minister had kickstarted the ‘10 Hafte 10 Baje 10 Minute' anti-dengue campaign by inspecting his house for any signs of stagnant clean water and draining it. The Delhi government also launched a dengue helpline - 01123300012 - and WhatsApp helpline - 8595920530 - to assist the general public in preventing the spread of dengue this year. "Kejriwal government's 10 Hafte 10 Baje 10 Minute campaign exemplifies how effective community-driven campaigns by the government can yield tangible results.

08-11-2020||North and Central||Wrong to treat protesting farmers as enemies: Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal to Centre||Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday slammed the Centre over the suspension of freight trains in Punjab, saying it is wrong to treat farmers protesting against the central agriculture laws as “enemies”. The Railways on Saturday declined to resume goods trains in Punjab, saying it will either operate both freight and passenger trains or none. The train services in Punjab are suspended since September 24, when farmers started their “rail roko” agitation against the central laws. Goods trains had resumed briefly after farmer unions on October 21 announced exempting them from their "rail roko" stir but the Railways suspended them again, saying farmers are still blocking the tracks. Badal condemned the Centre for not resuming freight trains despite farmers “clearing” all rail tracks. It is wrong to treat farmers agitating against the central agri-marketing acts as “enemies”, he told reporters here. Badal said the Centre should not make the train services a “prestige” issue. “Farmers held a 'rail roko' agitation to press for the repeal of the laws. They have vacated the rail tracks for more than a week. However, the central government is not restarting trains on one flimsy excuse or the other. Such conduct is not advisable in a democracy,” he said. Badal criticised Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh for doing “nothing” to resolve the crisis, except holding an hour long-protest in Delhi “solely for the benefit of the cameras”. He said the CM should tell Punjabis why he failed to meet either the railway minister or seek time from the prime minister to pressure the Union government for the resumption of freight trains. On future alliances of the party after parting ways with the BJP, the SAD chief said they are strengthening the party in all 117 constituencies in the state. On the occasion, former Tarn Taran BJP president R P S Maini joined the Shiromani Akali Dal. Maini, an advocate by profession, had joined the BJP in 2002. He had remained its Tarn Taran district president from 2009 to 2014 and the party spokesperson for the state unit till 2017. Maini said he resigned from the BJP in protest against the party's refusal to repeal the recently enacted farm laws and its “discriminatory” attitude towards Punjabi language in Jammu and Kashmir. Badal welcomed Maini to the SAD fold.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/wrong-to-treat-protesting-farmers-as-enemies-shiromani-akali-dal-chief-sukhbir-singh-badal-to-centre-913105.html

Vijay Saharia, a resident of Uakawad Khurd village under Bamori police station limits in Guna, was doused with kerosene and set ablaze on Friday night over a loan, said Superintendent of Police Rajesh Kumar Singh. "He died the next day at the district hospital and a villager identified as Radheshyam Lodha has been arrested for murder," the SP said. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan called the incident as gruesome and painful and said he would visit the deceased's family. He said a legal provision has been made in MP to free tribals from the clutches of money-lenders by waiving old debts. Meanwhile, the Congress said crimes against Dalits and tribals were on the rise under the BJP government which came to power in March. "The chief minister is terming it a normal fire death, but the truth is the deceased was a bonded labourer for three years with the accused over a Rs 5,000 loan.

08-11-2020||Opinion||The malaise of the moderates||In one of his last interactions, the recently deceased peace activist Swami Agnivesh told his friend and ally, the controversial former principal of St Stephens’ College of Delhi University, Valson Thampu, that he thought “religion has become a pestilence, it needs to be eradicated for the sake of humanity.” From Agnivesh, who wore ochre robes, took blows for pledging multifaith pluralism, this was telling, almost tragic, commentary. The happenings in France once more signal the Sisyphean condition of organised religion. Sure, many social, religious groups, including Islamic ones, and some governments, have condemned them. Still, it makes one ponder about the individual’s relationship with God. How do middle-of-the-road moderate believers treat acts of extreme violence while staying true to the spirit of their faiths? Is their centuries-old religion so brittle that it can be undone with a cartoon there, or an interfaith marriage, here? As a non-believer, maybe it isn’t my place to be speaking about this. But my ethos won’t let me be. There isn’t a second in the life of Indian society, when there is any respite from religiosity. My rights get trampled upon all the time. I grew up in the northern suburbs of Bombay, and I still recall the knocks on the door to my family’s tenement-like flat for the Ganesh Chaturti collection. The local Shiv Sena shakha ran it; the request felt like a threat. Even my religious family – where some youngsters turned irreligious – wasn’t amused. We caved since we wanted to be part of the wider community. It was not uncommon to find the Shiv Sainiks tipsy every other evening of the festival. Members of the borough thought their money was guzzled. Sometimes, I wished my family would refuse to pay up. It would have cast them out, I would have lost friends. Teenagers may have the brio to rebel against their parents, but against the groupthink of God-fearing friends? Little chance. Some of these Sainiks played no small role in razing the UP Muslim-run barbershop across our flats in 1992-3. Avowed Hindu moderates of my locality gaped on. It may have happened in France, but there have been non-violent provocations against many other religions in different parts of the world. No matter how offensive the trigger may have been, organised religion – of all systems – cannot be enabling bloodletting and should not be perceived doing it either. It’s the most ineffable aspect in the history of the major religions: that force has been used to crush a God’s castigating, lampooning, or caricaturing by somebody. And yet, with such a red record, masses of the world’s population retain belief in some god. Some may argue, that’s the reason why religion reinforces its hold on the human psyche. Even while one may think it implodes, it actually grows; it’s the ultimate identity giver and the most personalised government for the commoner. No matter how many religious associations condemn violence claiming it isn’t part of their faith, it sounds untrue. Dig into the past of many of the major religions in the world, and you will find grisly things done in the name of God. Religious people and groups who condemn religious violence often like to state that one shouldn’t tar a whole faith due to the acts of some. They say, in their faith – or in the version they follow – there is no sanction for murder, even under the worst circumstances. They often summon their individualised association with their religion to glorify their pacific practices. Religious extremism as “it’s not something that we do or condone at all – we are not like that.” Essentially, they attempt to restore the public image of the faith, knowing evil has been done. Indeed, even non-political religious people, like moderates of each faith, are driven to talk about how peaceable their mores are. When the moderates of a religion worm their way out to defend and redeem their religion when acts of radical violence take place under its name, you know that the extremists have beaten them. The malaise of the religious moderates is that when things get bad, they must defend their faith, and when they often quietly work for peace, they get limited credit. In the fingertip Internet age, many of the world’s major faiths are flattening out their variances and homogenising as never before. Along with it, some other things may go. One of them will be the private relationship between the individual and their God, which is a common attribute among religious moderates. One could say spirituality is a private matter, but now, what about religion? Can religious people claim their religiosity is a private matter when their faith is used for violence, and commerce? With the spirals of strife that obtain in the world, the faithful peacenik, the committed moderate, looks likely to be a relic.

08-11-2020||Opinion||The Hindu mind is full of blasphemous thoughts, and I’m proud of it||The Nasadiya Sukta in the Rig Veda is regarded as the Hindu creation hymn. But unlike the creation hymns of the Semitic religions, it does not assert that the universe was created by an omnipotent, omnipresent God and the manner in which it was done. Rather, the hymn merely wonders: Who really knows? Who will here proclaim it? Whence was it produced? Whence is this creation? The gods came afterwards, with thecreation of this universe. Who then knows whence it has arisen? Whence this creation has arisen – perhaps it formed itself, or perhaps itdid not – the One who looks down on it, in the highest heaven, only He knows or perhaps even He does not know.   Have you come across the dialogue between Sage Vyasa and Lord Ganesha, when the former asks the latter to be his scribe and write down the Mahabharata? Vyasa: Oh Lord, please write down the verses as I compose them. There’s no else who can do so at my speed. Ganesha: Gladly, oh Sage! But once I start writing, you cannot stop to think. Your composition must flow without a gap. Vyasa: Alright, oh Lord, but you must not write a single verse without understanding it. Finally, there is this unbelievable story that I heard and experienced years ago. The Sonda (Swaadi) Matha is in the middle of a forest near Sirsi taluk. If you were to stay overnight at the temple and get to sleep right in front of the sanctum sanctorum, at around 3.30 am, you will suddenly wake up to the sound of the temple bells. You will see no one near the bells, but you will see them swinging. If you feel terrified and want to run out, you will find the large door heavily bolted. You can’t go out at that time. Temple authorities will give you a strange explanation. They will tell you that you cannot step out because in the temple pond, an inversion of reality is occurring: Lord Vishnu is performing puja to Vadiraja Theertha, a 16th century Madhwa saint. Yes, you read that right: God performs puja of man! Now, none of this is a provable truth or fact, they are all imaginations of human minds. But what kind of human mind imagines that God did not create the universe and, perhaps, may not even know where it came from? What kind of human mind imagines a human challenging God intellectually, that too the God of Intellect himself? What kind of human mind imagines that God performs puja of man? Aren’t all these thoughts blasphemous? They would be, in a religion of the Book, in the Semitic religions. In Hinduism, it’s just curiosity and creativity, and evolution of the mind -- from the Vedic age through the epics and puranas to about the 16th century! Of course, this is not to refute the failings of the Brahminical caste system or the difficult history of Hinduism’s interaction with Buddhism, for instance, nor to refute that the evolution of the Hindu mind came to a halt at some point of time and began regressing. But recent events in France – a cartoon of the Prophet recreated deliberately to provoke Muslims; a Muslim refugee from Tunisia beheading a schoolteacher in revenge; the French President seemingly coming out in defence of Charlie Hebdo in the name of freedom of speech but failing the test on sensitivity towards religious feelings – made me look inward and think of the essence of Hinduism, and these few gems from the universe of Hindu philosophy, myths and temple lore. It is, of course, easy to conclude that ‘Hinduism’ and we Hindus – by the way, I’m a non-believer, Charvaka/agnostic, if you please -- are superior to the rest of the world. But it may be more prudent to recall Al Beruni’s chiding – “The Hindus believe there is no country like theirs; no religion like theirs, no science like theirs, no kings like theirs…They are haughty, and self-conceited…” Sure, Janani Janmabhoomischa Swargadapi Gariyasi. But think how far we have strayed from those Hindu minds that thought and debated so freely, so broadly, and so fearlessly, and think what we have become in pursuit of the political project of Hindutva. Self-proclaimed protectors of Hindutva almost burnt down some of our greatest treasures at the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute in 2004, angered merely by rumours of an insult to Chhatrapati Shivaji. In the last few years, they have weaponised Jai Shri Ram. And in an extension of the idea of blasphemy to the political arena, our Prime Minister has become unquestionable. You can’t question him anywhere, in any way -- not in a press conference, not by RTI, and now not even in Parliament. If you question him, you are anti-national, anti-Hindu! Christianity, and the West, progressed and adapted itself to the coming world of democracy by separating State from religion; the free-spirited Hindu mind evolved by its irreverent attitude to authority (even that of God Himself, what to speak of kings and prime ministers) and by questioning and debating existing ideas. Madhwacharya’s Dvaitha did not come about without questioning and arguing against Shankara’s Advaitha; Basavanna’s Vachanas and social reform did not come about without debunking Brahminical ideas of caste and holiness. The Muslim mind is yet to come to terms with the need to debate the ideas of its religion and adapt to the ideas of modern sovereign nations, secularism and democracy. We should hasten it not by fuelling a ‘Clash of Civilisations’ but by enabling a ‘Dialogue of Civilisations.’ Yes, we can be Vishwaguru in that respect, but for that, we must give up the political project of the Hindutva nation and return to the courageous blasphemy of Hindu imagination.

08-11-2020||Opinion||Flattening the ‘friendship curve’||In the many mellow moments of my midlife, I have often contemplated the fact that I don’t have a Best Friend. You know, the proverbial 3 AM friend that you fervently speed-dial, sniffling pitifully to explain very little but still be fully understood; the kind that, when all your ducks are not in a row in your mind, all your dots are connected in theirs. I do not even have the streaming gallery of Best Friend Forever’s my tween daughter has, each of whom must be solemnly ‘accessorised’ with one half of a heart on a locket. Moreover, everyone else my age seems to have flauntingly found their One Best Friend, many, a long time ago, and some, even before they learned to spell. Some years ago, I fancied I had found my Best Friend—a woman, a little bit more into her midlife than I, similar backgrounds, different circumstances, with a seemingly large capacity to hold all my cat-walking contradictions, as I hoped to hold hers. Our initial chemistry was like love at first sight on a blind date; she even recorded a midnight-special poem on my 45th. But as they say, for anything good to last, it must take its time to happen, except if it’s bad, like a pandemic or a heart attack. Sure enough, after the initial delirious delight of many ‘you too’s’, and the breathless disclosures of both old and new memories to quickly build a base cache of confidences over coffee dates, the fizz in this Best Friendship fizzled out as suddenly as it had bubbled up. Poof. All the right ingredients were there, in generous quantities too, and the best intentions, and the effort. We even lived just a short drive away from each other. Naturally, I wondered what had happened, or not, for such a spectacular fail. Since this small saga occurred sometime before the pandemic, I chinned up to treat these forays into new friendships like start-ups do bad business ideas—fail fast, get up and go, and keep experimenting with more. But who knew the tsunami of Covid-19 was coming at us all, and that it would change our relationship with all our relationships—with work, our co-workers, our spouses, partners, children, siblings, parents, our homes, with ourselves. The ship is wrecked, and with it, also our friendships, even the fastest of them. In their flexibility was also their fragility, those Lockdown One cocktails on Zoom notwithstanding. In hindsight, it seems that we may have mistaken our ability to be available in our full, unmasked physicality as acts of friendship. How else do I explain the numerous Friday evenings that I have dressed up to mark my presence at gatherings that left me hungover, with excessive wine and endless whining, both of which we had indulged in before a thousand times? And all those Saturday evenings I have dressed up my home to receive ‘friends’ who have then fiddled with their phones taking away with them very little but a few photographs of false bonhomie and over-familiarity for Facebook? Maybe the only fellow who called it right was the security guard at my condominium’s gate when he announced these friends as merely ‘Visitors’. But my fascination with this aspect of our increasingly fickle lives continues, and as it is now safe to assume that we are unsafe for the foreseeable future, where do we go from here? Do we now have to go for broke alone? I think not. I hope not, please, God of Pandemics, no. Can we again do just as the start-ups do, look at the colossal collapse of our former lives as a cashable opportunity? The answer to finding abiding friendships may lie in those Zoom calls after all, but those we do for work: in their precision, starting with the correct selection of invitees. Some, for whom our lives were just an amble in an amusement park, must now be classified as optional. The pandemic even offers us a chance to deny these ‘visitors’ re-admittance into our worlds. And some carefully chosen others we can now welcome back in with open arms, no hugs though, because they never left the party till the dishes were done? The Covid-19 curve will continue to be like a yo-yo, but the friendship curve has flattened. It is now up to us to find the upsides.

08-11-2020||Opinion||Between the devil and the deep sea||China is anxiously waiting for the US election results and to see if there’s a chance to restore strategic stability between the two countries. China has many stakes in who becomes the next President. All US presidential candidates since the late 1990s have taken shades of anti-China stance in their poll campaigns, only to switch over to full-fledged engagement with Beijing once they are in the White House. This time, it could be different. In the last four years, the fundamentals of Sino-US engagement policies, assiduously built since Henry Kissinger’s secret visit to Beijing in 1971 and Deng Xiaoping’s visit to the White House in 1979, have been revisited, at the cost of the basic tenets of the bilateral relationship. This drastic change was caused by the epistemological break brought about by China’s 19th Communist Party Congress in October 2017, which made attempts to “occupy the centre stage” in the global order. It laid out a roadmap to realise “socialist modernisation” by 2050 -- China intends to replace the US without having to fight a war by constantly expanding the envelope of deterrence. China is also keen to unveil the first centennial of the Communist Party’s establishment and ushering in a “well-off society” next year. It has grand plans for Made in China 2025, of graduating to being a high-tech exporter. It has commenced the 14th Five Year Plan with innovation, dual circulation strategy, and domestic economic restructuring. Strategic stability with the US is crucial for the success of these projects. President Donald Trump’s “decoupling” from China began with the 18-month tariff war, and extended to a revision of US policies on Tibet, Xinjiang, Taiwan, South China Sea, and 5G. The US specifically targeting China’s Communist Party cadres and leaders has brought about a new low in ties. China’s “wolf warrior diplomacy” has revived Cold War imagery. Effectively, the Trump administration ended the engagement policies that led to the rise of China. Hence, any coming back of Trump is widely seen in China as a problem, although some Chinese argue that Trumpian structural disruptions, America First and isolationist foreign and security policies, have provided China with opportunities to expand. The Trump administration’s restrictions on financial flows, technology flows, visas, educational exchanges, 5G telecom contracts -- not only in the US but also in the European markets -- have stifled China, leading to a decline in the growth rate, which is essential for social and political stability for the Communist Party. China is thus looking desperately for the restoration of the engagement policies. On the other hand, some Chinese argue that while Joe Biden may revive multilateralism, or give a new lease of life to Barrack Obama’s G-2 (a US-China condominium), he may prioritise the Uighur issue or step up engagement with the Dalai Lama. Chinese policy analysts are aware that there is now a bipartisan consensus on China policy due to Beijing’s assertiveness all around, compounded by the spread of Covid-19, which coincided with over 500,000 people reaching the US before the Wuhan lockdown on January 23. With the US becoming the biggest victim of the pandemic and the high anti-China sentiment there, Covid-19 is going to loom large over US-China ties in the short to medium term. The stakes for China in these US elections are high, ranging from benefiting out of any revival of engagement policies on trade, investment, technology transfers, working together on proliferation and regional stability issues to strategic competition or even conflict over Taiwan, South China Sea, North Korea, the global commons or other issues. As such, many Chinese see themselves as being caught between the devil and the deep sea. Both candidates can negatively impact China’s growth in many sectors, just at the time when China is at the cusp of realising “strategic opportunities” that the four-decades-old engagement policies provided in the first place. Secondly, while it was the US that sought to export democracy and capitalism to the Soviet republics during the Cold War, today, China is being accused of interfering in the US elections. The Cold War, then, has come a long way between China and the US.

08-11-2020||Opinion||A speech with soul||When the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin, reimagined Otis Redding’s Respect and released her iconic version in 1967, the rendition soon became a black power anthem as well as a theme song for the burgeoning feminist movement. So much power, so much impact, but all Aretha was asking for was just a little respect (just a little bit, just a little bit). Two decades earlier, in a jarringly different time and place, India’s Constituent Assembly was engaged in multiple redraftings of our Constitution. This laborious process, across three separate readings over a duration of some two years, was finally coming to a conclusion toward the end of 1949. On November 25 that year, Babasaheb Ambedkar, who had steered the project from its inception, made a motion in the Assembly that the Constitution should now be adopted. In the process, Ambedkar delivered his final address, certainly one of the finest speeches of his stellar career. The speech is well known. It has been commented upon innumerable times, with some of its catchiest phrases (‘the grammar of anarchy’, ‘a life of contradictions’) later becoming appropriated as book titles. But there is one peculiar aspect of this address that gets nearly universally passed over without mention. And it is this overlooked aspect of the speech that I want to focus on here — just a little bit. Ambedkar began his final address in the customary way, thanking members of the Drafting Committee, its support staff and advisers, the ruling party members and their effective whip and others who had helped complete the Herculean task. But then the speech took an unexpected turn. Ambedkar mentioned individually several members of the Assembly who had done the opposite of all of those whom he had just thanked. He called out and thanked the ‘rebels’, salient voices of opposition who had challenged Ambedkar’s drafting, not once, not occasionally, but frequently and consistently throughout the entire process. Again, to be clear, Ambedkar thanked individually and by name each one of his most vociferous political opponents. As he had put it, “The points they raised were mostly ideological. That I was not prepared to accept their suggestions does not diminish the value of their suggestions...I am grateful to them. But for them, I would not have had the opportunity which I got for expounding the principles underlying the Constitution, which was more important than the mere mechanical work of passing the Constitution.” R-E-S-P-E-C-T, that’s what Ambedkar gave to them. Now, let’s look at why. Ambedkar said he was grateful to his ideological opponents because their constant challenges had forced him to reflect upon and expound his own position in a much more thorough-going way than if he had been surrounded by ‘yes-men’ only. Principles, he pointed out, were ultimately more important than mechanics and procedures. This was especially true when constitutional essentials (basic structures, separation of powers, fundamental rights) were on the line. Disturbing or delaying the process in order to ensure the clarity and soundness of the underlying principles was something that policymakers, leaders, persons in power, ought to welcome. In plain terms, what Ambedkar was highlighting was that dissent improves us. It enriches constitutional democracy. That Ambedkar enjoyed the wisdom to recognise this provides the backdrop for the central role that ‘fraternity’ played in the later parts of this historic speech. He argued that cultivating fraternity — an attitude of mutual respect, even for our ideological opponents — was what would one day allow our fractured state and polarised society to become unified as a nation. Who in positions of power today heed these historic words of Ambedkar? All we’re asking for is just a little respect. Just a little bit. Sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me… (Aakash Singh Rathore as Dr Jekyll is a Professor of Philosophy, Politics and Law, author and editor of over 20 books and counting, and as Mr Hyde, one of India’s top-ranking Ironman triathletes.  @ASR_metta)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/a-speech-with-soul-912738.html
08-11-2020||Opinion||An open letter to Joe Biden||Dear Mr Vice President: In the last four years, federally funded science agencies were unmade and remade. They were given new marching orders. The mandate of providing the nation with unbiased scientific advice was replaced by a new mandate—that science is subordinate to the political goals and ego of President Trump. The consequences of this new mandate are serious and far-reaching. The Environmental Protection Agency became the Environmental Pollution Agency, rolling back protections on clean air and clean water, and providing regulatory relief to President Trump’s campaign contributors from the fossil fuel industry. Scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were censured for challenging President Trump’s incorrect forecast of the path of a major hurricane. Their sin? Failing to adhere to the prime directive that the president is never wrong. At multiple federal agencies, climate science became “the subject that must not be named”—and the subject that should not be studied. And most recently, federally funded scientists unwilling to support the president’s incorrect narrative of a country “rounding the corner” on Covid-19 were publicly ridiculed and dismissed as “idiots.” I was a federally funded climate scientist until September 2020, supported by the US Department of Energy’s Office of Biological and Environmental Research. I used pattern recognition methods to identify human “fingerprints” on climate.. I worked with colleagues at Lawrence Livermore National Lab and at research institutes and universities around the world. Together, we found human fingerprints in the temperatures of the atmosphere, the land surface and the world’s oceans. We detected signs of human influence on ocean heat content and salinity, snowpack depth, the timing of streamflow from snow-fed river basins, atmospheric moisture, drought behaviour and clouds. We learned that human fingerprints on climate are not an isolated phenomenon. They are ubiquitous, present in dozens of independently monitored climate records. The Department of Energy supported climate fingerprint research for over 25 years. The research survived transitions between Democratic and Republican administrations. It withstood shifts in the composition of the Senate and Congress. But it did not survive a president who has falsely dismissed climate change as a hoax and a Chinese conspiracy. It did not survive a president who falsely asserts that science does not know the causes of climate change. It did not survive a very stable genius who considers his expertise superior to that of all scientific experts. Nor did climate fingerprinting survive the changing of the guard at a remade Department of Energy—new leadership that walked away from the same research the DOE had funded.  This seismic shift in political climate led to the apprehension and even fear among my younger scientific colleagues. Some worried about green-card applications. Could their application be adversely affected by co-authoring a paper that rebutted incorrect scientific statements made by former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt? Others worried about funding. Could their DOE support be cut if we continued to engage in climate fingerprint research? Should we simply hide and self-censor? Should we avoid any research areas viewed with disfavour by the president of the United States? Our climate fingerprint group did not self-censor. Throughout the tenure of the Trump administration, we continued to study the nature and causes of climate change—research that is in the best interests of the citizens of this nation and this planet. We continued to believe that US National Laboratories are an appropriate place to perform such research. And we continued to report on our findings; to speak science to power. We did not hide. Over the last four years, Americans have had ample opportunity to observe the consequences of willful scientific ignorance. Ignorance is toxic and fatal. It is a potent vector for the spread of the Covid-19 virus. It hampers effective action on climate change, burdening our children with present and future climate disruption they did nothing to incur. Ignorance isolates us from the rest of the world. The United States is the world’s pariah nation, unwilling to accept science, unwilling to participate in international efforts to control a global pandemic, and unwilling to take part in international efforts to reduce emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. Our peers in the free world view us with pity and concern. Mr Biden, assuming your election to the office of President of the United States, is formally certified, you will face two immediate, formidable challenges. The first is “bending the curve” of Covid-19 infections. The second is to bend the curve of greenhouse gas emissions towards a more sustainable pathway—to attain an emissions curve that reduces the risks of significant climate disruption. An additional important challenge is to restore public trust in science and scientists. You must rebuild public trust in the scientific impartiality of the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Energy, the Centers for Disease Control and many other federal agencies with scientific remits. You must convince the women and men working in these agencies that their new prime directive is not political loyalty to one person—the new directive is “get the science right.” You will have to inspire the disillusioned and disheartened, reverse the loss of critical expertise at key scientific agencies and make public service at these agencies an aspirational goal for the next generation of young scientists. In achieving this restoration of trust, you can count on the help of many thousands of US scientists. I was educated in a British Army school in Germany. My education was heavy on poetry. One poem that stuck in the sieve of my memory was by Thomas Hardy. It describes a desolate winter landscape at the tail end of the 19th century. In the cold, inhospitable countryside, against a backdrop of political instability in Europe, a solitary thrush is singing. The poem captures the disconnect between the bleak physical setting, the portents of conflict, and the clear, beautiful birdsong: So little cause for carolings Of such ecstatic sound Was written on terrestrial things Afar or nigh around, That I could think there trembled through His happy good-night air Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew And I was unaware. Today, we live in similarly ominous times. We wish for signs that the darkness of the last four years is lifting—for singing in the wilderness. Our “blessed hope” for a better future is invested in you.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/an-open-letter-to-joe-biden-912745.html
08-11-2020||Opinion||Don’t freak out about Covid-19 reinfection stories||By Faye FlamThe most attention-grabbing scare stories about the pandemic often revolve around individual cases — someone who got the disease twice; a young, fit person who died; an older person who was likely infectious for more than two months. The fear is that these phenomena could be widespread, but scientists who study infectious disease say it’s normal to see extreme variability in the human reaction to any virus. Early in the pandemic, people often described the disease based on their experience or someone they knew. Some said it was just the sniffles because that’s what they experienced. Others said it was the worst thing that ever hit them. They’re both right. But the over-generalization of these experiences can feed into the political polarization of the disease. It shouldn’t. In the big picture, Covid-19 neither the Black Death or the sniffles. “There’s a vast diversity of immune responses as well as responses to infection,” says Dan Barouch, a vaccine researcher at Harvard Medical School. That’s the case with other pathogens from influenza to tuberculosis to HIV. “Sometimes it’s because of different genetics, and sometimes it’s from a different strain of the virus,” he says. “In some cases, it might be due to different viral doses or other immune parameters, or demographic variables — sometimes it comes down to chance.”  He said he’s not alarmed that there are a few documented cases of reinfection. Even if there are vastly more than the dozen or so reported reinfections, this would still represent a tiny sliver of the tens of millions of cases that have occurred worldwide. One of the most striking examples, described in a case study in The Lancet, was a 25-year-old man in Nevada who was infected once in late March and later in May. Genetic analysis of the virus showed it was not a lingering effect of the same infection. While other cases of reinfection were milder the second time, this one was more severe. It’s not all that surprising, says immunologist Florian Krammer of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai. The concentration of antibodies in different people infected with the virus follows something close to a bell curve, he says. There’s a typical response, but plenty of variation out at the edges. Sometimes people with more severe infections make more antibodies, but sometimes they see sky-high antibody concentrations in people who never get symptoms. As millions of people become infected, it’s not surprising that a few get a new infection only a short time later, he says. In the Nevada case, the patient produced antibodies the second time, but possibly not the first. In another case out of Hong Kong, doctors measured a low antibody concentration after the first infection, and the patient had only a mild case the second time. Another recent alarming case study described a 71-year-old woman with leukemia who never developed symptoms and never produced measurable antibodies, but appeared to remain infected and possibly infectious for more than 70 days — much longer than the eight days most patients are thought to be contagious. Despite these exceptions, the experts I consulted still think most people will be immune for at least a few months after getting infected. And they expect that vaccines will work. The immune system is complex and offers more defenses than only antibodies. Antibodies are produced during initial infection, says Krammer, but another component called memory B cells circulate in the body for years, retaining the ability to recognize the same virus and trigger a new immune response if it comes back. Genes also play an intriguing role. Rheumatologist Arthur Krieg, the founder of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, says that people with a defect in a gene called TLR7 can develop particularly severe cases of Covid-19. That gene regulates an all-purpose virus fighter called interferon, which is released quickly after exposure to pathogens. According to an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the TLR7 gene is on the X chromosome, and that makes the problem much more common in males. (Females have two copies of the X chromosome, so are more likely to end up with at least one normal version of the gene.) In one case described in the article, two brothers in their early 20s were sick enough to need mechanical ventilation to survive. In another, a 32-year-old man and his 29-year-old brother were hospitalized, and the younger brother eventually died. Another factor is experience with prior infections, says Krieg. There are four coronaviruses circulating in the population and causing common colds. He says exposure to these may influence the way people respond to Covid-19. Indeed, a new paper released Friday in Science shows that more than 5 percent of a sample of 302 people and more than 40 percent of a smaller group of children under 16 carried some immunity to the new coronavirus left over from these other infections.  The variability in human response to the virus means there will likely be variability in the effectiveness of vaccines, he says, and that’s a good reason to try to gain public trust and get everyone on board. If enough people take a vaccine, the world could achieve herd immunity, even if the vaccine only worked in, say 70% of people. But if too few people get the vaccines, then even vaccinated people might not be safe, if they’re unlucky enough to be especially susceptible to the virus. And if that happens, we’ll all be living with Covid-19 for a long time to come.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/don-t-freak-out-about-covid-19-reinfection-stories-913083.html

Former Karnataka-cadre IAS officer S Sasikanth Senthil, who resigned from the civil services last year citing his inability to continue when "fundamental building blocks of diverse democracy are being compromised," will join the Congress in Tamil Nadu on Monday. Senthil, a 2009 batch officer, will join the Congress in the presence of AICC in-charge for the state, Dinesh Gundu Rao, and state Congress chief K S Alagiri. 41-year-old Senthil resigned from the civil services in September 2019 when he was working as the Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada. The development comes months after former IPS officer Annamalai took the political plunge in Tamil Nadu by joining the BJP. He is currently the vice-president of the state unit of BJP. Born in Chennai, Senthil did his BE from the then Regional Engineering College in Tiruchirapalli and worked with a software firm for a year before taking up teaching. He then joined the civil services and became part of Karnataka cadre. The former IAS officer, a vehement opponent of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, told DH that he took the decision to join the Congress as he felt that the party can provide the support system that he needs. "I certainly believe political solution is the only way to resolve many things that are plaguing the nation today. Congress is a party whose ideology is grand old and rooted to the Constitution. The party has never weaned away from its ideology. The current leadership understands the spirit of this ideological fight and recognises that India has to be for all," Senthil said. "There is no substitute to meeting the people directly and explaining things to them. That is what I am planning to do and I am convinced that Congress will provide me the support system," he added. Senthil said he decided to take the plunge in Tamil Nadu as he feels he owes a lot to the state that gave him education and life. "This is the time for people like me to come to politics. If people like me who have enjoyed the fruits of life only because of the policies of the governments (that ruled the state) do not come to save the state, who else will come? The state has given me so much and I want to pay back as much as I can. This is the right time as the BJP is trying to change the narrative. We will not let them...," he added. Senthil is likely to travel across the state and campaign for the Congress-DMK alliance in the run-up to the 2021 assembly elections. Covid-19 situation did not allow a personal meeting between him and Rahul Gandhi, but the Congress leader did speak to Senthil on the phone. "He invited me to join his fight against the divisive forces. I liked the approach," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/former-karnataka-ias-officer-sasikanth-senthil-to-join-congress-912837.html

Not just that, she has created history by becoming the first woman V-P of the US. We are very happy for Kamala,” Dr Sarala, an obstetrician and gynaecologist based here, said. 'Kamala will call when she is free' Since the announcement came late on Saturday night, Dr Sarala has not yet spoken to her niece. “It was quite late when the announcement was made. She will call me whenever she finds time,” Dr Sarala added. Harris had spoken about her chithis more than once in the past. As she accepted the Democratic nomination for V-P in August, she said her mother had taught her to put family first. “Family, is my husband Doug, who I met on a blind date set up by my best friend. Family is our beautiful children, Cole and Ella, who as you just heard, call me Momala. Family is my sister. Family is my best friend, my nieces and my godchildren. Family is my uncles, my aunts and my chithis,” she had said in August. Harris' mother Dr Shyamala Gopalan went to the US at the age of 19 to pursue her higher studies and married a Jamaican Donald Harris. She divorced him ten years later and raised her children – Kamala and Maya – on her own. “My sister would have been the happiest person today if she was alive. But I am sure she is smiling from wherever she is,” Dr Sarala added. Aunt will pray before the family deity Dr Shyamala was the eldest of P V Gopalan's four children. While Dr Sarala and Balachandran Gopalan live in India, their other sister lives in Canada. Gopalan, who was an Indian diplomat, had inspired Harris so deeply that the US Senator had herself recalled how the former had shaped her life, He was her greatest inspiration besides her mother, she had said Dr Sarala also added that she would soon travel to her native village, Painganadu-Thulasendrapuram, 350 km from here, to offer prayers for Harris. Special poojas and abhishekams were conducted at the Dharma Sastha Aiyanar temple in the village for Harris' victory on the day the US went to the polls. Harris had always been a person who was connected to her roots. “She (Kamala Harris) is a person who never forgets her roots and believes in family values inculcated in her by my sister. Even today, she calls me chithi (mother’s younger sister) and she has always been a caring person,” Dr Sarala had told DH in August. ‘My mother proved her critics wrong’ Harris herself had spoken about how her mother was the reason she was where she was, “My mother, who raised me and my sister, was a proud woman. She was a brown woman. She was a woman with a heavy accent. She was a woman, who many times people would overlook her, or not take her seriously. Or because of her accent, assume things about her intelligence. Now every time my mother proved them wrong. “Every time she proved them wrong. And because of who mother was, and what she believed, what she had the ability to dream what was possible and then work to make possible, the fact that my mother never asked anyone permission to tell her what was possible is why, within one generation, I stand here as a serious candidate for the President of United States,” she had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/happy-that-kamala-has-scripted-history-family-in-chennai-912845.html

08-11-2020||South||When Covid-19 turns 'dancing Gods' of Malabar jobless, pushes to penury||He is the God incarnate. Wearing coconut-frond skirt and towering headgear, he used to give "darshan" to his devotees at temple grounds and countryside sacred groves at midnight. Even his mere touch or soothing words were believed to have the divine power to cure diseases and bring fortunes in life. But the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has suddenly turned things upside down and changed Suresh Babu, the God incarnate, into a mere mortal, who is worried about job loss and financial constraints and pushed him into mental depression. This is not just the story of Babu alone, but of a large number of Theyyam performers, the ritual dancers of Malabar (north Kerala), who are considered as God incarnates. Theyyam is a centuries-old ritualistic performance, a melange of folk dance, drama, music and mime, held at temples and 'kavus' (sacred groves) attached to ancestral village homes in the Malabar region of the southern state during November-mid May every year. It is performed as an offering to appease Gods or ancestors. While performing, the artist is considered and revered as the incarnate of God and believed to have divine powers. For the first time in its known history, Malabar is passing through a time without Theyyam performance as the state government has imposed strict restrictions for the presentation of the ancient ritual art in the wake of the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Considering this, temple managements and the performers have decided to do away with the Theyyam season this time. As the pandemic spread and temple authorities decided to abandon the performance, hundreds of Theyyam performers lost their only source of income, many were pushed to depression and several others are thinking of going back to their traditional community jobs like mattress making, farming and so on. For Suresh Babu, a well-known Theyyam performer hailing from Neeleswaram in northern-most Kasaragod district, life has suddenly come to a standstill after the Covid-19 spread. "It is something beyond my imagination. Even in my worst dreams, I have not thought that there won't be any Theyyam this season. There was no such period in my life so far," a disheartened Babu told PTI. Popularly known as Suresh Babu Anjoottan among his fellow performers, the 58-year-old artist said he belongs to a family having traditional right to perform the ritual dance and persons like him were born to perform it. "I do not know anything else other than performing the ritual dance, which I have been doing since the age of 13 years. A majority of Theyyam performers, including me, have no other job or source of income. Me and my family entirely depend on the six-months-long Theyyam season. Its cancellation means our life is in deep crisis," the seasoned artist said. Though he didn't specifically say how much he earns through each Theyyam performance, Babu said contributions from devotees and respective temple managements comprise their income. A Theyyam performer and his family not only have to manage to live with the meagre amount, but also have to keep some balance for the lean period during the rest of the year. According to the government directive, a Covid-19 certificate is mandatory for the artist to perform Theyyam and prior permission from respective local bodies is inevitable. Adhering to Covid-19 protocol, a maximum of 20 persons can participate while the ritual dance is staged in Kasaragod district, which the performers and temple management feel is not practical. Unnikrishnan, a Kannur based Theyyam performer said as there was no steady income or any welfare scheme to protect their lives, many youngsters were already not keen on taking the ritual dance as their profession. "After the outbreak of the pandemic, many of our fellow performers are even thinking of going back to our traditional jobs. We don't find any other way to survive," he told PTI. Theyyam or Theyyattam means 'dance of the Gods' in local parlance. Over 400 varieties of Theyyam, representing major and minor Gods in Hindu mythology, are in practice in the Malabar region, which mainly comprise Kannur and Kasaragod districts. Elaborate make-up, colourful costumes comprising red cloth-covered waist skirts made of bamboo splices or coconut fronds and heavy-weight headgear, some of them towering even up to 60 feet height, make the ritual dance a spectacle for onlookers. Each Theyyam is the outcome of sincere dedication and days-long hard work of several people, especially the performer. He has to adhere to a strict vegetarian diet and celibate lifestyle and abandon all worldly pleasures even days before the performance. As many major Theyyams can last more than 12 hours, the performer may not be able to have food or water at the proper time. During the seasons, many artists work continuously for weeks, taxing their bodies. Even the elaborate body and eye make-up may take up to 5 -6 hours to complete. The performer's body is richly painted with natural dye and other colours and the pattern and design vary according to the deity which he represents. "Many artists start suffering from various diseases from hypertension to arthritis. The heavy make-up causes irritation to the skin and problems to eyes. Those suffering from back pain and tuberculosis are also not less," he said, adding that the fire-jumping in which the performer leaps on a heap of hot ashes at frequent intervals also causes serious health hazards. Velan, Malayan, Vannnan, Anjoottan and so on are among the major communities who traditionally perform Theyyam. The performer, wearing a multi-layered waist skirt, towering headgear, traditional ornaments and heavy face and body makeup, enters the temple premises and invokes the deity by dancing to the frenzied rhythm of drum beat. It is believed that God possesses the artist's body while performing and gives blessings to the devotees assembled there to see him. As a token of blessing, the Theyyam performer distributes rice with turmeric powder to the devotees. People approach Theyyams with their endless woes and seek blessings from them for bringing prosperity in life. Suresh Babu remembered how several couples, who were blessed with newborns, came to offer him precious gifts while performing. "They believe in the divine powers of Theyyam. Even people bring unsettled legal disputes in front of Theyyams and seek solutions. But now, my days have passed without any meaning. I am doing nothing... I am heading to depression," he said. A sad Babu also said he was spending time nowadays cherishing those good-old memories and feels that the days without Theyyam are equal to death. The Theyyam artists of Malabar also requested the authorities to come out with a financial package to save their lives as the unexpected pandemic and lockdown has robbed them of their sole source of income and pushed them to penury.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/when-covid-19-turns-dancing-gods-of-malabar-jobless-pushes-to-penury-912877.html

Villagers burst crackers, distributed sweets, drew rangolis outside their homes, and prayed at the Sri Dharmasastha Ayyanar Temple to celebrate Harris breaking the “glass ceiling” and writing herself into history. Painganadu-Thulasendrapuram, 350 km from here in the fertile Cauvery Delta region, is the native village of P V Gopalan, the grandfather of Harris, and people here have been conducting special poojas and abhishekams at the temple for her victory. Food Minister R Kamaraj and Tiruvarur MLA 'Poondi' Kalaivanan from the DMK participated in the festivities on Sunday. Women drew rangolis and with verses like “Kamala Harris – Pride of Our Village” and “Vanakkam America” outside their homes as people held placards that displayed the US V-P elect's photo. People distributed sweets outside the Sri Dharmasastha Ayyanar Temple, for which the Gopalan family has been sending donations, and installed banners and cut-outs wishing Harris for her victory. “It is a proud moment for all of us at all the village that a person who traces her roots to this hamlet has become the Vice-President of the United States. Our joy knows no bounds today. The village erupted in celebrations,” R R Kalidas Vandaiyar, whose grandfather enjoyed close friendship with Gopalan, told DH from the village. Vandaiyar had organised a special abhishekam on Tuesday, the day the US went to the polls. The temple, where the abhishekam was held, is close to the Gopalan family as his son Balachandran Gopalan, who lives in Delhi, and daughter Dr Sarala Gopalan have been making donations for its consecration. On Sunday, Dr Sarala told DH that she is likely to visit the village to offer prayers at the temple in the next few days. “I am planning to go to our native village,” she said. Ramani, one of the caretakers of the temple, said he sends the temple prasadam every year to Balachandran and Dr Sarala. “Dr Sarala comes here every two or three years. They have donated money for the temple. The whole village celebrated Kamala Harris' victory on Sunday,” Ramani said. Gopalan, who was a high-ranking civil servant, was born in Painganadu-Thulasendrapuram. His eldest daughter Dr Shyamala Gopalan went to the US to pursue her higher studies where she married a Jamaican Donald Harris and the couple had two daughters Kamala Harris and Maya Harris, a lawyer by profession. Kamala Harris and her sister had accompanied Dr Shyamala to Chennai often to meet their grandparents at their home in upscale Besant Nagar.

A senior forest officer said a proposal for declaring the purple frog, also known as pignose frog, as state's amphibian, is in the active consideration of the state government. "The proposal is in the active consideration of the government and soon it will be declared as the state's amphibian, "Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) & Chief Wildlife Warden Surendrakumar told PTI. The matter will be discussed in the next meeting of the state wildlife board. Official sources said the move to declare it as the state's amphibian as it was mostly endemic to Kerala region of Western Ghats. According to Delhi University professor S D Biju, who discovered the frog a few years ago in the Idukki district, said it is not only a rare frog species but is also one of the unique amphibians. Talking to PTI, Biju said the purple frog, which remains underground most of the year, is found mostly in the Kerala part of the Western Ghats. The frog was found in one forest area of Tamil Nadu also, Biju said. The purple frog, scientifically called "Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis" is listed as endangered in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as its "Extent of Occurrence is less than 5,000 km, all individuals are in fewer than five locations, and there is continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat in the Cardamom Hills." According to WWF, the leading organisation in wildlife conservation and endangered species, purple frog has been acknowledged by bio-geographers all over the world as one of the rarest kinds and a "once in a century find." It said the purple frog has a bloated body with short stout limbs and is dark purple to greyish in colour. "Reaching to about 7 centimetres, it has a small head in comparison to the body length, and an unusually pointed snout. Its short and muscular forelimbs with hard palms help it to burrow underground. Unlike other frogs, it has very short hind legs, which does not allow it to leap from one spot to another. As a result, it covers any distance with long strides. It depends more on its sense of smell to hunt out soil termites underground," the conservation organisation said. The proposal for declaring the purple frog as the state amphibian was submitted to the forest department by Sandeep Das, who does research on frogs at the Kerala Forest Research Institute. Das, also EDGE Fellow at Zoological Society of London, named it as the "Mahabali frog" as it emerges from under the ground for only one day, like Keralas mythological King Mahabali who was banished to the underworld and given permission to meet his subjects in Kerala during Thiruvonam day of Malayalam month of Chingam. Talking to PTI, he said the purple frog was recommended as a strong candidate for the state amphibian as it was easy to recognise, resemblance to King Mahabali visiting above ground for a single day and one of the most popular frogs in the world. He said the frog can act as ambassador for amphibian conservation in the Western Ghats region of the state. By conserving the Mahabali frog the whole aquatic ecosystem along with the biodiversity of Western Ghats can be conserved, Das said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mahabali-frog-may-be-keralas-official-amphibian-913012.html

The gesture of the young nurse, Stephy Rose Simon, assumed much significance as health workers in the state had been justifying even serious lapses allegedly leading to the death of patients by citing the workload. Stephy has been working in the Covid-19 ward at the medical college hospital under the RSBY scheme. The patient at the ward was fed by Stephy as he was showing reluctance to take food. She was in a PPE kit. Most Covid-19 patients are not having by-standers even as the government now decided to allow by-standers for those who necessarily require support. Stephy's act was captured by another patient in the ward and he posted it on social media. Subsequently, Stephy got much appreciation. Recently a doctor at Ernakulam medical college hospital itself alleged that some nurses were not taking proper care of Covid-19 patients and it even led to the death of a couple of patients. An audio message sent by a nursing officer of the Ernakulam medical college hospital to her junior colleagues stating that even as many patients undergoing treatment for Covid-19 have died due to lapses in medical care, the doctors are protecting the nurses considering their workload, and it has triggered strong protests. Hence the act of Stephy has assumed much significance.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-nurses-care-for-covid-19-patient-goes-viral-913054.html

08-11-2020||South||India hails Kamala Harris as history maker||Residents set off firecrackers in the ancestral home of Kamala Harris on Sunday as India celebrated the vice president-elect's victory in the US election, with her uncle hailing her achievement as historic and an inspiration to women and girls. Harris -- daughter of breast cancer specialist Shyamala Gopalan from the southern Indian city of Chennai -- paid tribute to her late mother, who "believed so deeply in an America where a moment like this is possible" in a national address with president-elect Joe Biden on Saturday. At Thulasendrapuram village in Tamil Nadu state, once home to Harris's maternal grandfather P.V. Gopalan, celebrations broke out with people lighting firecrackers, praying at its main temple and waving posters bearing the vice president-elect's face. Women in the village made a rangoli -- a colourful work of folk art drawn on the ground -- with the words "Congratulations to Kamala Harris". "It is a matter of pride for the entire womenfolk," housewife Arul Mozhi Sudhakar told AFP. Harris' uncle, academic Balachandran Gopalan, said his late sister would have been proud of her daughter and that the family would converge in Washington from across the United States and from India, Canada and Mexico to witness her historic inauguration. "Her mother would have been very happy. She would have asked Kamala to continue what she's doing," the 79-year-old academic told AFP in the capital New Delhi as a huge media contingent crowded outside his home. "Can you think of any other country where a first-generation immigrant would go to the highest office... It's a lot of firsts. And at a major time in US history. And that she's there as VP means a lot." His niece's lifetime of accomplishments -- she was also California's first Black attorney general and the first woman of South Asian heritage elected to the US Senate -- would be an inspiration to other Indian-American immigrants, he added. "Lots of (Indian-American) children who earlier were interested in the annual Spelling Bee contest are now going to be interested in US politics," he quipped. "I think young children, especially young girls, are more motivated and enthused. That's a good thing." Gopalan said he had further hopes for his trailblazing niece -- including a presidential run. In Delhi, people cheered the Harris family's Indian origins. Yash Iyer, 25, told AFP: "It's a proud moment for us too as Indians since she traces her roots here." "Kamala Harris being the US VP is a monumental accomplishment not only for the US and Indians but for women across the globe," Smitashree Mishra, who works in international health and development, told AFP. "What I take away from this victory is a ray of hope, hope to stand strong in a society that constantly judges you on archaic notions of gender, race and ethnicity... I am proud as a woman to see another woman represent our perspective in the politics of the world's most powerful country." Shopkeeper Murlidhar Aggarwal said Harris' success showed that people from minority backgrounds could "reach the highest offices" in the US. "Even in India, it should be like that -- the only thing that should matter is if the person is qualified for the job." Early Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Biden and Harris. "Your success is pathbreaking, and a matter of immense pride not just for your chittis, but also for all Indian-Americans," Modi wrote about Harris. "Chitti" is a Tamil term of endearment for the younger sisters of one's mother, which Harris used in her acceptance of the Democratic nomination for vice president. The Biden-Harris victory was splashed across India's Sunday newspaper front pages. Harris "creates history", The Sunday Express said along with the headline: "Finally."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/india-hails-kamala-harris-as-history-maker-913065.html

It was based on a notice seeking privilege motion given by CPM MLA James Mathew that the ethics committee issued the notice. The fresh moves could be seen as the political move by the left-front government. Hence the Congress and BJP had also flayed the move. Sources said that the ED was taking legal opinion on responding to the notice. The ED may point out the provisions in the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Kerala government got irked as ED sought details of various projects like Life Mission, which aims at providing housing to all homeless in the state, as part of probe against Kerala CM's former principal secretary M Sivasankar. The CPM legislator's contention was that the Life Mission project was a policy decision of the state government to provide housing to all home less on a time bound basis. It was also announced in the state Assembly. But the ED intervention might affect the implementation of the project as a whole and it would delay housing to the homeless. Vijayan had alleged that the central agencies were acting as per a political script. He also suspected an attempt to sabotage Kerala's prestigious projects like the Kerala Fibre Optic Network that aims at providing high-speed internet free of cost to 20 lakh economically weak families. Meanwhile, Kerala Higher Education Minister K T Jaleel is likely to appear before Customs on Monday. The Customs had summoned Jaleel in connection with probe into importing of dates and religious books by UAE consulate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-govt-issues-notice-to-ed-over-life-mission-scheme-913066.html
08-11-2020||South||Kerala: Cheating accused MLA from Kasargod gets political backing||An MLA from Kasargod district arrested on charges of cheating over a hundred people who invested in his jewelery business has been backed by the Congress and Indian Union Muslim League. Manjeshwar lawmaker M C Kamaruddin was arrested on Saturday as over 100 cases were registered against him. He is a leader of the IUML, which is a key ally of Congress-led United Democratic Front. Meanwhile, both Congress and IUML leadership maintained that the arrest of Kamaruddin, a day after local body elections in the state was declared, was a political move to divert attention from the serious charges that the ruling CPM-led Left front was facing in Kerala. Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, UDF Convenor M M Hassan and IUML leader and Lok Sabha MP P K Kunhalikutty were among those who came out in the open supporting Kamaruddin. They said the case against Kamaruddin was due to loss in his business and it could not be compared with the drug trafficking or gold smuggling case that the CPM was facing. The IUML leadership also decided not to take any action against Kamaruddin now. The cases pertain to Kasargod-based Fashion Gold Jewellery business. Kamaruddin was chairman of the shop and IUML local leader T K Pookoya Thangal is managing director. The firm downed shutters in January citing business loss. Around 700 people were said to have invested in the firm. A total of 117 cases were so far registered against the accused. Meanwhile, the police have launched a search for the other accused Pookoya Thangal. It was learnt that Kamaruddin told the police that Thangal was mainly running the firm. Kamaruddin is arraigned as the second accused and Thangal is the first accused. Various Sections of IPC for breach of trust, cheating and criminal conspiracy were invoked against the MLA.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-cheating-accused-mla-from-kasargod-gets-political-backing-913067.html

The recoveries stood at 2,386, taking the total number of people walking out of health care institutions after getting cured to 7.13 lakh till date, a health department bulletin said. The Covid-19 toll in the state climbed to 11,344 with 20 related fatalities. Active cases including those in isolation were at 18,894. Meanwhile, Chief Secretary K Shanmugham said being the festival season, the coming days will be challenging as far as controlling coronavirus is concerned. Stressing the need to wear face masks to prevent the spread of the virus, he said restrictions can be relaxed if there was a decline in active cases. Briefing reporters in Coimbatore after reviewing various developmental schemes and Covid-19 situation, Shanmugham said the number of infections was more in villages and there was a need to ramp up testing in districts. As many as 75,384 samples were tested on Sunday with the cumulative specimens examined till date touching 1.05 crore. Chennai accounted for 2.04 lakh cases of the total 7.43 lakh cases in the state. The state capital clocked 601 new infections followed by Coimbatore 205, Thiruvallur 133, Chengalpet 120, Erode 103. Ramanathapuram recorded the least with seven people contracting the contagion.

The allegation comes a day after Bedi announced that she had referred to Union Home Ministry the proposal of territorial government to provide the quota. Narayanasamy told a virtual press conference that he had convened a joint meeting of leaders of all political parties on Monday to decide on the next course of action to ensure implementation of the reservation. He alleged that the Lt Governor had been impeding implementation of all proposals of the elected government only to tarnish its image. "Now, the proposal of the government to provide horizontal reservation of 10 per cent is being blocked by Bedi who is delaying its implementation by referring it to the Union Ministry," he said. She deliberately acts to the detriment of the students and other sections of people through her intervention, he alleged. The government had intended to help students from rural areas, who had done plus-two courses in government schools and cleared the NEET and the 10 per cent quota was, therefore, sought to be introduced through a decision of the cabinet recently, he said. "We forwarded the file relating to the cabinet decision to Lt Governor for approval. But Kiran Bedi had blocked the implementation of the proposal particularly when counselling was to be held shortly for admission to MBBS and other medical courses," Narayansamy said. "The Lt Governor has been hatching a conspiracy to block the government`s proposals on various issues and now she has adopted the same conspiracy in implementing the horizontal reservation for government school students," he said. He charged Bedi with functioning like the agent of the Bharatiya Janata party and was dashing to pieces the dreams of the poor students aspiring to do medical courses by referring the proposal to the Home Ministry. Narayanasamy further said he had asked the District Collector to go into the allegations that students who did not belong to Puducherry had been earmarked seats in the MBBS course in the centrally administered JIPMER on the basis of alleged fake certificates of nativity of Puducherry. The Chief Minister said he had received complaints that students from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana had allegedly been selected for the MBBS course in JIPMER on the basis of fake certificates that they were from Union Territory. The Collector would conduct a detailed enquiry and take appropriate decision, he said. President of Puducherry Parents and Students Welfare Association V Bhala had also alleged that bogus nativity certificates were submitted by students from other states in getting admission under Puducherry quota in MBBS courses at JIPMER. He wanted the government to hold a probe into the matter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kiran-bedi-purposely-blocking-govt-quota-for-medical-courses-puducherry-cm-913086.html
08-11-2020||State||B S Yediyurappa confident about winning RR Nagar, Sira assembly bypolls by huge margins||Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Sunday expressed confidence about the ruling BJP winning both Rajarajeshwari Nagar and Sira assembly bypolls, results for which will be declared on November 10, by huge margins. "We will win R R Nagar by (a margin of) 35,000-40,000 votes. In Sira also we will win by about 20,000-25,000 votes. I'm not saying it today, I had said it ahead of the elections and on the polling day," he told reporters here. The Chief Minister said the Congress has probably taken this prediction lightly and would know the truth once the results are out. "If Yediyurappa says something, it will be after thinking ten times and after understanding the public opinion. So 100 per cent we will win both seats by a huge margin," he added. Asked about Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah's claim that the results would favour the Congress, he said "Siddaramaiah will get to know when the results are out on November 10. I wish him good luck." Exit polls have indicated that the BJP will sweep the Rajarajeshwari Nagar and Sira bypolls. Voting for both assembly constituencies took place on November 3, with a turnout of 82.31 per cent and 45.24 per cent respectively. The Sira byelection was necessitated following the death of JD(S) legislator B Sathyanarayana in August, while the R R Nagar seat here fell vacant after disqualification of the then Congress MLA N Munirathna under the anti-defection law last year. The BJP, which has never won the Sira seat, had fielded radiologist Dr C M Rajesh Gowda, son of former Congress MP C P Mudalagiriyappa, who recently joined the party. The Congress and JD(S), considered traditional rivals in the region, had fielded former Minister T B Jayachandra and Ammajamma. Ammajamma is the wife of late JD(S) MLA Sathyanarayana. In R R Nagar, Congress had fielded a fresh face -- Kusuma H, wife of late IAS officer D K Ravi. She was pitted against V Krishnamurthy of JD(S) and N Munirathna of the BJP. Munirathna, after his disqualification last year, had joined the BJP. The outcome of the bypolls would be seen in many quarters as a reflection on the performance of the Yediyurappa government, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, while the opposition parties-Congress and JD(S) would be keen to strike after being routed in the December 2019 bypolls. The Chief Minister has already indicated that the much-awaited cabinet expansion would take place at the earliest and he would talk to the high command in this regard soon after the assembly bypoll results. Expressing confidence about the NDA forming the government in Bihar, Yediyurappa said, "let there be no doubt about it...exit polls may be showing some variations, but according to me, 100 per cent we will be forming the government there."||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/b-s-yediyurappa-confident-about-winning-rr-nagar-sira-assembly-bypolls-by-huge-margins-912917.html

The government has submitted a timeline for cleaning the lake to the tribunal. As per the timeline, it will clear the garbage dump in the lake bed over the next three months, undertake purification of the lake water in seven months and complete the rejuvenation and beautification in 12 months, which includes preventing entry of industrial waste to the water body. The NGT principal bench headed by Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel asked the government to submit a report on the status of works by March 31, 2021, and posted the matter for hearing on April 29, 2021.  The green panel was hearing a plea filed by Sanjay Rao and others, seeking action against pollution in the Kithiganahalli lake due to dumping of garbage and discharging of industrial waste. Earlier, the NGT had imposed an interim penalty of Rs 10 lakh on the state government and Rs 5 lakh on Bommasandra Municipal Council over pollution in the lake and for failure in the discharge of duties, i.e., preventing entry of pollutants into water bodies.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/will-rejuvenate-anekal-lake-in-one-year-karnataka-govt-tells-ngt-913119.html
08-11-2020||State||Karnataka relies heavily on teleconsultation to reach out to Covid-19 patients||Despite the Union government’s guidelines that Covid-19 facilities should have provisions for psychiatric consultation, Karnataka relies heavily on teleconsultation to reach out to patients.  The Health Department has just 50 psychiatrists — one each in 30 district hospitals and in District Mental Health Programme (DMHP) teams, while the state has 2,912 government facilities.  Going by the BBMP dashboard, 17 government hospitals in Bengaluru are treating Covid-19 patients. Just a single Bengaluru Rural DMHP psychiatrist covers the Covid patients in Doddaballapur, Nelamangala, Devanahalli and Hoskote government hospitals, while the single Bengaluru Urban DMHP psychiatrist covers Anekal, Yelahanka and KR Puram.  The protocol dictates that all patients in quarantine or isolation should be contacted on a daily basis. The DMHP team consisting of a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a social worker, two nurses and two support staff should make the first call if required and should call everyone once in three days.  “We visit patients in quarantine centres in each taluk donning PPE,” said Dr Girish Kumar D P, the psychiatrist with Bengaluru Rural DMHP. “We counsel asymptomatic Covid patients over the phone. Five clinical psychologists handle 100 to 200 patients every day. If psychological disorders are found after screening, they’re referred to me.”  He said the DMHP team counsels nearly 500 patients a day. About 30% of the patients have anxiety disorders, stress and adjustment disorders followed by depression and substance use. “About 2% of them have suicidal tendencies,” Dr Girish revealed.  Saving PPE Dr Rajani Parthasarathy, Deputy Director, Mental Health, Department of Health and Family Welfare, told DH that the psychiatrists are made to do more teleconsultation since the department did not want to waste the PPE. “As on November 1, 4,26,314 Covid patients have been counselled and 12,314 have been treated,” she said.  The department’s mental health staff also counselled 4,24,122 home quarantined/isolated patients, while it has treated 11,223 of them. It has also counselled 6,512 doctors and 15,382 health workers as on November 1.  The Health Ministry has cited research which suggests that 30% of diagnosed Covid patients have depression, while symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are seen in 96% Covid patients. Among the psychiatric symptoms found during the pandemic are mild to severe anxiety, worries, non-specific psychological distress, depression, stress symptoms, insomnia, hallucinations, paranoia, and suicidal ideation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-relies-heavily-on-teleconsultation-to-reach-out-to-covid-19-patients-913124.html
08-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Many a contender but no luck with B S Yediyurappa successor||Ten more years. That was the vow Bookanakere Siddalingappa Yediyurappa made on the floor of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly moments after resigning as chief minister before the aborted 2018 Trust vote.“My hands and legs are strong enough that I can work ten more years,” he had pledged. A year later, he was back as CM after a protracted political drama that involved 16 MLAs from the Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) alliance brazenly switching loyalties to the BJP. The 76-year-old leader had delivered Karnataka to the BJP again and there was no way the party could deny him the CM’s post. The 75-year retirement rule would have to be set aside for another day. The Karnataka strongman wrote his own political script.  And yet, even in that moment of triumph for him, there always lurked the suspicion that it was just a matter of time before Yediyurappa was shown the door. The buzz was that the party was waiting for the right moment to anoint a younger and, perhaps, ‘loyal’ face as Yediyurappa's successor. In the last few months, amidst the uncertainty triggered by Covid-19, this speculation has only intensified. The BJP finds itself grappling with whom it should choose to replace Yediyurappa, that is, if the old warhorse agrees to bow out before his self-appointed hour of exit.  The answer, if there is one, is not simple. It involves considerations of caste arithmetic, regional representation and generational change.  Heading the list are known suspects: Jagadish Shettar, Laxman Savadi, and Pralhad Joshi — the first two, Lingayat leaders like Yediyurappa, with experience of governance, and the third, a Brahmin and a Union Cabinet minister.  But there are other names doing the rounds, from dark horses like Hubli-Dharwad West MLA, Arvind Bellad, to those like BJP National General Secretary (Organisation), BL Santhosh, who was spoken of as a possible successor to Yediyurappa even back in 2010. Then, of course, many leaders are demanding that Yediyurappa’s successor hail from north Karnataka, where the Lingayats — a community that forms the BJP’s core vote base — are present in big numbers. And finally,  there are those who believe the candidate must have the backing of the RSS, bestowing a good chance of success to someone like Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, who ticks many boxes.  And yet, despite the field of applicants being varied and large, replacing Yediyurappa will be easier said than done for the BJP. “I don’t think they’ll change him anytime soon. They won’t wait till 2023 either,” a senior BJP leader known to be close to both Yediyurappa and the party’s central leadership said. “But, there’s no credible replacement right now.” According to political analyst, Muzzafar Assadi, it goes beyond that. There is a sense of deep crisis in the party at present. “There’s a strong political vacuum,” he held. In many ways, the BJP is at a cross-roads. Yediyurappa is a part of the founding generation of the party’s Karnataka unit. BJP grew from having just two legislators in 1985 —Yediyurappa and K Vasantha Bangera — to forming the government on its own twice. In this journey, Yediyurappa has become CM four times and the BJP’s state president thrice.  Many look back at how the BJP squandered an opportunity to groom a succession line when Yediyurappa severed ties with the party. This was the BJP’s 2008-13 tenure that saw three chief ministers. After Yediyurappa, D V Sadananda Gowda and Jagadish Shettar ran the show.  The BJP only managed to revive its fortunes in the state after  Yediyurappa’s return to the party fold in 2014. That break demonstrated just how dependent the BJP was on Yediyurappa to secure the backing of Lingayats, who constitute 17-18% of the population. Additionally, his ability to build inter-community alliances based on foundational support from Lingayats remains largely non-existent among younger leaders.  Caste, regional factors hold key  As Assadi explains it, there are three social coalitions at work in the state: LIBRA (Lingayats-Brahmins), MOVD (Muslims-OBC-Vokkaligas- Dalits) and 4Bs in the coastal belt (Brahmins-Billavas-Bunts- Baniyas).  “The BJP has created a multi-social coalition, with LIBRA as the dominant one. The party needs someone who represents and sustains all three coalitions. Otherwise, it won’t win more than 70 seats. Right now, Yediyurappa is that someone,” he said. This is the logic for replacing Yediyurappa with Shettar, Savadi or Joshi. But Assadi adds, “Shettar and Savadi aren’t vote catchers. Joshi is nowhere close to what Ananth Kumar was.” Some argue that the absence of an alternative leader is a carefully propounded ‘myth’ from the Yediyurappa camp, which wants to project him as the tallest among Lingayats.  “Yediyurappa is not the only leader and he has done nothing for north Karnataka…,” former DG&IGP and BJP leader Shankar Bidari, also a Lingayat, said.  Bidari, who is miffed with alleged corruption in the Yediyurappa administration, cited how Manohar Lal Khattar, Yogi Adityanath, Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy and R Gundu Rao emerged. “The party can choose any good suitable MLA or MP to replace Yediyurappa. That leader has to place the interest of the state and party above one’s own family.” Many in the party share the view that the party central leadership should “show some guts” in choosing Yediyurappa’s successor. “I suggested that Anantkumar Hegde be groomed,” the BJP leader quoted earlier said. Hegde, a six-time MP and former Union minister, is a firebrand Brahmin. “He has the Hindutva brand, a clean image and doesn’t belong to any camp. But, he has fallen out.” Former union minister Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, a Lingayat who is currently Bijapur City MLA, is “optimally placed” to be the next CM, sources say.  “Ananth Kumar had ensured that Yatnal became a minister in the Vajpayee Cabinet at a young age so as to hone him as an alternative Lingayat leader against Yediyurappa,” according to a source. Yatnal made headlines recently when he publicly claimed that Yediyurappa’s time was up and that his successor would be someone from north Karnataka. That leaves BL Santhosh, a Brahmin, widely perceived as Yediyurappa’s bete noire and said to be the brain behind the appointment of the three current deputy chief ministers, and Yediyurappa’s son, BY Vijayendra, who is seen as his political heir, but with a long way to go. “Whoever is brought in will just be a night watchman. The point is that that person should emerge as a leader,” the BJP leader close to Yediyurappa said.  In all this, Yediyurappa is not worried, sources close to him say. “People were talking, what after Vajpayee and Advani. Nobody even remembers those questions now. Ours is a cadre-based party,” BJP spokesperson Ganesh Karnik said. “We have full confidence in Yediyurappa’s leadership. He has been the tallest leader for the party and the electorate. We’re capable, in any eventuality, to find leaders of which there is no dearth.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/many-a-contender-but-no-luck-with-b-s-yediyurappa-successor-912799.html

08-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Some Covid-19 patients show only gastrointestinal symptoms: Doctors||Some Covid-19 patients may only show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, an examination of findings, published in the Abdominal Radiology journal, from 36 studies done across the world from July has shown.  The Bengaluru-based gastroenterologists say most common presentation is extreme fatigue, diarrhoea, loss of appetite and gastric symptoms. At Meenakshi Institute of Gastroenterology and Fortis Hospital, doctors have seen three to four cases out of 20 patients with this presentation. They have seen a few cases of jaundice and pancreas as well. Dr Praveen Kumar A C, a medical gastroenterologist at St Martha’s Hospital and a Professor at Rajarajeshwari Medical College, Kengeri, told DH that every second day, he sees such patients and that they’re quite common. “Initially, when the pandemic started, we were not aware. We’re lucky to not have picked up infection despite this. We’ve had patients with weakness and loss of appetite, but no other respiratory symptoms like cold, cough or fever. Some had just hiccups orvomiting. A subset of patients had loose motions and abdominal pain but no respiratory symptoms. As we started treating more patients, we were surprised to see that 60% to 70% of patients tested positive for Covid. Any patient who requires endoscopy is being asked to get an RT PCR test,” Dr Kumar said. Dr S Ravindra, director of gastroenterology and hepatology, Fortis Hospital, said, “Most common presentation we’re seeing is extreme tiredness, weakness, gastric-like features and diarrhea. Some come with jaundice and pancreatitis (inflamed pancreas) also. When we check them, most of them turn out to be Covid positive. We should also get a chest CT done to check for Covid characteristics. Whenever we order a CT abdomen, pelvis we ask radiologists to also screen the chest.” Dr C Vikram Belliapa, a surgical gastroenterologist, Vikram Hospital, said, “While a majority of Covid patients show respiratory symptoms, a minority can show symptoms of other (body) systems. A small percentage of these can show only gastrointestinal presentation. This is known to happen from our observational experience. Covid has various manifestations that affect almost all systems of the body - dermatological, psychiatric, etc. The fine difference to understand here is whether Covid patients will present with only gastro symptoms or along with gastro symptoms.” Dr N S Nagesh, surgical gastroenterologist, PMSSY Hospital, said, “Sometimes it is possible for Covid patients to present with loose stools and diarrhea. The virus affects the lungs but for some patients, it is the gut. It is a sequela of the viral infection.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/some-covid-19-patients-show-only-gastrointestinal-symptoms-doctors-913127.html

Gaikwad made the announcement at a video conference held by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. Classes 9 to 12 should reopen after Diwali with all Covid-19 safety protocols in place, he said. A second wave of Covid-19 pandemic was possible looking at the situation elsewhere in the world, so the administration must be cautious, the chief minister warned. "We need to be extra cautious after Diwali. Quarantine centers in schools cannot be shut. The local administration can take decision regarding alternative places for classrooms. Sanitization of schools, coronavirus tests for teachers and other precautions are a must," the CM said. Students who are sick or those who have a sick family member at home must not be sent to schools, Thackeray added. Gaikwad said all teachers will undergo RT-PCR coronavirus tests between November 17 and 22. "Schools will reopen on November 23, and students will undergo thermal checking at entry," she said. Only one student will be seated per bench, the minister said. Further, classes will be held on alternate days and science, maths and English will be taught while other subjects will be taught online, Gaikwad said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-schools-to-reopen-for-std-9th-to-12th-from-november-23-912773.html

Temples were closed to public in Maharashtra since March when the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown in India. “People are asking questions…when will temples reopen?....Yes…places of worship will reopen…let Diwali be over. However, before that comprehensive SOPs will be in place,” Thackeray said. According to him, the government is taking each and every step carefully as the Unlock process continues. “Yes…there has been a delay, but lets take all precautions…some people are blaming but I am reading to take the blame for the delay…we have to ensure that we do not go back to the earlier situation,” said Thackeray, the Shiv Sena President.   The BJP had been targeting the Maha Vikas Aghadi government over keeping the temples shut and its spiritual wing have been staging protests outside temples across the state. Last month there was a war of words between Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and Thackeray on this issue that even came to the attention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Thackeray said that many countries in the West have been hit by the second wave. “We have to avoid it at any cost,” he said, adding that even though there has been a flattening of the curve, we cannot take chances,” he said, adding that wearing masks would be compulsory and people would not wear masks would be penalized. “If one Covid-19 positive person goes to a crowded place without wearing a mask, he or she has the potential to infect 400 persons…imagine how many others these 400 can pass on the infection…we have to come out of it and not go back to the same situation,” he said. Thackeray also appealed to people to celebrate a safe Diwali. “We have celebrated Dahi Handi, GaneshUtsav, Daashera, Eid and other festivals safely…lets celebrate Diwali similarly,” he said and appealed to people not to burst firecrackers. “We thought of a ban, but everything cannot be banned…I am sure that people will cooperate,” he said. Thackeray warned that the four days during Diwali is crucial in the war against virus. “We have controlled the situation in Mumbai, but if we have a look at figures of Delhi, there is an increase. But why no? It is because of the air pollution,” he said, adding that winter is setting in and at this time we cannot afford an increase in pollution levels because of fire crackers. “Celebrate Diwali with diyas traditionally,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/temples-in-maharashtra-to-reopen-after-diwali-uddhav-thackeray-912905.html

While giving him relief, the court "cautioned" the journalist to refrain from publishing articles against any 'constitutional functionaries" without verification. The high court judge R P Dholaria allowed the petition of journalist Dhaval Patel who had sought to quash the FIR through advocate Anand Yagnik. In the order, Justice Dholaria has stated that since Patel is a young journalist who has already tendered an apology, "the court is of the considered opinion that interest of justice would be served if the present proceedings/FIR are quashed." The order also mentions the apology submitted by the journalist in the court which read, "I tender my unconditional apology for the allegedly offending article published by me in my web portal 'Face of the Nation' based on which the impugned FIR has been registered against me. My unconditional apology is without prejudice and without admission of any guilt." The court accepted the apology and ordered to quash the FIR. Justice Dholaria has also cautioned the journalist that, "as and when he may publish an article in future, no such comments are used against any constitutional functionaries without verification and he shall be cautious of not repeating the same." On May 7, Patel ran a news story on this web portal titled, “Mansukh Mandaviya called by high command, chances of a change of guard in Gujarat." Mandaviya is a Rajya Sabha MP and a union minister of state for shipping, chemicals, and fertilisers. The news report had also alleged that Vijay Rupani led state government had failed in containing the virus and therefore, he could be replaced. Following this report, the Detection of Crime Branch (DCB), Ahmedabad booked Patel for sedition and was arrested on May 13. After spending a day in police custody, he was sent to Sabarmati Central Jail in judicial custody. On May 27, he was granted bail by the sessions court which held that prima facie no serious offence was made out against the journalist.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-hc-quashes-sediton-case-against-journalist-for-writing-speculative-report-912930.html

However, he did not elaborate on it further. Thackeray, the head of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, said that the Kanjur Marg land belongs to Maharashtra. Last month, the MVA government scrapped the Mumbai Metro carshed at the Aarey Milk Colony and shifted it to Kanjur Marg. However, the Centre has claimed ownership of the land and directed the state to stop work. He said that international investors find it easy to work in Maharashtra and this was evident from the fact that post Covid-19 outbreak, huge investments are coming in. "In June, we signed MoUs to the tune of Rs 17,000 crore and now (in November) Rs 35,000 crore,” he said. The MVA government has accused the then Devendra Fadnavis-led alliance government of plans to allow commercial development in Aarey, considered a green lung of Mumbai. “The site of Aarey for the metro car shed was chosen by the Fadnavis government only from a commercial point of view. The proposal for the Kanjur Marg site was deliberately rejected. It has now been proved that a private person will have to be paid Rs 5,000 crore for the Kanjur Marg land, was a lie floated by the Fadnavis government,” Maharashtra Congress spokesperson and general secretary Sachin Sawant has said. “Despite knowing that the Metro project in Aarey Milk Colony required only 20 hectares of land, 62 hectares of land was earmarked for it so that the remaining land could be commercially exploited,” added Sawant.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/some-people-are-trying-to-put-salt-on-mumbai-s-development-cm-uddhav-thackeray-912961.html

The BJP’s Maharashtra unit has protested against the move of the police and the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. On 4 November, Goswami (47), a popular TV anchor-editor, was arrested in a 2018 abetment to suicide case. A Magistrate’s court remanded him to judicial custody till 18 November – even as it rejected the demand of police custody for the journalist. While in judicial custody, he was lodged at a makeshift quarantine centre in Alibaug town. “My life is under threat….they did not allow me to speak to my lawyers….my life is in danger…I was assaulted in jail by the jailer…,” he said as he was taken in a jail van. “With Arnab publicly disclosing threat to his life and atrocities faced in custody, law and order officers, the state and national machinery will be held responsible if any harm is inflicted upon my husband,” said Goswami’s wife Samyabrata Ray Goswami, who is the senior executive editor of Republic Media Network. “He was dragged and lugged by the Maharashtra Police in a blacked-out police van to Taloja Jail this morning,” she said. State BJP vice president Dr Kirit Somaiya rushed to the Taloja jail and also spoke to the officer. “The jailer assured me of no harassment of Goswami in jail and proper medical treatment, if required, will be provided,” Somaiya said. BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP and former Chief Minister Narayan Rane said if anything happens to Arnab, the Maha Vikas Aghadi government would be fully responsible.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/arnab-goswami-shifted-to-taloja-central-prison-912973.html
