Madhwacharya and Shankaracharya had set up religious centres in Udupi and Sringeri. It would be more meaningful if the airport is named after them, he said.   The seer's demand comes after Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath cleared a proposal to name Ayodhya Airport as Maryada Purushotham Sri Ram Airport. Naming the airport after two philosophers will bring in glory. India will be recognised for its spirituality. Further, he said various airports in South India should be named after eminent philosophers of the region like Basavanna, Ramanujacharya.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/name-mangalore-airport-after-madhwa-shankara-920871.html

Speaking to reporters here on Saturday, Eshwarappa said, "the dissatisfied MLAs from Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) joined the BJP, else we could not have formed our government. Now all are BJP MLAs and the question of new and old does not arise". "Cabinet berths were less and aspirants were more. We have to accommodate all of them. BJP state and central leadership will soon take a decision in this regard," he said. Regarding activities in the residence of Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi in Bengaluru, he said such political activities have led to the BJP government being formed in the state. There was nothing wrong with him demanding a cabinet berth for MLC C P Yogeshwar. Regarding remarks by Leader of Opposition in Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah that Chief Minister B S Yeddyurappa would be replaced, Eshwarappa said such foolish statements were not anticipated from the former chief minister. "Our party is disciplined and any mistakes, if committed, were rectified through guidance. Yeddyurappa will complete his tenure," he said. He denied having knowledge of the reasons regarding the Chief Minister's Political Secretary N R Santosh attempting to end his life. We have over one crore party workers and their family members are aware of the reasons for them taking such extreme measures.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/bjp-needs-to-repay-debt-of-mlas-who-sacrified-eshwarappa-920909.html

Noting that Belagavi was one of the centres of Hindutva, he said the ticket will be given to its proponents. "In BJP there is no question of Kuruba, Lingayat, Vokkaliga or Brahmin community, we will all sit together and discuss, this is the system, a democratic way.

Speaking to reporters in Belagavi, the senior BJP leader said state and national leaders will select a candidate who can win by gaining the trust of the people. "Whether we give (ticket) to Kurubas or Lingayats or Vokkaligas or Brahmins, we will not give to a Muslim. Belagavi is one of the centres of Hindutva, there is no question of us giving tickets to Muslims here," Eshwarappa said in response to a query. We will give tickets to Hindutva proponents, I don't know whether we will give it to followers of Sangolli Rayanna, Kittur Chennamma (freedom fighters) or Shankaracharya, he added.

In April last year, Eshwarappa had in Koppal said BJP will not give tickets to Muslims to contest the elections as they do not believe in the party. However, he had subsequently clarified that he was not hater of any community including Muslims and his statement was in response to a question about a specific leader from the community getting a ticket from the BJP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/belagavi-is-one-of-the-centres-of-hindutva-karnataka-bjp-will-not-field-a-muslim-candidate-for-lok-sabha-bypoll-920986.html

28-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||‘Need to assess impact of social welfare schemes on beneficiaries’||R Raghu, a Mysuru-based education-entrepreneur, is the new Chairman of D Devaraj Urs Backward Classes Development Corporation. Following his nomination on Tuesday, he took charge in Bengaluru on Thursday. Raghu, who was with the Congress earlier, says he is immensely inspired by the late chief minister D Devaraja Urs and Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa. He joined the BJP in 2015 and unsuccessfully contested the election to the State Legislative Council, from Local Bodies constituency, the same year. In 2002, he was nominated as Chairman of Karnataka Exhibition Authority, when S M Krishna was the chief minister. Raghu, an avid reader and rational commentator on social issues, was also a journalist and published a Kannada newspaper, as a teenager. He is chairman of Kautilya Vidyalaya, a CBSE school in Mysuru. He likes to experiment in education and has introduced various innovative programmes, involving students. Born to J Ranganna and Lakshmamma in 1967, he studied up to MA in Political Science and wanted to be on his own. In an interview with T R Sathish Kumar of DH, he speaks about his vision for the development of the people belonging to backward castes and classes. Q: D Devaraj Urs Backward Classes Development Corporation basically empowers farmers, entrepreneurs, self-employed persons and also artisans. After the beneficiaries are empowered, what is their responsibility towards the corporation, their community people and the society? Once benefits are given, there is a need to evaluate the extent of empowerment. While monitoring the progress of empowerment, additional support should be extended to the beneficiaries to make them successful. Besides, such successful beneficiaries should be involved in motivating and training new beneficiaries. They can provide practical training to youngsters, under internship-like arrangement. Q: The corporation mostly provides financial assistance. What plans does it have to educate the beneficiaries on aspects like judicious use of their education, skills and resources? My wish is to expand the horizon of the corporation. Most of the micro, small scale, cottage and rural industries do not need much investment. As per the teachings of Basavanna, 'work is worship'. Thus, work is the main investment. The vision of Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa and Devaraja Urs is on the same lines, to strengthen grass-roots level vocations. Such initiatives will also strengthen the Atmanirbhar drive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This will reduce our dependence on large industries and imports from nations like China. Q: Most of the benefits extended by the governments are usually used by dominant communities among the target groups. Under the corporation, less represented communities need more support. What can be done for their development? Welfare of around 200 castes, under three categories of 2A, 3A and 3B, comes under the ambit of the corporation. A few communities use most of the benefits. To empower people of all castes, there should be decentralisation of benefits and beneficiaries. Norms would be formulated to give representation to all castes. Q: Both departments and corporations for target groups have similar objectives and functions. Is there a plan to avoid duplication, with Backward Classes Welfare department? I will study the objectives and functions of both the department and the corporation. I will try to achieve coordination. Concerted efforts will yield better results. Empowering local manufacturers and artisans will make the society self-sustained. It will also check migration of rural people to urban areas. The National Education Policy 2020, which stresses on skills and interdisciplinary studies, will give a boost to localisation of vocations and trade. Q: While vacancies in corporations and departments are a handicap in administration, there is also scope for streamlining of administration by some reforms. What is your take on this issue? I wish to reform and revamp the corporation. I will study the strengths and weaknesses of the corporation and work in this direction, for the benefit of the people. I will discuss the issue with the Chief Minister and take his advise. Q: Positive attitude towards life is important for a person to become empowered. Will your diverse experience help to partner with schools and colleges, to groom students of backward and also other communities, to be ready to avail government benefits and excel in life? I will explore the possibilities to partner with educational institutions. As an educationist, I understand the role of schools and colleges in moulding the students to be worthy citizens. NEP 2020 would also be helpful in this regard. Q: Tourism provides ample opportunities for products as well as service providers. Does the corporation have plans to tap this potential? The corporation will take steps to train new tourist guides and will also provide orientation to existing guides. Additional support, like vehicles can be provided to guides. Besides, the tourism sector network can be exploited to market products manufactured by the people belonging to backward communities.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/need-to-assess-impact-of-social-welfare-schemes-on-beneficiaries-921070.html

28-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||No talks in any of the party forums on CM change: BJP Karnataka chief Kateel||The BJP's Karnataka unit president Nalin Kumar Kateel on Saturday reaffirmed that there have been no talks in any of the party forums on leadership change in the state, as speculation about the high command mulling over replacing Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa refuses to die down. "There have been no discussions on leadership change.There have been speculations in this regard for the last three to four months and I have been saying this constantly," Kateel said. Speaking to reporters in Mangaluru, he questioned whether discussions have taken place in this regard and at what level. "Who has raised the issue of leadership change? Who has questioned it? Has our national president or national office bearers or core committee members or our legislators have spoken in this regard?" he asked. There have been rumours in some quarters in recent times that the BJP is weighing the option of leadership change in Karnataka considering the age of Yediyurappa, who is 77. The state BJP has repeatedly rejected such speculations, but some within the party like senior MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal have openly talked about his replacement. The recent move by Yediyurappa like-recommending inclusion of the Veerashaiva-Lingayats community as OBC under the central list, which has been deferred, is being seen by many within BJP circles as a move by the CM to further consolidate his position as the leader of the community considered as BJP's core vote bank, amid such speculations. On cabinet expansion or reshuffle, Kateel said the Chief Minister along with national leaders will decide on who should be in the cabinet and all party legislators will abide by it. Echoing similar views, Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan too said, the chief minister will decide in consultation with the high command. The statement from the party president and the DCM has come amid some aspirants openly expressing their resentment about the delay in the cabinet exercise. Ministerial aspirant and MLC MTB Nagaraj expressed unhappiness about delay in his induction into the cabinet. "It has been six months since we became MLC. Chief Minister has been saying that induction will happen, but the delay has caused some resentment naturally," he said. Other BJP MLCs A H Vishwanath and R Shankar, who along with Nagaraj had rebelled against the Congress-JD(S) coalition government and faced disqualification, which helped the BJP come to power, too have expressed similar sentiments. They too have asked Yediyurappa to keep up the promise by making them ministers in return for their "sacrifice". As per the agreement, Yediyurappa has already inducted 10 rebels into the cabinet after they won subsequent bypolls on the BJP ticket. Now the three MLCs along with newly elected Rajarajeshwari Nagar BJP MLA Muniratha (also a rebel) are now waiting for their turn. With cabinet expansion delaying, a section of this group had met at a hotel last night and held discussions. They are said to be miffed about one among them, Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, who has made repeated visits to the high command lobbying for the induction of MLC C P Yogeshwar, who is not from the group. Yediyurappa on Friday told reporters that he has spoken to Union Home Minister Amit Shah on the cabinet expansion, and the central leadership will convey their decision soon, and that the exercise may take place in two-three days. The cabinet expansion or reshuffle is expected to be a tightrope walk for the Chief Minister, considering that there are too many aspirants, from the party old guard too along with Congress-JD(S) rebels who are now BJP legislators. The cabinet currently has 27 members, and seven berths are still vacant.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/no-talks-in-any-of-the-party-forums-on-cm-change-bjp-karnataka-chief-kateel-921048.html

Modi spoke to Palaniswami who apprised him of the situation in the state. The Prime Minister informed Central teams would be deputed the state for all assistance. "Spoke to Tamil Nadu CM Thiru @EPSTamilNadu and discussed the situation in the wake of the cyclone and heavy rainfall in parts of the state. Central teams are being sent to Tamil Nadu to assist in rescue and relief work," a PMO tweet said. In another tweet, it said the PM condoled the loss of lives and prayed for quick recovery of the injured. "An ex-gratia of Rs. 2 lakh each would be given to the next of kin of the persons deceased and Rs. 50,000 each to the injured, from the PMNRF. @CMOTamilNadu," it added. Palaniswami announced Rs 10 lakh each to the families of the victims. The cyclone had crossed the coast between Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on Thursday morning, but spared the state of very large scale destruction as witnessed during the Gaja cyclone two years ago that crossed the coast between Nagapattinam and Vedaranyam in the south. Apart from uprooting 2,064 trees in the affected districts, including Chennai, Cuddalore, Chengalpattu, Vellore and Nagapattinam, it caused damage to about 108 power transformers and over 2,927 electric poles, Palaniswami said in a statement here. The work to clear the fallen trees and restore the transformers was being taken up on a war-footing, he said. "The state government swung into action immediately after receiving an alert about the cyclone from the Indian Meteorological Department. Strict measures were put in place to prevent casualties due to the cyclone." "However, I am very saddened to learn that four persons have lost their lives due to the unexpected cyclone and heavy rain," he said. Palaniswami expressed his deepest condolences to the victims' families and said he has ordered financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh each -- Rs four lakh from the State Disaster Relief Fund and Rs six lakh from the Chief Minister's Public Relief Fund. Also, he announced compensation for the loss of 61 cows, five bulls, 65 calves and 114 goats in the storm to cattle owners, ranging between Rs 3,000 and Rs 30,000. About 302 huts and 38 tiled houses were completely damaged and 1,439 huts and 161 tiled houses suffered partial damage. Appropriate assistance would be provided to the people whose houses were damaged due to the cyclone, he said. Asserting that prompt measures averted a major catastrophe, Palaniswami said people living in low-lying areas were evacuated to safety and lodged in relief camps. They were provided food, water, mats and blankets. In addition, each family was provided 10 kg rice, dhoti, saree, a litre of kerosene, lentils and cooking oil. Steps were on to prevent the spread of infectious diseases by organising medical camps which so far benefitted about 85,331 people. On the problem of inundation in the city and suburbs, Palaniswami said he has directed the authorities to formulate appropriate plans to find a permanent solution, especially in areas like Velachery, Mudichur, Varadarajapuram and Tambaram. Compensation to farmers for crop loss would be provided after assessing the extent of damage.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/four-killed-due-to-nivar-cyclone-in-tamil-nadu-centre-state-announce-relief-920782.html

In the national capital, the maximum temperature was recorded at 27 degrees Celsius, a notch above normal while the minimum temperature was 10.2 degrees Celsius, normal for this time of the year. Delhi's air quality also improved to be in the "moderate" category due to favourable wind speed and is likely to get even better. The city's 24-hour average air quality index (AQI), which was 302 on Thursday, improved to 137 on Friday, with experts saying stronger winds and a drastic reduction in the contribution of stubble burning were two major reasons for cleaner skies over Delhi. The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the air quality is likely to remain in the "satisfactory" to "moderate" category on Saturday and in the "moderate" to "poor" category on Sunday. In Himachal Pradesh, tourist hotspots Kufri and Kalpa received fresh snowfall while Keylong recorded the lowest temperature in the state at minus 9.9 degrees Celsius. While Kalpa in Kinnaur district recorded 17 cm snowfall, Kufri registered one cm. The minimum temperatures in Kufri and Dalhousie were recorded at 1.5 degrees Celsius and 3.4 degrees Celsius respectively while the highest temperature recorded on Thursday was in Una at 27 degrees Celsius. Further north, Kashmir experienced a dry but cold weather on Friday with Pahalgam tourist resort in Anantnag district being the coldest recorded place at minus 6.5 degrees Celsius. A MeT Department official said while the day temperature was almost around the normal for this part of the season at most of the places, the minimum settled several degrees below the normal at many places. Srinagar, which recorded a minimum of 0.5 degrees Celsius, was the only place in the Kashmir valley where the night temperature settled above the freezing point. The MeT office has forecast mainly dry weather in Jammu and Kashmir till December 1. In Punjab and Haryana, the minimum temperatures hovered above normal limits with Chandigarh, the common capital of the two states, recording a low of 9.1 degrees Celsius, one notch above normal. In Haryana, Ambala recorded a low of 9.9  degrees Celsius, up two notches against normal while Karnal recorded a low of 9.4 degrees Celsius. Amritsar in Punjab recorded a low of 7.7 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal. Meanwhile, there was some relief from cold conditions in parts of Rajasthan, including Jaipur, as the sky cleared compared to the day before. On Thursday night, Mount Abu, the only hill station in the state, recorded a minimum temperature of 3.4 degrees Celsius. According to the weather office, light to moderate fog is likely to occur anywhere on November 27-28, whereas during November 28-30, cold wave is also likely to revive in the northern parts of the state. In Uttar Pradesh, very light rain was recorded at isolated places over western parts while the weather remained dry in the eastern region with shallow to moderate fog at isolated places The day temperatures were markedly below normal in the Agra division, appreciably below normal in the Jhansi division, below normal in Gorakhpur, Kanpur, Bareilly, Moradabad divisions and normal in the remaining divisions of the state. Allahabad recorded the highest maximum temperature at 28.3 degrees Celsius, while the lowest minimum temperature at 8.6 degrees Celsius was recorded in Banda. In the south, the regional weather office said a low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal on November 30 could bring more rains to Tamil Nadu and Puducherry from December 1. The forecast for more rains for the southern state and the union territory comes after severe cyclonic storm 'Nivar' made landfall between Tamil Nadu and Puducherry early on Thursday, bringing sharp showers. At least three people were killed in Tamil Nadu in rain-related incidents like wall and tree collapse, while over a thousand trees were uprooted. Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai, S Balachandran said , the system was likely to intensify into a depression later. "A low pressure area is likely to form over southeast Bay of Bengal during the next 48 hours. It is very likely to intensify into a depression on November 30 and move towards the Tamil Nadu coast. As a result, there will be widespread rains in Tamil Nadu and neighbouring Puducherry from December 1-3, he said. He also forecast light to moderate rains in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry for the next two days in some places. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said extremely heavy rainfall was also recorded at isolated places over Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh while rain/thundershowers were observed at most places over coastal Andhra Pradesh and Rayalseema, a few places over Telangana and at isolated places over sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, Jharkhand, East Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh among others. The IMD has predicted heavy rainfall at isolated places over coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam and Andaman and Nicobar Islands while it has said thunderstorm with lightning may occur at isolated places over Rayalseema, Kerala & Mahe and Coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cold-conditions-prevail-in-north-india-tamil-nadu-puducherry-likely-to-receive-more-rainfall-next-week-920788.html

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the grit and determination of the Indian farmers cannot be broken by the use of force. "Lakhs of our annadatas are knocking PM Modi to listen. He doesn’t even take cognisance. Instead feeds his vanity deepening people’s misery & intensifying pandemic spread," he tweeted. “Swelling farmers protests braving severe repression does not move callous Modi government over urgency for new laws to protect the kisan entitlements,” Yechury said. Thousands of farmers gathered at various entry points into the national capital were allowed in on Friday to hold a peaceful protest at a north Delhi ground, defusing some of the tension building up since morning around the city's edges and beyond. The concession came after hours of a standoff that saw police using teargas shells, water cannons and multi-layer barriers to block the protesters and the farmers pelting stones and breaking barricades in some places in their determination to push through as part of their 'Delhi Chalo' march. CPI MP Binoy Viswam said the use of tear gas, water cannons, lathi charge and other excesses by the police forces against the farmers was "yet another example of the way this government suppresses democratic voices and stifles dissent." "Their actions cannot be condoned and are an anathema to the Indian Constitution. After their (the three laws) passing, protests have raged across various parts of the country and numerous representations have met with the government, only to be met with empty promises. The protests that are currently centred around Delhi are a direct response to the anti-people, anti-democratic and fascist stance of the ruling party,” he said in a statement. CPI general secretary D Raja too condemned the police action on the farmers and said the Haryana government and Delhi Police under the Home Ministry should be criticised for their "high-handed manner". "We continue to stand in support of the farmers of this country. If the farmers have any grievances, they have the right to come to the capital city of this country,” he said. Viswam alleged that the government had forgotten that the Constitution gives a guarantee to peacefully protest and was using every tactic to “de-legitimise and quash” the farmers’ movement. “The farmers' march to Delhi has foiled the BJP design to paint the farmers' agitation as an 'opposition conspiracy'. Sikh farmers from Congress-ruled Punjab and Hindu farmers from BJP-ruled Haryana and UP are together in this resistance,” Dipankar Bhattacharya, the general secretary of the CPI(ML), said. After facing tear gas, water cannons and clashing with security personnel, hundreds of farmers entered the national capital on Friday to hold a peaceful protest at a north Delhi ground, but there were still thousands at border points who were undecided to go to the identified demonstration site and a clarity in their decision is expected on Saturday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/left-parties-condemn-police-action-on-protesting-farmers-ask-centre-to-roll-back-laws-920798.html
28-11-2020||National||DH Deciphers | How effective are Covid-19 vaccines and when will India get them?||The news of the high efficacy of four Covid-19 vaccines in the last two weeks has generated hopes at a time when the pandemic has infected more than 93 lakh Indians and killed over 135,000 of them. But notwithstanding the promises, Covid-19 shots are unlikely to be available to the people immediately as there are multiple hurdles that need to be overcome. Here's what you need to know:    How many Covid-19 vaccines are available now?  While vaccine development usually takes years, the global emergency caused by the coronavirus has greatly expedited the process in the last 12 months. Forty-eight vaccine candidates are in clinical trials, including 11 under phase III. (Under Phase I, the vaccine is usually tried out on 30-50 people to check safety; Phase II involves a larger trial to evaluate immune response while Phase III usually involves tens of thousands of people to examine if a vaccine is really protecting people from the infection.)  Early results from vaccines developed by BioNTech-Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca-Oxford University and Russia’s Sputnik V have shown promises. An Indian vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech is in Phase III trial while a second one from Zydus Cadila is undergoing clinical evaluation. Hyderabad-based Biological Evans will also launch the trial of a vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson.  How promising are the early results?  BioNTech-Pfizer, Moderna and Sputnik V vaccines claimed more than 90% efficacy while AstraZeneca claimed 70% efficacy. But even the AstraZeneca vaccine was seen to be 90% effective under a specific dose regimen. The problem, however, is that these are based on interim data as technical details on the trial protocols and findings have not been published in any peer-reviewed journal. (Peer review is the evaluation of a scientific work by others working in the same field). Since the devil always lies in the details, a clearer picture of the vaccine efficacy would emerge when the publications appear.     When would the vaccine be available in India? That's difficult to say even though Adar Poonawalla, the CEO of the Serum Institute of India, promised to make 100 million doses (of the AstraZeneca vaccine) available to India by late December 2020 or early January 2021. He also promised 400 million doses by July 2021. The government plans to use these doses for emergency use for doctors, healthcare workers and some of the vulnerable people. India is, however, yet to finalise the pathway to the emergency user authorisation. Once it is finalised, the SII will have to apply for EAU approval for its vaccine. While the timeline for public access to the vaccine remains unclear, researchers estimated that it may take up to two years to vaccinate nearly 800 million Indians in order to reach herd immunity. Which vaccine would be used in India? The AstraZeneca is the best bet at the moment despite its somewhat lower efficacy because it is easier to transport using India’s existing cold chain network, and the manufacturer has made a commitment to make 50% of its capacity available to India. The next best options are Sputnik-V and Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila products, subject to the trial outcomes. The Moderna and Pfizer shots are unlikely to come to India in the near future because of their: (a) high cost (b) ultra-low cooling requirement for storage and (c) pre-booking of their entire stock by the rich nations. The USA has promised Pfizer a $1.95 billion contract for 100 million doses, which would mean the company’s entire production capacity for 2020 and another 50 million in 2021. The US booked 800 million doses so far whereas the UK with a population of 67 million pre-booked 325 million doses. Australia with less than 30 million population pre-booked 84 million doses.  Does India have adequate infrastructure to roll out an adult vaccine to such a large population? The infrastructure at the moment is inadequate. Currently, there are 28,000 cold chain points and 700 plus refrigeration vans. The government is in talks with the private sector for additional cold chain facilities. State governments have also been asked to prep up their cold chain network. Also, there are 70,000 plus trained vaccine-givers but efforts are underway to find out more people to administer the two-dose vaccine. How much would the vaccine cost in India?  For a two-dose regimen, the AstraZeneca vaccine would cost $8. Poonawalla said he would sell the vaccine at Rs 1,000 while talks are on with the health ministry to fix a procurement rate for the government. Sputnik-V will cost less than $20 for two doses while Moderna and Pfizer products will cost $30 and $39, respectively.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dh-deciphers-how-effective-are-covid-19-vaccines-and-when-will-india-get-them-920799.html

It is learnt that the virtual summit is expected to focus on further strengthening trade, economic and cultural cooperation among the eight member nations of the influential grouping. For the first time, India is hosting the summit of the council of heads of government of the SCO. India and Pakistan became permanent members of the SCO in 2017. The other member nations of the SCO are Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The SCO summit of the Council of Heads of State is considered as the main annual event. It was hosted by Russia on November 10 in the virtual format and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had participated in it. The SCO, seen as a counterweight to NATO, has emerged as one of the largest transregional international organisations. Apart from the member states, delegations from four observer states, Afghanistan, Belarus, Iran and Mongolia, are also expected to participate in the summit. It is understood that Naidu will chair the summit. At the end of the summit, the bloc is expected to issue a joint communique containing major proposals of member states on issues of trade and economic cooperation. In the course of India's chairmanship of the SCO council of heads of government in 2020, it has particularly focused on creating three new pillars of cooperation: startups and innovation, science and technology and traditional medicine.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/vice-president-naidu-expected-to-chair-sco-heads-of-government-summit-on-november-30-920823.html

According to the state Congress leadership, Gandhi enquired about the seat-sharing deal between the two parties. During the meeting, the entire state Congress leadership favoured the partys alliance with the Left, but opinions of senior members differed over seat-sharing. Some members said that the party should take a cue from the just-concluded polls in Bihar, where it managed to win only 19 out of the 70 seats it contested, before arriving at any decision. We have told Rahul Gandhi ji that the entire state unit is keen on forging an alliance with the Left, but seat- sharing talks were yet to start. The Left-Congress alliance in Bengal is the best possible option for defeating the TMC and the BJP," a senior party leader said. Another leader, who was also a part of the meeting, said, "Some were of the opinion that the party had contested 92 seats during the 2016 polls, and the number shouldn't go down this time. Others said it would be wise to concentrate on areas where the party has a significant support base." Both Gandhi and general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal gave the state unit leaders a patient hearing, and gave assurances that they would apprise party president Sonia Gandhi about the development, he added. In 2016, both the Left and the grand old party had fought together and bagged 76 seats in the 294-member assembly. The CPI(M)-led Left Front later walked out of the alliance. During the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the two sides failed to reach an agreement on seat sharing. After their dismal performance last year, with the Congress bagging two Lok Sabha seats and the CPI(M) drawing a blank, the two sides have now decided to stitch an alliance again for 2021 polls, likely to be held in April-May.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rahul-gandhi-holds-virtual-meet-with-bengal-leaders-to-discuss-left-cong-alliance-for-2021-polls-920828.html

The state cabinet had given its approval to the ordinance on Tuesday. Although the Ordinance nowhere uses the term 'Love Jihad', the BJP leaders have maintained that it is a law to prevent what they allege ''rising cases of Hindu girls being lured through fraudulent ways into marriage by Muslim youths''.  The Ordinance provides for a maximum of ten years imprisonment besides a fine of Rs 15,000 for violators. In case of minor girls and women from SC and ST communities, the minimum imprisonment would be of two years while the maximum imprisonment will be for ten years besides a fine of Rs 25,000. Three years of minimum and ten years of maximum imprisonment had been provided for mass religious conversion. A fine of Rs 50,000 would also be imposed on the offenders. It puts the religious conversion under certain situations under the category of an offence. According to the Ordinance religious conversion, if done under duress, force, allurement or any other fraudulent means or for the purpose of marriage would be an offence.  It also provides for cancellation of registration of certain social organisations, allegedly involved in mass religious conversion.  The onus of proving that the religious conversion had not been undertaken through the means mentioned under the law would be on the person converting and the one, who was getting him converted. If the conversion was done for the purpose of marriage only then such marriages would be declared as void under this law.  Anyone wanting to convert on one's own volition to marry would have to compulsorily give an application in this regard to the concerned district magistrate two months in advance. Some other states, including Haryana and Madhya Pradesh, were also contemplating making a similar law to deal with 'Love Jihad'.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/uttar-pradesh-governor-promulgates-love-jihad-law-920887.html

The 83-year-old was arrested from his residence in Ranchi on October 8 for his alleged involvement in the Elgar Parishad case and is lodged at the Taloja Jail in Mumbai. The National Platform for the Rights of the Disabled's reaction came after a special court in Mumbai on Thursday again rejected Swamy's application for a straw and sipper, and sought a response from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on his request. The court will hear the matter on December 4. The agency had earlier this month sought 20 days time to respond to the activist's request for a straw and sipper, and had said it did not take these items from Swamy during his arrest, as claimed by the activist. "The painful wait that Swamy will have to endure for a sipper cannot be tolerated any longer. December 4, when the very same court decides again, is seven days away. Stan cannot be refused fluids for such a long period. The NPRD and its affiliating units have therefore decided to send sippers to the jailor of Taloja Jail, Maharashtra, to be given to Stan Swamy," the NPRD said in a statement. It also appealed to all disability rights organisations, activists and all those who seek justice for the activist and stand in defence of his rights to join this campaign and send sippers to Swamy. "It took 20 long days for the NIA to come up with a claim that they did not seize these items from Stan's possession. Even if we accept the NIA's contention, the special court should have taken a humanitarian view and ordered that he be provided with an utensil that would assist him in intaking fluids including water. The refusal to do so is atrocious to say the least," the NPRD said. Swamy is a person living with Parkinson's disease, which is a condition recognised as disabling as per the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, it said and expressed outrage at the continued denial of a sipper and straw to the activist. The NPRD said that "as per various laws and international conventions to which India is a signatory, it is obligatory that Stan Swamy be provided with requisite age and disability appropriate requirements, assistive aids including straws and sippers as also human care assistance". "Denial of the same constitutes a violation of his basic rights," it said. Swamy, was arrested for his alleged role inciting mob violence in Koregaon Bhima near Pune in Maharashtra on January 1, 2018.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nprd-to-send-sipper-to-taloja-jail-for-stan-swamy-urges-other-organisations-to-do-same-920921.html

In a statement, it said the Guild was "perturbed by the unprovoked" advisory from the Press Council, which swears by self-regulation of the media and believes that any government interference would be destructive to press freedom.  "Through its advisory...(Press Council) is lending its weight towards a step that could bring in some form of censorship and punitive actions against those organisations that publish content, which in its view is seen as not desirable," the Guild said. It noted that the advisory did not specify who will verify the content, the criteria of verification and "most importantly", what does "unregulated circulation" mean. "Many publications in the country license and reproduce content from foreign agencies, newspapers, and periodicals, which is a prerogative of the editor, and who is in any case responsible for all the content published in their publication. A reiteration by the Council at this juncture of this established practice, in an ominous-sounding advisory, has disturbing implications," the statement said. The Press Council had on November 25 issued the advisory asking Indian media to publish content from foreign publications only after due verification and warned that they will be held responsible for the reportage irrespective of from where it sourced the article. The advisory came after the Press Council considered references received "by the government" from various quarters about the "responsibility of Indian newspapers in publishing foreign content".

The Mental Healthcare Act, which came into effect in July 2018, had made attempt to die by suicide punishable only in limited circumstances but it has not led to the repeal of the IPC provision. The Narendra Modi government had in 2014 told Parliament that at least 18 states had supported the idea of repealing Section 309 from the IPC but nothing much has happened after that except for the mention in the Mental Healthcare Act. The issue had seen a changing of positions on the validity of Section 309. The Law Commission and the Supreme Court had gone back and forth on the issue and finally, nine years ago, the apex court favoured repealing Section 309 and left it to the Parliament to decide on the issue. According to Section 115(1) of the Mental Healthcare Act, "notwithstanding anything contained in Section 309 of the IPC,  any person who attempts to commit suicide shall be presumed, unless proved otherwise, to have severe stress and shall not be tried and punished under the said Code." Section 115(2) says that the appropriate government shall have a duty to provide care, treatment and rehabilitation to a person, having severe stress and who attempted to commit suicide, to reduce the risk of recurrence of attempt to commit suicide. However, activists and legal experts feel that there is very little clarity in the Act, especially on the definition of "severe stress". The Act also does not provide blanket protection from Section 309. According to Section 309 of the IPC, "whoever attempts to commit suicide and does any act towards the commission of such offence, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine, or with both." There has been a demand for removing Section 309 for a long time with the 42nd Law Commission report in 1971 opining that the provision was "harsh and unjustifiable" and recommended repealing it. However, the 156th report of the Law Commission argued against repealing the Section.  In 2008, the 210th report of the Law Commission went back to the 1971 position, when it said, "Section 309 needs to be effaced from the statute book because the provision is inhuman, irrespective of whether it is constitutional or unconstitutional. The repeal of the anachronistic law contained in section 309 of the Indian Penal Code would save many lives and relieve the distress of his suffering." A Bill was even passed by Rajya Sabha in 1978 to repeal Section 309 but it could not pass the Lok Sabha hurdle as Parliament was dissolved soon. The issue has been a matter of debate in the higher judiciary. In 1985, the Delhi High Court said that the continuance of Section 309 was an "anachronism unworthy of a humane society like ours" and "medical clinics for such social misfits certainly but police and prison never" while upholding acquittal of a man by a trial court. However, it did not examine the constitutional validity of the provision.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/people-who-attempt-to-die-by-suicide-continue-to-face-criminal-charges-under-section-309-920942.html

The agency is probing Agrawal, his family members and others in connection with a money laundering case linked to charges of alleged corruption and disproportionate assets. "The attached assets include plant and machinery, balances in bank accounts and immovable properties of Babulal Agarwal and his family members," the ED said in a statement. The total value of the attached properties is Rs 27.86 crore, it said. Agrawal, a 1988-batch Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, was arrested by the agency from his residence in state capital Raipur on November 9 and he is in judicial custody till December 5. He has served as a principal secretary in the Chhattisgarh government and has been arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) also in the past on charges of corruption. Agrawal was suspended by the state government after the CBI arrested him. It was alleged that Agrawal wanted to "settle" CBI probes against him which were registered in 2010 when he was the health secretary in the state government. When the ED arrested him earlier this month, it said the action was taken against Agrawal for "laundering the proceeds generated out of criminal offences through shell companies and integrating the same in the business of his family members." The ED had said its criminal case filed against Agrawal, his chartered accountant (CA) Sunil Agrawal and others was filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after studying a 2010 FIR of the Chhattisgarh anti-corruption bureau and the CBI. Plant and machinery worth Rs 26.16 crore, Rs 20.43 lakh kept in 291 bank accounts, a residential plot worth Rs 39.52 lakh in the name of a firm, Xpress Mining Pvt Ltd, which is an entity owned and operated by family members of Babulal Agrawal, and Rs 15 lakh cash recovered during I-T searches are among the provisionally attached assets. The attached assets also include Rs 4.75 lakh kept in the bank account of a company called Capstone and a residential plot worth Rs 10.25 lakh in the name of a firm identified as Shri Ram Vihar (both partnership firms owned and operated by family members of the former IAS officer), and Rs 39.81 lakh cash and two kgs gold recovered by the CBI when it raided him. The alleged corruption and disproportionate assets case against the former bureaucrat first came to light after the Income Tax (I-T) department raided him in February, 2010. The ED had said it was found in the probe that Babulal Agrawal "played an active role for splitting the tender contracts related to the World Bank aided Malaria control program and awarding them to some non-existing entities and thereby, causing loss to the exchequer and pecuniary benefit to himself." The ED has also alleged that the former bureaucrat, in connivance with his CA Sunil Agrawal, his brother Ashok Agrawal and Pawan Agrawal, opened "more than 400 bank accounts in the name of gullible villagers of Kharora and its nearby villages and cash to the tune of about Rs 46 crore was deposited." This cash, the ED alleged, was "laundered" through shell or dummy companies opened by Agrawal's CA and other entities, which was ultimately parked in a company identified as Prime Ispat Ltd, Raipur, as an investment in shares. The ED has earlier attached properties to the tune of Rs 36.09 crore which includes assets of Prime Ispat Ltd, Raipur and the properties of the former IAS. Sunil Agrawal was also arrested by the ED in this case earlier.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ed-attaches-assets-worth-over-rs-27-crore-of-former-ias-officer-920943.html

The latest organisation to come under this category is the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) as its chief Rajesh Ranjan is set to retire this month-end and the Union home ministry has given the "additional charge" of the post to SSB director general Kumar Rajesh Chandra "till the joining of regular DG, CISF or untill further orders, whichever is earlier" as per an order issued on November 26. Similarly, the charge of the federal counter-terrorist force NSG, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and the central police think tank -- Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) -- is being rendered in additional capacities by various Indian Police Service (IPS) officers. Indo-Tibetan Border Police chief S S Deswal is handling the "additional charge" of the National Security Guard since incumbent A K Singh retired on September 30. Border Security Force (BSF) chief Rakesh Asthana is holding the additional charge of NCB since July last year after incumbent DG Abhay was appointed as the Director of Hyderabad-based Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy. Abhay, who goes by his first name, is now serving as the DG of Odisha Police. Special secretary (internal security) V S K Kaumudi is holding the additional charge of BPRD since August after he was appointed to the present post in the Union home ministry. Official sources in the ministry said the regular appointments to these posts will take place after the meeting of the ACC, that is expected to be held soon.

He also hit out at Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, claiming that despite wanting to talk to him over the issue, he did not respond even when telephone calls to his office were made for three days. Claiming a “conspiracy”, Khattar told reporters in Gurgaon that officials in the Punjab Chief Minister's Office are “giving directions” to the protesting farmers from Punjab. The stir has been build up by farmers from Punjab and some political parties and organisations are “sponsoring” it, he said. Khattar claimed that Haryana farmers have not participated in the stir. “For this, I want to thank Haryana farmers,” he said. “I also appreciate the Haryana Police that for past 2-3 days since this issue (Delhi Chalo march) started, they exercised restraint and did not use any force,” he said. The CM alleged that some people are grinding their own political axe, which needs to be condemned. When asked if he tried to speak to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh before the farmers' march, Khattar said, “My office told me that they tried to contact him over telephone on six to seven occasions and every time his staff used to say we will soon get back and then they used to give the plea that the CM was busy in a meeting and so on.” “But it was a very strange situation that the chief minister of a state wants to talk to his counterpart of other state but is unable to get through after so many attempts. For six years, I have been a CM. Never before such a thing has happened. We even talk to opposition leaders. Earlier too, I have been having telephone conversations with the Punjab CM and even when he was busy, he used to call back after 30 or 60 minutes. This time for three days attempts to reach him were made, but he didn't respond,” alleged Khattar. Alleging a conspiracy, he said “card holders” (officials) in the Punjab CM’s office have been directing protesters. Replying to a question, Khattar asserted that farmers should talk to the Centre. “There is no purpose of bringing large gatherings to Delhi. We appealed to Punjab farmers that their representatives could come and talk. Farmers must talk to the Centre, that is the only way forward,” he said. Meanwhile, Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij in Ambala said, “Farmers from the rest of the country have accepted the new farm laws but in Punjab due to political reasons and Amarinder Singh's engineering, they are holding a stir.” He hoped that farmers will soon realise that the laws are for their benefit.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/march-against-farm-laws-political-parties-sponsoring-farmers-stir-claims-haryana-cm-khattar-920991.html

The Congress also said it would have been better if the prime minister talked to the protesting farmers instead of getting "himself photographed in corporate offices". Farmers from Punjab and Haryana continued their protests against the new farm laws, with many of them blocking traffic on the national highway after the police stopped them from their 'Chalo Delhi' march. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala accused Modi of getting pictures clicked in corporate offices while farmers are protesting on Delhi roads. "Wish the PM talks to farmers on the road instead of flying in the aircraft," he said in a tweet, after Modi visited a company in Ahmedabad which is engaged in the COVID-19 vaccine research. Another spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi claimed whoever protests against the Modi government is "deemed a terrorist". "Poor farmers from Punjab pointing out genuine grievances have been labelled khalistani. Why doesn't Modi come out and address the Annadata however, only demands of them during elections," he tweeted. Whoever protests against the Modi Govt is deemed a terrorist. Poor farmers from Punjab pointing out genuine grievances have been labelled khalistani. Why doesn't Modi come out & address the Ann data however, only demands of them during elections? Party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also tweeted similar pictures of farmers being prevented by the police from marching towards Delhi, where they wish to hold a protest against the new farm laws. She said it is right if the government frames laws against farmers, but it is wrong when farmers wish to make their voice heard in Delhi. "Look at the state of affairs in the BJP government. When super rich friends of the BJP come to Delhi, a red carpet is laid to welcome them, but the roads are being dug up when farmers wish to enter Delhi," she said in a tweet in Hindi. Thousands of farmers protesting the Centre's new agri laws stayed put at the Singhu and Tikri border points for the third consecutive day on Saturday amid heavy police presence even after being offered a north Delhi ground to hold peaceful demonstrations. Numbers swelled at the Singhu border point as farmers gathered there were joined by more counterparts from Punjab and Haryana and they refused to move towards the Sant Nirankari Ground, one of the biggest in the national capital.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/soldier-standing-against-farmer-due-to-pms-arrogance-rahul-hits-out-congress-says-modi-must-talk-to-farmers-921020.html

The method -- Dry Swab-Direct RT-PCR -- developed by CSIR's Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, is a variation of the existing gold standard RT-PCR method and can easily scale up the testing by 2 to 3 fold with no new investment of resources. "After evaluating this method and finding an overall concordance of 96.9 per cent, ICMR has now issued an advisory for the use of CSIR-CCMB dry swab method, considering its lesser cost and quick turn-around time," the CSIR said. The CCMB has been testing samples for coronavirus since April. Having worked closely with healthcare workers of Telangana, it identified some of the key issues that slow the testing process. In response to it, the researchers developed the Dry Swab RNA-extraction free testing method for Covid-19. The Dry Swab-Direct RT-PCR method involves collecting and transporting the nasal swab in dry state, as opposed to using the viral transport medium VTM, which makes the transportation and handling of the samples easy and less prone to spillage and spread of infection.  Secondly, the step of RNA isolation from the sample is omitted and involves only simple processing of the sample followed by direct RT-PCR using the kit recommended by the ICMR.  "Omitting the step of RNA isolation offers a huge benefit over the conventional method, as the RNA isolation is a major bottleneck in terms of time, cost and trained manpower. Given this, with the same resources and no additional cost, more samples can be tested and can be easily scaled up at least 2-3 times immediately," the CSIR said. Rakesh Mishra, director, CCMB said RNA extraction, even with automation, takes four hours for roughly 500 samples. "VTM and RNA extraction both add a significant burden on money and time required for mass testing for coronavirus. We believe the technique's merit holds for all kinds of settings and has the potential of bringing the costs and time of testing by 40-50 per cent," the CSIR said. CSIR director-general Shekhar Mande said the Dry-Swab Direct RT-PCR method is cost-effective, easy to implement with no requirement of new kits and existing manpower can perform this with no additional training and hence could make a significant contribution to ramping up the testing capacity in the country quickly.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/icmr-approves-csirs-covid-19-testing-method-that-can-help-ramp-up-number-of-rt-pcr-tests-921021.html

As of now, the SII is producing 50 to 60 million doses and they would scale it up to 100 million doses a month by January 2021. “As of now, we don't have anything in writing with the Government of  India on how many doses they will purchase but the indication is that the need would be around 300-400 million doses by July 2021,” SII Chief Executive Officer Adar Poonawalla said during an online press conference. The statement came minutes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the SII facility of the world’s largest vaccine maker in Hadapsar in Pune during his day-long pan-India review of the vaccine development programme which also involved meetings at Zydus Biotech Park in Ahmedabad and Bharat Biotech Facility in Hyderabad. During his visit, the production and implementation plan was discussed with the Prime Minister, Poonawalla said. “The Prime Minister has very good knowledge on vaccines and vaccine production…there was very little to be explained to him,” he said. At SII, the Prime Minister was received by founder-Chairman Cyrus Poonawalla, Adar and his wife Natasha, who is the Exective Director of SII and  Chairperson of the Villoo Poonawalla Foundation. Adar said that the priority for SII is India. “Covishield vaccine will be distributed initially in India, then we will look at the COVAX countries which are mainly in Africa. The UK and European markets are being taken care of by AstraZeneca and Oxford. Our priority is India and COVAX countries,” he said. On the issue of ramping up vaccine production, he said: “We have built the largest pandemic level facility in Pune and our new campus in Mandri. That was also showcased to the Prime Minister with a tour around the facility and a lot of detailed discussions of the plans ahead.” Adar noted that at the moment the trails are enough for the efficacy. “There was a bit of confusion in the communication which will be explained.

In a joint statement, the leaders reiterated their opposition to the three controversial farm laws, which they said threaten India's food security, abolish Minimum Support Price, destroy agriculture and farmers. Besides NCP chief Pawar, CPI(M) General Secretary Yechury and his CPI counterpart Raja, the statement was signed by DMK Treasurer T R Baalu, CPI(ML) General Secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya, Forward Bloc's Debabrata Biswas, RSP's Manoj Bhattacharya and RJD's Manoj K Jha. Though in support of the farmers, no Congress leader has signed the joint statement. They said the Narendra Modi government must adhere to the democratic process and norms and address the concerns of the protesting farmers. A large number of farmers have gathered in the national capital as part of a protest against the farm laws, braving baton-charge and water canons while entering Delhi. "Braving severe repression, tear-gassing, heavy water cannoning, roadblocks, police barricades and digging up the national highways surrounding Delhi akin to waging a war on our farmers, tens of thousands of farmers have successfully reached the national capital of Delhi," they said. "We salute their determination and courage in this massive protest demanding the withdrawal of the retrograde anti-farmer agriculture laws," they said. The leaders were of the view that the Centre was "forced" to relent and reverse its earlier decision of preventing the farmers from reaching Delhi to peacefully voice their protest. On Friday, the government had allowed farmers to gather at Nirankari Grounds in north Delhi's Burari. "This ground, however, is too small for the tens of thousands that have reached Delhi. We...demand that a larger ground like Ramlila Maidan or similar must be allotted for this peaceful protest and all necessary arrangements must be made for their stay and food," they added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/action-against-farmers-akin-to-waging-war-against-them-say-opposition-leaders-921027.html

In an obituary ‘Farewell Ahmed’ in Congress mouthpiece ‘National Herald’, Gandhi described Patel, her political secretary for 16 years, as among those rare individuals who preferred to remain in the background and let others take credit. “Ever since I myself became Congress President, he was at my side as a most trusted colleague, as someone I could always turn to for advice and counsel, as someone who I could depend upon without any questions being asked, to do the right thing by the Congress Party,” she said. Gandhi noted that Patel has been called troubleshooter and crisis manager. “He was indeed that and much more. He was a sounding board. He was a confidant. All this makes his untimely passing a matter of the greatest anguish,” she said. The Congress President’s glowing tribute to Patel has come at a time when the party is in a disarray with senior leaders such as Ghulam Nabi Azad, Kapil Sibal, Anand Sharma and others forming a ginger group within the party, calling for sweeping changes in the organisation. The ginger group has become a target of the Gandhi family loyalists, who have asked them to quit the party if they cannot follow the discipline and continue to air internal issues in public. “We are all destined to depart sometime or the other but Ahmed has been snatched away from us very cruelly at a time when he was most needed.

Serum Institute of India (SII), which has partnered with the British drugmaker to conduct trials on its COVISHIELD vaccine in India and produce the vaccine candidate if it secures approval, plans to apply for an emergency use licence for the vaccine in the next two weeks, said SII's Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla. "This vaccine is a very good one," said Poonawalla, via a virtual press briefing following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to SII's campus on Saturday. "What we found with COVISHIELD in its global trial is there were zero hospitalisations, which means even if you do get infected you're not going to have a severe attack and secondly even those who got the disease were not infecting others," he said. Poonawalla's comments come as a boost to AstraZeneca after some scientists raised doubts about the robustness of results showing the shot was 90% effective in a sub-group of trial participants who, by error initially, received a half dose followed by a full dose. He also noted that the AstraZeneca vaccine, along with the vaccine from Novavax - the US vaccine developer that SII has also partnered with - offered a significant edge over the vaccine candidates of certain rivals, which need to be stored at much lower temperatures. "Both our vaccine candidates can be stored in 2 Celsius to 8 Celsius and India has lot of storage and infrastructure for that temperature range. It has slightly less storage capacity for -20 C and almost nothing for -70 C," said Poonawalla. US vaccine developers Moderna and Pfizer recently announced strong efficacy results on their respective vaccine candidates, but both of their vaccines need to be stored at very low temperatures that would present challenges for many developing economies. Moderna has said its vaccine can be stored at normal fridge temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius for 30 days and it can be stored for up to 6 months at -20C. Pfizer's experimental vaccine must be stored at -70C over longer durations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/serum-institute-ceo-adar-poonawalla-sees-astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-as-very-good-candidate-921063.html

Doval arrived here on Friday for a trilateral maritime dialogue among India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. He took part in the dialogue, held after 6 years, along with Sri Lankan Defence Secretary Major Gen (Retd.) Kamal Gunaratne and Maldivian Defence Minister Mariya Didi on Saturday. "Had a fruitful discussion with Shri @Ajitdovalkumar, NSA #India this evening. National Sec, Sec in the Indian Ocean, new Indian investments, continuation of infrastructure proj. & strengthening bilateral relations between #SriLanka & #India were the areas discussed at the meeting," President Gotabaya tweeted. "NSA Ajit Doval called on President Gotabaya Rajapaksa & had a productive discussion. NSA Doval expressed hope that the India-Sri Lanka bilateral relationship would diversify and deepen further under the strong leadership of PM @narendramodi and President @GotabayaR @MEAIndia," the High Commission of India here said in a tweet. On the first day of his visit, Doval met Sri Lankan Defence Secretary Gunaratne and they agreed on several steps to further strengthen the "valuable" cooperation between the two countries which also contributes to peace and security in the region. He also called on Prime Minister and elder brother of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Mahinda Rajapaksa, and conveyed greetings from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mahinda Rajapaksa asked the senior Indian official for continued assistance to Sri Lanka in its bilateral help, the prime minister's office said on Friday. The high-level trilateral meeting is designed to initiate collective action on maritime security including maritime domain awareness, legal regimes, train in search and rescue, maritime pollution response, information sharing, curbing piracy drugs arms and contraband trafficking in the Indian Ocean region. This is Doval’s second official visit to Sri Lanka this year. In January, he visited the island nation and discussed a range of bilateral issues, including strengthening cooperation in defence, intelligence sharing and maritime security with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nsa-ajit-doval-calls-on-sri-lankan-president-gotabaya-rajapaksa-921068.html

The three men who were spotted on the road outside during Modi's visit were carrying posters seeking the release of the godman who has been convicted in a case of rape. But before they could display the posters, the police took them in custody, an official of Hadapsar police station said. "They would be released after initiating a preventive action against them," he added. Asaram was convicted in April 2018 on charges of raping a teenage student at his ashram.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/asarams-followers-detained-outside-sii-during-pm-modis-visit-921071.html
28-11-2020||National||Chinese scientists now say India is origin of coronavirus||In what has been a fresh development in the India-China rivalry and the Covid-19 pandemic, a team from China’s top science institution, Chinese Academy of Sciences in a paper argues that SARS-CoV-2 likely originated in India in summer of 2019. The scientists claim that Wuhan is the place where the first human to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 happened. Before the virus had spread to Wuhan, it had already seen some evolution in previous transmission between humans, says the paper, adding that, the least mutated strain’s geographic information and strain diversity suggest that the Indian subcontinent might be the place where the first human to human transmission of the virus occurred, a few months prior to the Wuhan outbreak. This is not the first time China has blamed other countries for being the point of origin of the virus. Earlier, they had pointed fingers at Italy and the US as the first sites of infection. The paper, which has not been peer-reviewed yet, uses a method called phylogenetic analysis, a technique where scientists study the mutation of the virus to trace the origins of Covid-19. According to the analysis, the method rules out Wuhan as a site of origin of the Coronavirus but nominates Bangladesh, the US, Greece, Australia, India, Italy, Czech Republic, Russia and Serbia as potential countries.  The team, however, says that since India and Bangladesh recorded the lowest number of mutations and are neighbours, it is possible that the Indian subcontinent is where the first transmission happened. Estimating the time it takes for the virus to mutate and comparing that time to the samples taken in the region, they also claimed that the virus first emerged in July or August 2019 in the region. They add, “From May to June 2019, the second-longest recorded heat-wave had rampaged in northern-central India and Pakistan, which created a serious water crisis in this region. The water shortage made wild animals, such as monkeys, engage in the deadly fight over water among each other and would have surely increased the chance of human-wild animal interactions.” Blaming a 'less efficient' healthcare system and 'imperfect' hygiene conditions, the Chinese scientists say, “As known for all, the hygiene condition is imperfect and the public medical system is less efficient in the subcontinent. Thus, it is conceivable that a virus with flu-like symptom could spread undetectably for several months there.” This comes in the backdrop of a long-drawn-out stand-off between Indian and Chinese armed forces along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh which has led to strained relations between both the countries.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/chinese-scientists-now-say-india-is-origin-of-coronavirus-921072.html
28-11-2020||National||Sri Lanka, Maldives agree to broad-base maritime security cooperation with India||Notwithstanding China’s bid to woo them into its orbit of influence, Sri Lanka and the Maldives on Saturday agreed to broad-base trilateral maritime security cooperation with India to help keep watch on the Indian Ocean region. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Sri Lankan Defence Secretary Kamal Gunaratne and Maldivian Defence Minister Mariya Didi took part in a trilateral meeting on maritime security cooperation in Colombo. They exchanged views on common security threats and “agreed to broad-base cooperation by expanding the scope to improve intelligence sharing”, according to a joint statement. Senior officials of two other Indian Ocean nations — Mauritius and Seychelles — also virtually participated in the meeting as observers. Doval, Gunaratne and Mariya Didi “took stock of the current maritime security environment in the region and discussed mutual cooperation in the areas of maritime domain awareness, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, joint exercises, capacity building, maritime security and threats”. They agreed to further strengthen cooperation in dealing with the challenges, “to ensure peace and security in the region for common benefit”. Though India took the lead in institutionalising trilateral talks maritime security cooperation with Sri Lanka and the Maldives in 2011, no meeting was held after the third and the last in March 2014. The meeting held in Colombo on Saturday was the fourth and was held after a gap of six years, amid an intense contest between India and China for influence in the Indian Ocean region. The delegates of the three nations agreed to meet regularly in future. What added to the significance of the meeting in Colombo on Saturday was that it was hosted by Sri Lanka—one of the Indian Ocean nations China has been trying to pull into its orbit of influence in order to spread its geo-strategic tentacles around India. Since the stand-off between Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) started along the disputed boundary between the two nations in eastern Ladakh in early May, New Delhi renewed focus on reaching out to the Indian Ocean nations to counter the communist country’s moves to build strategic assets and expand its footprints in the maritime neighbourhood of India. India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives on Saturday also agreed to step up cooperation in combating radicalisation and terrorism, extremism, drug, arms and human trafficking, money laundering, cybersecurity and effect of climate change on the maritime environment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sri-lanka-maldives-agree-to-broad-base-maritime-security-cooperation-with-india-921073.html

Modi asked scientists working at these units to share their views on how to improve the regulatory processes. He also said India would supply Covid-19 vaccine to its neighbours, following a tradition of 'global good'. "India considers vaccines as not only vital to good health but also as a global good. It is India's duty to assist other countries, including the nations in our neighbourhood, in the collective fight against the virus," he said in a statement. The prime minister visited Zydus Biotech Park in Ahmedabad, Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad and Serum Institute of India (SII) in Pune where top officials apprised him of the status of the clinical trial and manufacturing process. Last month, Bharat Biotech began the phase-3 trial of its homemade vaccine that will be tried on 26,000 volunteers. The SII, on the other hand, is carrying out a fast-track bridging study on 1,600 volunteers as the efficacy of its vaccine — same as the AstraZeneca-Oxford shot — has been demonstrated in trials abroad. Zydus Cadila's vaccine candidate, developed at its Vaccine Technology Centre, is completing the second phase of the trial. Despite repeated attempts, Cadila officials refused to elaborate on the status. Modi arrived at the Ahmedabad airport at 9 am and boarded a helicopter to reach Changodar industrial area on the outskirts of the city where Zydus Biotech Park is located. His visit lasted nearly an hour, during which he interacted with the scientists and chairman and managing director of the drug-maker. The Bharat Biotech facility at the Genome Valley in Hyderabad was his next stop where he was briefed about the ongoing clinical trial at 25 medical centres across the country. The vaccine is being manufactured at the company's BSL-3 high containment facility on the outskirts of Hyderabad. The last stop was the SII vaccine complex at Hadapsar in Pune where the top brass of the world's largest vaccine manufacturer briefed the prime minister in detail about the vaccine development process and the target rollout dates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/on-3-city-tour-modi-talks-of-covid-19-vaccine-for-global-good-921075.html

After a high-level review meeting of the Revenue Department officers, it was also decided that GST registration cancellation process can be started for about 5.43 lakh taxpayers who have not filed their returns for the last six or more months. About 80 lakh sales return or GSTR-3B have been filed so far. Sources said GST Network, which handles the IT backbone for Goods and Services Tax, along with tax officials would persuade these 25,000 taxpayers who have defaulted on the filing of GSTR-3B returns by due date, i.e., by November 20, 2020, for the month of October. "Tax officers have been directed to follow up personally with these defaulting taxpayers so that their GSTR-3B returns due for the month get filed by November 30, 2020. These top 25,000 taxpayers, who have not yet filed their returns, were identified on the basis of last month's statistics," a source said. Sources said that the GSTN has also been directed to send 1 lakh SMS and e-mail reminders per day to the taxpayers, particularly to the defaulting taxpayers, to file the return in due time. As per GST rules, for the supplies made in the month of October, the GSTR-3B returns were expected to be filed in a staggered manner by 20th, 22nd and 24th November. Those having turnover above Rs 5 crore annually are expected to file their GSTR-3B by 20th of the month. However, these identified 25,000 top taxpayers are yet to file their returns as on today, they added. GST collections crossed Rs 1 lakh crore mark first time since February, at over Rs 1.05 lakh crore in October, reflecting pickup in economic activity and demand. In October too 80 lakh GST returns were filed. GST revenue had topped Rs 1 lakh crore in 8 out of 12 months of 2019-20 fiscal. In current fiscal, the revenues have taken a hit due to Covid lockdown and consequent slowdown in economy. Revenue in April was Rs 32,172 crore, May (Rs 62,151 crore), June (Rs 90,917 crore), July (Rs 87,422 crore), August (Rs 86,449 crore), September (Rs 95,480 crore) and October (Rs 1,05,155 crore). Meanwhile, in its nationwide drive launched in the second week of November against GST fake invoice frauds, the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) and Central GST Commissionerates have so far arrested 85 persons for allegedly availing or passing on ineligible ITC fraudulently and have booked 981 cases against more than 3119 fake GSTIN entities identified across the country, sources said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/top-25000-gst-payers-of-october-yet-to-file-returns-in-november-tax-officers-to-send-reminders-921079.html

Since then there have been protests from farmers across the nation who fear that the legislation will not ensure Minimum Support Price (MSP) on agricultural produce. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have been marching toward the national capital November 28 onward. In the backdrop of this, several Twitter and Facebook users have juxtaposed two images of an elderly woman. One of them is 82-year-old Bilkis Bano also known as ‘Shaheen Bagh Dadi’. As per the claim, both women are the same and Bano was present at the recent farmers’ protests. Some social media posts added that Bano is available on hire on daily basis for such protests. Thus, questioning the integrity of both protests. Twitter user Gaurav Pradhan tweeted, “1. Dadi at Shaheen Bagh 2. Dadi as Farmer? Dadi available for hire on per day basis. Food, cloth, award and pocket money extra CONTACT : @RahulGandhi, @priyankagandhi or at @incindia office, 24, Akbar Road, New Delhi.” His tweet retweeted over 1000 times. Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut also promoted the tweet and wrote, “Ha ha ha she is the same dadi who featured in Time magazine for being the most powerful Indian…. And she is available in Rs 100. Pakistani jurno’s have hijacked international PR for India in an embarrassing way. We need our own people to speak for us internationally.” Ranaut’s tweet was liked over 1,000 times before it was taken down. Alt News received several requests to authenticate this claim on our WhatsApp helpline (+917600011160) and on our official Android application. One of the WhatsApp messages reads, “Shahin Bagh wali dadi aaj kisan bani hai”. Attempt to malign farmer protests with false claim A quick glance makes it clear that the two women aren’t identical. However several social media users believe otherwise. In order to authenticate both the images, we performed a reverse image search on both to find the context. Image 1: Bilkis Bano The image of Bano was published in The Economic Times, India Times and She The People in September. Earlier this year, TIME magazine listed Bano as one of the 100 most influential people in 2020 after she actively participated and led women’s protest against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act.

Farmers from Punjab and Haryana have been marching towards Delhi demanding repeal of the three farm laws, leading to showdown with the police. "This (protests by farmers) is the failure of the Central government. The government should have initiated talks with farmers at an early stage and thought twice before bringing the new laws. I feel the government should have consulted leaders like (NCP chief) Sharad Pawar, who was a former agriculture minister, Parkash Singh Badal (former CM of Punjab), H D Deve Gowda (former prime minister) who had worked in the agriculture sector. "After consulting these leaders, the government would have realised lacunae in the new agri bills. Had these things be done in the past, the bill(s) would not have been opposed," the former Union minister said. On the first anniversary of the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government in Maharashtra, Patel said it has been a successful year.

28-11-2020||National Politics||'What makes the BJP special is what I call Hindu Fevicol’||Political scientist Vinay Sitapati in a conversation with Sagar Kulkarni delves into the reasons for BJP’s electoral successes and discovers the “secret sauce” of organisational unity that makes it possible. Sitapati’s recent book, Jugalbandi: The BJP Before Modi, provides the backstory for BJP’s dominance through the 60-year-old relationship between veterans Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani. Edited excerpts: Why ‘Jugalbandi’? Indian politics has changed rapidly for a lot of people and Modi’s India seems so dominant. But really the argument of my book is that it has taken 100 years to create Narendra Modi. To understand today’s society is a 100-year project that begins in the 1920s when Savarkar writes his famous essay on the ‘Essentials of Hindutva’. That is also the period when RSS was created, it is also the time when Hindu Mahasabha, the first Hindu national party, was created. All those ideas have now fructified in Narendra Modi. That was the purpose of the book. I tell this story through Vajpayee and Advani and their 60-year relationship, which is really the history of the BJP before Modi. I also chose the word ‘Jugalbandi’, because, in the Indian context, jugalbandi is a duo. But it is a duo who are different from each other, but yet they are playing equal music.  We tend to see Advani as a hardliner and Vajpayee as the moderate face of the BJP. But your book speaks about how this was not necessarily a given… Advani is called as the hardliner, but he is actually what the RSS derisively calls as a ‘Macaulayputra’. He spoke English, before he learnt to speak Hindi, grew up in the cosmopolitan Karachi of 1920s and 30s, came from a very rich family. He joined the RSS because Partition seemed likely and there was this talk of breaking of Sindh from the rest of India. Atal Bihari Vajpayee came from a very poor Gangetic Brahmin family, a very traditional and very parochial family. One would associate that kind of a background with a hardliner, but instead, he becomes moderate. But, Hindu nationalism always wanted both—an orator as well as an organiser; the hardliner as well as the moderate—as it was both a movement that was trying to shape the society as well as a party trying to form a government. So, in the Jana Sangh itself, you had Syama Prasad Mookerjee, who was the orator in Parliament, and Deendayal Upadhyay from the RSS who is more of an ideologue and more of an organiser. Then you had Vajpayee and Advani and now you have Amit Shah and Modi.  Do you see similar examples in other political parties as well? Well, certainly. The Communists come to mind because communism is a movement aiming to change society as well as a party seeking government. During the heyday of communist rule in West Bengal, you had Jyoti Basu as the chief minister and Pramod Dasgupta as the head of the party in West Bengal—an orator-organiser jugalbandi. The difference is that the Communists did not understand the importance of being united, which is why they split from CPI to CPM to CPI(M-L) and even within M-L there are factions. The BJP rarely splits. In my book, I explain this as “Hindu Fevicol”.  How different is the Modi-Shah jugalbandi compared to Vajpayee-Advani? The Modi-Shah jugalbandi is still playing out. The two differences I can see immediately are that Vajpayee and Advani were very different from each other. On 90% of the issues, I think Modi and Amit Shah agree. In that sense, it is not a partnership of people who are different. Another big difference is that Advani-Vajpayee partnership was a partnership of equals. From 1968 to 1986, Vajpayee ran the party, but in 1986 the RSS asked him to step down and Advani took over. Then once again from 1995 to 2004, Vajpayee was the boss and Advani served under him. Today, it is very clear that Narendra Modi is the boss and Amit Shah the subordinate. We cannot imagine them swapping roles, but who knows? It has happened once in the BJP and maybe it will happen again. How has the RSS-BJP relationship evolved over the years? During the Vajpayee-Advani era itself, there have been ups and downs. RSS played a huge role in BJP from 1986 to 1995. It pushed the BJP to adopt the Ram Janmabhoomi movement into its agenda. However, in the 1984 elections, the RSS voted for Rajiv Gandhi and not for Vajpayee. As the RSS mouthpiece, Organiser said, Rajiv’s party was the Hindu party. From 1998-2004, Vajpayee’s biggest opponent was the RSS. Specifically, K S Sudarshan, the RSS chief had a personal animus with Vajpayee. You are not seeing Mohan Bhagwat make any public criticism against Narendra Modi. The difference in tone today is quite obvious compared to the Vajpayee years in power.  Would this jugalbandi have been different had Vajpayee got a majority on his own? The jugalbandi was heavily shaped by its political context, as the Jan Sangh and the BJP was considered untouchable for much of this period. Even when it became the single largest party, the allies considered it untouchable. And with the Nehruvian idea of India being dominant, Vajpayee had to adopt a different strategy. I also think the Hindu voter has changed today compared to the period I am writing about and I think that today Narendra Modi and Amit Shah have shown that you can talk and practice Hindutva and still win elections. Vajpayee and Advani were quite convinced that this was not possible when they were in power. But what makes Modi and Shah win elections year after year? Well, my book ends in 2004. As an academic, I can talk confidently on things that I have done research about and should avoid commenting on areas I have not done research on. But Amit Shah and Modi seem more sensitive to caste in India than Advani and Vajpayee. This trend of attracting tribals and OBCs began in the 1980s under Advani and Vajpayee, but Modi has been able to attract Dalits as well. I suspect it is because of his own social location as an OBC, even though he doesn’t play it up. I think Advani did not understand caste because he came from the region of Sindh, where caste among Hindus was not really practised. Vajpayee himself didn’t quite see how caste arithmetic could be used to form a Hindu vote bank. They had begun it. In the 1980s they had Kalyan Singh, Uma Bharti as backward class Hindutva leaders, but that idea has been taken to new heights by Modi and Amit Shah. Another thing in Modi’s favour is that he is a better mass politician than both Vajpayee and Advani. Neither Vajpayee nor Advani could really win even one state.  Do you see the dominance of BJP continuing in the future? Yes. The period that we are currently in is analogous to 1967 to 1989 in India, where the Congress was either the single biggest party or, if you had to come to power, it was an anti-Congress alliance that came to power. Similarly, I feel that in the next 10-15 years either we will have a BJP government in power or an anti-BJP alliance in power, which is united only by the shared hatred for BJP. The BJP is going to be the principal pole on which politics oscillates for the next 10-15 years.  What lessons should the Congress learn from the BJP? Don’t split. The problem is that Indians are very bad at teamwork. One of the reasons for this is dynasty and nepotism, where you constantly support your relatives rather than encouraging merit. Congress only reflects this problem in India. That is why it keeps splitting. It doesn’t have an organisational core. What makes the BJP special is what I call the ‘Hindu Fevicol’. They fight with each other, they don’t like each other, they have ideological differences. But it is like one of those joint families where there is a lot of fighting, but there is no divorce. That is the secret sauce of the BJP. It is like a family that never splits. Or very rarely. In Karnataka, there have been a few cases, in Gujarat Shankarsinh Vaghela did split. But the exception proves the rule. It is so rare in the BJP that you remember it. It is very hard to remember in Congress because it is happening every week. Why does this Pakistan fixation exist within the BJP? The BJP uses a modern form of Hinduism. But one feature it shares with traditional Hinduism is the idea of sacred geography or the ‘teertha sthans' of India. The idea of Akhand Bharat as a religious idea is embedded in traditional Hinduism. They see the Partition of India as a partition of its religious geography. Kashmir is the unfinished business of Partition. In that sense, Pakistan is a religious affront to their nationalism. It is not just a simple question of Hindu or Muslim. It is a deeper one. It is for that reason, in that context, that Vajpayee did more than any prime minister for better relations with Pakistan. For example The Lahore bus yatra or the Agra peace summit, or his many overtures to Kashmiris. Even Advani, who should have had a personal animus against Pakistan, because it was an idea that hurt his family, supports 100% in this endeavour. I think that is remarkable.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/what-makes-the-bjp-special-is-what-i-call-hindu-fevicol-920982.html

The Delhi Police on Friday allowed protestors to hold their protest at Burari ground. Meanwhile, several farmers have gathered at Delhi's border with Haryana in Sonipat district and they will halt for the night there. "The farmers from Punjab as well as from Haryana will make a night halt inside Haryana territory in Sonipat district, close to the Singhu border," Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni)'s Haryana unit chief Gurnam Singh Charuni said over phone. It was felt a night halt should be made close to where farmers have gathered since many peasants from Punjab are still on their way and are likely to join them over the next few hours. On Friday afternoon, Delhi Police allowed farmers to hold their protest at north Delhi's Nirankari Ground - one of the biggest grounds in the national capital. Earlier in the day, Krantikari Kisan Union president Darshan Pal had said that officials of the Union Home Ministry had allowed them a place in Delhi to hold the agitation "We have been allowed safe passage to Delhi," claimed Pal. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday welcomed the Union government's decision allowing farmers to enter the national capital and hold peaceful agitation. More farmers from Punjab are on their way to Haryana as part of their 'Delhi Chalo' protest march. A number of women are also part of the protesters and are headed towards Delhi in tractor trolleys and other vehicles. Farmers owing allegiance to Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta- Ugrahan), one of the largest farm bodies in the state, who entered Haryana from Khanauri border, were about 120 km away from the national capital. This group of farmers has decided to halt for the night in Haryana and make an early morning move towards Delhi. Farmers owing allegiance to Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) were also headed to the national capital. The farmers are protesting against the three new laws that deregulate sale of farm produce. They say this will dismantle the minimum support price (system).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-chalo-punjab-farmers-to-hold-meet-on-november-28-for-next-course-of-action-920803.html

Those gathered at the Tikri border continued to hold ground as well. A decision on whether they would head to the designated protest site is expected soon. After the meeting at the Singhu border, one of the main routes used to access the city from Punjab, a farmer leader said they would not move and continue their protest there. "We will not move from here (Singhu Border) and continue our fight. We will not return home. Thousands of farmers have come from Punjab and Haryana to join the protest," he said. On Friday, hundreds of farmers entered the national capital to hold a peaceful protest at the Sant Nirankari Ground after facing teargas and water cannons and clashing with security personnel while thousands remained at border points, undecided whether to go to the demonstration site identified by police. The day witnessed police using teargas shells, water cannons and multi-layer barriers to block the protesters and the farmers pelting stones and breaking barricades in some places in their determination to push through as part of their 'Delhi Chalo' march against the Centre's new farm laws. After a meeting between farmer leaders and senior police officers, the Delhi Police had allowed the protesters to hold demonstration peacefully at Nirankari Ground, but senior farmer leader Darshan Pal later said they would stay put at border points on Friday night and a decision on whether to go to the identified protest site or not will be taken on Saturday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-at-delhi-border-refuse-to-head-to-protest-site-920894.html

Officials said that over 17% polling was recorded till 11 am in three panchayat blocks that went to polls for DDC elections in north Kashmir’s Bandipora district. In Kashmir, Gurez, Tulail, and Sumbal panchayat blocks in Bandipora district went to polls in the first phase of DDC elections. Polling started at 7 am and will end at 2 pm. In the first phase of the district development council (DDC) elections, voting is taking place in 43 constituencies, including 25 in Kashmir and 18 in Jammu with 1,427 candidates in the fray and seven lakh voters eligible to exercise their franchise. In the election, the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration comprising National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party, Peoples Conference, and other parties are locked in a direct contest with BJP. The authorities have made elaborate security arrangements for the elections to ensure incident-free polls. “Vigil has been tightened across the Union Territory,” a senior police officer told DH. “Security is being reviewed as per requirements.” Security along the LoC and the International Border, he said, had also been beefed up to prevent militants from infiltrating and disturbing the poll exercise. The DDC polls mark the Centre’s first attempt at restoring democratic processes in the region, following the revocation of its special status and bifurcation in August 2019. In the absence of an elected government in the UT, these Councils are set to become a new unit of governance in Jammu and Kashmir. J&K has been under central rule since June 2018 when the BJP pulled out of the alliance government with the PDP. The special status of the erstwhile state under Article 370 was revoked in August 2019 by the Parliament and it was bifurcated into the UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/amid-tight-security-polling-underway-for-first-phase-of-ddc-elections-in-jk-920904.html

Among them was a youth who emerged as a social media icon after he climbed atop water cannons to turn it off during the protests. Several videos of farmers clashing with the local cops circulated on social media, but 26-year-old Navdeep Singh, son of leader Jai Singh who hails from the Ambala district made headlines for helping protesting farmers who were being targeted by water cannons. The incident took place at Mohra village in Ambala district on National Highway (NH) 44 on November 25. He has however been booked under the charges of the attempt to murder, rioting, and violation of Covid-19 norms, in a case registered at Parao police station by Ambala police, according to reports. Justifying his act, he said, “I climbed on top of water cannon truck from a tractor-trolley and after reaching the tap, I turned it off. A policeman also climbed up while chasing me but by that time, my brother brought his tractor near and I jumped onto it.” He also told the news publication that the cops hit him, but he is not angry as the cops were only doing their job. Hundreds of farmers entered Delhi on Friday to hold a peaceful protest at a north Delhi ground after facing tear gas and water cannons.

By Friday evening, all Haryana Police barricades at the border with Punjab and along the highway to Delhi had been lifted. Hundreds entered the national capital to hold a peaceful protest at a north Delhi ground after facing teargas and water cannons and clashing with security personnel, while thousands remained at border points, undecided whether to go to the demonstration site identified by police. "We have again started heading towards Delhi in the morning after a night halt at Meham in Rohtak district of Haryana," Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) leader Shingara Singh said on Saturday. Another group of farmers made a night halt at Julana in Haryana's Jind district, he said, adding, "They have also resumed their journey towards Delhi." Farmers with the outfit had on Friday broken through police barricades at Khanauri and Dabwali border points between Punjab and Haryana. More farmers under the banner of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) will enter Haryana on Saturday for their march towards the national capital. "Our group of farmers on tractor-trolleys will soon enter Haryana through the Shambhu interstate border," said KMSC general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher. They had begun their march from Amritsar on Friday. Pandher lashed out at the Centre for bringing the "black laws" against the farming community. Punjab farmers in large numbers had on Friday crossed the state's border with Haryana. Some even faced water cannons and teargas. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has welcomed the Union government's decision allowing farmers to enter the national capital and hold peaceful agitation.

An official at MeT Department said that mercury at the famous ski resort of Gulmarg in north Kashmir settled at minus 5.6 degrees while south Kashmir's famous hill resort Pahalgam, which serves as one of the base camps during the annual Amarnath yatra, recorded a minimum temperature of 5.2 degrees. Srinagar recorded a minimum temperature of minus 2.2 degrees Celsius while the mercury in Qazigund town of south Kashmir also called as the gateway to the Valley, settled at minus 1.8 degrees. Leh in the frontier region of Ladakh was the coldest recorded place in the region with the night temperature dropping to bone-chilling minus 12.9 degrees Celsius.  The minimum temperature in neighbouring Kargil town settled at minus 9.2 degrees Celsius. The cold wave has intensified over the last few days with sub-zero night temperatures resulting in the freezing of water supply lines in several areas. The minimum temperatures were likely to drop further due to clear night sky as mainly dry weather was expected in the next few days in the region, the Met Office has forecast. Reports said bad weather condition and poor visibility in the mornings results in slowing down of traffic movement on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway and other roads in Kashmir.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/kashmir-ladakh-continue-to-reel-under-intense-cold-920913.html
28-11-2020||North and Central||In a remote Kashmiri district, seven women battle for education and development||Aarti Nehru, one of the seven women, has been campaigning for the District Development Council (DDC) polls that are being held today.  Shuttling between villages, she has promised to address issues such as repair of roads, culverts and improving the power supply in the district. “I am put off by the non-existent facilities in our villages. Nothing has changed here for so many years,” she told News18.  Alleging that the previous representatives have never helped the poorer population, she said that as an independent candidate she doesn’t have any strings attached and will be the agent of change if elected.  Contesting from Muslim-dominated population, Nehru said, “Religion does not matter in Kashmir. It is the only place where there are no religious biases.”  Competing against Nehru is lawyer-turned-politician Ruqaya Fayaz (23) who has already made herself familiar with the younger women by raising awareness on women’s issues in the villages. “Women should pursue education, earn and stand on their feet,” she tells a group of young girls in scarfs and pherans in a rally, the publication reported. Fayaz has also set up a non-profit trust to train young girls in handicrafts and such. Using her knowledge of the justice system, she has been able to introduce several central schemes in the villages.  Focussing on the indigenous population, 30-year-old Parmeet Kaur has been campaigning hard. She is affiliated to the People’s Conference.  Talking about her campaigns to the publication, she said, “I talk about schools, proper sewage disposal, roads and nullas and people seem to be very keen to give me a chance.” “Their children (indigenous groups) have no access to good schools, a good education. They have to walk long distances as there are no road-links to the hills. Power remains snapped for weeks together in winter,” she said. “They are the most deprived community and there is a dire need to intervene,” she added. Giving stiff competition to Kaur, is Tasleema Bano, an erstwhile life insurance agent who is fielded by Altaf Bukharis's Apni Party. Dangiwacha district is a reserved seat for women. As many as 1,475 candidates are in the fray for the first phase of the polls, the officials said. Out of these, 296 candidates are contesting the first phase of the DDC polls in the union territory. The election is being seen as a triangular contest between the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) -- an amalgam of several mainstream political parties, including the National Conference (NC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which are seeking the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir's special status revoked by the Centre last year -- and the BJP, and Apni Party floated by former finance minister Altaf Bukhari.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/in-a-remote-kashmiri-district-seven-women-battle-for-education-and-development-920922.html
28-11-2020||North and Central||Ailing Geelani calls for 'complete boycott' of DDC election||For the first time since resigning as chief of the hardline faction of the Hurriyat Conference in June, ailing separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani has called for a “complete boycott” of the district development council (DDC) elections taking place in Jammu and Kashmir from November 28. In a statement uploaded on his Twitter handle, the nonagenarian separatists said, “….. at a time when our freedom struggle against India’s illegal occupation is going through a crucial phase, conduction of DDC elections is to further the heinous designs of demographic changes, land grabs, building settler colonies, assaulting our economy and snatching our livelihood.” While blaming all the parties participating in these elections for “acting against the freedom movement”, Geelani claimed that their “actions are not only legitimising Indian occupation but they are equally responsible towards creating these new occupational structures like DDC, BDC, and panchayats for the annihilation of people of J&K.” Since the insurgency began in Kashmir in the late 1980s, separatists like Geelani have been calling for a boycott of all elections and running anti-poll campaigns across the Valley. However, since the NIA crackdown from 2017 onwards, the writ of separatists has waned and even local newspapers are refusing to publish their statements. Geelani, who became life-time chief of the hardline faction, floated after the split of the Hurriyat Conference in 2003, resigned in June, complaining that constituents of the amalgam failed to lead the people after the abrogation of J&K’s special status, “overstepped the limits”, and tried to “create a parallel structure” He also took a swipe at the Hurriyat leadership in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, calling it “just a representative forum” with “no power to take any decision” and using its influence to “get close to power corridors” in Pakistan.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ailing-geelani-calls-for-complete-boycott-of-ddc-election-920925.html
28-11-2020||North and Central||Justice done after 70 years: West Pakistan refugees on DDC polls||Enthusiasm was palpable among voters at polling booths here on Saturday as the maiden District Development Council (DDC) polls and panchayat by-elections, the first democratic exercise in Jammu and Kashmir since it was reorganised as a union territory last year, was underway. With the abrogation of Article 370, several communities like West Pakistan refugees, Valmikis and Gurkhas are now eligible to vote in local elections, purchase land and apply for jobs in Jammu and Kashmir, and besides these, they can also contest elections. On August 5, 2019, the Centre revoked the special status of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated it into UTs of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Since then, the government has introduced several laws, including those related to land and domicile status. "We have heard the words equality, justice and liberty, and today we are feeling the true meaning of these words," Sujati Bharti, a young voter from the West Pakistan refugee community, said standing in a queue outside a polling station at Kot Ghari in Akhnoor block in the outskirts of Jammu. She thanked the Centre for its decision to do away with the special status, saying members of her community were exercising their right to vote in local elections after 70 years. Bharti said she felt liberated as she stood in queue with permanent residents. Justice has finally been granted after an over seven-decade-long struggle, she added. Except for parliamentary elections, these refugees, were, till last year, barred in Jammu and Kashmir from voting in assembly, panchayat and urban local body polls. Bishan Dass (67), another voter from the community, said he did not want to remember the past and instead, pinned hopes on a bright future in which his grandchildren could get jobs without moving outside. "We feel empowered. Earlier nobody used to come to our places to seek votes. Today, every candidate came thrice knocking our doors," he said, flashing a victory sign. Most of the West Pakistan refugees, after migrating from Pakistan during the Partition, settled in R S Pura, Akhnoor, Samba, Hiranagar and Jammu. Currently, there are over 1.5 lakh refugees in the Union territory. In the first leg of the eight-phased DDC elections, 43 constituencies will go to polls -- 25 in Kashmir and 18 in Jammu. Voting began at 7 am and will end aat 2 pm. Out of a total of 1,475 candidates, 296 are contesting the first phase -- 172 in the Kashmir valley and 124 in the Jammu region. By-elections to 12,153 panchayat constituencies are also taking place along with the DDC polls. Out of these, 11,814 are in the Kashmir valley and the rest 339 in Jammu. A total of 2,644 polling stations have been set up and there are around 7 lakh electors for this phase -- 3.72 lakh in Kashmir and 3.28 lakh in Jammu. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the government has made special arrangements to ensure guidelines and standard operating procedures are adhered to. Tight security arrangements have also been made in and around the polling stations to ensure peaceful voting. At the Purmandal block in Samba district, voters started queuing up outside polling stations in Khara village much before the scheduled start of the polling. "This election is meant to strengthen grassroots democracy and ensure development at village level. We are voting with focus on the candidates who can provide us better facilities," 25-year-old Ashok Kumar said. He said people in the area were facing tremendous hardships due to the scarcity of water and underdeveloped roads. "We have to decided to vote for a DDC candidate who can be accessed easily and can address our day-to-day problems," Kumar said. Chuni Lal, another voter, said they heard all the 10 candidates in the fray during campaigning and accordingly made up his mind. He said he was hopeful that the maiden DDC elections would strengthen the Panchayati Raj system after successful conclusion of the Block Development Council elections, and also paves way for early Assembly elections in the Union Territory.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/justice-done-after-70-years-west-pakistan-refugees-on-ddc-polls-920926.html
28-11-2020||North and Central||'Delhi Chalo': Protesting farmers charged with attempt to murder, rioting in Haryana||Haryana Police has booked state Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Gurnam Singh Charuni and several farmers on attempt to murder, rioting, causing obstruction in government duty and other charges for violations during their "Delhi Chalo" march, officials said on Saturday. A case was registered on November 26 under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 147 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 186 (obstructing any public servant in discharge of public functions) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) among others at the Parao police station on a complaint from Head Constable Pardeep Kumar as hundreds of farmers assembled on the GT road near Ambala Cantt to proceed towards the national capital. The FIR names Charuni and several other unknown farmers as accused. According to it, the BKU Haryana chief and others had gathered near Mohra village in Ambala. The FIR says Deputy Superintendent of Police Ram Kumar, who was leading the police team at the spot, asked Charuni not to proceed further but he refused. It adds that Charuni and other farmers broke police barricades with their tractors. Some of the police officials had a narrow escape and could have been run over by the tractors heading towards Delhi, says the FIR. Charuni and other farmers also violated guidelines pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, it further states. A case against some farmers from BKU (Charuni) and others from Punjab was also registered at Panipat for violations relating to breaking police barriers and other charges.  "A case has been registered under the provisions of section 188 IPC (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), Disaster Management Act, 2005 and under other provisions of the IPC," Inspector Rajvir Singh, SHO of Panipat's Police Station (Industrial) in Sector 29, said over the phone. Two days ago, Haryana Director General of Police Manoj Yadava had said that state police acted with "great restraint" as farmers broke barricades during their march. He had said the farmers took an aggressive stand and tried to disturb law and order by "pelting stones" at police at many places. Some police personnel sustained injuries, and police and private vehicles were damaged, Yadava had said. "Agitating farmers not only damaged police barricades, but also proceeded by removing all the blockades and obstructions in an unlawful manner. Acting with restraint, police did not use force on the agitating farmers," he had added. Prohibitory orders under section 144 of the CrPC had been imposed in several parts of Haryana to prevent the assembly of people. Farmers from Punjab and Haryana are marching towards Delhi as part of a protest to demand a repeal of the Centre's new farm laws, which deregulate the sale of agriculture produce. They say the laws will lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-chalo-protesting-farmers-charged-with-attempt-to-murder-rioting-in-haryana-920933.html

However, the family of the boy who was preparing for a relative’s wedding, was unaware of the complaint until the cops showed up at their home, reported Indian Express. “He is so young, and has barely seen the outside world. We don’t know why or in what circumstances he sent the message. But anyone in the village can vouch that he meant no harm.,” the family appealed. The police tracked the WhatsApp number within 24 hours and a two-member team was sent from Lucknow to arrest him. According to the report, the boy was presented before the Juvenile Board in the capital a day later and is now lodged at a juvenile home in Lucknow.  “The FIR was filed by a policeman because the message mentioned the CM. Prima facie it appears that the minor did not mean to carry out the threat,” Sachin Kumar Singh, SHO Suahant Gold City told the daily. Further investigation in the matter is underway. Earlier, 16-year-old boy had sent a message threatening the chief minister on the WhatsApp number of the 112 emergency service on Sunday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-cops-detain-15-year-old-boy-for-allegedly-threatening-yogi-adityanath-report-920945.html

While thousands of farmers sat it out at various border points into Delhi for the third consecutive day, many made their way into the national capital and gathered at the Nirankari ground, one of the largest in the city. The farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana and also from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, arrived in trucks and tractors. Slogans such as “Dharti Mata Ki Jai”, ‘Narendra Modi Kisan Virodhi” and “Inquilab Zindabad” could be heard from different parts of the vast, dusty ground. As some farmer leaders gave speeches, farmers danced to drumbeats and the strains of “Hum Honge Kaamyab” could also be heard. Amid the cheerful cacophony from farmers who said they were determined to make their point, members of the Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti struck up a chorus of “Chahe Kuch Bhi Karlo Hum Badhte Jaenge”. The Bangla Sahib gurdwara set up a ‘langar’ to feed the protesters. Delhi’s Aam Aadmi Party government had also made provisions for food. An e-rickshaw moved around spreading awareness about the Covid-19 pandemic and the importance of wearing masks. “The unprecedented unity of the farmers will put pressure on the government to withdraw the three anti-farmer acts,” social activist Medha Patkar, who was at Burari with a group of men and women, told NDTV. She said it was a decentralised movement and the protest was against the “vulgar inequity” in the country. Farmers protesting against the Centre's three farm laws have expressed apprehension that the laws would pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/slogans-songs-and-drumbeats-as-hundreds-of-farmers-gather-at-burari-ground-920950.html

The Delhi Traffic Police tweeted that traffic movement was not allowed from Azadpur and Outer Ring Road towards the Singhu border. "We appeal to commuters to avoid travelling towards the Singhu and Tikri borders, Mukarba Chowk, NH-44, GT-Karnal Road and Outer Ring Road," Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Meenu Chaudhary said. Saturday being a holiday for most office goers, the traffic situation in other parts is better than Friday, she said. On Friday, the Delhi Police had curtailed movement at several places, including Dhansa, Jharoda Kalan, Tikri, Gurugram, Singhu and Chilla, to prevent protesting farmers from entering Delhi. Sections of Outer Ring Road, Mukarba Chowk, GT Karnal Road, NH-44 were also closed. The restrictions led to chaos and confusion among commuters who were stuck for hours. Some of the chaos eased out later in the day after police allowed the farmers to enter the national capital. Farmers, representing over 30 farm bodies, have called a 'Delhi Chalo' march through several routes -- Lalru, Shambhu, Patiala-Pehowa, Patran-Khanauri, Moonak-Tohana, Ratia-Fatehabad and Talwandi-Sirsa. They have been demanding that the central government repeal the new farm laws, which, they say, should be replaced with another set of legislations framed after wider consultation with the stakeholders.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/traffic-blocked-in-key-roads-of-delhi-as-police-keep-singhu-tikri-borders-closed-920952.html

28-11-2020||North and Central||DDC polls are for local issues, not for 'bigger' political problems, say voters in J&K's Ganderbal||Several voters in Jammu and Kashmir's Ganderbal district on Saturday said that the District Development Council (DDC) polls are to elect people who can solve basic problems and "bigger issues" like restoration of special status should be left for assembly and parliamentary elections. The eight-phase DDC polls are the first elections in Jammu and Kashmir since it was reorganised as a union territory last year after the abrogation of its special status, and it is being held along with bypolls to panchayats. The first phase was held across Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday and over 22 per cent of the seven lakh voters had exercised their franchise till 11 am. Two DDC seats -- Gund-A and Gund-B -- went to polls in the central Kashmir district, which recorded a polling percentage of 23.14 till 11 am. "Political issues are for bigger platforms like the assembly or the Parliament. What role do the DDCs or for that matter panches and sarpanches have in framing laws. This is a small platform to address the developmental issues of the people at the local level," 67-year-old Shareef-ud-Din said after voting at a polling booth in the district's Thune area. Zahida Begum, a voter at the Government Higher Secondary School in Hariganiwan, said she came out to vote to support a local candidate who could address day-to-day issues. "We have many issues that need attention. I do not know anything about Article 370, but I want the issues of our locality to be resolved," she said. The Centre on August 5 last year had announced abrogation of Article 370, which gave the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir special status, and divided it into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Juma Koswal, another voter, said that "bigger issues are for bigger parties to discuss". "Yes, our identity has been snatched from us (after abrogation of special status), but this election is not for that," he said, adding that people are voting for candidates who can solve local issues and problems. "This election is also important as through this we can keep those parties and people away who took away our special status," Yaseen Ahmad said, adding that though the DDC polls had nothing to do with the issue, but "this would send a message how the people feel about last year's decision". The eight-phase elections are seen as a triangular contest among the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), the BJP and the Apni Party floated by former finance minister Altaf Bukhari. The PAGD -- an amalgam of several mainstream political parties, including NC and PDP, seeking the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir's special status which was revoked by the Centre last year -- has been accusing the Bukhari-led party of being a B-Team of the BJP. Of the 1,475 candidates in the fray for 280 DDC seats, 296 candidates are in the first phase, according to officials. Many voters in the district also said that the elections should not have started at 7 am in view of the chilly weather. But as the day progressed, several turned up at polling booths to exercise their franchise.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ddc-polls-are-for-local-issues-not-for-bigger-political-problems-say-voters-in-jks-ganderbal-920964.html
28-11-2020||North and Central||Will oppose bill on unlawful conversions: Akhilesh Yadav||Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said his party will oppose the state government’s bill on religious conversions when placed in the assembly for passage. The start cabinet earlier this week gave nod to the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020 to curb forcible or “dishonest” religious conversions including those for the sake of marriage, which could land violators in jail for up to 10 years. Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel gave assent to the ordinance on Saturday. Now, it will be presented in the state legislature for passage. Commenting on it, Akhilesh Yadav told reporters, “The Samajwadi Party is not in favour of any such law. We will oppose it (when it comes to the assembly).” He also sought to know its relevance when the state has schemes to encourage inter-caste and inter-faith marriages. The government does not want to debate on more important issues due to which it brought the ordinance, he said, alleging that it is creating hatred and chasm in society. The SP president also extended support to the farmers' protest against the Centre’s farm laws. “The betterment of farmers cannot be ensured through laws. It will happen only when the government comes forward and provides them with the right price of their produce,” he said. Akhilesh alleged, “No other government has committed as many atrocities on farmers as this government is doing. This treatment is being meted out by those who had promised to double their income.” He also asked when the Centre is going to bring a law to double farmers’ income and provide employment to the youth. Questioning investment claims of the UP government, Akhilesh said it should also tell how it has fared in corruption and fake encounters. “Fake cases are being lodged against political leaders,” he alleged. To a question on corruption charges against his party leader Azam Khan, Akhilesh Yadav said he has been targeted as he had done some good work. Only time will tell about the corruption and loot taking place under the BJP rule, he said. The former chief minister once again said the BJP government is copying the schemes and programmes of the previous SP regime led by him and hoped that people will give his party another chance in the 2022 assembly elections.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/will-oppose-bill-on-unlawful-conversions-akhilesh-yadav-920970.html
28-11-2020||North and Central||Armed forces deserve special treatment, should not be harassed: Delhi High Court||Members of the armed forces, who take the oath of laying down their lives for the country, deserve special treatment and are not to be harassed unnecessarily and "made ping pong of" by being sent from one forum of adjudication to another, the Delhi High Court has said. The high court observed that the oath required to be taken by the President, Vice President, Governors of the States or by the Judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts does not require them to lay down their lives in the service of the country. It is only the members of the armed forces who are required under the Constitution and other laws to take an oath of abiding by the command issued to them by the President or any officer set over them, even to the peril of their lives, a bench of Justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Asha Menon said. The court’s observation came on a batch of 40 petitions challenging an order issued by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) granting the benefit of pro-rata pension only to Commissioned Officers of the Defence Services and not to the Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs)/ Persons Below Officer Rank (PBORs). The petitioners -- NCOs/ PBORs who joined the Indian Air Force (IAF) as Airmen/ Corporals -- said the MoD’s order is discriminatory and claimed pro-rata pension. The high court allowed the petitions and directed the IAF to pay the petitioners within 12 weeks arrears of pro-rata pension from the date of discharge till the date of payment. It said the future pro-rata pension shall be paid from March 2021 to them and made it clear that if the arrears are not paid within 12 weeks, it will also carry interest at 7 per cent per annum from the expiry of 12 weeks till the date of payment. Pro-rata pension is the proportionate pension for the government service which is calculated as per the government pension rules. The bench said, “Members of a force, who take oath of laying down their lives for the country, form a distinct class and deserve special treatment. They are not to be harassed unnecessarily and made ping pong of, by sending them from one forum of adjudication to another.” The bench noted that the Air Force Tribunal (AFT), which had earlier held that the challenge to circulars could not be entertained by it, recently declined the relief of pro-rata pension to NCOs. Earlier, another bench of the high court had held that the AFT could not entertain a challenge to the MoD order and allowed pro-rata pension to the petitioners therein. Thereafter, several other benches of the high court also allowed various similar petitions. Although the IAF sought to distinguish the order passed by the high court from the orders passed by the AFT, the bench refused to form a view different from that of the co-ordinate bench in the earlier matter. The bench also rejected the Central government's plea to transfer this batch of petitions to the AFT for adjudication. “We are rather surprised that the AFT, though bound by the law laid down by this court, has at the asking of the respondents IAF refused to be bound by the judgment and law laid down by this court and ventured to take a contrary view and which was not open to the AFT,” it said and termed the conduct of AFT as “adventurism”. “Once the orders of the AFT are subject to judicial review by this court, if AFT were to continue to pass orders disregarding the law laid down by the high courts, the same would result in chaos, with petitions under Article 226 being filed in the high courts terming such orders of the AFT as patently illegal and would defeat the principle of stare decisis and purpose of tribunalisation i.e. of expeditious disposal of disputes of personnel of the Armed Forces,” the bench said. IAF submitted that the award of pro-rata pension carries with it a financial burden of Rs 44 crore per month and of Rs 250 crore in payment of arrears. The bench, however, referred to an earlier judgement that the State could not take a plea of financial burden to deny the payment of legitimate dues.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/armed-forces-deserve-special-treatment-should-not-be-harassed-delhi-high-court-921026.html
28-11-2020||North and Central||Man moves Delhi court seeking maintenance from wife||In what is a rare case, a man has approached a Delhi court seeking maintenance from his "working" wife during pendency of divorce proceedings, saying he was not able to get any job due to criminal cases, including those related to rape and unnatural sex, lodged by her. In his application filed in Saket court, Vikrant claimed he was living in penury and his physical condition has also become precarious due to hypertension, and stress-related issues. He said he was not able to sustain himself or find gainful employment as his consultancy firm has become dormant for some years in view of the criminal cases. There is a slim chance of any reputed MNCs employing him in view of numerous criminal and civil cases pending against him. The man invoked Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act which allowed husband or wife to claim maintenance during the pendency of divorce proceedings if he or she did not have an independent source of income. The wife, for her part, claimed the man earned one lakh per month.  The family court has put the matter for final hearing in December. The man, through his pro bono counsel Lakshay Yadav, said he was just a Bachelor of Arts while his wife was an MBA and disclosed her CTC as Rs 62,000 per month. Vikrant sought interim maintenance of Rs 25,000 per month for "his survival" till he got a good job. He also sought monetary support for coaching classes to clear LLB entrance examination from Delhi University. Besides, he sought direction for monetary support for care and treatment of his diseases at a good hospital. In her response, Vikrant's wife said he was earning huge money but has been cunningly reducing his ITR filings, though the court has directed him to pay Rs 1,500 per month each to her and her son, under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The man claimed his review plea against the maintenance order and a plea for perjury charges against the wife were still pending. Terming his plea as "false, frivolous and misconceived", she said the man could get employment any day as he himself drafted his application. She also said he did not show documents to prove that he had applied to appear for LLB entrance exam.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/man-moves-delhi-court-seeking-maintenance-from-wife-921030.html

State Election Commissioner, K K Sharma said that in Jammu, 64.2% people voted while in Kashmir 40.65 voting was recorded. “Barring small incident of stone pelting in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district, the election process for the first phase passed off peacefully,”(sic) he said while addressing a presser in Jammu. The authorities had made elaborate security arrangements for the elections to ensure incident-free polls. “Vigil has been tightened across the Union Territory,” a senior police officer told DH. “Security is being reviewed as per requirements.” Security along the LoC and the International Border, he said, has also been beefed up to prevent militants from infiltrating and disturbing the poll exercise. In the first phase of the DDC elections, voting took place in 43 constituencies, including 25 in Kashmir and 18 in Jammu with 1,427 candidates in the fray and seven lakh voters eligible to exercise their franchise. The election will be held in eight phases starting from November 28 and concluding on December 19 while counting will take place on December 22. In the election, People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration comprising National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party, Peoples Conference and other parties are locked in a direct contest with BJP. The elections are to be held using ballot papers. The DDC polls mark the Centre’s first attempt at restoring democratic processes in the region, following the revocation of its special status and bifurcation in August 2019. In the absence of an elected government in the UT, these Councils are set to become a new unit of governance in Jammu and Kashmir. J&K has been ruled by the Centre since June 2018 when the BJP pulled out of the alliance government with PDP. The special status of the erstwhile state under Article 370 was revoked in August 2019 by the Parliament and it was bifurcated into the UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jammu-and-kashmir-sees-517-polling-in-first-phase-of-ddc-elections-921039.html
28-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality deteriorates to 'poor' category||Delhi's air quality slipped back into the poor category on Saturday, a day after favourable wind speed helped it improve significantly. With winds slowing down, government agencies said the air quality is likely to deteriorate further . The city's 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was 231 on Saturday. It was 137 on Friday, 302 on Thursday and 413 on Wednesday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. Stronger winds and a drastic reduction in the contribution of stubble burning were two major reasons for cleaner skies over Delhi on Friday. However, the winds slowed down at night allowing the pollutants to accumulate. The maximum wind speed was 15 kmph on Saturday. It is likely to be eight to 12 kmph on Sunday and Monday, according to the India Meteorological Department. The share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution has also reduced significantly as the harvesting season has ended. The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring states to Delhi's PM2.5 levels was 4 per cent on Saturday, 2 per cent on Friday and just 1 per cent on Thursday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR. Winds are predicted to slow down on Sunday. Therefore, Delhi's air quality is likely to deteriorate further and remain in the 'poor' to 'very poor' category over the next two days, it said. The minimum temperature in the national capital was 10.1 degrees Celsius on Saturday and the maximum 26.4 degrees Celsius, the weather department said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-deteriorates-to-poor-category-921040.html
28-11-2020||North and Central||Will advance talks, says Amit Shah as more farmers join Delhi protests||As more farmers' groups converged at the national capital to protest against the Modi government’s agriculture sector reforms, Home Minister Amit Shah stepped in with an offer to expedite talks, asking the protestors to clear highways and shift to the Burari grounds. Shah’s appeal for talks came as farmers’ groups continued to march towards the national capital on tractor trolleys, blocking entry points at Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri borders with Uttar Pradesh and Haryana respectively. “I appeal to the protesting farmers that the government of India is ready to hold talks. The Agriculture Minister has invited them on December 3 for discussion. If farmers' unions want to hold a discussion before December 3, then, I assure you that it will happen as soon as you shift your protest to a designated place,” Shah said. Shah said that at many places, farmers were staying in their tractor-trolleys on highways in this cold. “I appeal to them that Delhi Police are ready to shift you to big ground, please go there,”(sic) he said. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh urged farmers to accede to the Home Minister’s appeal for talks as the purpose of their protest was to pressurise the Centre to listen to their voice. Farmers’ leaders were expected to meet on Sunday to take a call on the future course of action. On Friday evening a large group of farmers had shifted to their protests to the Nirankari Samagam grounds at Burari in north Delhi, about 20 kilometres away from the Ram Lila Grounds where the agitation was planned originally. However, Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh activists had stayed put at the Delhi-Haryana Singhu Border, insisting that they would await other farmer groups who had set off for Delhi from Punjab and decide on moving to the Burari protest site after consultations with them. Various parts of the national capital witnessed sporadic protests as small groups of farmers blocked traffic near Pragati Maidan and Jantar Mantar, before being escorted away by the police. At the Uttar Pradesh-Delhi border near Ghazipur, hundreds of activists of the Bharatiya Kisan Union led by Rakesh Tikait broke police barricades to enter the national capital to join the agitation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/will-advance-talks-says-amit-shah-as-more-farmers-join-delhi-protests-921042.html
28-11-2020||North and Central||Feeling 'emotional connect', students join farmers' protest||Playing the 'dafli' and singing songs about distress, a number of students from different universities have joined farmers in their protest against the Centre's three agriculture-related laws at the Delhi-Haryana border at Singhu. Arpan, a student from the Punjab University and a resident of Chandigarh, said she has joined the farmers' agitation as she felt an "emotional connection" with their land. "We have come here along with farmers to support them. We have been living here with the farmers and are having food at the langars. We are also singing songs in Punjabi and Hindi to explain the condition of farmers," she said. Arpan further said, "Women are also protesting here as they are emotionally connected to their lands". At least around 25 to 30 students have come to the Singhu border from different parts of Haryana and Punjab, including Panipat, Jhajjar, Patiala, Chandigarh and Sonipat. The students sat on the roads and sang songs about the difficulties faced by farmers', playing tambourines or 'daflis' and clapping along. They also ate the meals cooked by the protesting farmers in their makeshift community kitchens. Ankit, a student of Kurukshetra University, said he has come to Singhu along with farmers from Jhajjar district in Haryana. "We have joined the farmers, we will follow them and do what they will do. We have come here by our own wish. We are eating with them, sleeping with them. They (farmers) are giving us food and treating us like their kids," Ankit said. Some students from Delhi have also joined the farmers in their protest. Feroz Alam, a student of history at Delhi University who joined the farmers at Singhu border on Friday, said, "As a student, I have come here to extend my support to the farmers and will not move till the farmers' demands are accepted," Alam said. Thousands of farmers stayed put at the Singhu and Tikri border points for the third consecutive day on Saturday amid heavy police presence. They rejected the police's offer of moving to a north Delhi ground to hold peaceful demonstrations. The protesters' numbers swelled at the Singhu border point as the farmers gathered there since Thursday and Friday were on Saturday joined by more counterparts from Punjab and Haryana. Refusing to move towards the Sant Nirankari Ground, one of the biggest in the national capital, the farmers said they will not relent till they are able to hold their protest at Jantar Mantar or Ramlila Maidan in the heart of the national capital.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/feeling-emotional-connect-students-join-farmers-protest-921051.html

According to the bulletin, the total number of coronavirus cases climbed to 5,61,742 on Saturday, of which 516166 have recovered. The tally of active cases in Delhi was 36578 down from 38181 on Friday.  Delhi recorded 6,746 cases on Sunday, 4,454 on Monday, 6,224 on Tuesday, 5,246 on Wednesday and 5,475 on Thursday and 5,482 on Friday. The number of Covid-19 containment zones in Delhi rose to 5331 on Saturday from 5229 on Friday. Of the total number of 18,389 beds in Covid-19 hospitals, 9,739 are vacant, according to official data. Health Minister Satyendar Jain said Delhi has sufficient infrastructure and equipment to vaccinate its entire population in a few weeks once a Covid-19 vaccine is available. "There is no need to worry about storage of vaccines. We have a large number of health care facilities, such as mohalla clinics, polyclinics, and hospitals etc., where a Covid-19 vaccine can be administered to people," Jain told reporters. "Once a vaccine is available, we can vaccinate the entire population of Delhi in a few weeks," the minister said. Jain also said that Delhi should be given priority during the distribution of the vaccine as it is the national capital. A three-storeyed building on the premises of Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital has also been identified for the storage of Covid-19 vaccines. Jain said that more than 50 per cent of the beds reserved for coronavirus patients in Delhi are unoccupied. "More than 1,200 ICU beds and around 9,500 normal ones are unoccupied at present. Overall, more than 50 per cent beds are available. So, we are in a slightly better situation," he told reporters.    The minister said there were some problems related to oxygen supply in Delhi on Friday which have been resolved.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-sees-4998-new-covid-19-cases-from-record-69k-tests-921057.html

The Prime Minister should resolve the issues of agitating 'annadatas' on a “top national priority” basis, the SAD said in a statement here. When the Centre is repeatedly assuring farmers of continued procurement of their produce at the minimum support price, there should be no hitch in giving it a legal shape through necessary legislation, it added. The SAD core committee, party's highest decision-making body, also slammed the Haryana government for alleged “repression” of farmers heading to the national capital in response to the 'Delhi Chalo' call to protest against the Centre’s three new farm laws. “The fact is that the BJP and its governments at the Centre and in Haryana have got jittery by the success of farmers' secular and democratic movement,” said SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal in the statement. The SAD president said his party has been in the movement from the first day. “We led a massive farmers' protest march to Chandigarh. The party later merged its efforts with the ongoing movement as there were apprehensions that a parallel show by the SAD might hamper a united fight against the Centre. “Since then, in deference to the wishes of the agitating farmers, our entire focus and efforts have been towards a united fight with whole-hearted participation by our workers at different levels,” said Badal. Badal also set up a three-member committee comprising Akali leaders Balwinder Singh Bhundur, Prem Singh Chandumajra and Sikander Singh Maluka to coordinate with leaders of the like-minded national and regional parties across the country for an all-round effort to secure justice for the farmers and get the “black laws” against them repealed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/put-everything-else-aside-address-farmers-issues-personally-sad-to-pm-921078.html

The media platforms were reporting about him on the basis of the supplementary chargesheet filed in a case pertaining to the February riots, even though Khalid did not have a copy of the chargesheet and cannot defend himself in the alleged “media trial” or understand the narrative being built, the application filed by his counsel said. The application further sought that a soft copy of the chargesheet be provided to him on Saturday itself though the case was earlier fixed for hearing on December 2 for supply of copies to the accused in the matter. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat directed the court staff to provide the soft copy of the supplementary chargesheet to Khalid's counsel on Saturday. During the hearing, Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the police, denied all the allegations raised by Khalid. Khalid, JNU student Sharjeel Imam and Faizan Khan have been chargesheeted for offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including murder, rioting, unlawful assembly, sedition, criminal conspiracy. The court had on November 24 taken cognisance of the supplementary chargesheet. While it had decided to proceed against them for the offences under the stringent UAPA, it did not take cognisance of the offences of sedition, criminal conspiracy and some other charges of the Indian Penal Code as the required sanctions were awaited. Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/vicious-media-campaign-against-me-in-delhi-riots-case-umar-khalid-alleges-before-court-921095.html
28-11-2020||North and Central||Hyderabad Polls: Yogi Adityanath slams TRS, AIMIM over misgovernance, corruption||Slamming the ruling TRS and AIMIM over alleged misgovernance and corruption, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said the electorate should give a message through the December 1 Hyderabad civic polls that they would not give the liberty to loot. If Faizabad and Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh can become Ayodhya and Prayagraj respectively, he said Hyderabad can again become 'Bhagyanagar'. The election is to make the "Bhagya" (fortune) of Bhagyanagar, Adityanath said on Friday night, addressing a BJP campaign meeting ahead of the civic polls on December 1. "If the fund of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi can reach the accounts of 12 crore farmers, then why KCR government has not directly sent the money into the accounts of those affected by the flood? Why the liberty to loot was given for TRS activists? These things tell that the government's intention was not clear," he said. Even on Saturday, "when all other leaders were sleeping in the morning", Modi visited Hyderabad and other cities to review the progress of Covid-19 vaccine development, he said. Has Chief Minister Rao gone to the lab (Bharat Biotech) despite living in Hyderabad, Adityanath asked. As the crowd replied in the negative, he claimed it shows that there is no place for people in Rao's heart. Rao does not have any free time other than for family and AIMIM, he alleged. If lawlessness is to be spread, Rao has got a model like AIMIM in the form of a friend, he said. The people have to give a message through the Hyderabad civic polls that they would not give the liberty to loot, Adityanath told the gathering. If the "TRS and MIM alliance" occupies the civic body, they will have liberty to loot and people would be deprived of basic facilities, he alleged. "....When BJP was not there in (in power) Uttar Pradesh, people knew the name of the district of Ram Janmabhoomi as Faizabad. We came and gave the name Ayodhya. If Faizabad can become Ayodhya, if Allahabad can become Prayagraj, then Hyderabad can also become Bhagyanagar again," he said. He appealed to the voters to make all BJP candidates victorious in all wards to change the "Bhagya" (fortune) of Hyderabad. Earlier, he held a roadshow in the city to a rousing response from BJP supporters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hyderabad-polls-yogi-adityanath-slams-trs-aimim-over-misgovernance-corruption-921098.html
28-11-2020||Opinion||Donald Trump looms large now, but maybe not forever||President Trump’s critics have warned that history will look unkindly on the president’s decision to make false attacks on the integrity of the election instead of accepting defeat. This forecast, while understandable, may be wrong. History rarely looks on one-term presidents at all. For years I’ve had the chance to view Trump in the light of his predecessors, covering his administration as a journalist while also writing history. This made it natural to try assessing him from a distance, as I have done with 19th-century leaders, and as future historians will peer at him. Someday the clamor of his tenure will fade, leaving behind a few essential facts, the first of which is his single term. Few presidents who served four years or less find an enduring place in the popular imagination. One term is not long to influence a country so large and dynamic — and a president’s failure to win a second term can be a sign that he didn’t. If you are not from Indiana, you may not know my state produced Benjamin Harrison, a one-term president who was different from President William Henry Harrison, who died after one month in office. Few people visit the statue of James Buchanan in a lonely corner of a Washington park, and in my life I have met just one enthusiast for Chester A. Arthur. One-term presidents who escape obscurity often did something beyond the presidency — like John Adams, one of the nation’s founders, or Jimmy Carter, whose much-admired post-presidency has lasted 10 times as long as his term. Others are known for their failures while in office: Warren G. Harding for a corruption scandal, Herbert Hoover for economic calamity, Andrew Johnson for being impeached. We can’t be sure what history will make of Trump, whose term featured scandal, impeachment and calamity, as well as a pandemic. His story may not be over; he remains at the head of a powerful movement, and reportedly talks of running in 2024. But to judge by information available today, he has a relatively narrow role in the American story: as the reaction to a game-changing president — Barack Obama. Something like this is true of many presidents. A relative handful enact lasting change, while others respond to them. The ones who left a mark include Andrew Jackson, Trump’s favourite, who served two terms, from 1829 to 1837. Jackson founded the Democratic Party, reinforced slavery, pursued populist economic policies, and faced down a near-rebellion over states’ rights. When he exceeded his power to achieve his goals, critics called him King Andrew. Jackson was followed by eight presidents who served in his shadow, two of whom died in office and none of whom went on to a second term. History does not linger long on most of them; they were subordinate characters, mostly shaped by Jackson’s agenda — either advancing or resisting it. In the same way, we can place Trump in the context of Barack Obama. Elected in 2008, Obama seemed to personify America’s growing diversity as a multiracial republic. His campaign motivated new voters, and he talked at first of transcending old political divisions. He said he wanted Americans to regain trust in institutions battered by 9/11, the war in Iraq, and the financial crisis. He signed the Affordable Care Act, tried to break an impasse over immigration, and approved a nuclear agreement to ease a long-running conflict with Iran. He also did not manage to transcend the old divisions. Facing unrelenting opposition from Republicans in Congress, he enraged them by using executive authority to govern around them. Numerous Republicans claimed Obama was acting like a king. The Obama presidency paved the way for Trump. He rose by relentlessly attacking Obama, promoting the racist conspiracy theory about his birthplace and falsely claiming that he favored open borders. He told voters in 2016 that he was their “last chance” to win before they were overwhelmed by immigrants and globalism. It is astonishing to recall how much Trump devoted his term to re-fighting the battles of the Obama years. Using executive authority as Obama had, he rolled back housing and environmental regulations, reversed transgender rights in the military, and branded antiracism programs as racist. But on many issues he only partly succeeded. He withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement, but other nations did their best to maintain it. He abandoned Obama’s strategy toward China, but he struggled to make his own strategy work. He damaged the Affordable Care Act but never managed to repeal it, even when his party controlled Congress. It was revealing that he publicly supported the most popular benefits of the health insurance law that he said he despised, such as protections for pre-existing conditions. His predecessor defined what health insurance should cover, and Trump accepted the definition. Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord, but his successor plans to rejoin it. Trump ended Obama’s program giving legal status to some immigrants who arrived in the United States as children, but the Supreme Court restored it, finding Trump’s action “arbitrary and capricious.” Though Trump took other actions to limit immigration, the most permanent symbol of his policy may be an unfinished wall in the desert. He neither erased all of President Obama’s accomplishments nor completed his own. President Trump still has a legacy. He attracted a vast and loyal following. The three Supreme Court justices he appointed are likely to remain on the bench for decades. His obsessive use of social media made him unlike any president before him, as did his open disregard of barriers between his public duties and personal business. He spoke well of authoritarian rulers, and used similar styles of disinformation. And the epic conflicts he generated seem like perfect material for future history texts. It is easy to imagine a high school history book recounting the monthslong court fight over his effort to ban Muslims from entering the United States, followed by discussion questions on religious freedom and the Constitution. But as he leaves office, President Trump remains only one character in a story much larger than him, in which he is overshadowed by the two-term president he so often opposed. If Trump’s own record did not demonstrate this, it will be clear on Jan. 20, when his single term in office ends, and Obama’s former vice president will replace him.

28-11-2020||Opinion||US President Trump's Afghan troop withdrawal is a gift to the Taliban||By Tobin Harshaw The US and its allies have been at war against the Afghan Taliban for nearly two decades, and still understand the enemy so poorly that they can’t decide if “Taliban” is singular or plural. Either way, the insurgent group is riding high, ratcheting up violent attacks even as it strings along the Kabul government and Washington in negotiating a truce. Now President Donald Trump, on his way out the door, can’t leave bad enough alone. His administration’s announcement that it intends to withdraw 2,500 of the 4,500 US forces still in the country follows a long pattern, begun under President Barack Obama, of not just getting Americans out of harm’s way but also telling the Taliban exactly how and when it will be done. Callous political calculation? Or did successive presidential administrations just not understand the enemy? I found someone who does: Austin L. Wright, a co-author of a fascinating working paper called 'The Logic of Insurgent Electoral Violence.' (Confession: I skipped over the math parts.) Wright is an assistant professor of public policy at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and an associate at the Pearson Institute for the Study and Resolution of Global Conflicts, which sounds like it must have great holiday parties. Here is a lightly edited transcript of our chat: Tobin Harshaw: Before we get to Trump’s troop withdrawals and how that may complicate things for the Joe Biden administration, maybe we want to talk a little more generally. You’ve written about how non-state actors can act strategically like actual nation-states. Can you explain what you mean in a nutshell? Austin L. Wright: For a long time, there's been a misconception that the individuals and organizations that participate in armed rebellion and political violence are irrational. That they are unorganized and live hand to mouth in terms of resources and funding. And that the strategies or the tactics that they use are erratic. This turns out to be almost completely wrong in the case of most modern insurgencies. Most of these actors engage in very deliberate planning on how to tax and generate revenue from the civilian population. They know how to extract resources from areas where they operate, which allows them to provide public services and of course fund military operations. Insurgent groups aim eventually to influence policy by influencing the government itself. This separates them from terrorists, who typically don't have territorial ambitions. Most of my work is trying to use data to look into the strategies insurgents use — what are the various tactics that they deploy in the field? TH: So the Islamic State is aptly named, to some extent. ALW: Exactly. The names of ISIS or ISIL are a very deliberate representation of their aspirations. For two reasons. The first is statehood, their actual goal. But it also serves a broader messaging purpose: It signals an intent to rule, which is useful even when the state itself is gone. They are able to attract fighters from around the world, to engage in some pretty sophisticated propaganda. TH: Let's talk about the Taliban more specifically. In what ways did they take on these state-like functions of taxation and regulation? ALW: It's important to remember — and I think a lot of people have forgotten — that the Taliban were the government of Afghanistan. They weren't the government for a long time and they weren't actually particularly effective. But they have a very well-established set of bureaucracies. TH: Such as? ALW: They have shadow governors in the provinces; they run a sort of separate political system that operates behind the actual Afghan government’s system. They have Islamic courts across the country — which are actually one of the more popular things that they do, helping to resolve local disputes by bypassing the government’s courts. They engage in a substantial amount of taxation to fund those fairly sophisticated institutions. The revenue comes from the general public, especially opium farmers, as well as from traffickers who pay for protection and move opium and other illegally gotten assets out of the country. They also get taxes from other sources like the trade in timber and some precious metals and stones. TH: Initially after the 2001 invasion, the U.S. and its allies said they were going to make a big effort to stop the poppy growing and the opium trade. Did that effort fail? ALW: I think “fail” is putting it mildly. If you look historically at overall production levels, they started declining in the late 1990s and early 2000s, during the Taliban government. Since then, aggregate production has been skyrocketing. There was some discussion in the early years of something like the “Plan Colombia” approach, which involved massive aerial eradication — in Colombia that was coca. In Afghanistan, there was a substantial amount of pushback because of health concerns about those chemicals. The alternative was field eradication — sending teams out to literally chop down the plants — which is how it's still done now. As you might imagine, both the civilians who rely on this crop for their livelihoods, as well as the Taliban who rely on it for revenue, don't exactly take kindly to this. TH: After the killing of Osama bin Laden, Hillary Clinton boasted that the message to the Taliban was, “You cannot wait us out, you cannot defeat us.” What did you think when you heard that? ALW: It was just not true. The U.S. was not going to maintain surge-level troops in Afghanistan indefinitely. When the bin Laden raid was happening, troop levels in Afghanistan were incredibly high, about 100,000. But the Obama administration and the Hamid Karzai government in Kabul, as well as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization broadly, had already committed to a timeline for withdrawal. That timeline was literally a playbook the Taliban needed to follow to wait out NATO, and eventually to overrun the Afghan government. TH: So you and your colleagues looked at data from more granular sources like the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. What did you find? ALW: In our paper, we wanted to investigate whether this handover was effective. Did it reduce violence? There were actually quite a few reasons to think that going from coalition forces, who were targets for political reasons, to local Afghans providing security might be more effective. The Afghans know the field better, they can better connect with civilians and maybe they can get them to cooperate more easily. It's not a foreign occupation or a foreign operation anymore; it's just local actors. That secure transition, which Clinton said the Taliban couldn't wait out, came in phases. The first, beginning in 2011-2012, was a handover in operational control — that is, in military control and who's leading the operations. This was staggered over five waves in different districts. After the first phase, we saw a significant reduction in the violence, which could be an initial sign that local actors are more effective than some expected. TH: Wishful thinking? ALW: Yes, there's a second phase, which is the actual physical withdrawal of the U.S. and allied troops. Over the following months and years, into 2013-2014, they leave and the bases get shut down. And then we find a huge surge in violence. The Taliban knew the schedule, and were strategically responding to the state of the war as they could see it in the field.   For the US and NATO, once the physical withdrawal occurred, the costs of re-intervening would have been extremely high, because you have to redeploy all the forces, manage the logistics of rebuilding infrastructure — it’s very, very costly. Once the coalition had withdrawn, the Taliban could ratchet up violence. And that's exactly what the data we found told us they did. TH: Let's jump to the present day. Trump has ordered a drawdown of as many as 2,500 troops from the 4,500 or so still there. Either way, it’s a very small number of troops compared to the hundreds of thousands once there. Is drawing out half of that tiny group really going to have an effect on the ground? ALW: I think it will. There's a reason this move came only after Defense Secretary Mark Esper was fired. If you had to choose the worst possible time to withdraw forces, it would be when you haven't finished negotiating and implementing the final peace deal. You are giving up leverage in the bargaining against the Taliban in a few different ways. One is that those 4,500 troops are working to enhance the security of the Afghan government — and thus ultimately of the international community — by supporting missions and operations and training. There's a reason why American taxpayers are paying for them to be there, and why they're putting their lives on the line. So they serve a purpose operationally, but also from the bargaining side, by signaling the U.S. commitment to support the government of Afghanistan during this shift. A negotiated settlement that's welfare-enhancing is a good thing. The way to establish and maintain that kind of peace deal is when all sides recognize the commitment that each side is willing to make. If one side begins to back away before the deal is done, especially if they're doing it along a clearly political timeline, it matters. TH: After Trump made the announcement on the troop withdrawal, the Taliban acted very much like a state, warning Biden not to reverse it. If you were advising the president-elect, what would you recommend he do? ALW: Ultimately, it depends on whether or not Trump’s directive is implemented. If half the remaining troops are gone, then I think the best advice is to find other ways to signal U.S. commitment to the Afghan government. If a small-scale troop surge would risk the potential of the peace deal falling apart, then we could trying to re-establish a stronger civilian presence. This could include making sure that reconstruction projects are being put in the field, that they're supported by American engineers, that they’re supported by American advisers. That could be seen, by both the Afghan government and the Taliban, as a symbol of America's enduring interest and support for the Afghan people.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/us-president-trumps-afghan-troop-withdrawal-is-a-gift-to-the-taliban-921044.html

They were booked under Section 505 of the Indian Penal Code (statements conducing to public mischief), police said Akbaruddin Owaisi, younger brother of AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi, courted a controversy on November 25, asking whether the 'samadhis' of former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao and TDP founder N T Rama Rao on Hussain Sagar lake bank would be removed as he questioned the eviction drive against "poor people" residing near water bodies. The ruling TRS and BJP had termed his remarks as 'inappropriate' and demanded that he tender an apology. The AIMIM leader, addressing a public meeting here on Wednesday in the run up to the December 1 Greater Hyderabad Municipal Elections, claimed that the banks of the lake was spread over 4,700 acres when it was built by saint Hussain Shah Wali, but was now not even 700 acres. He said it had become a road, with shops and samadhis of the two leaders there, as also the Lumbini Park. State BJP president and MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar, without naming Akbaruddin, had in a sharp retort asked if he has the guts to demolish the samadhis.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/aimims-akbaruddin-owaisibjp-leader-bandi-sanjay-kumar-booked-over-remarks-on-samadhis-of-p-v-narasimha-rao-and-n-t-rama-rao-920961.html

28-11-2020||South||Some divisive forces are trying to enter Hyderabad and create havoc: TRS slams BJP||Seeking support for TRS in the Hyderabad civic polls, Chief Minister and party president K Chandrashekhar Rao on Saturday alleged that some "divisive forces" were trying to enter the city to disturb peace and tranquility. "Some divisive forces are trying to enter Hyderabad and create havoc in the city. Are we going to allow it? Are we going to lose our peace?... My dear brothers and sisters of Hyderabad...as Chief Minister of Telangana, I am appealing earnestly, please come forward. Please support TRS, which is a progressive thinking party. Please save Hyderabad from these divisive forces," he said addressing a public meeting, apparently referring to BJP. Taking a jab at Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's campaign in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polls for BJP, KCR said the northern state, which is in 28th position in terms of per capita income, was trying to teach lessons to Telangana, which is in fifth position. "As a fellow Chief Minister I welcome him (Yogi Adityanath). The person who is in 28th rank is trying to teach lessons to the one in fifth rank," KCR said. Polls for the GHMC will be held on December 1 and counting of votes will be taken up on December 4. Referring to the recent floods in the city, the southern satrap alleged that the Centre did not give even Rs 13 though the state had requested for Rs 1,300 crore as assistance. He slammed the NDA government, saying that it is selling successfully-run Public Sector Undertakings such as LIC, Railways and BHEL. Stating that he has no bosses in Delhi, KCR said the opponents were making derogatory statements against him, which cannot provoke him. On BJP leaders coming from other places to campaign in the GHMC polls, Rao asked "Is this a municipal election or national election?. A galaxy of leaders of that party are coming from all states." Reacting to KCRs speech, the BJP Telangana chief spokesperson Krishna Sagar Rao in a statement said KCRs speech has openly exposed his fear of losing GHMC to BJP in this election as over 80 per cent of what he said was dedicated to "selling fear to the voters."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/some-divisive-forces-are-trying-to-enter-hyderabad-and-create-havoc-trs-slams-bjp-921038.html

The move is seen as an attempt to clear the confusion on following syllabus for schools owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. Educational institutions have been closed since March following the Covid-triggered lockdown and though the government allowed reopening of schools for Classes 9-12 recently, it later withdrew the order after opposition from various quarters over fears of coronavirus. Stating that he would submit the syllabus reduced by about 40 to 50 percent to Palaniswami on Monday, Sengottaiyan told reporters in Gobichettipalayam in this district that a detailed announcement will be made within five days of handing over the report to the chief minister. He also denied a move to conduct half yearly exams online. An 18-member panel, constituted by the government to look into the aspect of reducing the syllabus for the 2020-21 academic year in view of closure of schools due to COVID-19, had already submitted its report.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/report-on-condensed-school-syllabus-will-be-submitted-to-tamil-nadu-cm-on-nov-30-minister-921087.html
28-11-2020||South||Why can't Hyderabad become Bhagyanagar? asks UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ahead of GHMC polls||Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday took the BJP's electoral battle to the AIMIM's citadel and pitched the idea of changing Hyderabad's name to 'Bhagyanagar'. Boosted by the recent Dubbaka bypoll victory claiming the TRS held assembly seat, the BJP is engaged in an aggressive electioneering fight with the TRS and the AIMIM in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) polls scheduled on Tuesday. The name Bhagyanagar espoused by the BJP drew sharp criticism from the AIMIM as an attempt to communalise a non-issue for the locals. Yogi, who officially renamed Faizabad 'Ayodhya' and Allahabad 'Prayagraj' during his tenure, asked what objection could be raised in the case of the Telangana capital. “If Faizabad can become Ayodhya, Allahabad can become Prayagraj, then why can't Hyderabad become Bhagyanagar?” Yogi said while addressing a public meeting in the religiously sensitive Laldarwaza area of the old city, close to Charminar, where the AIMIM shows dominance. During his campaign for the Telangana assembly polls in December 2018, the UP CM had said that the BJP, once in power in the state, would effect the name change. Yogi's fresh pitch comes at a time when the city's civic body polls scene is already charged with communally polarizing speeches from the BJP and AIMIM leaders. On Saturday, the Hyderabad police booked AIMIM legislator Akbaruddin Owaisi and Telangana BJP chief Bandi Sanjay for inflammatory speeches promoting hate. The suo motu case was registered at the SR Nagar police station. Bandi had threatened to launch surgical strikes on the old city to flush out the Rohingyas and other illegal immigrants. Akbaruddin has challenged the TRS government to raze the memorials of late Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao and Chief Minister NT Rama Rao on the Hussain Sagar lake shores, pointing them as encroachments. Bandi reacted to the controversial remarks by promising to tear the AIMIM headquarters Darussalam to the ground within two hours if the AIMIM dares to destroy the tombs of the iconic Telugu leaders. On Monday, AIMIM Chief Asaduddin Owaisi equated the civic polls to a fight between Hyderabad and Bhagyanagar, asking the voters to choose between the two. The Hyderabad MP's statement was apparently a reference to Bangalore South MP Tejasvi Surya's referring to the city as Bhagyanagar during his GHMC poll campaign. As the Congress party seems to be faltering in the state, BJP leaders perceive the 2020 Hyderabad polls as their access to challenging K Chandrashekar Rao's might in the 2023 Telangana assembly arena. The GHMC jurisdiction covers a whopping 24 assembly constituencies i.e. 20 per cent of the total seats. A good performance here, BJP leaders believe, would help them vastly in spreading the BJP influence statewide. Towards that end, the BJP has roped in its national leadership for GHMC campaigning, including national President JP Nadda and Home Minister Amit Shah.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/why-cant-hyderabad-become-bhagyanagar-asks-up-chief-minister-yogi-adityanath-ahead-of-ghmc-polls-921099.html

"Dakshina Kannada has reported 705 Covid-19 fatalities, of which a majority of them hail from BPL. Already, the government has raised funds in the name of relief. It is not difficult for the government to pay compensation," he said. He accused that the government of not making any preparations to tackle second wave of Covid-19 pandemic.

Punjab CM Amarinder Singh vehemently slammed Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar for allegedly accusing the former of instigating the farmers for protest. Responding to allegations of the farmers' protest being politically motivated and backed by Khalistan, Singh made a strong statement. "Is Amarinder Khalistani? What non-sense is this? Once they say Amarinder is heading it, once they say Khalistan is heading it. Tell them to make up their mind first," Singh told News 18. Khattar had earlier said that the protesting farmers include Khalistanis. Haryana Police has booked state Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Gurnam Singh Charuni and several farmers on attempt to murder, rioting, causing obstruction in government duty and other charges for violations during their "Delhi Chalo" march, officials said on Saturday. A case was registered on November 26 under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 147 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 186 (obstructing any public servant in discharge of public functions) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) among others at the Parao police station on a complaint from Head Constable Pardeep Kumar as hundreds of farmers assembled on the GT road near Ambala Cantt to proceed towards the national capital. National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on Saturday took part in the high-level trilateral maritime dialogue in Colombo among India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Sri Lanka is hosting the fourth trilateral meeting on maritime security cooperation with India and the Maldives. The meeting is taking place after six years - the last meeting was held in New Delhi in 2014. The Indian cricket team was fined 20 per cent of its match fee for maintaining a slow over-rate against Australia in the series opening first ODI in Sydney. India took an unprecedented four hours and six minutes to complete their 50 overs during their 66-run loss in the first ODI. ICC match referee David Boon imposed the sanction after India was ruled to be one over short of the target after time allowances were taken into consideration. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is conducting raids at 40 locations across three states including the premises of some alleged coal smugglers.  The searches which are primarily spread across West Bengal pertain to a new case registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), they said. The officials said that the search operations are going on at 40 locations, with some people involved in the illegal trade and smuggling of coal being raided by the agency. The Sadashivanagar police have registered a criminal case against the Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa's political secretary N R Santosh for allegedly attempting to kill himself in his Dollars Colony residence by consuming sleeping pills on Friday night. According to a senior officer, the case has been registered under IPC section 309. "We are going to question Santosh after he recovers and further necessary action will be taken," the officer added.  Santosh is suspected to have consumed more than 10 sleeping pills around 7.15 pm. He was rushed to MS Ramaiah hospital where he is undergoing treatment in the ICU. The police are tight-lipped about the reason behind the extreme step of Santosh. Islamic State-linked extremists killed four people in a remote Christian community on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday, with one victim beheaded and another burned to death. The group of sword-and-gun wielding attackers ambushed Lembantongoa village in Central Sulawesi province Friday morning, killing several residents and torching half a dozen homes, including one used for regular prayers and services, police said. But authorities pointed the finger at the Sulawesi-based East Indonesia Mujahideen (MIT), one of dozens of radical groups across the Southeast Asian archipelago that have pledged allegiance to IS.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/from-the-newsroom-india-fined-for-slow-over-rate-in-first-odi-criminal-case-against-yediyurappas-political-secretary-921007.html

He was appointed as the CM's political secretary in May this year.  The incident, reportedly caused due to sleeping pills, took place at Santhosh’s Dollars Colony residence.  “This morning, we walked together for 45 minutes. Even yesterday, I saw he was happy. I don’t know why this happened. I will find out and talk to his family,” Yediyurappa told reporters. “He’s getting good treatment. There’s no problem,” he added.  Speculation was rife that Santhosh would resign as the CM’s political secretary following differences with some members in Yediyurappa’s inner circle.   A BE graduate from Kalpataru Institute of Technology, Tiptur in Tumakuru district, Santhosh hails from Nonavinakere in the district.  He was appointed as Yediyurappa’s personal assistant five years ago and was his trusted lieutenant.  Santhosh hit the headlines last year; he was seen playing an active role during the political drama that saw the defection of legislators that helped the BJP come to power.  He, however, kept a low-profile after Yediyurappa became the chief minister. Santhosh was even accused of having joined the anti-Yediyurappa camp, which he later denied.  Santhosh was said to be nursing political ambitions with an eye on the next general elections.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-cm-bs-yediyurappa-s-political-secretary-nr-santhosh-hospitalised-after-suspected-suicide-attempt-920767.html

The ED on Wednesday arrested Amit Chandole, an alleged associate of Sarnaik, in connection with its money laundering case against a security service provider company and others. Before that, the ED had launched searches at properties of Sarnaik on November 24 in Mumbai and neighbouring Thane. In a statement, Sawant said the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) had in 2013 decided to give contracts for providing private security guards. Tops Security Agency and some other companies got contracts from the MMRDA between 2014-2017 and again from 2017 to 2020, Sawant said. Stating that the BJP was in power in Maharashtra when the contracts were awarded to Tops Security Agency, Sawant asked why was the company awarded the contract again in 2017 if the earlier contract involved corruption, as alleged. The Congress leader further claimed that since 2014 (after the BJP came to power at the Centre) there have been several instances of central agencies being used to bring down governments of opposition (non-BJP) parties. "The ED's action against Sarnaik is politically motivated and biased," he alleged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/ed-raids-on-sarnaiks-properties-politically-motivated-congress-920824.html

The BJP, he said, would continue to play the role of an “effective opposition”. According to him, there has been a crackdown on RTI activists and people writing social media posts against the government. “We do not fully subscribe to what Kangana Ranaut or Arnab Goswami says but it has to be noted that the government is cracking down on anyone who is speaking against them. The Supreme Court (in Arnab Goswami case) and Bombay High Court (in Kangana Ranaut) has said clearly that there is a gross abuse of power,” said Fadnavis, adding that "there seems to be an undeclared emergency." According to him, the government had failed on all fronts, and in the last one year, the new dispensation involving Shiv Sena, NCP, and Congress has done only one job – to scrap the projects of the erstwhile BJP-led government. “They (Shiv Sena) have not betrayed BJP, they betrayed the people of Maharashtra. They contested elections as a pre-poll alliance (with BJP), they sought votes in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then joined hands with NCP and Congress,” he said, referring to the political developments a year ago. Referring to NCP supremo Sharad Pawar as a “seasoned politician”, he said that the veteran leader knows how to expand his party using Shiv Sena and Congress. “There is absolutely no coordination between the three parties,” he said. Lashing out at Thackeray, he said, “I have never seen such a Chief Minister who goes all out threatening people… I heard that he is patient. Even I experienced it during the five years (of BJP-Sena government).” Referring to the interview that Thackeray has given to 'Saamana' and 'Dophar ka Saamana' – which was conducted by Rajya Sabha member and journalist Sanjay Raut, he said: “Such a language is not expected from a Chief Minister…you compare Hindutva with ‘dhoti’.” Fadnavis was referring to Thackeray’s statement – “What do you mean… we have left Hindutva…is this a ‘dhoti’? Hindutva has to be in the blood. We follow Hindutva that has been taught by my father (Balasaheb Thackeray) and grandfather (Prabodhankar Thackeray). Don’t get into teaching Hindutva. In this country, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj unfurled saffron and laid the foundation of (Hindavi) swaraj. This land does not follow the Hindutva of ‘dalals'.” Fadnavis further said that he does not find it fit to comment on the 'Saamana' interview.

Earlier in the day, Fadnavis told reporters that he had not seen any chief minister in Maharashtra, other than Uddhav Thackeray, who threatened the opposition "so much", and said his (the CM's) recent interview to 'Saamana' (Shiv Sena mouthpiece) did not befit the constitutional post he held. "When he was chief minister, Fadnavis had threatened that he had 'kundlis' (details) of everybody (political opponents). What kind of language was that?" Raut told reporters while defending Thackeray, who heads Shiv Sena. He also lashed out at Fadnavis for demanding President's rule in the state. "What kind of a precedent does he want to set (by making such demand)?" Raut asked. Queried about the Bombay HC's ruling on Friday in actress Kangana Ranaut case, Raut said, "How can demolition of an illegal construction be called illegal?" In its ruling, the HC declared the Mumbai civic body's action of demolishing part of Ranaut's bungalow here as illegal and said it smacks of malafide intentions. When asked about CM Thackeray not accompanying Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the latter's visit to the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) later in the day, Raut said, "It is surprising that the BJP doesn't know the directives of the PMO that there was no need for official protocol in this visit". Raut reiterated the Sena will not cower down if national investigation agencies are used against its leaders. "The state government is watching the situation. Those who get sadistic pleasure from such things (by playing vindictive politics)...they should know such things don't go on for long," he added. Raut was apparently referring to the searches conducted by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) at the premises of Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik in a money laundering case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/raut-hits-back-at-fadnavis-for-his-barb-against-maharashtra-cm-thackeray-920965.html
