04-11-2020||Comment||Emmanuel Macron, Narendra Modi and Muslims||The recent re-emergence of Charlie Hebdo on the global stage with the killing of a French schoolteacher by a Chechen refugee and the subsequent stabbing to death of three in an ‘Islamic terrorist attack’ in Nice, France, raises some fundamental questions on key liberal values that have shaped Western societies as well as our own Constitution. At the heart of the matter is ‘individual freedoms vs community beliefs.’ Can an individual’s freedom of speech be defended even if it is used to attack the foundational beliefs of a religion and its worshippers? Or should a European/Christian country restrict the rights enjoyed by its citizens so as not to offend the immigrant Muslim population? And can Islamic immigrants living in Europe refuse to integrate into the dominant cultural tradition and seek to impose Sharia laws on their own community?       Would French President Macron have defended Charlie Hebdo’s freedom of expression if it had suggested that Hitler’s ‘Final Solution’ to the ‘Jewish Question’ was right? Or would it be considered ‘blasphemy’? But how can there be ‘blasphemy’ in the absence of ‘State Religion’? In most European states, Anti-Semitism is the new blasphemy as per the London Agreement of August 8, 1948. In France, a newspaper editor or journalist could be imprisoned for up to five years and penalised Euro 45,000 under the Gayssot Act of 1990. Isn’t it a restriction on the freedom of speech and expression? Of course, it is. But it is considered ‘just and reasonable by the majority’ Christian community which has witnessed the horrors of the Holocaust (1933 -45). Is Macron right in considering Muslim immigrants as threatening ‘French civilizational values’? And how does it affect India, another democracy based on liberal values, that has a large Muslim population? The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, set by the Constituent Assembly of 1789, defines: “Liberty consists of being able to do anything that does not harm others: Thus, the exercise of the natural rights of every man or woman has no bounds other than those that guarantee other members of society the enjoyment of these same rights.” So, this liberty is not absolute; it should not harm others. Our Constitution in Article 19 states that ‘all citizens shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression….’ The Supreme Court in its 2016 verdict in Kanhaiya Kumar vs State of Delhi stated that this right is co-related to fundamental duties envisaged under Article 51A, which lists 11 normative restraints. Thus, our Constitution provides for this right with clearly prescribed restrictions and would have certainly frowned upon any such misuse as seen in France.   The declaration of support by Prime Minister Modi to President Macron’s views and actions is in line with the known proclivities of our government in the matter. The present dispensation would not only support Macron but also see the complete justification for their own actions in suppressing the rights of Muslim minorities in India. They see this as part of rising Islamic radicalism and militancy that should be put down with full force of the State or else, they say, the majority will be reduced to minority status in their own homeland. They also see the ‘terrorist attacks’ on innocent civilians as confirming their long-held beliefs. This fits in with their oft-expressed syllogism that ‘since all terrorists are Muslims, all Muslims are terrorists’. That’s a simple logical fallacy of mistaken categories. The events in France further validate the neatly formulated worldview that Hindu Rashtra is meant only for those who regard this land as their ‘pitr-bhoomi’ and also their ‘punya-Bhoomi’. Since Muslims regard Mecca as their punya-bhoomi, they should go there, rather than live here, so goes the argument. This thesis would put about 170 million Muslims in India in the category of aliens or migrants, though a majority of them have ancestry here going back centuries. It is fair to argue that the French government should have put restrictions on Charlie Hebdo in the interest of maintaining law and order and communal harmony. About the Muslim communities living in Europe, there is no doubt that they should respect local laws and cultural traditions of the host country. If they wish to enjoy full rights of citizenship in a democracy, they have to shed their ‘religious identity’ and take on the ‘political identity’ of a citizen of that democracy. They have to separate their religious practices from their civic roles, a dichotomy that does not exist back home in their Islamic countries, most of which are neither democratic nor liberal. Secularism is the only guarantor of survival for minorities, and when a democracy offers that promise, they cannot demand Sharia laws for themselves. That’s part of the Social Contract.   As for the response of President Erdogan, Prime Ministers Imran Khan, and Mahathir Mohammed, who are trying to emerge as defenders of the Islamic faith by condemning President Macron, they should speak of President Xi Jinping’s atrocities against the Uighur Muslims first before lecturing the French President. Secularism is not merely a political project but, at its core, an ethical one. When Prime Minister Indira Gandhi inserted the word ‘Secular’ in our preamble in 1976, what exactly did she mean by it? Was it a declaration of fact or a value; a moral imperative necessary for the survival of a diverse and pluralistic society or a goal to be achieved? Perhaps it’s a goal and is getting ever more distant. Conflicting visions of ensuring a peaceful social organisation of different religious communities is at the heart of the problem faced by Macron, Modi and Xi Jinping. Rightist forces on both sides of the religious and political divide who wish to play ‘identity politics’ offer no solution to this. And the world is becoming more turbulent and polarised, with few saner voices to calm the strife.

04-11-2020||First Edit||Recovery or just a demand blip?||The reporting of a high gross collection of Goods Services Tax (GST) for the month of October is a positive for the economy which has nosedived for months, with the Covid-19 pandemic disrupting every sector of it, aggravating a slowdown which was already weakening it. The Rs 1.05 lakh crore revenue is an eight-month high, and it is 10% higher than the collections over the same period last year. The September revenues at Rs 95,000 crore were also more than the previous month’s collections. These may signal a rise in consumption and of demand. There are signs of better performance on the production side also with Nikkei’s manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) rising to 58.9 in October, which was the fastest expansion in factory output in over a decade. The index of eight core industries in September registered the same level as last year. The monthly sales data for the auto sector and fuel consumption has shown an uptick. Railway freight revenue has started showing an increase. The quarterly results announced till now of some listed companies have also shown promise. But it may be too early to consider these as signs of the economy turning around after its sharpest fall in many decades. The steepness of the fall itself has something to do with the recovery seen now. A part of the increase in GST collections may be attributed to the September 30 deadline for input tax credit. The gradual reopening of the economy after the easing of lockdowns in September and October may have led to the release of a part of the pent-up demand of the previous months. Festival demand, which every year gives a boost to the economy during these months, could have accounted for a good part of the high collections. But It is difficult to predict that the trend will sustain in the coming months. There are warnings about the pandemic making another surge in the coming weeks, and that may lead to more disruptions of the economy. The sighting of the green shoots should therefore be taken with some caution. It may not be right for individuals to make financial decisions and governments to formulate policy on the basis of indicators available now. But individuals, organisations, businesses and governments can help the economy by spending as much as they can. The government, in fact, has a greater responsibility in this respect. Despite suggestions from all quarters that it should spend more and facilitate more spending in order to stimulate more demand in the economy, its response has been timid. The packages that it has announced have not gone far enough, and there is a need for more stimulus.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/recovery-or-just-a-demand-blip-911036.html
04-11-2020||In Perspective||Onion crisis is not new||As onion prices have sky-rocketed to an all-time high, the Minister for Consumer Affairs Piyush Goyal announced that the country will import 25,000 tonnes of onions from Turkey, Bhutan and Afghanistan. He issued an assurance that the imported onions would arrive before Deepavali, would help curb the prices and provide succour to consumers as the ubiquitous, political vegetable continues to make daily headlines. India is the second-largest producer of onion followed by China. We produce 230 lakh tonnes annually and the demand is 200 lakh tonnes. Economically speaking, with the fair play of market forces, the problem of such extreme price volatility should not arise. Nevertheless, the country is witnessing the onion crisis from almost four decades. In 1979, it was Indira Gandhi who used the crisis as a political weapon to ride back to popularity and power! The NDA government has witnessed this crisis several times in the past six years. However, political parties that used this vegetable have not bothered to address the root cause to overcome the crisis. Over the years, their knee jerk policy interventions have complicated the matter, jettisoning the interest of consumers and farmers. This is indicative of long term failure of agricultural policy. The policy paralysis runs deep with regard to most agricultural commodities in the country, and the government enters the scene at the last minute to rein in rising prices by importing produce without any success, or at times even harms the interests of both consumers and growers. Basic factors Fortunately, it is the Rabi crop that meets 70% of demand in the country, whereas the Kharif crop meets 20% of demand. Seven states-- Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Bihar, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh-- produce close to 80% of India’s onions. Over the years from 2012-13 to 2018-19, there has been a 40% increase in production, from 17 million tonnes to 24 million tonnes, overall. The per capita consumption of onion has also seen an uptick over the years with a 40% increase in demand in rural areas and a 20% increase in urban areas. The crop grown during Kharif, in hot and wet conditions, is of poorer quality and prone to fungal and bacterial disease. Bulbs are infected before storage, making it difficult to store. This year the crop was destroyed as the heavy rains and flooding broke the supply chain. This leaves us with the Rabi crop that is of better quality and more amenable to store to meet the country-wide demand. Unfortunately, the storage capacity can handle only 20% of the produce, 30% to 40% of the produce is lost because of bad storage. We need to massively increase storage capacity to be able to handle 20 lakh tonnes of product and be able to moderate temperature and humidity in storage. Incentives of input subsidies to increase storage capacity have not yielded results. We have also failed to develop an appropriate low-cost, post-harvest and decentralised storage technology that can resolve the problem.   Rohit Patel from Dedla village, Jhabua district in Madhya Pradesh has developed a new kind of low-cost onion storage facility. The facility has the capacity to store five tonnes of onion in a 600 sqft structure using local technology of exhaust fans to maintain the required humidity and temperature. In the Sandur region, in Karnataka, farmers store the Rabi crop in low cost ‘onion houses’ for several months to reap the benefits when market prices fluctuate. Devinder Sharma, a Food Analyst says, “at times, onion farmers receive as low a price as 30 paise per kilo and cannot recover the cost, they allow it to rot or dump it on the road. Strangely enough, there is no hysteria in the media drawing the nation’s attention to the plight of the terrible economic hardship of the farmer; it is only when the prices begin to firm up in the cities when the media begins to howl.” Ad hoc and knee jerk measures like importing produce, imposing export bans and limiting stocks have failed to curb prices. In fact, this has led to a glut in the market, making it difficult for farmers to get better prices for their produce. For politicians and the government, resolving the onion crisis has one objective--to provide ample supply of the produce to consumers at a reasonable price. They fail to address farmers’ distress. The average cost of production of the vegetable is Rs 8 to 10 per kg. A farmer should, at least, be able to get a decent return for his investment and labour. Changing climate and rainfall patterns are bound to have a drastic impact on the production and supply of onions in the coming years. It is high time that policymakers learn from the decades-long mismanagement that has resulted in a recurring crisis, move towards a workable model to avert the problem and safeguard the interests of both consumers and growers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/in-perspective/onion-crisis-is-not-new-911044.html

Ajay, Thomas and Shanthikumari, said to be the residents of Chamarajpet, Bengaluru, are the arrested. The police recovered a car and fake notes of Rs 77,000 face value with Rs 200, Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 denomination, from them. The accused had bought breakfast at a restaurant near Donigal, on Bengaluru-Mangaluru national highway in Sakleshpur taluk, giving Rs 500 fake note. The hotel owner, who identified that the note was fake, wrote down the car number and informed the police. The police immediately rushed to the spot and intercepted the car at a little distance. Upon inquiry, the trio confessed to the crime. The suspect revealed that they had started printing fake notes at home using a scanner and printer from March 2020. They had already circulated fake notes worth Rs 90,000. They exchange the notes at hotels, restaurants, shops on the pretext of buying eateries for Rs 50 and Rs 100 and getting the change. Ajay claims that Shanthikumari is his wife and Thomas his son. But, there are possibilities of more people involved in the racket.A probe is on, said Dy SP Gopi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/fake-notes-racket-busted-three-held-911354.html

Around 33 renal patients from Srirangapatna and other taluks are being treated at the dialysis centre at present. M K Agrotech company had donated a dialysis equipment worth Rs 25 lakh. But, the supply of medical equipment like dialister, tubes, gloves and others have been stopped since three months. Currently, the patients themselves get dialisters to undergo dialysis at the centre. Other equipment are being supplied by the government hospital. With the hospital itself facing funds crunch, it has become difficult to spare the funds and the doctors are asking the patients to pay for the treatment. According to the patients, each dialyster costs Rs 750. The patients are purchasing the equipment now. Besides, the doctors are asking for Rs 250 for the use of other equipment. If this dialysis treatment centre stops functioning, the patients have to pay Rs 1,500 every time to get dialysis at private hospitals. Many are undergoing dialysis thrice a week, and it costs around Rs 15,000 per month, which is difficult for the poor patients. The government should release sufficient funds and equipment, they appealed. A private organisation is given the contract of dialysis management. The government pays the company for each dialysis. The company has now informed the employees to stop dialysis, as the government has stopped funding. The medical equipment too are not functioning properly. When this was brought to the notice of the higher officials, they ask us to somehow continue the same, till the new tenders are floated. MLA Ravindra Srikantaiah has asked us to run the centre, by collecting a fee from the patients. It is difficult to run the centre without funds and equipment, opined Dr P Maruthi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/dialysis-centre-on-the-verge-of-closure-patients-worried-911355.html

04-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Pvt schools nonchalant over safety of teachers||It appears like the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) schools are not bothered about the safety of teachers. A few schools do not provide facilities and also deny holidays for staff, to check the contact of infected persons. Teachers in many schools are under fear of infecting the virus as some of their colleagues have tested positive recently. A majority of the schools have failed to keep hand sanitisers, hand wash and other safety equipment. A teacher of a reputed school in Vijayanagar said, “Nearly, five staffers of the school have tested positive for Covid-19 and three of them have recovered. Many of us were primary contacts of the infected, but, the school sanctioned leave only for a day and asked us to attend to work from the second day itself.” Another teacher complained that the management is not allowing leave and is unnecessarily asking the teachers to come to school. Although online classes are being held for Class VII to X students, the school management has directed all teachers from Class I to X to come to school every day. “We have family, children and aged persons at home. How can we manage, if the schools pressurise us to come to school without any precautionary measures?” the teacher asked. “We asked our management to grant leave or at least allow us to conduct classes from home. But, they denied. The management is planning for Christmas holiday. All teachers are made to sit closer and no standard operating procedure (SOP) is being followed from the last two months,” she said. The teacher expressed displeasure over the state government, Education and Health departments and district administration. “State board schools are sanctioned three weeks holiday, but, why CBSE and ICSE school teachers are neglected? Aren’t we human beings? Why the government is discriminating during the pandemic?” the teachers asks. An officer of the Education department claimed that CBSE and ICSE schools do not come under their purview. All schools are supposed to make necessary arrangements and no school should force all teachers to come to school, to conduct online classes. He assured of taking action against the schools violating the norms. A Health department official claimed that the institution head must bring it to the notice of the Health department and the persons, primary contacts of infected patients, must be under quarantine for at least seven days, if anyone tests positive. The officer said that action will be taken against the school managements, if any fail to follow the SOP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/pvt-schools-nonchalant-over-safety-of-teachers-911357.html

Deputy Chief Minister Dr C N Ashwath Narayan likened the arrest to Emergency and said the arrest reeks of vendetta. "The arrest of #ArnabGoswami is reprehensible and stinks of the nasty vendetta that flows in the DNA of @INCIndia! "This glaring misuse of state power to curtail the free press is a grim reminder of the Emergency. We should stand united and speak up to oppose this vile attack," he added. Goswami was arrested in Mumbai for allegedly abetting suicide of a 53-year-old interior designer, a Mumbai Police official said. BJP national general secretary and tourism minister C T Ravi tweeted: "Dear Lutyens Media, The Nation wants to know, are you with Nationalist #ArnabGoswami or Fascist Sonia Gandhi?" Another BJP national secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh too condemned the arrest, saying it was an assault on the Freedom of Expression (FOE). The senior BJP functionary claimed Mumbai Police fed terrorist Ajmal Kasab with Biryani but assaulted media persons who question them on Palghar Sadhu Lynching and Sushant Singh Rajput death cases. Calling upon people to stand up for the cause of Freedom of Expression, Santhosh said it reminded of Emergency. "Media houses , editors & reporters organisations who keep silent today are in a sense tactically supporting MVA (Maha Vikas Aghadi) Govt & Police highhandedness. You will repent for a long time if you dont condemn this act unsparingly," the BJP leader cautioned.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/bjp-leaders-in-karnataka-condemn-arnab-goswamis-arrest-911259.html
04-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||Siddaramaiah will be removed, not me: BS Yediyurappa||Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa hit out at Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah for claiming Wednesday that the state would have a new chief minister after the Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar bypoll results.  Earlier in the day, Siddaramaiah told reporters that he was “confident” Yediyurappa will be removed as the CM after the bypoll results on November 10. He based this claim on information from his ‘sources’ in Delhi.  “Being the Leader of the Opposition, Siddaramaiah is repeatedly making irresponsible statements,” Yediyurappa told reporters. “You will lose Sira 100% under your leadership. Even in Rajarajeshwarinagar, you will lose. It’s the Congress that’s thinking of removing you as leader of the opposition,” he said.  “I didn’t want to react, but I’m speaking since he’s saying this again and again. When we win big in both seats, will the BJP’s strength increase or decrease? Everything will become clear after the results,” Yediyurappa said.  That Yediyurappa will be removed was a claim Siddaramaiah made during his campaigning for the November 3 bypolls. “I don’t know who will replace him, but I’m confident he’ll be removed,” Siddaramaiah said. “This was under discussion from before. Now, it’s fortifying and corruption is one of the reasons he will be removed,” he said.  The outcome of the high-decibel Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar bypolls will not be a referendum, Siddaramaiah said. “But, it will show how people are thinking,” he said, adding that the Congress had a chance of winning both seats.  Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president DK Shivakumar, while expressing confidence, said he had faith in voters. “In any bypoll, we know what happens to the ruling party and the opposition,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/siddaramaiah-will-be-removed-not-me-bs-yediyurappa-911307.html

The phone conversation happened on Tuesday and it is said that Yediyurappa stressed with Nadda that the party’s central leadership should take a decision soon on the Cabinet expansion. The CM also told Nadda that he is confident of winning both Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar bypolls. “Nadda and I have discussed it. If necessary, I will go to Delhi after the bypoll results,” Yediyurappa told reporters. Yediyurappa went to Delhi in September to meet party leaders on expanding his Cabinet. But, he did not get a green signal and the process got halted because of the Monsoon Session of the legislature and the November 3 bypolls. Yediyurappa is learnt to have told Nadda that delaying the Cabinet expansion further would be troublesome. The CM made a case for accommodating into this Cabinet those who helped the BJP come to power. “It will be good if a decision is taken soon,” Yediyurappa told Nadda, sources said. There are six berths vacant in the 34-member Cabinet. Yediyurappa will have to accommodate MLCs MTB Nagaraj, H Vishwanath, and R Shankar - rebels who helped the BJP come to power. If Munirathna wins the Rajarajeshwarinagar bypoll, he could make it in. Plus, Yediyurappa will have to keep space for Pratap Gowda Patil who needs to win the Maski bypoll that is yet to be announced. The CM has also publicly assured a berth for 8-time MLA Umesh Katti, who is sulking. There are several others who are vying to become ministers. Some within the party opine that the Cabinet expansion was delayed because of differing stances taken by Yediyurappa and the party’s top brass. While Yediyurappa prefers an expansion, the top brass wants to promote fresh faces through a reshuffle keeping the next election in mind. It is said that Nadda may hold talks with Union Home Minister Amit Shah and take a call soon. Yediyurappa is expected to go to Delhi to discuss who goes in and who goes out in case of a reshuffle.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/b-s-yediyurappa-j-p-nadda-discuss-bypolls-cabinet-rejig-911342.html
04-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||Siddaramaiah to contest next election from Bengaluru?||Early stage talks are underway within the Congress to get Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah to contest the next general election from a ‘safe’ seat in Bengaluru. Multiple sources confirmed to DH that Chamarajpet legislator BZ Zameer Ahmed Khan had offered to vacate the constituency for Siddaramaiah. The Chamarajpet segment has a sizable minority population. However, no decision has been made, sources added. Currently, Siddaramaiah represents the Badami constituency in north Karnataka’s Bagalkot district. He won this seat in 2018 with a narrow margin of 1,696 votes against the BJP’s B Sriramulu. He had also contested from Chamundeshwari in Mysuru and lost badly, despite being an incumbent chief minister.“Contesting again from Badami or Chamundeshwari may not be safe for him,” a party leader aware of the discussion said.“Also, Siddaramaiah doesn’t want to return to his earlier Varuna constituency, which is currently represented by his son Yathindra.” In the past, Siddaramaiah said that the 2018 election would be his last. However, a ‘safe’ seat will be necessary in the event that he is persuaded by the party to contest the next election, sources pointed out.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/siddaramaiah-to-contest-next-election-from-bengaluru-911347.html

On the other hand, the Congress, which dominated the Upper House for a long time, is now down to 38 seats - its lowest ever tally - in the 242-member House after it lost two more seats to the BJP in the current elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday took a swipe at the main Opposition party saying public anger has reduced the party to such a sorry state that it has been left with less than 100 MPs in both Houses of Parliament together.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dh-toon-congress-at-its-lowest-tally-in-rajya-sabha-911080.html

According to data from the national transporter, till date, more than 2225 freight rakes carrying vital commodities could not be operated due to the blockages caused by the protestors. Around 1350 have been forced to be cancelled or diverted, they said. "Loss already expected to have crossed Rs 1200 crore as agitators have continued dharna at platforms/near railway track. Train movement had to be suspended due to operational and safety considerations as agitators have suddenly stopped some train movements and sporadic blockade continued at various places especially around Jandiala, Nabha, Talwandi Sabo and Bathinda," an official said. "Due to the continued blockages at sections of tracks in Punjab, there has been a major adverse impact on freight movement and hence on availability of vital commodities for farm, industrial and infrastructure sector as well," the official said. Earlier, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal had written to the Punjab Chief Minister seeking assurance about the safety of tracks and running staff to resume operations.  Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh is scheduled to lead a 'dharna' of Congress MLAs at Rajghat here on Wednesday following President Ram Nath Kovind’s refusal to meet a delegation led by him over the Centre’s farm laws. The Chief Minister's Office had on on October 21 sought an appointment for Singh and his delegation with the President to urge him to grant his assent to Punjab's farm bills passed last month by the state assembly in a bid to negate the Centre’s three farm laws. The farmer's agitation in Punjab began around September 24 when they started blocking railway tracks and stations demanding the repeal of new three agriculture-related bills. Farmers in Punjab have expressed apprehension that the Centre's farm reforms would pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. The three farm laws include Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-railways-incurs-rs-1200-crore-revenue-loss-due-to-punjab-farm-law-protests-911169.html

The ICAI said its 3-hour exam is of a different pattern altogether, which have descriptive answers and not tick marks. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna asked the ICAI to publish on its website the steps taken for students welfare with regard to Covid-19 and disposed of the petition seeking a detailed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the examinees in the upcoming CA exams. The Chartered Accountant exams are scheduled to be held from November 21 to December 14. During the hearing, senior advocate Ramji Srinivasan, appearing for the ICAI, said that they don’t have any isolation room as examination centres and don’t have the facilities for doctors. He said that as directed by the top court in its last hearing, they have examined all the suggestions given by advocate Bansuri Swaraj, representing the petitioners. “There was a suggestion that can we hold online exams. Our exams have a different pattern and therefore we cannot hold the online examination”, he said, adding that they test the analytical capabilities of examinees. The bench then told Swaraj that petitioners need to be reasonable in their demands and it was not satisfied with their responses. Srinivasan further said that transport and accommodation were also sought by the petitioner but that is not possible. He submitted that ICAI may request Ministry of Home Affairs to allow e-admit cards to book hotels. The bench said that it is a state-specific issue as earlier when such suggestions were made, the state governments have agreed to do so. It told Swaraj that how can online exams be allowed when the answers are required to be descriptive. “How can this be allowed? Just because courts are allowing many things, you cannot keep on asking what you want. Be reasonable in your demands,” the bench told the petitioner’s counsel. It asked ICAI to put all the information on the grievances raised by the Petitioners on the website and disposed of the plea saying if there is any lapse it will be addressed but exams in the past have been handled well. The petitioners have contended that despite less than a month left for the commencement of the examination, no steps have been taken by the authorities with respect to the safety of examinees. They have claimed that no safety guidelines have been issued by ICAI on how the examinations will be held amid Covid-19 pandemic. The plea alleged that the examination will be in violation of central government guidelines which prohibits congregations of more than 100 persons at an academic institution.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ca-exams-cant-be-held-online-icai-tells-sc-911183.html

As locals in Thulasendrapuram's temple held special prayers for a Democratic win in the Nov. 3 election, 34-year-old M. Umadevi - who was elected to the village council in December - said she related to Harris as a fellow woman politician. "She is a daughter of our village," said Umadevi, who has a five-year-old son and sews clothes to support the income of her husband, a driver. "This must have been difficult and challenging for her. But anything new is like that. I feel both excited and nervous about my new role also." The village, located about 320 km (200 miles) south of the city of Chennai in the state of Tamil Nadu, is where Harris's maternal grandfather was born more than a century ago. Harris was born in California to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father who both immigrated to the United States to study. She visited Thulasendrapuram when she was five and has talked about walking on Chennai beaches with her grandfather. The former attorney general of California, 55-year-old Harris is the first black woman and first person of Indian descent nominated for national office by a major party - and only the fourth woman on a presidential ticket. Umadevi said her priority as a member of the village council, representing some 200 mostly farming families, was to build a tarmac road. "The first thing on my list is to make sure we have a proper road," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview. "It is in terrible shape and you can barely call it a road really. A good road will bring better fortune." Ambitions Unlike Harris, who has a degree in law, Umadevi dropped out of school when she was 15 on her mother's decision. About 60% of girls in India are educated but some states record a higher rate of over 90%, according to India's last census data. In Thiruvarur district, where Thulasendrapuram is located, literacy level is more than 82%, with district education officials stating that all girls were enrolled in schools. Umadevi said education was key if the next generation of girls in the village were to become high achievers like Harris, whose smiling image is plastered on banners in the village wishing her electoral success. "Today, all our girls study, even if it means going to high school that is a few kilometers away from the village," said Umadevi. "College is also far but many still go and get a degree," she said, adding that young people in the area still found it hard to get well-paid jobs. At the Government Higher Secondary School in neighbouring Painganadu village, English teacher S. Tamilselvan has been following Harris's campaign speeches and plans to use them to motivate his students. "She is so articulate and clear," he said. "My students know about her but I want at least some of them to succeed like her. Most of my students are first-generation learners and even the brightest find it difficult to articulate their ambitions." Hemalatha Raja is also a member of Thulasendrapuram's village council. Like Umadevi, she describes herself as a housewife who was elected for a five-year term as 33% of seats were reserved for women. Despite their lack of formal education or qualifications, the two women share Harris's passion for social justice. "I want to solve all the problems that people from my neighbourhood come to me with," said Raja, 36, who dropped out of school when she was 13, since her parents did not want her to travel out of the village to attend high school. "I don't know if I can but I want to try. And all this talk about how someone with roots in our village is doing big things in America also encourages me to do a little extra."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/she-is-a-daughter-of-our-village-kamala-harriss-success-inspires-women-leaders-of-her-ancestral-village-911187.html

The sectors that are witnessing significant uptrend include EdTech and e-Learning followed by healthcare, HR tech and FinTech. "Freshers hiring had dropped down to mere 1.5 lakh during March 25-April 30, from the average 5 lakhs per month. However, the scenario is improving and currently there are around 3.5 lacs fresher job openings listed on the portal,” Teamlease.com and Freshersworld.com VP and Business Head Kaushik Banerjee told PTI. Hiring began to look up for freshers in late June and is likely to pick up more strength during September-November period, he noted. The sectors where these freshers recruitment is taking place the most include EdTech and e-Learning followed by healthcare, HR tech and FinTech. Besides, FMCG, IT and ITES, Manufacturing, BFSI, Telecom, and Semiconductor industries have also sprung back into action, he added. According to CIEL HR Services Director and CEO Aditya Mishra, most companies were impacted by demand contraction but are betting on recovery and are hoping to witness pre-Covid levels of demand in January-March 2021. "Through the weeks of unlocking, freshers hiring has started in the above sectors. About 65 per cent of the freshers who were holding offers slated to join in May-September have found placements. However, the remaining ones are struggling to find work," he said. Considering the off-campus hiring, on an overall basis fresher hiring in the first half (April-September) is about 75 per cent of the last year, he pointed out. Further, he said, large organisations with their campus-hiring infrastructure will adopt new ways of holding campus connect and hiring because fresher hiring is a critical component of hiring strategy for large organisations. “However, we expect salary levels offered in the campuses to decline up to 10 per cent this year,” he opined. Meanwhile, companies have evolved new methods of induction and training for new joinees using various online platforms of learning, a combination of self-paced learning and instructor-led live classes held on video platforms, he added. Indeed India Managing Director Sashi Kumar stated that as per the global job site's data job postings for freshers saw a 26 per cent decline from March to April 2020, following the implementation of the lockdown. "After this slump, job postings for freshers began to see a recovery from June onwards. Job postings for freshers saw a 57 per cent increase from just May to June. In parallel, postings for remote fresher jobs began to pick up from May. There was a 157 per cent increase in remote job postings for freshers from April to May," he said. While job postings for freshers have improved marginally between April and August, however, remote job postings for fresher roles have seen a 364 per cent increase during the same time period, indicating changing modes of work, said Kumar. Leading roles for freshers in terms of hiring include Administration roles (14 per cent), Tech Software roles (10 per cent), Customer Servicing roles (8 per cent), Marketing roles (5 per cent) and Sales roles (4 per cent), he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hiring-for-freshers-improving-likely-to-continue-till-end-of-fy21-experts-911188.html

Tej Bahadur's nomination papers were rejected as the Samajwadi Party candidate in Varanasi constituency in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy adjourned the matter by two weeks. Senior advocates Harish Salve and Satyapal Jain appeared for Modi and others. Tej Bahadur challenged the validity of the high court's judgement of December 6, 2019. The high court has dismissed his election petition as having no locus and further that he was neither a registered voter nor the resident of Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency. In a special leave petition, he contended that his nomination papers were rejected by the returning officer under "illegitimate pressure" from BJP, and sought a direction to set aside the rejection of his nomination papers. The petitioner was sacked from the BSF after a video in which he showed alleged poor quality of foods served to jawans.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-to-take-up-plea-by-sacked-cop-who-contested-against-pm-modi-911204.html

As many as 87 per cent companies plan to give salary increases in 2021 compared to 71 per cent in 2020. According to the survey, companies in India gave an average pay increase of 6.1 per cent during 2020, the lowest since 2009 when the average was 6.3 per cent. The latest Salary Trends Survey in India also noted that companies in India will give an average pay hike of 7.3 per cent in 2021. As per the findings based on an analysis of data across 1,050 companies from more than 20 industries, as of September-October 2020, 87 per cent of surveyed companies said they intend to pay out salary increases in 2021 and 61 per cent of these organisations plan to offer increases between 5 per cent and 10 per cent. In 2020, 71 per cent of companies provided salary increases and of this group, only 45 per cent gave hikes in the range of 5 to 10 per cent. "This is a special year -- business leaders are putting investments in their employees and clients ahead of shareholder return. Despite the gravity of the Covid-19 pandemic in India and its deep impact on the economy, organisations in India have shown tremendous resilience and a mature view on talent," said Nitin Sethi, a partner at Aon and CEO of the firm's Performance and Rewards Solutions practice in India. The survey also said that two-third of the companies either aim to provide similar or higher increments in 2021 compared to the increments offered in 2020. Further, Sethi said "business and HR leaders made hard decisions in second and third quarters of 2020 and are now betting on the green shoots of improving consumer demand. They see the need to invest in talent as a critical part of their recovery and growth prospects". The industries looking to provide the highest salary increases are High Technology (Hi Tech), Information Technology (IT), IT Enabled Services (ITeS), Life Sciences, E-commerce, Chemicals and Professional Services. Meanwhile, companies in the Hospitality, Retail and Real Estate/ Infrastructure industries, which had given very low increases in 2020, are projecting a higher increase for 2021, but still trail most other sectors. "The impact of Covid-19 has been varied on different sectors and organisations. We see high differentials in salary increases -- both intra and inter-industry. "The difference between industries with the highest increase to lowest increase hits 7.2 per cent points as compared to mere 2.4 per cent points in 2019," said Navneet Rattan, Director at Aon in India's Performance and Rewards Solutions practice.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/average-pay-hike-at-61-this-year-likely-to-be-73-in-2021-survey-911208.html

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Saxena, however, submitted that disqualification matters should be heard on an urgent basis before it becomes infructuous. The plea was filed in March, but now, this plea has become infructuous. Such matters become infructuous as time is sought by counsels. Goa, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu matters were all languishing. These are serious matters, he said. "Time is sought by all the sides. Anyways, we will bear it in mind and reject such requests for adjournment," the bench said. Bypolls of seats these dissidents MLAs have already been held on November 3. On October 6, the Madhya Pradesh Assembly Speaker has informed the court that the disqualification petitions filed on March 10 and 15 against 22 Congress MLAs, who defected to BJP, were decided on June 12 by the then Protem Speaker within three months maximum time period, set up the top court in a 2020 judgement. Speaker Rameshwar Sharma, who was appointed on July 2, said 22 ex MLAs were ceased to be members of the Assembly when their resignations were accepted by the erstwhile Speaker on March 10. He maintained the disqualification petitions against them were filed on March 10 and 15. "The time taken in deciding disqualification petition was due to resignation of erstwhile Speaker and due to unprecedented situation arising out of Covid-19 pandemic, which forced complete lockdown in the country," the Speaker said. The Congress government in MP could not continue and the Chief Minister Kamal Nath had to put in his papers on March 20, 2020, after resignations of 22 Congress MLAs, owing allegiance to Jyotiraditya Scindia. Saxena, through counsel Varun K Chopra, said during the pendency of disqualification petitions, 12 out of 22 MLAs have been appointed as ministers on July 2. Even Jagdish Deora, who was earlier acting as the Assembly Speaker, has been appointed as a minister. He also said to the decision by the Protem Speaker was against the spirit of the Tenth Schedule (anti-defection law) and suffered from "mala fides, perversity, and a grave violation of constitutional mandate and principles of natural justice".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-refrains-from-dealing-with-plea-related-to-disqualification-of-mp-mlas-911210.html

The report points out that the legal cigarette industry in India is suffering due to high taxation on cigarettes over the years particularly between 2012-13 and 2017-18. "The Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime introduced in July 2017, increased the tax burden on cigarettes by increasing the GST compensation cess rates by a weighted average of about 13 per cent over the pre-GST tax rates,” the report found.  It further added, "The huge increase in National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) rates in the Union Budget 2020-21 is likely to provide a further boost to the illicit tax evaded cigarette trade in the country." India is the world’s second-largest producer and a major exporter of tobacco, which provides livelihood to 45.7 million people. The industry body pointed out that tobacco products generate tax revenue to the tune of Rs 43,000 crore annually. Yes, illegal cigarettes are cheap but what at what cost? Illegal cigarettes are sold cheap due to tax evasion. Some of the many serious consequences of growth in illegal cigarette trade include: - Aids the prevalence of organised criminal syndicates and terror outfits that control illegal trade in cigarettes  - Undermines the tobacco control policies of the government by not adhering to tobacco regulations  - Adversely impact the demand for domestic tobaccos since contraband products do not use locally-grown tobaccos||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-loses-rs-13000-crore-every-year-due-to-illegal-cigarettes-report-911228.html

Speaking to reporters, Naik's daughter Adnya and wife Akshata claimed they had sent applications seeking justice to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) and Raigad superintendent of police. Earlier in the day, Goswami was arrested from him house in Mumbai by Alibaug Police on the charge of abetting the suicide of the 53-year-old interior designer, a police official said. During their interaction with reporters, Adnya and Akshata ruled out any politics in the case. They thanked the police for taking action against Goswami and requested a fair investigation. "We had made applications to various people including the PMO and SP, Raigad, to get justice for my father," Adnya Naik said. She alleged the investigation into the case was "suppressed only because of Arnab Goswami". Responding to a query, Adnya Naik said they didn't know any politicians. "We don't want to get into politics. We don't know any political party or persons. What we want is justice for my deceased father," she said. Meanwhile, Akshata Naik said they are grateful to the Maharashtra Police for taking action against Goswami. "Maharashtra police are well capable to investigate this case. My husband had mentioned names of three persons including Arnab Goswami in his suicide note but no arrest was made then. He committed suicide only because his legitimate dues were not paid by the accused persons," she said. Police had said that in a suicide note, Anvay Naik, who owned Concorde Designs Pvt Ltd, had claimed that he was ending his life due to non-payment of his dues by Goswami, Feroz Shaikh of IcastX/Skimedia and Niteesh Sarda of Smartworks. Police said that as per the note, the three firms owed Naik's company Rs 83 lakh, Rs four crore and Rs 55 lakh respectively. In May this year, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh announced he has ordered a fresh probe in the case after a complaint by Adnya Naik.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/architect-suicide-probe-quashed-due-to-arnab-alleges-kin-911244.html

In order to ensure uniformity and consistency in deciding such cases, a bench of Justices Indu Malhotra and R Subhash Reddy passed its directions under Article 142 of the Constitution to do complete justice. "Where successive claims for maintenance are made by a party under different statutes, the court would consider an adjustment or set-off, of the amount awarded in the previous proceedings, while determining whether any further amount is to be awarded in the subsequent proceeding," the bench said. The top court noted that there were different statutes like the Criminal Procedure Code, the Special Marriage Act, the Hindu Marriage Act, the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, and the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, for grant of maintenance, if any person having sufficient means neglected, or refused to maintain his wife, children, parents.  However, in spite of time frames being prescribed by various statutes in a vast majority of cases, the applications are not disposed of within the time frame prescribed, the court noted. "To overcome the issue of overlapping jurisdiction, and avoid conflicting orders being passed in different proceedings, it has become necessary to issue directions, so that there is uniformity in the practice followed by the Family courts, District courts, Magistrate courts throughout the country," the bench said. The court said it would be mandatory for the applicant to disclose the previous proceedings and the orders passed earlier, in the subsequent proceedings. The bench also made it mandatory for filing of affidavit of disclosure of assets and liabilities by both parties in all maintenance proceedings, including pending proceedings before the concerned Family court, District court, Magistrates court throughout the country. For the purpose, it also prepared a proforma for it. Senior advocates Anitha Shenoy and Gopal Sankaranaryanan were appointed as amici curiae in the case, arising out of a special leave petition filed by husband, Rajnesh against the directions to payment to maintenance to his wife and a son.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-frames-guidelines-on-payment-of-maintenance-in-matrimonial-matters-911247.html

Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said people were already "struggling" with prices of onion, potato, tomato and now around the festival season, they are also grappling with the high prices of cooking oil. "Prices of edible oil are skyrocketing because of the failures of the central government," Shrinate said at a media briefing. Prices of groundnut oil, soya bean oil, mustard oil, sunflower oil and peanut oil have risen only because of the "faulty" policies of this government, she alleged. "Oil is used by everyone who cooks in India. So from the poorest person to the richest man and there is no elasticity in demand here," she said. "They (the government) should have taken care of this. You cannot make basic commodities unaffordable. You have made a basic commodity unaffordable in India," Shrinate said. She said the poor were struck by a "double whammy" as unlike high prices earlier, the rise in prices now have been being preceded by job losses and wage cuts. "Which is where this government is immoral, which is where this government is inefficient and we strongly call out inefficiency and immorality of theirs," Shrinate said. The UPA government had started a big mission, but this government did not take it to its logical conclusion and that is why the price of edible oils has increased between 33 per cent and 50 per cent, she said. "Today, we see that the dishes before the festivals have been devoid of their sweetness, because the prices of the oil they will be cooked in are on fire," Shrinate said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-slams-govt-over-skyrocketing-edible-oil-prices-amid-festival-season-911284.html

An increase in rail freight collection, higher goods and services tax mop-up, rise in power demand and improved FDI inflows indicate that the economy was doing better in the second quarter of the current financial year, he said. "...economy is coming on track at more speed than expected," the information and broadcasting minister said while briefing reporters after a cabinet meeting here. The increase in power demand was despite lesser consumption by the agriculture sector due to good rains and railways, which is not yet fully operational, Javadekar said. "Despite these two facts, 12 per cent increase in power indicates a complete return to normalcy in the production sector," he added. The economy has dropped by a historic 23.9 per cent in the April-June quarter on account of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus. The RBI too has projected a contraction of 9.5 per cent in the current fiscal. On Tuesday, Finance Secretary Tarun Bajaj too had said the Indian economy is recovering fast and will soon be back on rails as all parameters have started showing improvement. The GST collection has touched Rs 1.05 lakh crore, almost 10 per cent higher year-on-year. E-way bills (GST) have gone up almost 19 per cent in October and valued at 16.82 lakh crore. The railway freight was up by 15.5 per cent in September and almost 14 per cent in October. The foreign direct investment during April-August was $35.73 billion. The economic activity was hit severely following a strict countrywide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus in March. Since then the country has witnessed gradual unlocking and the economic activities have started picking up.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/economy-coming-on-track-at-more-speed-than-expected-javadekar-911292.html

We don't want to stop developmental projects in the country but we can't have a natural wealth of the forests eroded," a bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde told Attorney General K K Venugopal while hearing a plea by the Jharkhand government against the Centre for auction of coal mines. In 2018, the top court directed the Centre to declare 10-km radius around 21 national parks and wildlife sanctuaries as eco-sensitive zones. On Wednesday, the bench also broached an idea to form a panel of experts to examine the environmental aspect with regard to mining.  "We want to satisfy our conscience on the environment. Make everything available to the committee from the state and centre and let the committee take a call within a month. You either don't make a decision for a month or we stay it," the bench told the A-G. Opposing the idea, Venugopal said the mines were 23 to 70 km away from eco-sensitive zones. "But that is dangerously close," the bench said. He, however, pointed out mining can be undertaken after getting clearance certificate under every law. He said the Centre's attempt was to have industrialisation and jobs and development will be impacted by such an order.  Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Sighvi, appearing for Jharkhand government, said its affidavit showed elephant corridor and all animal corridors were within 20 km in all the seven cases where commercial coal mining will be carried out.  "If the commercial mining is allowed then how will the court make it irreversible? The core area and buffer area are both important," he said. Venugopal, for his part, said the Chief Minister wanted the highest revenue from the bid. This was evident from the state's assertion. Let the bidding take place but no work will be done, he said. "We are not sure of the intentions of the Jharkhand government. But we need to see forests are not destroyed in the meanwhile," the bench said. Venugopal sought time to put forth materials to show that animal Corridor would not be impacted by the Centre's decision. "Give me one day time. Rather than long drawn processes of committee let us present some material before the court," he said. The court posted the matter for consideration on Friday. Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for an intervenor contended that satellite images showed that mining will take place amidst the dense forest and nine major lakes. Advocate Prashant Bhushan said that he has filed a plea to stop mining in all eco-sensitive zones across the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-likely-to-ban-mining-within-50-km-radium-of-eco-sensitive-zones-911297.html

While slamming the BJP, Sena minister Anil Parab said Goswami had duped a "Marathi" entrepreneur forcing the latter to commit suicide two years ago. Sena leader Sanjay Raut told reporters the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of the Sena, NCP and Congress has never acted vindictively against anyone since it came to power last year. He also claimed that the state government or any political party had nothing to do with the arrest. Goswami was arrested in Mumbai by Raigad police on Wednesday morning for allegedly abetting suicide of a 53- year-old interior designer in 2018. "Proper procedure of law is followed in Maharashtra. Police can take action against anyone if they have evidence. The state government hasn't acted out of revenge," Raut told reporters when asked about Goswami's arrest. "There is no anarchy in Maharashtra and law of the land is followed," Raut said, adding that Mumbai police is a professional force. "It is not a black day for media. Journalists also should follow ethics. Media is not an investigating agency or court. This observation is of the highest court. We are all journalists. Whoever does anything wrong will be punished by the police," he said. "The state government or any political party has nothing to do with the arrest," the Sena MP said. Taking a swipe at the BJP, Sena spokesperson and state Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab told reporters that Goswami's name was mentioned in the suicide note written by the interior designer. "The Naik family had moved the court and the case is being investigated. Goswami duped the Marathi entrepreneur Anvay Naik due to which he committed suicide. Earlier, the case wasn't investigated two years agoas per the contents of the suicide note. "The Naik family then moved court and the probe started. Where does the question of the attack on the freedom of press arise?" he asked. "There is no politics of revenge. The BJP is trying to save Arnab Goswami as if their party worker has been taken away by the police," Parab said while terming Goswami as the "BJP's parrot". "A Marathi woman became a widow...and the case is being investigated. What is wrong in that? Why is the BJP trying to save him (Goswami)? How can it be called as the state of emergency in Maharashtra when a person booked for abetment of suicide is arrested?" he asked. Parab said why was the BJP keeping mum on two other persons who were also named in Naik's suicide note and arrested. Meanwhile, Maharashtra minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik termed Goswami's arrest as "Part 2 of India's Most Wanted" and recalled the action against a TV crime show anchor who was charged with killing his wife. Suhaib Ilyasi, who had shot into limelight after hosting TV crime show India's Most Wanted was charged with murdering his wife in March 2000. He was, however, acquitted by the Delhi High Court in October 2018. "Once upon a time there was a show called India's Most Wanted & the Anchor highlighted murders & suicides, the same anchor was held responsible for his wife's murder, Minority Affairs Minister Malik tweeted without naming Ilyasi. "Here is Part 2 of India's Most Wanted, another anchor doing the same is now responsible for suicide #ArnabArrested, he added on the micro-blogging site. BJP's state unit chief Chandrakant Patil condemned the arrest saying that it was meant to muzzle his voice for speaking against the Maharashtra government, the Congress and its leadership. Talking to reporters in Nagpur, he said, "It is a murder of democracy and freedom of speech. Arnab Goswami speaks against you (government), Congress and party chief Sonia Gandhi. But on that basis, you cannot arrest him." "Reopening this (suicide abetment) case, which was already closed, means it is an attempt to stop the voice of Goswami. The BJP and the people of this country will not tolerate this," Patil added. He said similar attempts to curb the freedom of speech were also made during the Emergency and Indira Gandhi had to face defeat in the following elections. "We condemn this incident and a protest led by me will be held in Nagpur. Similar protests will be held at other places across Maharashtra," Patil said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/arnab-goswamis-arrest-is-not-revenge-politics-shiv-sena-911298.html

On October 17, the Centre amended the Jammu and Kashmir Panchayati Raj Act, 1989, to facilitate the setting up of DDCs, the members of which will be directly elected by voters in the Union Territory. Addressing a press conference in Jammu, State Election Commissioner KK Sharma said that first-ever elections for the DDC’s and polls for the vacant panch and sarpanch seats will be held simultaneously from November 28. He said that the polling will take place through electronic voting machines (EVMs) while postal ballots will be available for Covid-19 patients in isolation, senior citizens, and physically unwell patients. “The electoral rolls used in sarpanch and panch elections that have been updated on January 1, 2020, will be used for the DDC polls. With the announcement of DDC polls, the model code of conduct is in vogue from today onwards. The first formal notification for the first phase of elections will be issued tomorrow,” Sharma said. He said that delimitation has been done for the constituencies and 280 DDCs have been identified across the J&K UT. “The term of the DDC will be for five years,” he said and added that West Pakistan Refugees (WPRs) will also be entitled to exercise their right to vote for the first time. In the absence of an elected government in the UT, these Councils are set to become a new unit of governance in Jammu and Kashmir. The holding of DDC polls will complete the third tier of Panchayats for the first time in the history of J&K as never in the past the erstwhile UT had elected DDCs, which used to be headed by the Chief Minister and Cabinet Ministers. J&K has been under the central rule since June 2018 when the BJP pulled out of the alliance government with the PDP. The special status of the erstwhile state under Article 370 was revoked in August 2019 by the Parliament and it was bifurcated into the UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/district-development-council-polls-in-jk-to-start-from-november-28-911300.html

The four-member panel constituted by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting also includes IIT-Kanpur professor Dr Shalabh, C-DOT Executive Director Dr Rajkumar Upadhyay, and Centre for Public Policy professor Pulak Ghosh. According to the order on setting up of the committee, there is a need to have a fresh look at the guidelines on rating agencies, particularly in view of the recent recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and technological advancements and interventions to address the system among others. One of the aims of the review is to further strengthen the procedures for a "credible and transparent" rating system. The committee will study different aspects of the TV rating system in the country as they have evolved over a period of time and carry out an appraisal of the existing system. It will also look into TRAI recommendations from time to time, overall industry scenario while addressing the needs of the stakeholders to make a "robust, transparent and accountable" rating system by making changes in the existing guidelines.

Rhea's complaint was based on "unfounded allegations, unsubstantiated facts, speculations and was a counterblast" to the abetment of suicide case filed against her by their father K K Singh in Bihar, the sisters said in a rejoinder in the HC. Priyanka and Meetu Singh have moved the HC seeking quashing of the case filed by Bandra police here against them for allegedly procuring a fake medical prescription for their brother a few days before he committed suicide. The rejoinder came in response to an affidavit filed by Chakraborty seeking dismissal of their petition. Chakraborty, Rajput's girlfriend, had alleged in police complaint that Rajput's sisters, with the help from Delhi-based Dr Tarun Kumar, forged and fabricated a medical prescription for the actor for his anxiety issues. The sisters in their rejoinder said Chakraborty lodged the FIR only "for wreaking vengeance". "This is a classic case of malicious prosecution where the unsubstantiated and baseless allegations do not disclose commission of any offence", it said, also seeking damages for malicious prosecution over a "concocted story". Rajput's father had filed a complaint in Patna, alleging that Chakraborty and her family were responsible for his son's suicide on June 14.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rheas-complaint-is-attempt-to-take-revenge-sushant-singh-rajputs-sisters-911328.html

The first batch of five Rafale jets reached India on July 29, nearly four years after India signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 aircraft at a cost of Rs 59,000 crore. "Second batch of IAF #Rafale aircraft arrived in India at 8:14 pm on 04 Nov 20 after flying non-stop from France," the IAF said in a tweet. The first batch of Rafale jets was inducted into the IAF on September 10. Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on October 5 said that the induction of all 36 Rafale jets will be completed by 2023. The Rafale jets, known for air-superiority and precision strikes, are India's first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 years after the Sukhoi jets were imported from Russia.

The ministry had informed the airlines about the 60 per cent limit through an official order on September 2 but it had not told them the period for which the cap would remain in place. On October 29, the ministry issued a new order clarifying that the September 2 order "shall remain in force until 2359 hrs on February 24, 2021 or until further orders" due to the "prevailing situation of Covid-19". On June 26, the ministry had allowed the airlines to operate a maximum of 45 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic flights. The ministry had resumed domestic passenger services from May 25, after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. However, the airlines were allowed to operate not more than 33 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic flights. Modifying its previous order of June 26 where it had put the 45 per cent limit on the number of domestic flights, the ministry issued an order on September 2 stating that, "45 per cent capacity may be read as 60 per cent capacity." Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in the country since March 23 due to the pandemic.

The senior military commanders of the two nations are likely to hold the eighth round of talks near the LAC on Friday. Lt Gen PG K Menon, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 14 Corps, will lead the delegation of the Indian Army. Maj Gen Liu Lin will lead the Chinese PLA delegation. Lt. Gen. Menon had accompanied his predecessor Lt. Gen. Harinder Singh in the sixth and seventh rounds of meetings with the Chinese PLA’s senior commander. Lt Gen Singh’s tenure as the GOC of the 14 Corps of the Indian Army ended on October 13. The sixth round of talks between the senior commanders of the two sides saw both sides agreeing to stop further deployment of soldiers on the face-off scenes. They however could not reach an agreement to restart the stalled process of pulling back soldiers already deployed on the LAC. The Chinese PLA put forward a fresh proposal for disengagement when the military commanders of the two sides had the seventh round of meetings. The proposal was studied by a panel comprising senior army and intelligence officials, bureaucrats, and diplomats of the Government of India. The Indian Army’s response to it will be conveyed to the Chinese PLA on Friday. The disengagement process the two sides had mutually agreed upon in early July remained stalled since mid-July with the Chinese PLA declining to completely withdraw troops from several “points of friction” along the LAC – like Depsang Y junction, Gogra Post, and the northern bank of Pangong Tso.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/lac-stand-off-india-to-respond-to-chinas-new-troop-pulback-proposal-on-friday-911358.html

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel noted that it has already issued notice to Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and the state governments of Odisha and Rajasthan have already issued a notification prohibiting the sale and use of firecrackers. The green panel sought response from  Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Uttarakhand and West Bengal. "Having regard to further developments... the scope of proceedings may need to be extended beyond NCR so as to suggest that in all the concerned States where air quality is not satisfactory may consider taking action on the pattern of action taken by the States of Odisha and Rajasthan," the bench said. The tribunal said it may have to consider prohibiting the use of firecrackers to protect the health of the vulnerable groups in 122 non-attainment cities where air quality, as per record maintained by the CPCB, is generally beyond permissible limits. "Accordingly, we consider it appropriate to issue a notice to all the States/UTs where the above cities fall, in addition, to notice already issued to the Governments of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. "Notice need not be issued to the States of Odisha and Rajasthan in view of the notification issued by the said States. To all other States/UTs where the above cities fall, notice may be issued by e-mail to the concerned Chief Secretaries returnable for tomorrow." the bench said. The NGT on November 2 had issued notice to the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and four state governments on whether the use of firecrackers be banned from November 7-30 in the interest of public health and environment.

Addressing an election rally in this north Bihar district, Singh, a former BJP president, said the party has taken to their logical conclusion all issues it has been ideologically committed to- be it the Ayodhya temple, Article 370 or expeditious grant of citizenship to persecuted religious minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. That Article 370 should go has been our ideological position since the time of Shyama Prasad Mookerji. We stuck to the stand when the Jana Sangh came into being and remained steadfast in the new avatar the BJP. "Once our party formed a government and mustered the numbers in Parliament, we scrapped it in a snap of the finger (chutki bajaakar khatm kar diya)," said Singh, evoking applause from the crowds. He lamented that despite having enjoyed a special status for so long, J&K, which has now been split into two union territories, remained backward because of rampant corruption and terrorism. But things have begun to look up. A decline in terrorist activities has been noticed in Jammu and Kashmir ever since the so-called special status was done away with. In my capacity as the defence minister, I wish to assure all that the menace will be rooted out in near future, Singh added. Speaking about the CAA, which had triggered country- wide protests late last year and continued till the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, Singh said We were never in favour of Partition. But there were some powers and also our British colonizers, who made it possible. India retained its magnanimity in treating its minorities well. Not so in the new countries that came into being. Our Sikh, Buddhist and Parsee brethren suffered untold hardships in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. They have been forced to live in penury and constant fear of their womenfolk losing their honour. We had promised to bring in a legislation which would provide them with some succour and we did that, he said. About Ayodhya, the former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister said we had pledged that upon coming to power, we will intervene in a manner that will bring to an end the dispute over Ram Janmabhoomi and remove hurdles in the way of construction of a Ram temple. I need not say we have been successful on this count too. Singh lauded Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi for having ruled the state for 15 years without any blemish of corruption.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/terrorism-on-the-decline-in-jk-will-be-rooted-out-rajnath-singh-911360.html

"Video conferencing rooms and witness examination rooms - funding is an issue. I am requesting the Centre to pay in the first instance to states and then adjust accordingly. Right now, for the last 10 months, we are in a pandemic which may continue for 10 more months," amicus curiae senior advocate Vijay Hansaria said. The court was hearing a plea by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay for expediting the trials against former and present MPs/MLAs. In his plea, Hansaria said that the judicial officers, who will be trying cases, must continue for a period of at least two years. He said the delay was due to prosecution not being present.  He said that state governments can appoint nodal prosecution officers for these special courts who will be responsible for proceedings such as summons etc. He also added that the Kerala HC, in its report, said the police avoid arresting the MPs and MLAs. "Criminal cases involving sitting legislators must be given priority as against former legislators, they are lawmakers. If they have murder cases pending against them, they shouldn't be making laws for us. This is in the public interest," he said. The amicus curiae also pointed out that the Madras HC has objected to the order for setting up special courts for trial of MPs and MLAs. "Now, we have travelled long years and a number of orders were passed. Except for the HC of Madras, no HC has raised an objection regarding the constitution of special courts. We'll deal with it after some time," Justice Ramana said. The court also said that it will pass further orders for fast-tracking of cases, as it noted a case was pending in West Bengal since 1981. Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayan, appearing for Upadhyay, said the stay granted in cases as per the recent order, must have ceased to be in operation after six months time. The court also informed an additional court except the one in Bengaluru has been set up in Karnataka to take up cases against sitting and former lawmakers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-asks-centre-to-respond-to-making-funds-for-video-conferencing-and-witnesses-protection-rooms-911389.html
04-11-2020||National||Delhi riots: Court grants bail to activist Khalid Saifi, questions charge sheet against him||A court on Wednesday granted bail to activist Khalid Saifi here in a case related to the February riots in northeast Delhi, saying charge-sheeting him over “insignificant” material was total non-application of mind by the police which went to the extent of “vindictiveness”. The court also failed to understand how a "lofty claim" of conspiracy could be inferred from a witness's statement as it merely stated that Saifi, who is a member of United Against Hate, had allegedly met co-accused Tahir Hussain and Umar Khalid on January 8 in Shaheen Bagh, but did not disclose the subject matter of the meeting. Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav said Saifi cannot be permitted to remain behind bars in this case on the basis of “sketchy” material against him. The court granted him bail on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 20,000 with one surety of like amount in the case related to rioting in Khajuri Khas area. The court noted that if the principal accused, Tahir Hussain, was moved or actuated by Saifi in the meeting, then Saifi should have been made co-accused in ten other cases like Hussain, "which is not the case". It said the date of recording of the witness's statement, which was September 27, itself spoke volumes about the credibility. “The sole evidence of this so-called conspiracy is a statement of prosecution witness Rahul Kasana, wherein he stated on September 27, 2020, that he was standing outside a building in the area of Shaheen Bagh, where he had dropped principal accused Tahir Hussain, and thereafter he saw applicant and Umar Khalid going into the same building. "I fail to understand from the statement how a lofty claim of conspiracy can be inferred," the judge said in his order. “In my humble opinion, charge-sheeting the applicant in this case on the basis of such an insignificant material is total non-application of mind by the police which goes to the extent of vindictiveness,” the judge said in his order. The court said it has nowhere been the case of the prosecution that Saifi was physically present at the scene of crime on the day of the incident and he has not been seen in any CCTV footage/viral videos of the matter. “The applicant (Saifi) has merely been roped in the matter on the basis of his own disclosure statement and fourth disclosure statement of co-accused Tahir Hussain. Even no recovery of any sort has been effected from the applicant pursuant to his disclosure statement,” it said. Saifi has also been arrested in the case related to larger conspiracy in the riots and has been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The court noted that the contention that he had been in regular contact with Hussain and Khalid over mobile phone was hardly of any consequences, as prima facie it did not in any way go on to establish the criminal conspiracy alleged against him in the matter. “In the said case the statement under Section 161 (examination by police) Code of Criminal Procedure of Rahul Kasana was recorded on May 21, 2020, on which date he did not utter a single word against the applicant (Saifi) qua 'criminal conspiracy'...," the court said. Now all of a sudden, he in his statement recorded "under Section 161 CrPC in the matter on September 27, blew the trumpet of 'criminal conspiracy' against the applicant," it said, adding it prima facie does not appeal to the senses. It added that the other piece of evidence which was sought to be used against Safi was a 71-second call made by Hussain to him in the intervening night of February 24/25, after the incident in the case had already taken place. The court said Hussain has been accused in 10 other cases related to rioting but Saifi has been made accused in only two cases, even on the strength of the material that the prosecution showed against him. “I do not find any rationale in the act of police in involving the applicant (Saifi) in this solitary case for the offence of conspiracy," the judge said. Senior advocate Rebecca John and advocate Harsh Bora, appearing for Saifi, claimed he had been falsely implicated in the case and his call detail records did not establish that he was in any criminal conspiracy with the other accused. Special Public Prosecutor Manoj Chaudhary, appearing for the police, opposed the bail plea saying Saifi was allegedly part of a large-scale conspiracy hatched by Hussain with other anti-social elements. United Against Hate was a citizens' campaign launched in 2017 to protest against a series of lynching incidents in the country and was involved in the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act. Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-riots-court-grants-bail-to-activist-khalid-saifi-questions-charge-sheet-against-him-911390.html
04-11-2020||National||HC refuses bail to Wadhawan brothers in Yes Bank case||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday rejected bail applications of Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan, promoters of Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL), in the Yes Bank fraud case, holding that procedures were followed when a chargesheet was filed. Justice S V Kotwal rejected the arguments made by the Wadhawan brothers' lawyers, senior advocates Amit Desai and A M Singhvi, that the CBI failed to follow procedure while filing a chargesheet in the case. The Wadhawans had sought `default bail', claiming that the Central Bureau of Investigation, the prosecuting agency, had not complied with the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) while filing a chargesheet in a special CBI court here. A default bail is given when procedural aspects, such as filing chargesheet within the stipulated period, are not followed. Advocate Desai had argued that under CrPC section 173, a court can take cognizance of a chargesheet only if the probe report is complete. In the present case, the CBI's probe report was not complete and yet the court had taken cognizance, he said. The probe report was not even submitted to the court, but was filed in the court registry, he contended. Advocate Singhvi had argued that the CBI added the offence of criminal breach of trust under section 409 of the IPC later and not while registering the FIR. This was a "subterfuge", he argued. Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, who appeared for the CBI, opposed the bail applications saying that the CBI had followed all procedures. If there were any deviations from the procedure, they took place due to the coronavirus pandemic situation, during which the court had taken precautionary measures for handling of documents, the ASG said. Accepting the central agency's arguments, Justice Kotwal held that the probe report "complied with all the requirements of law and hence was a proper report". Filing the report in the registry was not illegal, the judge added. "Since requisite report under Section 173 of CrPC was filed within time, the right to seek default bail never accrued in favour of the Applicants (Wadhawans)," the HC said. As per the FIR registered in the case by the CBI, Yes Bank invested Rs 3,700 crore in short-term debentures of DHFL between April and June 2018, for which the Wadhawans allegedly gave a kickback of Rs 600 crore to the bank's then CEO and managing director Rana Kapoor. These kickbacks were in the form of a loan to a company registered in the name of Kapoor's daughters, it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hc-refuses-bail-to-wadhawan-brothers-in-yes-bank-case-911400.html

Prakash was seen entering the NCB office in south Mumbai at 12.15 pm. An official said Prakash's questioning was still on. On October 27, a team of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), which is probing the drugs angle in connection with actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death case, had seized 1.8 gram Hashish from Versova residence of Prakash. Prakash had been summoned earlier but she remained untraceable as her mobile phone was switched off, the official said. Meanwhile, KWAN talent management agency, which claims to represent leading actors, has clarified that Prakash was no longer associated with it. "Karishma Prakash tendered her resignation on 21st of October with immediate effect and it was accepted. She now has nothing to do with KWAN or with any of theartists that the agency represent including Deepika Padukone," KWAN co-founder and CEO Vijay Subramaniam said in a statement.

Addressing an election rally at Bihariganj, from where veteran socialist leader Sharad Yadav's daughter Subhashini Yadav is contesting the assembly polls on a Congress seat, Gandhi also assailed the two NDA leaders over job creation. Kumar had promised he would provide jobs to the youth and "change" Bihar, but he could not deliver, the Congress leader said. "When youths today ask Kumar during his public meetings about the jobs he had promised, he threatens them, chases them away and gets them thrashed," Gandhi alleged. He also raked up the issue of Minimum Support Price for maize and paddy and said the money that the farmers should be getting is actually going to the middlemen. He alleged that Prime Minister Modi and Chief Minister Kumar did not help poor labourers and workers during the coronavirus lockdown, rather they got them "lathicharged", and are asking for their votes now. "If the prime minister of India had any place for farmers and labourers in his heart, he would have died but not done what he did during the lockdown. Entire Bihar knows this," he said. He alleged that the PM, through the three recently passed agricultural laws, has "cleared the way for new middlemen". "Not the smaller ones but the bigger ones -- Ambani and Adani. In 2006, mandis were destroyed here and it is being done now across the country," Gandhi claimed. He said prices of vegetable and other edible items are shooting up because of these new agricultural laws as the grains produced here are going to the "bigger godowns" and being sold at inflated rates. Contrary to PM Modi's arguments that the new farm laws have "freed" farmers, they have freed the millionaires. Praising Sharad Yadav, Gandhi said the veteran leader taught him a lot and was in a way a "guru" to him. Gandhi is scheduled to address another public meeting later in the day. The former Congress president had addressed two public rallies in the state on Tuesday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rahul-gandhi-attacks-pm-narendra-modi-nitish-kumar-over-job-migrant-crisis-praises-sharad-yadav-911195.html
04-11-2020||National Politics||Arnab's arrest: Congress slams BJP for selective outrage, says law will take own course||Hitting out at the BJP over its criticism of Arnab Goswami's arrest in Mumbai, the Congress on Wednesday said its "selective outrage" on press freedom is "shameful" and the law will take its own course in the case against the Republic TV editor-in-chief. Goswami was arrested from his residence in Mumbai on Wednesday for allegedly abetting the suicide of a 53-year-old interior designer. Several Union ministers and senior BJP leaders have criticised the Congress over Goswami's arrest and called it an "attack on freedom of press". The Congress is part of the Shiv Sena-led coalition government in Maharashtra. Asked about Goswami's arrest and the BJP's criticism of it, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said she was “actually very shocked with the selective outrage of the BJP of the sections of the government”. “Why are they silent when Prashant Kanojia is jailed for a number of months just because he exposed a scam where children were being served salt and chapati in Mirzapur?" the spokesperson asked, referring to the journalist who was arrested by the UP Police. Addressing a media briefing, she raised several other questions. Why, she asked, is the BJP "selectively silent" when sedition charges are slapped against journalists and when a case has been filed against (Scroll) journalist Supriya Sharma because she exposed the pathetic state of affairs in a village in Varanasi. “And when a reporter who exposed the PPE kit scam in Uttar Pradesh is jailed and faces serious sedition charges instead of action been taken against those responsible for the scam,” she added. "So this selective outrage is extremely unwarranted, is shameful and they (the BJP) should be ashamed of saying anything," she told reporters. Shrinate also hit out at Goswami, saying she herself had been a journalist for almost two decades and alleged that he had brought complete "disgrace and shame" to journalism.  "What he does in the garb of journalism is not journalism, what he does in the garb of journalism is the work of a BJP frontal," Shrinate said. "To accuse people, to hurl abuses, to make any sort of allegations, to use the language that he does. Is he judge or jury? What sort of journalism is he doing in the garb of running a TV channel," she said. Shrinate said the BJP should be the last one to be talking about freedom of the press.  She also accused the BJP of controlling the media through advertisements and through "intimidation and fear". "I am reasonably certain that wherever Congress is in government or we are in alliance, people will not be punished if they are absolutely innocent.  I also believe that law will take its own course even in this case," she said. The Congress believes in the independence of institutions and has never compromised their independence or autonomy, Shrinate said. Goswami, who was seen being pushed into a police van, claimed he was assaulted by police at his home. BJP president J P Nadda and various senior Union ministers, including Amit Shah, slammed Goswami's arrest, describing it as a "blatant misuse of state power" and reminiscent  of the Emergency.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/arnabs-arrest-congress-slams-bjp-for-selective-outrage-says-law-will-take-own-course-911198.html
04-11-2020||National Politics||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh begins dharna in Delhi amid Centre's rebuke||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday launched a sit-in protest in Delhi accusing the Modi government of meting out step-motherly treatment to the frontier state by refusing restart railway services suspended due to the farmers’ agitation over agri-reforms. The suspension of Railway services has pushed the state on the brink of a blackout as power plants have run out of coal and forced to shut down and the supply of fertilisers too has taken a hit in the middle of the rabi season. The Modi government rejected Singh’s allegations and asked the Punjab government to talk to the farmers and end the “political agitation” against the farm sector reforms.  Prakash Javadekar accused the Chief Minister of indulging in misleading propaganda over the farm sector reforms. “The common farmers have come to the market to sell paddy and benefited from the increased minimum support price. There have been higher procurement of paddy this year. Farmers have expressed their belief in the new system,” the Information and Broadcasting Minister told reporters in Delhi. Earlier, Singh launched the relay sit-in protest by a visit to Rajghat with Congress MPs and MLAs in tow. Singh then drove down to Jantar Mantar where Congress MLAs and MPs from Punjab had gathered for the protest. Protesting MLAs accused the central government of trying to “choke Punjab” with the suspension of goods trains, where all essential goods are now in short supply, including coal for power plants and fertilizer for Rabi crops. Amarinder said that he had sought a meeting with President Ram Nath Kovind to discuss the food security issues in Punjab and not the three farm sector laws passed by the Punjab assembly, which are pending approval from the state Governor. “The Governor has no role to play in this, he should have sent the Bills to the President by now, he is a mere post-box in such matters, so why has he not forwarded the Bills till now,” he asked. Punjab had not been paid GST dues since March and its constitutional guarantee of Rs 10 crore was also pending, he said, adding that Disaster Relief Fund had also been stopped by the Centre. “We don’t have money, our coal stocks are over, how can we survive in this situation,” Singh asked.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/punjab-chief-minister-amarinder-singh-begins-dharna-in-delhi-amid-centres-rebuke-911237.html
04-11-2020||National Politics||Politics prevails over Covid-19 pandemic in West Bengal||Political parties in West Bengal are throwing caution to the wind even as total Covid-19 cases in the state is inching closer to the 4-lakh mark. With the Assembly elections barely six months away, political activities in the state are in full swing and gross violations of physical distancing norms are taking place. Rallies, crowded meetings, protest demonstrations are being held by the major political parties, risking the lives of their workers. BJP, the main opposition force in the state, is leading from the front when it comes to holding political gatherings where physical distancing norms go for a toss. A look at the recent activities of the saffron party, which has its eyes set on coming to power in Bengal, makes it evident. BJP’s march to the State Secretariat last month showed that it has scant concern for the pandemic. Very few BJP workers bothered to wear masks and got involved into long tussles with the police. Large gatherings were held at several places in Kolkata and Howrah, where BJP workers clashed with the police. Least concern of the party leaders for the pandemic became clear in a remark made by state president Dilip Ghosh at a rally in Hooghly district. “ The coronavirus has left but Didi (as Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is often referred to) is imposing lockdown to stop BJP,” said Ghosh. BJP held several protest demonstrations when one of their former councilors was shot dead. Apprehensive that BJP will gain additional political mileage, the Trinamool Congress (TMC), CPI(M) and Congress swung into action. TMC held scores of rallies across the state against the contentious Farm Laws and the Hathras incident. The Chief Minister herself led a massive protest march in Kolkata, attended by thousands of people. Not to be left behind, the CPI(M) also hit the streets. Ironically, the party headed in Bengal by state Secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra, a doctor, is organising large gatherings amid the pandemic. Congress also is no exception.  It appears that votes are more important to the political parties in Bengal than the pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/politics-prevails-over-covid-19-pandemic-in-west-bengal-911296.html
04-11-2020||North and Central||Top BJP leaders, journalists find fault with Arnab Goswami arrest; Congress questions BJP's 'selective outrage'||BJP president J P Nadda and senior Union ministers on Wednesday slammed the arrest of Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami by the Mumbai Police, with Home Minister Amit Shah describing it as a "blatant misuse of state power" which reminds of the Emergency. Goswami was arrested in Mumbai for allegedly abetting suicide of a 53-year-old interior designer, a Mumbai Police official said. Congress and its allies have shamed democracy once again. Blatant misuse of state power against Republic TV & Arnab Goswami is an attack on individual freedom and the 4th pillar of democracy. It reminds us of the Emergency. This attack on free press must be and WILL BE OPPOSED. "India didn't forgive Indira Gandhi for the Emergency. India never forgave Rajiv Gandhi for his assault on press freedom. And now, India will again punish Sonia-Rahul Gandhi for their brazen and intimidating use of state power to get equal with journalists," Nadda tweeted. Asserting that every person who believes in a free press and freedom of expression was furious at the Maharashtra government's "bullying and harassment" of Goswami, the BJP chief said, "This is yet another instance of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi-directed antic of silencing those who disagree with them. Shameful." India didn’t forgive Indira Gandhi for the Emergency. India never forgave Rajiv Gandhi for his assault on press freedom. And now, India will again punish Sonia-Rahul Gandhi for their brazen and intimidating use of state power to get equal with journalists. Goswami, who was seen being pushed into a police van, claimed he was assaulted by police at his home. Reacting to Goswami's arrest, Shah said the Congress and its allies have shamed democracy once again. "Blatant misuse of state power against Republic TV and Arnab Goswami is an attack on individual freedom and the 4th pillar of democracy. It reminds us of the Emergency. This attack on free press must be and will be opposed," he tweeted. Several Union ministers, including Prakash Javadekar and S Jaishankar, described Goswami's arrest as "an attack on the freedom of press".  "Those who really believe in this freedom must speak up...Shades of the Emergency," Jaishankar tweeted. In a series of tweets, Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the arrest of senior journalist Goswami was "seriously reprehensible, unwarranted and worrisome." "We had fought for freedoms of Press as well while opposing the draconian Emergency of 1975," Prasad said. He said while Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have targeted the Modi government "through motivated charges of attack on institutions", yet they are completely silent when their own government in Maharashtra is "blatantly suppressing freedom of Press." He claimed it to be a "textbook case of hypocrisy." Information and Broadcasting minister Javadekar said it is reminiscent of "Emergency days". He also hit out at the Congress, saying its "fascist and Emergency mindset" is on display in Maharashtra. Javadekar said, "We condemn the attack on press freedom in Maharashtra. This is not the way to treat the Press." WCD Minister Smriti Irani tweeted that if those in free press don't stand up in support of Goswami then they are tactically in support of fascism. Those in the free press who don’t stand up today in support of Arnab, you are now tactically in support of fascism. You may not like him, you may not approve of him,you may despise his very existence but if you stay silent you support suppression. Who speaks if you are next ? "Those in the free press who don't stand up today in support of Arnab, you are now tactically in support of fascism. You may not like him, you may not approve of him, you may despise his very existence but if you stay silent you support suppression. Who speaks if you are next?," she tweeted. Later in a press conference at the BJP head office here, Sambit Patra dubbed the arrest of Goswami as a "black day" for journalism and said that "this is not only an attack on the fundamental rights of the press, the reporters and the editors, but also on the core of our democracy." The BJP spokesperson said at a time when the country is fighting against COVID-19, the Congress-backed government in Maharashtra is arresting journalists, particularly those who have questioned the state government for its failures in handling the pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/top-bjp-leaders-journalists-find-fault-with-arnab-goswami-arrest-congress-questions-bjps-selective-outrage-911122.html
04-11-2020||North and Central||At 10.6 degrees Celsius, Delhi records another cold morning||The national capital witnessed another cold morning on Wednesday, with the minimum temperature settling at 10.6 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the temperature met the criteria for “cold wave” on Tuesday but not Wednesday. For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days. On Tuesday, the minimum temperature had dropped to 10 degrees Celsius, the lowest in the season so far. It was less than that of Dalhousie (10.9 degrees Celsius), Dharamshala (10.6) and Mandi (10.2) in Himachal Pradesh and Mussoorie (10.4) in Uttarakhand. Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of IMD, said a similar situation is expected to prevail for another four to five days. He said the month of November this year is expected to be the coldest in the last four to five years. Normally, the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, records a minimum of 14.8 degrees Celsius in the first week of November. The mercury dips to 11-12 degrees Celsius by the last week of November, according to IMD officials. The senior IMD scientist said the minimum temperature is expected to be recorded in single digits in the next three to four days. Delhi has been witnessing a trend of low minimum temperatures due to the absence of cloud cover, he said. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground. Also, there has been snowfall in the higher reaches of Himachal Pradesh in the last three to four days, so cold winds from that region have started affecting Delhi's weather, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/at-106-degrees-celsius-delhi-records-another-cold-morning-911132.html
04-11-2020||North and Central||Madhya Pradesh bypolls outcome to be litmus test for 3 leaders||The result of Tuesday's bypolls to 28 Assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh will not only decide the fate of the BJP government in the state, but also have a bearing on the political future of three regional satraps- Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, his predecessor Kamal Nath and BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia. The political drama in the state that unfolded in the state earlier this year involved these three influential leaders. In March this year, the 15-month-old Kamal Nath-led government in the state collapsed following the resignation of 22 rebel Congress MLAs in support of Scindia, after he quit the grand old party. This paved the way for the BJP's return to power with Chouhan taking oath as the CM for a record fourth time. There is a talk in political circles that Scindia, who became the BJP's Rajya Sabha member in June this year, is aspiring for a berth in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet. When Scindia was in Congress, he had lost the race for chief ministership to Kamal Nath after the 2018 state assembly election. The BJP sensed an opportunity in his frustration and rode back to power in the state on his and his supporters' rebellion seven months ago. If Chouhan, a member of other backward classes (OBC) that accounts for more than 50 per cent population of MP, pulls off a victory on more than 15 seats, it would further bolster his position in the party, feel political observers. After Scindia's rebellion, the BJP's central leadership picked Chouhan to lead the party due to his pan- Madhya Pradesh acceptability and high hopes that he would deliver in the by-elections, they added. During his cabinet formation, he did not have a free hand and kept shuttling between Bhopal and New Delhi, they said. Madhya Pradesh has a 230-member Assembly. However, due to the resignation of one more Congress MLA recently, the effective strength of the House came down to 229. The BJP currently has 107 MLAs and needs to win eight more seats to attain a simple majority in the House. The Congress's tally has been reduced to 87 after the resignation of 26 MLAs since March this year. The magic figure of 115 does not look unattainable for Chouhan right now. But if he fails, the going will get tougher given the rivalry within the party and its central leadership will get an opportunity to subjugate him, political observers feel. Similarly, Nath, who is the state unit chief of Congress, also faces an uphill task of putting up a good show in the bypolls even if he is not able to bring the party back to power. He has steered the party through the intense campaign in the absence of other national stars like Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi. "If the party fares poorly in the bypolls, Nath's position as the state unit chief and Leader of Opposition may also be challenged in view of 'one man-one post' norm," Rasheed Kidwai, author of "Sonia A Biography", said. According to a Congress legislator, two months ago, when he (Nath) held a meeting of MLAs at his residence to bring his party flock together, an MLA close to him had found faultin theway the organisation is being run. Nath needs to win all the 28 seats to reach the majority figure of 115 seats. If he trounces the BJP in more than 20 seats, a figure looking unachievable right now, not only he may pose a serious challenge to the Chouhan government, but his standing in his own party will go up, Kidwai said. "The veteran Congress leader is a shrewd politician and can rock the boat of Chouhan given the fact that Scindia's loyalists had got a big slice of the cake in the state cabinet causing heartburns to senior BJP legislators," he added. Two BSP, one SP and two Independents have already switched sides twice since December 2018- supporting the Congress when it formed the government and later jumping upon the BJP bandwagon when Chouhan became chief minister in March. Two Independents are already with the Congress, Kidwai, who is also a fellow at Observer Research Foundation, said. To score some brownie points and to reach the Union Cabinet with a pride Scindia will have to garner more than 10 seats from 16 in Gwalior-Chambal region during the by-polls, senior journalist Rakesh Dixit said. "Already, he has been dwarfed in the Madhya Pradesh BJP. That is why, four more Congress MLAs have been cajoled and brought to the BJP after March when Scindia led a rebellion in Congress and toppled the Nath government," he said. The Scindia camp in the ruling BJP is dejected after his name was placed very low in the pecking order of the party's star campaigners list for the by-elections. Last month, Scindia had called on RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat at Nagpur apparently to firm up his position in the BJP, he said. Scindia had in fact also visited the state RSS office- Samidha- to prevail over the BJP cadre to work for the victory of his 22 loyalists in the fray, knowing that they are being cold-shouldered by the saffron party's rank and file, Dixit added. Estimated 69.93 per cent voters exercised their franchise in the crucial state bypolls on Tuesday and the counting of votes would take place on November 10.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/madhya-pradesh-bypolls-outcome-to-be-litmus-test-for-3-leaders-911133.html

04-11-2020||North and Central||J&K bringing surrender policy to encourage militants to give up arms||The Jammu and Kashmir government in consultation with the Center is soon rolling out a comprehensive surrender policy to encourage local militants to give up arms. In order to encourage local militants to join the mainstream, the policy provides rehabilitation through different means like the establishment of business units, for those who surrender. The previous rehabilitation policies for surrendered militants offered cash incentives and money in lieu of arms and ammunition However, this initiative will not cover foreign militants or those found to have been involved in heinous crimes. The policy entails amnesty from prosecution for local militants who surrender and if a surrendered militant gets a job, he wouldn’t be disqualified because of his past. Sources said the new policy is a revised version of earlier initiatives, but with a fresh focus on socio-economic reintegration. “Top brass of the Army, other security agencies, J&K Police and Intelligence agencies besides all other stakeholders, which were engaged in dealing with anti-militancy operations, have been taken on the board to incorporate their opinion,” they said. Sources said top officials of the Defence Ministry are in consultations with the Union Home Ministry to give a final touch to the policy, which is likely to be rolled out soon. “Besides local militants, over-ground-workers (OGWs) have also been kept in mind while finalizing the policy. The government plans to wean away not only local militants but their OGWs as well, from the militancy,” they said. A senior official said even the successful rehabilitation of one hardcore surrendered militant will motivate others to follow suit. “As the views of all major stakeholders, there is not going to be any opposition to the policy like the previous ones. Previous such policies failed as both the Central and State governments failed to provide adequate security to the militants following their surrender,” he said. “In some cases, the promised benefits were not delivered. These shortcomings not only instilled fear amongst militants regarding threats from terrorist outfits but also jeopardized their and their families’ social and economic situations following their surrender,” the official said and added in the new policy all these issues have been taken care of. The J&K police and the Army, of late, have started a surrender policy for the local youth, where parents of the trapped militants are called to the encounter site to convince them to surrender. In almost all the encounters, the local militants are being given a chance to give up arms and surrender. The first surrender policy in Jammu and Kashmir was introduced in 1995 when militancy was at its peak. It promised a fixed deposit of Rs 1.5 lakh, a monthly stipend of Rs 1,800 and some vocational training for the militants who surrendered. In 2004, a new policy was approved which was applicable to “known militants who surrender with weapons” and “dreaded militants even without weapons”. It also promised a fixed deposit of Rs 1.5 lakh, a monthly stipend of Rs 2,000 and some vocational training. In 2010, another policy was announced for Kashmiri militants who had gone to Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK) for arms training between 1989 and 2009 and wanted to return.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jk-bringing-surrender-policy-to-encourage-militants-to-give-up-arms-911186.html

Kejriwal said people do not need to panic and the government was monitoring the situation regularly. "Delhi has witnessed a jump in the number of Covid-19 cases. I think we can call it a third wave," he told reporters. "We have been monitoring the situation continuously and there is no need to panic. We will take whatever steps are needed," the chief minister said.    The government's priority is to give best treatment and healthcare facilities to Covid-19 patients in Delhi and to keep the death rate as low as possible, he said. The chief minister said there was no shortage of beds for coronavirus patients in the city.  "However, there is scarcity of ICU beds in some big, private hospitals. But we are trying to set things right," he said. "The Delhi government had increased their numbers (ICU beds in private hospitals) but unfortunately, the Delhi High Court stayed our decision. We are moving the Supreme Court today to urge it to vacate the stay," Kejriwal said.  Delhi recorded over 6,700 fresh Covid-19 cases for the first time on Tuesday, taking the infection tally in the city to over 4 lakh, even as the positivity rate stood at 11.29 per cent amid festive season and rising pollution in the city. The previous highest single-day spike till date here - 5,891 cases - was recorded on Friday. The 6,725 fresh cases came out of the 59,540 tests conducted the previous day. Forty-eight new fatalities were recorded, pushing the death toll in the national capital to 6,652, according to the bulletin issued by the Delhi health department.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/third-wave-of-covid-19-in-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-asks-not-to-panic-911226.html

Despite Punjab government's request to the Centre to operate trains in the state to ensure smooth movement of goods, the Railways says the farmers sitting on tracks or station premises at 32 places. According to data from the national transporter, till date, more than 2225 freight rakes carrying vital commodities could not be operated due to the blockages caused by the protestors. Around 1350 have been forced to be cancelled or diverted, they said. "Loss already expected to have crossed Rs 1200 crore as agitators haveÂ continued dharna at platforms/near the railway track. Train movement had to be suspended due to operational and safety considerations as agitators have suddenly stopped some train movements and sporadic blockade continued at various places especially around Jandiala, Nabha, Talwandi Sabo and Bathinda," an official said. "Due to the continued blockages at sections of tracks in Punjab, there has been a major adverse impact on freight movement and hence on availability of vital commodities for farm, industrial and infrastructure sector as well," the official said. Earlier, Railways Minister Piyush Goyal had written to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh seeking assurance about the safety of tracks and running staff to resume operations. While Punjab government claims that many places railway tracks are free, the Railways says safety of its properties and staff top priority. The farmers' agitation in Punjab began around September 24 when they started blocking railway tracks and stations demanding the repeal of new three agriculture-related bills. The three farm laws include Farmers'' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; Farmers'' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill. Farmers in Punjab have expressed apprehension that the Centre''s farm reforms would pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/punjab-farm-protests-continuing-at-32-railway-premises-says-national-transporter-911245.html
04-11-2020||North and Central||Is Mayawati's BSP heading for yet another split in Uttar Pradesh?||With seven party legislators virtually switching loyalty to the Samajwadi Party (SP) and several senior leaders raising a banner of revolt against party supremo Mayawati, the Bahujan Samaj Party appears to be headed for yet another split in Uttar Pradesh. Though Mayawati suspended the seven rebel MLAs, there were reports that some more party lawmakers could jump the ship in the days to come. BSP had won 19 seats in 2017 UP Assembly polls. While it lost an earlier bypoll at a seat vacated by its sitting MLA after the latter was elected to the Lok Sabha, the loss of seven lawmakers has further reduced its strength to only 11. If the claims by the SP had any substance then this tally could come down further in the days to come. ''Several senior BSP leaders, especially Muslims, are in touch with us and will leave the party in the very near future,'' claimed a senior SP leader here.   Congress was also trying to woo the 'Dalit' and Muslim leaders of the BSP with a promise of ''giving them due honour'' should they decide to join the grand old party. Although the BSP, which had split on several occasions in the past since it was founded in 1984, the ongoing tussle within the party assumed added significance as it could threaten the electoral prospects of the party in the politically crucial state of UP, where Assembly elections were due in less than one and half year time. Barely ten years after its formation the BSP had suffered its first split, when Raj Bahadur, one of the founding members of the party, had parted ways with 20 legislators and formed a new outfit. BSP experienced another split in 2003 when around a dozen party MLAs defected to the SP and helped the latter form government in the state. Mayawati may be claiming that everything was well within the party, sources said that there was resentment among the leaders and workers following her declaration that she could support the BJP to teach the SP a lesson. With the Bhim Army, a 'Dalit' outfit, going all out to expand its base among Mayawati's core vote bank, the desertions in the BSP could spoil the BSP supremo's dreams to come back to power in the next Assembly polls.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/is-mayawatis-bsp-heading-for-yet-another-split-in-uttar-pradesh-911254.html

Police had arrested four men on Tuesday for chanting Hanuman Chalisa at an Idgah on the Goverdhan-Barsana road, about 20 km from Mathura, a day after a man named Faisal Khan was arrested and sent to 14 days in judicial custody for offering namaz on the premises of a Mathura temple. However, Khan's organization, Delhi-based Khudai Khidmatgar, claimed that he offered prayers in the temple complex only with the permission of the priests there. On Tuesday, BJP leader Manupal Bansal recited Hanuman Chalisa at a mosque in Vinaypur village under Kekda Police Station area in Baghpat and also posted a video of the incident on Facebook. The local police is investigating the matter, Superintendent of Police, Baghpat, Abhishek Singh said on Wednesday, adding that Bansal visited the mosque often and had taken the permission of the mosque's maulvi -- Ali Hassan -- so a case could not be lodged. Bansal, who is the member of district working committee of the BJP, said that he recited Hanuman Chalisa to promote amity and brotherhood after taking Hassan's permission. Besides Hanuman Chalisa, Gayatri Mantra was also chanted, Bansal added. The district unit president of the BJP Surajpal too said that Bansal had taken the maulvi's permission. Talking to media persons, Hassan said he allowed Bansal to recite the Hindu prayers as there is nothing wrong in it and everyone needs to work to promote brotherhood. Earlier, a local leader of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad had announced that he would recite Hanuman Chalisa at Fuiswali Masjid in Badaut area of Baghpat during Friday prayers after which the police are on a high alert.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/local-bjp-leader-recites-hanuman-chalisa-at-mosque-in-ups-baghpat-911399.html
04-11-2020||Oasis||Our past is present||When weighed down by difficulties and disappointments, you are often told to ‘let the dead past bury its dead’. Sound advice, but only to a certain extent. Putting the past completely out of mind can relieve you and help you set your sights on the future, but the past cannot be discounted altogether. This is because each of us is the total sum of our yesterdays. It is clear therefore that our past is always present. There are however encouraging features to this for as Socrates remarked, ‘The unexamined life is not worth living.’ In our day to day living, the past intrudes frequently. When one is ill, the doctor takes a history of the case. This enables him to get closer to the right diagnosis. We celebrate birthdays and all manner of anniversaries because they bring memories that we cherish. The past is a precious treasure-chest containing all that we have experienced, achieved and celebrated. At any given moment, our identity is a composite of all we have been and done in the past. Some actions brought knowledge and wisdom, but others haunt us because we were not at our best. However, reliving the past and brooding over it can only harm us. What will be of help is sincere regret and it lies in responsible behavior in the here and now. This the only way to free ourselves from the bondage and sorrows of the past for what has happened can never be erased. Fortunately, the unchanging nature of the past can also be a great blessing and it can be best explained by those who have reached the sunset of their lives. As the psychiatrist, Viktor Frankl has pointed out, "the potentialities to fulfil a meaning (to Life) are affected by the irreversibility of our lives." No one lives forever, but every moment given to us brings us the choice to use it or abuse it. Those who lead productive lives, display integrity and show compassion succeed in transforming what were opportunities into realities. Nobody and nothing can ever rob them of these treasures that their past holds. It is a past that can never die and needs, of course, no burial, for it has the power to yield roses in winter!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/our-past-is-present-911052.html
04-11-2020||Opinion||Does Joe Biden really want to be US President?||When the gods want to punish you, Oscar Wilde wrote, they answer your prayers. The gods must really have it in for Joe Biden. At 77, he finally stands on the cusp of the presidency, a prize he’d be winning later in life than any of his forebears, one that surely came into his sights not in 1987, when he began the first of three presidential campaigns, but all the way back in 1973, when he entered the Senate at the age of 30. He has been praying for this, I’d wager, for nearly half a century. But he never prayed for this: a pandemic that may be approaching its peak, an economic catastrophe that’s nowhere near its end, a nation more nastily divided than at any point in his career, a Democratic Party whose lidded tensions could boil over at any moment, and an opponent who, if defeated, would not go gently and would command his conspiracy-minded followers to rage in concert with him. My Election Day question for Biden isn’t whether he’s confident he’ll win. It’s whether he’s really, really sure he wants to. “Biden may see the most complicated set of problems in several generations,” said Mike Leavitt, a Republican who served as the governor of Utah for 10 years and as the U.S. secretary of health and human services for four, and was in charge of planning Mitt Romney’s possible transition to the presidency in 2012. I asked Leavitt which if any American presidents over the past 100 years took office in circumstances as daunting as those that Biden if elected, would face. “I’m not a student of Roosevelt,” he said, referring to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, “but you have to go back at least that far.” “It is staggering,” Claire McCaskill, the Democratic former senator from Missouri, told me. “It is staggering.” One “staggering” wasn’t enough to describe Biden’s potential burden, the heaviness of which left political veterans grasping for adjectives and analogies. “His to-do list is just … gross,” she said. Of course, there’s no telling if he’ll get to tackle it. Trump is a proven magician with all sorts of tricks up his sleeve. But enough battleground-state polls have put Biden in the lead long enough to justify contemplation of his victory. His timing is terrible — again. When he and Barack Obama beat John McCain and Sarah Palin, they won the responsibility of navigating a global financial crisis, arresting the worst economic downturn in America since the Great Depression and extracting the country from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that’s a veritable rom-com next to the horror show of 2020, whose full terrors took shape after Biden committed to his presidential bid. He knew going in that Trump would fight dirty, exit messy, and bequeath an even more toxic political environment than he inherited. He couldn’t foresee the breadth and depth of America’s hurt right now. There is a singularly inverse relationship between the stubbornness of his ambitions and the gleam of his long-sought trophy. His calm acceptance of that is one of his most poignant, compelling virtues. Perhaps he’s the man for this moment after all. But what a moment. Rahm Emanuel, the former Chicago mayor who was Obama’s first chief of staff, said that if the economy then was crippled, the economy now “is not only broken but splattered all over the place,” courtesy of a once-in-a-century pandemic whose containment, bungled by Trump, would be Biden’s problem. That, however, wasn’t the difference between 2008 and 2020 that Emanuel dwelled on. He volunteered several detailed anecdotes about the crucial cooperation that Obama got from President George W. Bush on his way out, saying that during the transition, Bush put America’s perilous juncture above party and partisanship. I asked Emanuel if he could possibly be suggesting that Biden would get no such assistance from Trump. When you’re the president, he said, “You’re walking every morning from the White House residence to the Oval Office. You’re passing oil paintings of Washington, Kennedy, Reagan, Eisenhower, Lincoln. The history and the responsibility of this project called America is just present and seeps into every pore of your body.” Because of that, Emanuel said, he’d always believed the presidency imbued anybody who inhabited it with a sense of stewardship. But, he added, “we have found the one person who is immune to all of that moral, ethical, professional responsibility for the American project.” And it would be Biden’s awful luck to take the baton — or, rather, wrest it — from the talons of that tyrant. Lame-duck Trump would be foul. In word and deed, he’d booby-trap the presidency for Biden and then, after Biden’s inauguration, reject former presidents’ tradition of reticence to bellow at Biden and try to undermine him. Look at just the past few days. Knowing that Democrats are more likely than Republicans to vote by mail, Trump falsely claimed (again) that ballots received after Election Day, even if they’re in perfect accordance with a state’s requirement of a postmark by Election Day, are illegitimate. He applauded supporters of his who swarmed around and trapped a Biden-Harris campaign bus. Those ruffians wouldn’t accept his defeat or Biden’s authority serenely. “It’s different this time, because of their willingness to excuse the shattering of norms that are so central to democracy in America and the willingness of many of them to seek to intimidate, or prevent political expression from, their fellow Americans,” said Kori Schake, the director of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Biden would also confront a restive crew in his own party. If Democrats controlled the Senate, their fury during Trump’s presidency would transform into an insistence on any or all of the following: sweeping action to address climate change; sweeping action to expand health insurance; the sweeping aside of the filibuster; the expansion of the Supreme Court; an immigration overhaul; the placement of high-profile progressives in high-profile Cabinet slots; the destruction of what stretches of the border wall Trump managed to construct; and the investigation and even prosecution of his henchmen. Right now the disparate parts of the Democratic coalition are deceptively united in their revulsion for Trump, a Super Glue that binds even anti-capitalist college students and rich Republicans in the Never Trump brigade. But if Trump is ousted, the glue dissolves, laying bare the distance between Biden and many younger Democrats. He’s given to compromise and consensus, but Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who’s currently on the cover of Vanity Fair, and other stars in the Democratic Party take a less measured approach. “It’s going to be like a bunch of punk rockers showing up at a Neil Diamond concert,” Antonia Ferrier, a former aide to Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, told me. And what if McConnell continues to run the show? Or if a new Democratic majority is a slim one made possible by purple-state lawmakers wary of aggressive legislation? Under either scenario, there’d be strong resistance to the enormously expensive agenda that Biden campaigned on and that the punk rockers will press. But it’s not just American politics that’s in disarray. It’s our whole information ecosystem. Trump’s presidency fortified the alternate realities that Americans live in, the contradictory sets of facts that they accept and the competing truths that they tell. “You could show a chart of coronavirus statistics on the front page of The New York Times and a significant percentage of the population won’t even view it because it’s The New York Times,” Rory Cooper, a Republican strategist who worked as an aide to Eric Cantor when he was the House majority leader, told me. “You heard that in The New York Times? Screw that. Or you heard that on Fox News? Screw that.” It’s untenable to the point of ungovernable. Welcome, Joe Biden, to your dream come true.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/does-joe-biden-really-want-to-be-us-president-911068.html
04-11-2020||Opinion||Why the 2020 US presidential elections will not be decisive||By Ross Douthat An election is supposed to be a reality check. It promises the finality of decision, in which the back-and-forth of political argument gives way to the undeniability of a particular outcome on a particular day. Scoff at the possibility that Donald Trump could ever be the Republican nominee (as I did, once upon a time), and a succession of primaries will reveal the hollowness of your supposed expertise. Insist on the certainty of polling or political science, or some variable (rally size, yard signs, boaters) of your own choice, and the election result will put your certainty to a decisive test. Claim that your particular obsessions are shared by the American people, and on Election Day the people on their majesty will render a verdict on your claim. But that finality is still socially and politically constructed. And democracies can fail — a scenario on many people’s minds these days — when that constructedness dissolves, when it becomes possible to deny the finality of election results outright, to continue the contest outside the system or to substitute a different form of decision for the verdict of the ballot box. We are not there yet in America, but people are right to sense that we’re in a liminal place, where a combination of factors has made our election results much less decisive than in the country’s past. One factor is the increasingly immersive power of ideological narratives and virtual realities. If you can react to an election loss by retreating immediately into a storyscape where the outcome was a cheat, carried about by means of voter fraud or Russian interference, then the decisiveness of any given outcome will inevitably diminish. Another factor is the interaction of political polarization with America’s two-party system and constitutional design. A country with two parties that are increasingly ideologically consolidated, and a narrowing band of swing voters in between, will produce fewer landslides and more nail-biters, and more swings back and forth from election to election, than a country with looser and more fluid coalitions. If that country’s electoral system also allows candidates to win the state’s highest office with a minority of the popular vote, then under polarized conditions this scenario will become more commonplace, decoupling the official decision of the election from the apparent preferences of the voting majority. The irony is that historically, America’s Electoral College tended to produce more decisive-seeming outcomes, both because it magnified the scale of a geographically well-distributed victory and because the possibility of losing even with a slight popular majority created incentives to seek supermajorities — to overwhelm countermajoritarian redoubts with nationwide landslides. You can think of the 2020 campaign as a test of whether that kind of incentive structure can be made to work again. The 2016 election, as I wrote over the weekend, was an example of a shocking but non-decisive-seeming result, in which all the weirdnesses associated with Trump’s minoritarian victory gave people in both parties reasons not to learn any lessons from the experience. But Joe Biden’s campaign, with its steady “moderate blue-collar Joe” energy and disdain for Twitter fads, seemed to learn more lessons than the campaigns of rival Democrats. If Biden’s push to the nomination and now the presidency was uncreative and unambitious in all kinds of ways, it still seemed to go further than any candidacy since Barack Obama’s in 2008 in trying to be rhetorically unifying, in seeking a broader-than-last-time coalition.  The Trump presidency and campaign, meanwhile, appeared to write off the possibility of winning a landslide or even a simple popular-vote majority, relying on their Electoral College advantages while conspicuously resisting the Democratic Party’s attempts to count as many votes as possible. The scenario in which Trump’s 2016 campaign-trail populism coalesced into a majority-building agenda was foreclosed early; the scenario in which Trump rode a strong economy to an easy victory was foreclosed by the coronavirus. Which has left an indecisive outcome and yet another minoritarian government as his best 2020 hope. From a systemic perspective, from the point of view of America’s potential governability, even those of us who would oppose much about a Biden presidency could draw something hopeful from the seeming possibility — as of 24 hours ago — of a landslide Democratic win. That would mean that the system can still deliver clear decisions, even if only for one cycle, and it would create incentives for whatever follows Trump in the Republican Party to seek a similarly decisive victory in its turn. But that possibility has evaporated as of this writing, taking what remains of the expert class’s credibility with it. Instead at the moment we seem headed toward the indecision of another too-close-to-call and potentially litigated endgame, with razor-thin margins no matter which man wins. Which implies that even under what seemed like favourable conditions for a decisive outcome, the evolving ways we’re polarized — by age, geography, sex, class and faith — are still the more powerful forces, dragging us ever back toward stalemate. It’s one more sign, as if we needed more, that our system’s method of uniting power with legitimacy is slowly losing both.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/why-the-2020-us-presidential-elections-will-not-be-decisive-911159.html

In the US, while there is considerable similarity in the views on China of the incumbent, Donald Trump, and his opponent in the Presidential contest, Joseph Biden, there are important divergences too. Both have promised that they would not permit China to threaten its neighbours, rob American companies of their technologies and subsidise its own industries.  But Trump has taken unilateral actions against China, including the imposition of punitive tariffs and sanctions while seeking cooperation from allies. Biden wants to forge a “united front of allies and partners to confront China’s abusive behaviours,” while seeking the latter's cooperation on climate change, non-proliferation and global health issues. Given that many allies and partners have developed considerable distrust of the US and want to safeguard their strong economic interests with Beijing, it will be necessary for Washington to regain their confidence and convince them of the long-term threat posed by China to their peace, security and development.  Position of US allies The US’s allies and partners, in and outside the Quad, have generally been reticent in supporting its inclinations to formalise the Quad, openly oppose or name China in the absence of clarity on how the US would respond to their security and economic concerns. They would like the USA to convey a clear commitment to counter China’s aggression and deploy its capacity to deter assaults on them, as it has done in the case of Taiwan recently. Also, they want to continue with their economic and trade relations with Beijing just as the US itself is continuing its large economic and trade relationship with China. In regard to shifting of supply chains and excluding the Chinese companies such as Huawei from their 5G networks, they want to ascertain the alternate arrangements, which the USA would promote, and how these would impact them.  As an urgent priority, the USA needs to establish a common trade area encompassing both its Asian and European allies and partners which could reduce their economic dependence on China and make them less exposed to Beijing’s coercion. It needs to give priority to forging a common front with its allies and partners to counter China’s unfair trade policies and cease its public quarrels; the trade inequities with them can be corrected gradually through a dialogue. India is the main anchor in the US’s Indo-Pacific strategy given its growing economy, big professional armed forces, its strategic location and determination to resist China’s abusive behaviours. While there are many convergences in India’s strategic outlook with the US, there are some differences too, on issues such as Pakistan-sponsored terrorism against India, Pakistan’s support to Taliban, US’s hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan, Iran and other issues. India also has congruence of interests and strategic partnerships with key countries in the European Union such as France, UK and Germany, some of whom are working out other frameworks for the Indo-Pacific to secure their interests. Russia, a key traditional partner, is integrated with India in several partnerships such as BRICS, RIC and SCO and is opposed to the concept of Indo-Pacific and Quad. India is also keeping its communications open with China to find a bilateral solution to its security and other problems. India-US relationship In view of these reasons, India’s preference will be to forge a deeper partnership with the US instead of a military alliance. In any case, India is progressively getting closer to the US in strategic and defence fields by sharing its logistical and communications facilities, joining in combined military exercises and relying increasingly on her for security needs.  Given the above constraints, it may be useful to contemplate diverse cooperative frameworks in the Indo-Pacific including formal alliances such as NATO, quasi-alliance (USA-Taiwan) and strong partnerships (India-USA) as long as these are tied to an agreed framework of cooperation. It will allow many more countries to participate in building a common edifice of cooperation against Beijing without hemming them to constraints of an alliance.  US leadership key  The outcome of the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Committee meeting held recently indicates that China is determined to pursue its ambition of rapid modernisation of its military by deploying huge resources on domestic innovation and homegrown technologies. As the next party Congress approaches in 2022, the Chinese President Xi Jinping will double down on his current aggressive approach, which is popular at home, to achieve some demonstrable results to perpetuate his stay in power. Against the above background, the next US President will need to regain the leadership of the transatlantic alliance and partner in the Indo-Pacific in building a cohesive group with shared interests and tied to an agreed course of action, to push back China’s hegemony and unfair policies. This may involve a restructuring of several existing groups such as G-7, Quad and others. America’s unilateral actions have, so far, yielded only limited results; there is no substitute for the above united approach to mount needed pressure on Beijing to amend its policies.  China’s strategy is to not go for war but put overwhelming pressure on its adversary so that it gives up the will to fight and agrees to its terms. It will be necessary for the US’s allies and partners to assist each other in augmenting their economic, military and technological capacities so that their collective resolve and strength could outweigh China.  (Yogesh Gupta is a former Ambassador who writes on China-related issues) The views expressed above are the author’s own.

04-11-2020||Opinion||How Jack Ma's words cost him $35 billion||By Shuli Ren Jack Ma is a very busy man. China’s richest man has been busy launching the world’s biggest IPO. He has been busy preparing for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s grandest four-day Double Eleven shopping extravaganza. And yet two weeks ago, Ma somehow found the time to opine on China’s banking system at a high-profile financial forum in Shanghai, once again throwing himself into the eye of the storm. In that speech, apart from labeling the global banking Basel Accords as an “old people’s club,” Ma said “systemic risk” is not the issue in China. Rather, China’s biggest risk is that it “lacks a financial ecosystem.” Chinese banks are like “pawn shops”, where collateral and guarantees are the hard currencies. As a result, some decided to go so big they are not allowed to fail. “As the Chinese like to say, if you borrow 100,000 yuan from the bank, you are a bit scared; if you borrow a million yuan, both you and the bank are a little nervous; but if you take a 1 billion yuan loan, you are not scared at all, the bank is,” Ma said. The consequences came this week. On Monday, Beijing’s top financial watchdogs summoned Ma and dressed him down. Beijing also issued draft rules on online micro lending, stipulating stricter capital requirements and operational rules for some of Ant Group Co.’s consumer credit businesses. But the big shocker came on Tuesday night. The Shanghai Stock Exchange suspended Ant’s listing on its Star board, citing Monday's meeting and subsequent regulatory changes. Ant then said in a filing it would suspend its Hong Kong IPO as well. The fintech giant was scheduled to start trading on Thursday. The news sparked a slide in Alibaba shares on Tuesday in New York, while dragging down other Chinese companies’ U.S.-listed stocks. What Ma said was a bit sensational, perhaps. But he was right. China’s bankers are so averse to extending credit to smaller borrowers that Beijing redefined “inclusive financing” to make its banks’ loan books look prettier. In fact, it’s been so difficult for small businesses to obtain bank credit in the last decade that they have become hard wired not to invest for the future. Here’s the latest tidbit of evidence: In the third quarter, even as China’s economy recovered and 86% of 300 smaller manufacturers CLSA spoke to became profitable, most remained wary. A record-breaking 59% of their capital expenses went into mere “regular maintenance,” the brokerage found. Ma’s words were blunt, but these phrases, such as “pawn shops,” are not his concoctions. Bureaucrats at the People’s Bank of China, for instance, had used the same words themselves. So why is Ma being singled out? Could it be that Ant is too profitable and is now being targeted? Ant is raising at least $34.5 billion in an IPO that attracted more than $3 trillion of retail orders. Meanwhile, regional banks are still in the doghouse, struggling and sometimes being restructured because they lack capital buffers. In the fast-growing consumer credit business, Ant is essentially a matchmaker while banks lend and put aside cash in case some loans go sour. Fintech giants are making much more than lenders, city commercial banks complained to local media. Ant’s vast consumer base appreciates its small loan offerings. But going forward, to appease its banks, Beijing may want to level the regulatory playing field. For instance, Ant may no longer operate just as a matchmaker and might be asked to keep 30% of the loans on its balance sheet, compared with only about 2% now. That should have been no problem because Ant’s IPO would have brought in billions of dollars of capital for loan provisions. In its statement, the Shanghai exchange cited the changing regulatory landscape as one reason Ant no longer qualified for a listing. But in reality, nothing has changed. Since 2017, Beijing’s watchdogs have been debating whether to allow online micro lenders to take a simple loan facilitation model or require them to put away loan provisions. This new draft rule is just a continuation of the debate. At the opening of his speech, Ma admitted he was conflicted as to whether to attend the forum and speak up. Now he probably regrets it. But here’s the thing: If China is serious about financial innovation, “inclusive financing” or the digital yuan, let the man who pioneered the business and made billions along the way share his experiences and thoughts. If Ma says systemic risk is not China’s Achilles’ heel, hear him out. He knows where the real problem is and could be part of the solution.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/how-jack-mas-words-cost-him-35-billion-911177.html
04-11-2020||Panorama||As we count Covid-19 numbers, we have taken our eyes off TB, the silent killer||Robert Koch discovered tuberculosis (TB) bacteria nearly 140 years ago, making this one of the earliest diseases to have its causative agent identified by man. Despite this, TB continues to be the leading cause of death due to infectious diseases, infecting over 10 million people annually, and causing over a million deaths. India bears a huge burden of TB, being home to over 25% of all the cases as well as deaths occurring due to it. The last few years have seen a renewed emphasis on the TB programme in India, with the introduction of a new treatment regimen, financial incentives for nutrition support, greater involvement of the private sector, and robust data management. These measures have helped bring attention to the disease, which causes much misery, undernutrition, and deaths. The Covid-19 pandemic has, however, negated many of the hard-won gains. Since the pandemic began, the detection of new cases has fallen substantially in India. A paper in the Indian Journal of tuberculosis notes that there was a 59% decrease in TB case detection over a period of eight weeks of lockdown in March to May, as compared to the level of detection in the eight weeks just before the lockdown. The data was calculated based on data from the national TB elimination programme. The authors of the paper, Dr Anurag Bhargava and Dr Hemant Deepak Shewade wrote: “Considering the observed 59% reduction in detection over an eight-week period, there will be an estimated additional 87,711 TB deaths [19.5% increase], bringing the total to 5,37,411 TB deaths in 2020. In the last five years, 2015 saw the highest number of deaths from tuberculosis at 5,17,000. Since then, the number has been falling, year after year. However, now with these new estimates, the deaths in 2020 will surpass even the 2015 peak. We note that the poor notification of TB cases continues even now: the cases notified from June to September were 67% of those notified in this period a year ago. So, the trend is unchanged even with the progressive easing of the lockdown. The occurrence and severity of the disease is also closely linked to the nutrition status. Loss of livelihoods and worsening food security will adversely affect nutrition of individuals and could further increase the incidence as well as deaths due to TB. As physicians, we see the worrying situation on the ground of high occurrence, low detection and poor services for TB management that is likely to fuel an epidemic of TB, especially in rural India.We work with primary healthcare facilities in rural and tribal areas (in Rajasthan, but this is typical of all India) where public health facilities are poor and erratic. A patient who presented himself at our clinic many months after he noticed symptoms narrated how he was turned away at PHCs and CHCs. Several other patients have come to us after their treatments were interrupted for durations ranging from one to several months. Many such patients reach us when the disease has advanced substantially. For example, 34-year-old Ramubai came to us with advanced TB and hypoxia. She had sought care at the district hospital and was admitted in a ward for suspected Covid-19 patients for a week. She was discharged after her Covid-19 test was negative, without being further evaluated. Subsequent evaluation revealed she had sputum positive TB and was also HIV positive. Most health facilities in the area have cut down their outdoor, laboratory and radiology services. In many of these, there is a shortage of drugs, x-ray films and other items. Laboratory technicians are busy testing for Covid-19. Patients are discouraged from walking into facilities and are often not examined or tested. The preoccupation with Covid-19 is leading to the diagnosis of TB being missed on several occasions. Disrupted and erratic transport is making it difficult for patients to reach a health facility, and loss of livelihoods and resultant destitution is making it difficult to afford treatment at a private facility.   Time is running out. With each passing day, more patients are going undiagnosed, and more are dropping out of treatment and developing severe disease. Following are some measures which can help bring the focus back on TB.Resume and ramp up diagnosis, treatment of TB: While Covid-19 testing and treatment continue, a clear strategy is needed to enable diagnosis and treatment of TB. Dedicated days in the week for testing and initiating treatment at PHCs and CHCs can ensure testing for TB as well as Covid-19. The mandatory CBNAAT test for TB that detects drug resistance requires patients to travel all the way to the district headquarter. In view of the still erratic transport, and scarcity of liquid cash, the sputum samples can be transported rather than patients themselves as is being done now. Additionally, mobile vans with X-Ray facilities can be taken to PHCs. Promote intake of nutritious foods: Over half of the TB patients are men, the main earning members of the family whose disease severely affects the family’s income and availability of nutritious foods. Malnutrition levels among TB patients are extremely high: In 2019, 93% of all the patients enrolled for treatment at the facilities we manage were undernourished, with 61% being severely so. Poor nutrition in turn adversely affects the disease and the response to treatment. The provision of a cash incentive of Rs 500 per month to patients for their nutrition is a welcome step; the amount is, however, small, and its distribution erratic. The Public Distribution System needs to be made more robust and provide nutritious foods such as pulses and oils in addition to cereals alone, as provided at present. Finally, the anganwadis can expand the coverage of the supplementary food they provide, to include TB patients in addition to women and children. Generate suitable livelihood options: Extensive lung damage as occurs in many patients limits the scope of their work, even after recovery from TB. Innovative options for livelihoods need to be considered, such as providing guaranteed employment closer home under the NREGS, an important source of rural livelihoods in the present times. Helping patients to set up kitchen gardens and backyard poultry can go a long way in improving the availability of nutritious foods, besides also generating precious income. As the country continues to count Covid-19 numbers daily, let us shift attention back to the oldest and the most widespread disease. Let us try to reduce the silent suffering, and unknown deaths  (The writers are doctors with Basic Healthcare Services, a non-profit that provides primary healthcare in rural Rajasthan in association with the state government) (Syndicate: The Billion Press)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/as-we-count-covid-19-numbers-we-have-taken-our-eyes-off-tb-the-silent-killer-911050.html
04-11-2020||Panorama||A chance to rebuild Indo-Nepal ties||General Manoj Mukund Naravane, Chief of the Army Staff, Indian Army, is all set to visit Nepal on November 4 for three-days. It is the first high-level visit between the two neighbours since a border row hit ties earlier this year. Though this visit is a customary one, where Nepal’s President Vidya Devi Bhandari will “confer the honorary rank of general of the Nepali Army to the Indian army chief in a ceremony, it can also help rebuild ties as relations between Nepal and India appear to have reached an all-time low due to the boundary dispute starting from November last year. Nepal published a new, authoritative political map showing the areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani, and Limpiyadhura as part of its territory, toughening its stance on a recently flared up territorial dispute with India. The Nepali government’s move to unveil a new political map came after India published its map more than six months ago, including the Lipulekh and Kalapani areas in its claimed territory. The tensions between the two neighbours deepened further when India inaugurated a road linking Dharchula in Uttarakhand state to Lipulekh, as part of the Kailash-Mansarovar pilgrimage route. Nepal’s Parliament endorsed a constitutional amendment bill tabled by the government to revise its political map to include the areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani, and Limpiyadhura as part of its territory. The passage of the Bill marks a historic move for Nepal and a tough blow for India, which is seen as acting as a regional bully or ‘big brother’ in Nepal. Nothing underlines this attitude better than its willingness to hold to talks on the border issue with China at both the military and even diplomatic level, but not with Nepal. Nepal has always wanted to hold bilateral discussions with India to diffuse the border issue, but India has never shown any interest to that end. After the dispute began, Naravane said Nepal’s protest against the border road was at the behest of “someone else” where he hinted to China. His statement had created a huge uproar in Nepal. Though the border dispute issue may not be discussed officially in the meeting, unofficially message can be delivered through him. It is an opportunity for Nepal to initiate dialogue. As Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli heads the Defence Ministry, he can talk with the General about the border issues. This visit is an opportunity for the two sides to push for defence and security cooperation.

04-11-2020||Right in the Middle||Reliving the past||The isolation and lockdown necessitated by the pandemic recently threw up several challenges – many overt but quite a few covert. Things at home that had remained in cold storage for decades on one or the other pretext resurfaced much like an old enemy. The lockdown left me with no escape route out of one such covert issue. Much to my chagrin, this was like ‘reopening an old case file’ namely cleaning up a room with tons of old books, reading material, old letters and the like. Smelling blood, my wife pounced on me insisting that all this be cleared before the lockdown ends and even prepared a duty roster detailing everyday cleanup hours. Unwillingly, I set out on my mega assignment. No sooner had I dusted up the first carton of books, when I found a letter written by an old friend who now worked abroad. Reading through this, my mind rewound 28 years, reliving the good times we had as friends, hostel mates. This reverie caused my brain to jump from one nostalgic memory to another and a precious hour was lost on this letter alone. "How is it going?" my wife asked, nudging me out from my trance. Jolted by the warning, I decided perforced not to read any other letters henceforth but instead focus on the job on hand. That's when I chanced upon a first-year medical college book. Memories of the trials and tribulations as also the good times of the first year at medical college came flooding back and needless to say, I was drowning in a whirlpool of old thoughts yet again. The postprandial session of cleanup was admittedly tardy and I was left enjoying a siesta in the dark vault. Electricity failure proved to be my ally as dusk set in. When my ‘search’ came to a halt due to bad light and stumps were drawn, the scorecard of one letter and one book cleared was testimony to my progress. Day two began on a flowery note – a huge envelope containing old photographs with erstwhile colleagues and friends abroad was my first ‘opponent’. This virtual throwback to the scents and sounds of the days of yore occupied my time till noon. Paying an ‘inspection visit’ to my dugout, the lady of the house was chafed at my progress thus far. Entreaties that I was stuck in musings and will make amends did not cut any ice with her. Sensing mendacity on my part, she prayed then for an extension of lockdown while I am prayed for just the opposite so that I may escape to work and let status quo reign once again.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/reliving-the-past-911046.html
04-11-2020||Second Edit||Land titles project useful, welcome||It is easy to exaggerate the importance of SVAMITVA and its meaning strained out of a soup of words -- Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improved Technology in Villages Areas. Getting the right acronym with the right sense would have called for hard labour. The Modi government is known for its fondness for such acronyms, which is a sign of triteness and infantile fancy, but the project, without exaggeration, is useful for the management of property and land rights. Land records are notoriously messy, and large numbers of people, especially in villages, do not have the right land titles, though their families may have owned the property for generations. Most holdings are small and that aggravates the problem. Even when there are records, many cannot make use of them because of inefficiency or corruption in revenue departments.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently launched the project, which involves property mapping and digitisation of records by deploying drones to demarcate residential areas, farmland and other natural and infrastructural features like wooded areas and roads. The owners will receive virtual property cards as proof of ownership. The project is set to be completed by 2024 and the aim is to map and record all relevant details of the country’s 662,000 villages by then. Pilot projects have been started in 100,000 villages in six BJP-ruled states. Landowners in some villages have already been given the property records and they are able to access their virtual titles now. Legally enforceable property rights are essential for development in various areas like agriculture and industry because land is an important factor of production.  While the project is good, there is a need for caution also. The government has projected it as an exercise that will make the sale of land easy. This may be true, and many landowners will benefit, but saleability is the least of the benefits. The exercise should not lead to alienation of land, especially farmland, on a large scale. One obstacle in the way of purchase of land on a big scale by corporates and others is the lack of clear titles for the property. A clear title is primarily for the empowerment of the owner, for his own use, and for the security of the land. There are many challenges also. The use of technology is not enough. Land records may have to be studied, tallied with technological inputs, and sometimes corrected. There will also be disputes. The project can only be implemented with the help and cooperation of state governments. The question of why the pilot project is held only in BJP-ruled states is therefore relevant.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/land-titles-project-useful-welcome-911035.html
04-11-2020||South||Kerala Congress chief booked for remarks on rape victims||Kerala Congress chief Mullappally Ramachandran was on Tuesday booked by police for his controversial remarks on rape victims, comments that had sparked strong reactions from woman leaders, including from his own party, prompting him to tender an apology. The state Congress President was booked under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code, including outraging the modesty of women, over his recent remarks. The Women's police station here registered a case against him on a complaint. "A case has been registered under sections 354 A and 509 of the IPC (Indian Penal Code) after the complaint was forwarded to us from the city police commissioner," an investigating officer told PTI. Section509 of IPC deals with insulting the modesty of any woman while 354 A is outraging the modesty of a woman. Ramachandran had on November 1 stirred a row with his remarks when he said, "every day, this woman would wake up saying she has been raped by someone. It's a desperate attempt by the (Left) to dress up a prostitute and make her stand behind the curtain and make her tell tales. This game will not work." "One can understand when a woman is raped once. But what if she repeatedly says this. A woman with self-respect will either die by committing suicide after she is raped or else try not to be sexually assaulted again," Ramachandran had said while speaking at a protest meet organised against the state government over various issues. He had made these comments while criticising the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) after a woman accused in a solar scam case gave a statement to the police recently, accusing former Congress minister A P Anil Kumar of raping her. The Congress leader's remarks drew sharp reactions from CPI(M) leader and state Health Minister KK Shailaja, the state Women's Commission chief, and his own party MLA Shanimol Usman, following which he later tendered an unconditional apology. The solar scam broke out in 2013 during the rule of the UDF government led by the then Chief Minister Oommen Chandy when a company defrauded a number of investors of large amounts of money on the false promise of installing solar panels or making them business partners. The names of several leaders of the then ruling-UDF had cropped up in connection with the main accused woman in the case and Ramachandran was apparently referring to her when he made his statement on Sunday. Shailaja had said the remarks were highly condemnable and the state women's panel registered a case against the Congress chief on its own. Ramachandran had earlier made controversial remarks against Shailaja in June, calling her a "Covid Queen" and a "Nipah princess", referring to her handling of these diseases as the Health Minister. After a row erupted over his latest remarks against rape victims, he apologised, saying his statement was misinterpreted by certain persons.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-congress-chief-booked-for-remarks-on-rape-victims-911031.html
04-11-2020||South||ED extends probe against Bineesh Kodiyeri to Kerala||A team of Enforcement Directorate probing Bineesh Kodiyeri's connection with the Bengaluru drug peddling racket, reportedly reached Thiruvananthapuram as part of the probe. Bineesh is the son of CPM Kerala secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan. According to sources, the team is in Thiruvananthapuram to investigate Bineesh's assets and investments. The team may seek details from his business associates. Abdul Latheef, a city-based businessman, is alleged to be Bineesh's benami. Bineesh was suspected to have invested in a couple of hotel businesses along with Abdul Latheef. A firm run by Latheef had bagged some contracts from the UAE consulate in Kerala allegedly following Bineesh's intervention. Meanwhile, even as there were suggestions in the Left Front that Kodiyeri Balakrishnan may keep off from the party secretary post for the time being citing health reasons, the party leadership was not in favour of it as it may weaken the party's allegations that central agencies are targeting the party as part of a political plot. Since the local body and Assembly elections are approaching in Kerala, the party was concerned about the serious allegations that came up at this juncture.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/ed-extends-probe-against-bineesh-kodiyeri-to-kerala-911103.html

An ED team from Bengaluru conducted searches at his house, besides many locations here and in northern Kerala, sources said. A special court in Bengaluru had on Monday extended custody of Bineesh to the Enforcement Directorate by five more days. The ED had produced Bineesh before the special court dealing with the money laundering cases as the four-day custody came to an end on November 2. The agency arrested Bineesh on October 29 in a money laundering case linked to a drug seizure in Karnataka and took him into its custody for four days to interrogate him. On Sunday night, he reportedly complained of back pain following which he was taken to the Bowring Hospital in that city for a check-up. The central agency alleged that the "drug peddler" in the case, Mohammed Anoop, was a "benamidar" of Bineesh. The ED probe stems from a Narcotics Control Bureau investigation that claimed to have busted an ecstasy pills drug trafficking racket in Karnataka in August, along with the arrest of Anoop and two others. Bineesh has maintained that he knew Anoop and his family and the latter had borrowed money from him and some others to set up a restaurant business in Bengaluru a few years ago.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/drugs-case-ed-conducts-searches-at-bineesh-kodiyeris-residence-multiple-locations-in-kerala-911180.html
04-11-2020||South||Kerala revokes permission for CBI probes in state without consent||The Kerala government, on Wednesday, decided to revoke the general consent given to the CBI for investigating cases. With this, there are now five states in the country, all Opposition-ruled, where the country's premier investigating agency needs to take prior permission for conducting a probe. With this, the CBI will have to approach these state governments on a case to case basis seeking permission to conduct investigations in new cases. Earlier, Andhra Pradesh too had revoked the general consent during N Chandrababu Naidu government but was reinstated after Y S Jaganmohan Reddy stormed to power in the state last year. Already, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra governments have withdrawn the general consent required by the CBI under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act to act in states. Usually, general consent is renewed routinely. The move, however, will not have any impact on cases already registered by the CBI and the investigators can continue the probe. The CBI could also conduct a probe against central government employees posted in states. However, the states cannot prevent the National Investigation Agency (NIA) or the Enforcement Directorate to probe the cases in the country as they are not covered under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act. The NIA has jurisdiction across the country. The latest to enter the club is CPI(M)-led Kerala government, with the immediate trigger being the CBI filing a case in a housing project in the state. The CPI)M)-led Left Democratic Front, as in the case of Congress and Trinamool Congress governments elsewhere, believes that the central agencies are being misused by the Narendra Modi government. On October 23, Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government withdrew the general consent to CBI after the agency registered a case in the Television Rating Points (TRP) scam on the basis of a complaint filed in Uttar Pradesh. The CBI had also taken over the Sushant Singh Rajput suicide case, which was being probed by Mumbai Police, on the basis of an FIR filed in Patna. After the CBI registered a case in TRP scam, which was also probed by Maharashtra Police, the state government rushed to withdraw the general consent. The Mamata Banerjee-led government had withdrawn the general consent in 2018 while Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh took a similar action in January 2019. Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in Rajasthan also withdrew the consent given to the CBI in July this year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-revokes-permission-for-cbi-probes-in-state-without-consent-911181.html

Marking the inauguration of the mobile services of the low-cost food chain, Palaniswami distributed food items from the eateries on wheels to the public at the Secretariat here. The three vehicles, together cost about Rs 27 lakh, an official release here said. Palaniswami said, "I am very happy to have inaugurated the services of three mobile Amma canteens." The initiative is an extension of the services of the existing chain of Amma Canteens, he said on his Twitter handle. Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam, Municipal Administration Minister S P Velumani, Fisheries Minister D Jayakumar and top officials led by Chief Secretary K Shanmugam participated. The three mobile eateries, an initiative of the Greater Chennai Corporation, would "go anywhere" to cater better to workers like construction labourers by delivering food at or near their work sites, an official said. The vans would be stationed at places where the general public visit in large numbers 'like the Marina beach' or locations that teem with ordinary and poor people, the civic official told PTI.

Velmurugan, 33, of Anna Nagar colony at Periyakulam in Theni district of Tamilnadu, was killed in the encounter with Kerala police's Thunderbolt commandos at Padinjarathara forest areas of Banasura, about 30 kilometres from Kalpetta town on Tuesday morning. The police version of the incident was that the commandos opened firing in self-defense following the firing by the Maoists who were around five in numbers. One of the relatives of Velmurugan told a section of media at Kozhikode that there were multiple firing injuries and many seemed to be in close range. Hence the family would approach the court seeking a fair probe. The body was released to the family and was taken to a native place by evening after the postmortem examination at Kozhikode medical college hospital. Meanwhile, opposition Congress demanded a judicial probe into the incident. The police prevented Congress workers from seeing the body of the deceased. As per norms, the district magistrate would be conducting a probe into the incident. Though the commandos carried out a search in the forest areas for the remaining members of the gang, no one could not be traced. According to police, Velmurugan was involved in instigating tribal community members to fight against the government, imparting arms training and recruiting more people to such groups. Cases were pending against him at several police stations in Kerala.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/relatives-raise-suspicions-over-maoist-killing-911337.html

Apart from search at Bineesh's house in the city, which was continuing till late in the evening, ED conducted raids at premises of some of his associates who were believed to be his 'benamis'. There were unconfirmed reports that Bineesh's relatives were not willing to endorse certain documents recovered from the house. ED's moves were a part of an ongoing probe against Bineesh in connection with his involvement in Bengaluru based drug peddling racket. ED already got information regarding around Rs. 5 crore illegal money handled by Bineesh since 2012. Though Kodiyeri Balakrishnan also used to stay at this house earlier, he later shifted to CPM owned flat in the city. Apart from Bineesh's house, searches were conducted at the house and commercial establishments of a city-based businessman who has been a long term associate of Bineesh. Meanwhile, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said that it was hard to believe that the CPM and the left-front government remained in the dark about Bineesh's involvement in illegal activities and amassment of wealth. The silence of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on the ED action against Bineesh was mysterious, he alleged. Balakrishnan said on Tuesday that actions of ED were being glorified by the Congress even as Sonia Gandhi alleged that central agencies were dancing to the tune of BJP. The media was spreading baseless news against the CPM, he alleged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/as-ed-tightens-grip-on-bineesh-congress-targets-cpm-911350.html

04-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Rare, valuable tree faces rail line threat||A rare tree known for its anti-cancer properties and a vital component of the international pharmaceutical market worth Rs 21,000 cr annually could be imperiled by the proposed Hubballi-Ankola railway line in the Western Ghats, scientists said. The tree, nothapodytes nimmoniana, is known for its concentration of camptothecin (CPT), an indole alkaloid known for its anti-cancer properties. According to the published international literature, CPT displays “remarkable” anti-cancer activity in preliminary clinical trials, especially against breast, ovarian, colon, lung, and stomach cancers. Much of the current worldwide supply of camptothecin comes from China, where it is harvested from the bark and stem of the camptotheca acuminata, a tree native to the Himalayan plains. However, in 2011, Er. Hemanta R Naik, a published scientist whose research within the Western Ghats spans 30 years, and scientists from IIT-Madras and the University of Purdue in the US published a paper in the journal of the Royal Society of Chemistry, showing a high presence of CPT in nothapodytes nimmoniana. Veteran Field Botanist Dr Kaliyamoorthy Ravikumar described the tree species as being abundant in specific localities but in the “vulnerable” red category. “One of these clusters is in the Kali Tiger reserve, including in the area where the proposed railway line is set to go through,” said Naik. He added that protection of the tree’s natural habitat is important because studies have shown that its CPT content reduces when grown in controlled settings outside the Ghats. “A trial in GKVK found an 80% reduction in CPT content when the tree was grown on campus. It requires the presence of certain other plants and a fungus also found in the Western Ghats,” said Naik. Some commercial extraction of CPT is said to be already ongoing from nothapodytes nimmoniana trees in the Western Ghats, much of it ad hoc. "Local tribal people are paid about Rs 150-200 per day to extract the bark of the tree. When it reaches Mumbai, it is turned into a powder form and sells for Rs 15,000 per kg,” he said, explaining that roughly 1,000 kilos of bark is required to extract about 1 milligram of CPT. According to a report in Elsevier, there is a demand for one tonne of crude CPT extract per year worldwide. “By proceeding with plans to build the railway line, the state government could potentially deprive itself of high revenue from a natural source that the railway line itself can never generate,” said Naik. Whole place at risk Environmental scientist Professor T V Ramachandra of the Centre for Ecological Sciences at the IISc confirmed that populations of nothapodytes nimmoniana are present throughout the Western Ghats. “However, this tree alone is not a reason to scrap the railway proposal,” he told DH. “Our studies have shown that developmental projects in the region have a detrimental effect on water catchment areas and in carbon sequestration, which means that Ghats will see a reduced ability to soak up carbon dioxide emissions,” Dr Ramachandra said.

The new rates will come into effect from the first meter reading date falling on or after November 1, 2020.  While the KERC has approved uniform increase across all the Escoms and Hukkeri RECS, there is a marginal differential increase in BESCOM area. The slab-wise increase in the energy charge ranges from 20 paise to 25 paise per unit across all categories except Bangalore Metro, Battery Charging Station for electric vehicles, besides an increase of 50 paise per unit for temporary installations.  Though the revised tariff should have been given effect from April 1 of every year,  the latest revision in the tariff could not be pronounced due to country-wide lockdown on account of Covid-19 pandemic, pendency of KPTCL appeal before the appellate tribunal for electricity (ATE) against KERC order and code of conduct for bypolls to RR Nagar and Sira assembly seats.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/monthly-electricity-bills-to-cost-more-in-karnataka-as-kerc-approves-40-paise-hike-per-unit-911260.html
04-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Nearly 2 crore in Karnataka were Covid-19 infected: State govt survey||An estimated 1.93 crore people or 27% of the population in Karnataka are currently infected with Covid-19 or had contracted the disease in the past, a government-backed study has said. The study was based on a state-wide serosurvey conducted from September 3 to September 16 to estimate the prevalence of Covid-19. “Of the 7.07 crore estimated population in Karnataka, the study estimates that 1.93 crore are either currently infected or already had the infection, as of September 16,” said Dr Giridhar Babu, principal investigator of the study and member of the state Covid-19 technical advisory committee. While 16.4% of the 15,624 survey samples showed that the subjects were infected in the past and had developed IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus, 12.7% of the apparently healthy population in the surveyed area had an acute and active infection. Health and Medical Education Minister Dr K Sudhakar, while releasing the findings on Wednesday, said, “The sampled population surveyed were all adults aged 18 years and above. All 30 districts of the state, including eight zones of the BBMP, were surveyed. The survey was conducted in 290 hospitals and selected population settings.” Three groups of population were covered — low-risk group, i.e., pregnant women attending antenatal clinics, people attending outpatient departments in hospitals/attendees of children or patients; moderate-risk group, i.e., people moving in the community like bus conductors, vendors in vegetable markets, healthcare workers, individuals in containment zones and congregate settings such as markets, malls, retail stores, bus stops, railway stations, pourakarmikas/waste collectors; and high-risk group, i.e., the elderly and those with co-morbid conditions. The study used Rapid Antigen Test and RT-PCR for diagnosis of acute infection. Serum testing for IgG antibodies was conducted to know the protection offered by the immune response. Of the 16,585 people surveyed covering three risk categories, analysis was done on results for 15,624 whose RAT and RT-PCR, and antibody test results were available. The overall adjusted prevalence of Covid-19 was 27.3% (combined IgG and active infection). At the state level, it was estimated that there were 40 undetected infected individuals for every RT-PCR confirmed case, i.e., the case-to-undetected-infections ratio (CIR) was 1:40. The cases-to-infections ratio ranged from 10 to 111 across districts. Districts with high cases to infections ratio (i.e., more than 40) need to improve detection of cases actively through syndromic approach and improve testing. These districts were Vijayapura, Belagavi, Chitradurga, Tumakuru, Raichur, Ramanagar, Haveri, Chamarajanagar, Bidar, Davangere, Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Kolar, Kodagu, Mandya, Chikkamagalur, Ballari, Bengaluru Rural and Hassan. Sudhakar said that a follow-up survey is planned to measure the extent and speed of transmission and evaluate the impact of containment strategies over time in the state. This will be done in December-end and February-March. The survey was a collaborative effort of the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Indian Institute of Public Health, Nimhans, Indian Institute of Science, Indian Statistical Institute, Unicef, MS Ramaiah Medical College and others.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/nearly-2-crore-in-karnataka-were-covid-19-infected-state-govt-survey-911267.html

The  NGT Principal Bench Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel noted that it has already issued notice to Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh and the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) was seeking their response on whether the use of firecrackers be banned from November 7-30 in the interest of public health and environment. With the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) monitoring report noting 122 cities, in 18 states the air quality was beyond the norms fixed as per Air Act during mid-August this year, the Tribunal said, "it may have to consider prohibiting the use of firecrackers to protect the health of the vulnerable groups in these cities." According to CPCB, in Karnataka cities - Bengaluru, Davangere, Kalburgi, and Hubballi-Dharwad witnessed poor air quality during mid-August this year. The bench sought response from Karnataka,  Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttarakhand, and West Bengal. The states have to reply urgently by Thursday (November 5), where the bench will further hear the matter. The bench also noted that Odisha and Rajasthan governments have already issued a notification prohibiting the sale and use of firecrackers. "Having regard to further developments such as grievance being raised for the State of MP and States of Odisha and Rajasthan have banned the use of firecrackers in the wake of unsatisfactory air quality, the scope of proceedings may need to be extended beyond NCR so as to suggest that in all the concerned States where air quality is not satisfactory may consider taking action on the pattern of action taken by the States of Odisha and Rajasthan," the bench said. The green bench was hearing a plea by the Indian Social Responsibility Network, which sought action remedial action against pollution by use of firecrackers during the time air quality is unsatisfactory with a potential severity of Covid-19 pandemic. The use of green crackers will not remedy the situation. The smoke will choke and may create a gas chamber like situation. It will lead to poor visibility, hazy conditions, and asphyxia, the plea said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/ngt-widens-ambit-of-firecracker-pollution-cases-beyond-ncr-notices-to-18-states-uts-911312.html

The special court had rejected the B report (closure report) filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and summoned K J George and IPS officers Pronab Mohanty and Ashit Mohan Prasad to face the trial. The former minister and the IPS officers had challenged the order of the special court before the High Court. They claimed that the CBI had filed the closure report with a finding that DySP Ganapathy was having a troubled personal life and was undergoing severe stress and mental agony. The petitioners also contended that the special court has taken cognizance against the IPS officers without a prior sanction prescribed under the CrPC and Karnataka Police Act. Justice John Michael Cunha, while quashing the order of the special court, observed: “The evidence collected by the investigating agency, even if accepted in its entirety, does not disclose men's rea or instigation or conspiracy by the petitioners making out the ingredients of the offence under section 306 r/w 34 of IPC. In the absence of any material to make out the ingredients of the above offence, there was absolutely no reason or justification for the Special Court to reject the well-founded report filed by CBI and to take cognizance of the alleged offence and issue summons to the petitioners” the court said. Ganapathy had spoken about the harassment meted out to him by the then Home minister George and two IPS officers in an interview with a local TV channel at Madikeri before taking the extreme step. The CBI had collected 42 documents and examined 108 witnesses to come to a conclusion that none of the allegations made by Ganapathy was the reason for him to commit suicide. The CBI report also stated that there was no departmental enquiry pending against Ganapathy as on the date of his death. Ganapathy, who was the then DySP in Mangaluru, had committed suicide on July 7, 2016, by hanging himself in a room at a lodge in Madikeri town. The B closure report was filed on October 30, 2019. The special court had rejected the B report in August 2020.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/dysp-ganapathy-suicide-hc-relief-for-george-2-ips-officers-911378.html

He was holding a video conference with the state Health Minister Dr K Sudhakar and officials of the Health Department to discuss the steps taken to contain the infection and the preparations underway for vaccine distribution. The Union Minister said infection and mortality rate have been reduced after a spike. Stringent measures are to be implemented for complete control in the future, he said. "We should formulate sensible strategies during the upcoming festive season and winter. Also, there is a need to keep vigil on inter-state and international passengers," the Union Minister said. In return, Sudhakar assured him that the state would not allow any laxity during the festival season. Vardhan emphasised that influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory illness cases should be identified and make the patients undergo Covid-19 tests to control its spread. Sudhakar too explained the measures initiated by the state government to control the virus. He expressed gratitude for the assistance provided by the Centre. The Karnataka Health Minister said the serosurvey conducted by the state government would be factored in while formulating strategy for coming days.

A posse of policemen and plainclothesmen swooped at Arnab’s Lower Parel residence in Mumbai and detained him. He is being taken in a police vehicle to Raigad, according to his wife Samyabrata Ray Goswami. According to her, Arnab was assaulted by the police team. "He was assaulted and not even allowed to take water and medicines," she alleged.  As he was being taken in a police vehicle, he said, “They have assaulted me… My son was also assaulted. They did not allow me to meet my father-in-law and mother-in-law.” The police team was led by Inspector Sachin Vaze, who is currently attached to the Crime Intelligence Unit of the Mumbai Crime Branch-CID. According to Vaze, Arnab has been arrested by the Alibaug police in a 2018 suicide case. “He has been arrested in connection with the suicide by a son and a mother, registered in 2018,” he said. On being asked that the case was closed and a formal closure report was also filed, he said, “The same court and the same police have reopened the case.” It may be recalled, an interior designer Anvay Naik (53) had committed suicide in May 2018.  The body of Naik’s mother, Kumud, who was in her seventies, was found near him. In May this year, Anvay’s wife Akshata Naik said that her husband and her mother-in-law had allegedly committed suicide in their farmhouse in Alibaug in May 2018 and in his suicide note, Anvay had blamed Arnab Goswami and two others, Feroz Shaikh and Niteish Sarda, for not paying his dues, collectively worth more than Rs 5 crore. In 2018, the Alibaug police had filed a case of abetment to suicide but in 2019 the case was closed by the Raigad Police. After Akshata’s statement and her daughter Adnya’s plea, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had assured a fresh investigation by State-CID into the case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/arnab-goswami-arrested-in-2018-suicide-case-911094.html

The decision of Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray of shifting the Mumbai Mumbai Line 3 car shed from Aarey Milk Colony to Kanjur Marg has irked the BJP.  “Who gave the right to Centre on Maharashtra’s land? Every inch of the land of Mumbai belongs to Maharashtra… The Metro car shed will be constructed in Mumbai,” Shiv Sena chief spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut said. According to Raut, a close aide of Thackeray, there seems to be a conspiracy in Maharashtra to stall the development. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Secretary Guruprasad Mohapatra has written to Maharashtra’s Chief Secretary Sanjay Kumar asking the MVA government to halt work at the Kanjur Marg site, saying that it is against the interest of the Government of India. Thackeray’s son and State Environment, Tourism and Protocol Minister Aaditya Thackeray assured that work will continue as usual. He said that the Kanjur Marg land, allotted by the Mumbai Suburban district Collector to Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) for car depot of Mumbai Metro, has always been with the Maharashtra Government as per revenue records. “The Collector has done the due diligence of all land records and all sub-judice matters in all competent courts. The MMRDA will therefore carry on with its work for Metro joint car depots at Kanjur Marg as earlier decided,” Aaditya said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/every-inch-of-mumbai-s-land-belongs-to-maharashtra-shiv-sena-on-metro-car-shed-row-911184.html

He was arrested by Mumbai police after being granted bail by a Nagpur court and was on Tuesday produced before a local court, which remanded him to police custody for further probe into the matter. Thakkar was granted bail by the Nagpur court recently in a case registered against him by Nagpur police over the offensive comments on the micro-blogging site. Thakkar, who has 59,000 followers on Twitter and is followed by some prominent government functionaries on the social media platform, was arrested by Nagpur police from Rajkot on October 24 for his posts on Twitter, including his `Baby Penguin' remark against Aaditya Thackeray. Nagpur police on Sunday filed a case against some Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) workers for protesting against Thakkar's arrest. The activists carried flags of BJYM, BJP's youth wing, and wore aprons with penguin photos on them. The protesters booked include Shivani Dani Wakhare, whose Twitter bio describes her as Maharashtra BJYM general secretary. Detractors of Aaditya Thackeray have been taunting him with that sobriquet after he insisted on bringing penguins in the Mumbai zoo. The municipal corporation, controlled by the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena, spent crores on the project that included the cost of creating an artificial environment for the flightless birds. At the time of the arrest, police had described Thakkar as a BJP functionary. However, the BJP denied Thakkar being either a functionary or a member of the party's IT cell.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/man-who-tweeted-against-thackeray-remanded-to-police-custody-till-nov-9-911206.html

The petition filed by advocate Puneet Dhanda claimed that the deaths of Disha Salian and Rajput are interconnected as they occurred under suspicious circumstances. When the plea was taken up for hearing on Wednesday by a division bench of Justices K K Tated and G S Kulkarni, the petitioner's advocate Vineet Dhanda told the court that Salian had died on June 8 and Rajput on June 14. "The Mumbai police has not done their work and not carried out a proper inquiry into the deaths. The case (both the deaths) has created hue and cry in the country," Vineet Dhanda argued. The bench was, however, informed by the additional government pleader that the state has not been served a copy of the petition. Dhanda then claimed that he has already served a copy but will do so again. "You (petitioner) file an affidavit of service and also give them (government) another copy," the bench said, and posted the plea for further hearing on November 26. The petitioner, Puneet Dhanda, approached the Bombay High Court after the Supreme Court refused to hear the plea and directed them to approach the high court first. Salian, 28, died on June 8, 2020 after falling off the 14th floor of a residential building in suburban Malad. Rajput, aged 34, was found hanging from the ceiling of his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14. While the Mumbai police had initially registered an Additional Death Report (ADR) case in Rajput's death, the probe was later handed over to CBI after his father K K Singh filed a case in Bihar accusing the actor's girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty and her family of abetting his suicide and cheating him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/hand-over-copy-of-plea-over-disha-salians-death-to-maharashtra-government-says-bombay-high-court-911216.html

Among the persons booked for the offence is a municipal councillor said to be associated with the Congress party. One FIR was filed at Vejalpur police station last night against eight persons including Haji Asrarbaig Mirza, the councillor, Yunus Sabarhussain Kadri, Najma M Kureshi, 46, Mohammad Yunus, Mustakim Abdulkadir Master, Mohammad Salim Shaikh and Abdulhamid H Shaikh. The owner of the printing press, which printed the posters and yet to be identified, has also been booked along with 10 to 15 unidentified persons. The complainant in the case is a police constable Jogabhai Karmanbhai posted as Vejalpur police station's surveillance squad. The FIR has been registered under various sections of Indian Penal Code including 269 (negligent act likely to spread inspection), 270, (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life, to be read of section 120 b (conspiracy). The FIR also includes sections of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984, Disaster Management Act and Press and Books Registration Act. A similar FIR was registered at Shahpur police station in Ahmedabad last night against unidentified persons. The FIR states that on November 2, about 30 to 40 posters insulting French President were found pasted on public property. The FIR claims that those posters were "inciting." It says that in view of COVID-19, no one is permitted to paste posters on public property which has the potential to spread the infection of covid-19. This FIR is based on a complaint submitted by an LRD constable Ronaksinh Sureshbhai posted at Shahpur police station's surveillance squad. A few days back, Anand district police also registered an FIR against five persons on similar charges. The protesters are said to be angry with the French President's remarks which reportedly insulted the Prophet.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-police-register-three-firs-against-groups-for-protesting-against-french-president-911263.html

The Bombay High Court bench in Goa, on Wednesday, issued notices to several respondents, while hearing a writ petition filed by a local green NGO Goa Foundation, which has now challenged the decision of Goa Governor and Chief Minister to reject a Goa Lokayukta report. The report had recommended a criminal probe into the controversial renewals, which has brought the mining industry in the state to a virtual standstill. The petition that led to the HC issuing notice has also sought cancellation of the order issued earlier this year by Raj Bhavan and the CMO rejecting the Lokayukta report. In January this year, then Goa Lokayukta P.K. Mishra in his report had recommended a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe accusations of corruption in the second renewal of 88 mining leases, while also slamming the state government’s Anti-Corruption Bureau for shielding influential persons. The Lokayukta report had also questioned the speed with which a BJP-led coalition government led by Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar cleared as many as 56 mining lease renewals in a week, including granting of 31 clearances during one day, incidentally just before the Central government amended the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, which mandated that mining leases could only be auctioned afresh and not renewed in favour of existing leaseholders. Questions have also been raised about the manner in which the mining leases were renewed in the previous regime led by then Chief Minister late Manohar Parrikar, taking the total tally of renewed mining leases to 88. The Lokayukta report followed a complaint by Goa Foundation, which in its complaint in 2018 had said that "illegal renewal of 88 mining leases in the State of Goa, had led to losses to the state government of Rs. 1,44,000 crore".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/renewal-of-88-goa-mining-leases-hc-issues-notices-to-several-respondents-911308.html

Anvay Naik’s wife Akshata and daughter Adnya said that they are under pressure for a long time and feel threatened. In the past, they had also written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking justice. “We have been under constant pressures. We were continuously threatened. Unknown persons used to come and sit at our home. We have been shadowed by strange persons,” said Akshata and Adnya even as they welcomed the Maharashtra government’s move to arrest Goswami in the May 2018 suicide case. Adnya said that the investigations were suppressed at the behest of Goswami. “Goswami and the other two accused (Feroz Shaikh and Niteish Sarda) are responsible for the suicide of my father and grandmother. Yet, Goswami was given privileged treatment by recording his statement on a police computer instead of going to the Raigad Police,” Adnya said. They said that the Raigad Police’s then Superintendent of Police Anil Paraskar kept assuring them that “we shall be called to the court”. “We had no knowledge that the case was hastily ‘closed’ on the same day as the police filed the closure report,” he said. “We wanted justice. The previous (BJP-led government) was responsible for the case.Those who are seeking justice for the family of Sushant Singh Rajput must also seek justice for the Naik family. "We are hopeful of getting justice now, even if any other agency like CBI takes it over. Goswami is a very influential person. We appeal to all not to politicise the issue," the mother-daughter duo urged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/arnab-goswami-given-privileged-treatment-we-also-want-justice-naik-family-911315.html

The earlier investigation officer (IO) of the case had submitted a closure report in the case, saying there was no evidence. The Maharashtra government announced a fresh probe into the case in May this year, and on Wednesday, Goswami, editor-in-chief of Republic TV, was arrested for allegedly abetting the suicide of architect and interior decorator Anvay Naik in 2018. A first information report (FIR) for abetment of suicide had been registered against Goswami and two others in Alibaug in neighbouring Raigad district following Naik's death. But the IO submitted `A summary report' before a local court on April 26, 2019, saying there was no evidence. After the government decided to reopen the case, Raigad police informed the court on October 15 this year that they will initiate an enquiry against the then IO too, a senior official of Raigad police said. 53-year-old Anvay Naik's purported suicide note claimed that he and his mother were ending life due to non- payment of his dues by Goswami, Feroz Shaikh of IcastX/Skimedia and Niteish Sarda of Smartworks. Police said that as per the note, the three firms owed Naik's company Rs 83 lakh, Rs four crore and Rs 55 lakh, respectively.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/earlier-io-to-face-inquiry-over-closure-of-case-against-arnab-911348.html

Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, his family and the MVA government has been on the line of fire since its formation and on issues like the mob lynching of sadhus in Palghar and the Sushant Singh Rajput case. “No one is above the law. Maharashtra Police will work as per the law,” state’s home minister Anil Deshmukh said. “Due process of law is being followed,” Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said. State’s parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab said Goswami’s name is mentioned in the suicide note. ‘’Goswami duped a Marathi entrepreneur Anvay Naik due to which he ended his life. Earlier the case wasn’t investigated as per the suicide note. The family moved the court and the probe has begun. Where does the question of an attack on freedom of press come from,’’ he asked. “There is no politics of revenge. The BJP trying to save Goswami as if their party worker has been taken away by the police, Parab asked and described Goswami as “BJP’s parrot”. “A Marathi woman was widowed and the case is being investigated. What is wrong in that? Why is the BJP trying to save him? How is it that there is a state of emergency in Maharashtra if one against whom abetment to suicide charge is being levied arrested,’’ he asked. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis of the BJP lashed out at the state government and even targetted Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul Gandhi. “Arnab is paying the price of exposing every plot and move by Congress party to protect and encourage the ones instigating communal violence. Who is sheltering Tukde Tukde Gang and Palghar priest murderers? India wants an answer from Sonia ji and Rahul Gandhi,” he said. Fadnavis, who was the chief minister and home minister when the incident took place, further said: “The MVA government is dancing on tunes of Congress which is taking Maharashtra towards Emergency. Where are the advocates and activists for ‘freedom of press’ hiding?
