20-08-2020||News||India will always owe a huge debt to Pandit Jasraj | Opinion||Sangeet Martand Pandit Jasraj, the incomparable voice of Hindustani classical music that India gave to the world, will always shine bright as the pole star in the world of music. His loss has left a void that is impossible to fill. He was the last of the five pillars of Hindustani classical music in the past half-century or more, the others being Pandit Mallikarjun Mansur, Pandit Kumar Gandharva, Gaan Saraswati Kishori Amonkar and Pandit Bhimsen Joshi. Owing to his close ties with my family, I have rich memories of him. Pandit Jasraj had a special bond with my parents, Pandit Vinaya Chandra Maudgalya and Smt. Padma Devi. His debut concert in Delhi at the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya’s annual music festival, Pandit Vishnu Digambar Jayanti Sangeet Samaroh, in 1966 at Sapru House, set him apart as a rising star and he never looked back.I remember how, as a boy of 10, I awaited eagerly, Pandit Jasraj’s visits to our house-cum-Gandharva Mahavidyala at Connaught Place. There were many visiting musicians and each was special, but Pandit Jasraj’s visits made the atmosphere convivial and festive. I was especially fascinated by the fragrance of the henna-scented itar (perfume) that emanated from his suitcases.He taught me music, of course. But I learnt so much more, sitting behind him playing the tanpura or travelling with him to music festivals outside Delhi. As he enthralled audiences, the learned and the lay alike, I absorbed invaluable lessons in the technicalities of stage singing, presentation skills to diverse audiences, and coordinating and synchronising with extremely accomplished accompanists who were great musicians in their own right. His first LP, with Ragas Nat Bhairav, Hamsadhvani and Shuddh Varaali, made a deep impression on me in my teens.His style was unique, almost a whole world unto itself. Being hugely popular, it is lost on many how difficult his style is and what tremendous rigour had gone into mastering it. Pandit Motiram’s son, Pandit Jasraj started his music training under his elder brother Pandit Maniram, in the Mewati gharana.But in my opinion, his was a combination of the Mewati Gharana along with Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan Saheb’s, Ustad Amir Khan Saheb’s and the Patiala gharana styles, which he turned into a unique gayaki with his powerful multi-octave range, vocal technique such as his famous glides through the notes across octaves, and a special ability to deliver the lyrics with the lucidity of poetry, yet loaded with music. Laden with bhaava (emotion) and laya (rhythm), his music brimmed with a romanticism that mesmerised audiences. He had an uncanny way of engaging each listener. I remember how, during a full concert, one famous musician sitting in the audience, got up to leave after the first two pieces. Panditji noticed this and immediately, in his smiling manner, broke into a bandish (melodic composition) addressing the exiting gentleman, “hum ko bisaar kahaan chale” (whither do you go, forgetting me), in Raga Nagad-dhvani Kanhada, which so genially stopped the musician in his tracks following which he went back to his seat.Bestowed with a magical and mellifluous voice, Panditji won the hearts of listeners as a great performer. The world of music also knows that his depth of knowledge was immense. Ask him about any composition from any gharana, he would know the entire history and background about it. A true vidwaan (scholar), he was a treasure-house of Raga-knowledge and compositions, himself being a great vaaggeyakaar (composer, scholar and performer rolled into one). He created a new intriguing performance style called Jasrangi based on the concept of murchhana, where a male and a female singer performed a selection of two complementary ragas together.He rarely sang thumris, dadras or even taranas in concerts, but was an expert in these genres as well and his disciples are well-trained in all these forms of singing. He sang a lot of devotional music, making the maha-mantra “Om Namo Bhagavate Vaasudevaaya” popular in every household. That he was a very generous teacher and encouraged his students in every way, is evident from the extent to which his disciples have attained success in the tough terrain of classical music.Exuding positivity, Panditji’s was a persona that left behind joy and mirth wherever he went. Warmth and a great sense of humour were intrinsic to his nature. Despite being such a sought-after artist, he was always willing to sing without bothering about remuneration. He would readily travel to remote parts of the country to sing for whoever invited him with sincerity and simplicity.It would be an understatement to say that Padma Vibhushan Sangeet Martand Pandit Jasraj’s voice will always echo in the hearts of music lovers, touching every emotional chord deeply, and that the genius of his music will forever make India proud.Madhup Mudgal is a renowned Hindustani classical vocalist, Principal of the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya in New Delhi and recipient of the Padmashri and Sangeet Natak Akademi Award.

20-08-2020||News||A personal chronicle of Swachh Bharat Mission | Opinion||I vividly remember the first time I met Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi. It was the April 21, 2016, Civil Services Day. There was an evening reception at the Rashtrapati Bhawan Convention Centre, where my Indian Administrative Service (IAS) batchmate, Hasmukh Adhia, introduced me to the PM. I greeted him with a namaste and blurted out something about how much of an honour it was for me to meet him. With a straight face he responded, “Aap wohi hai na jo IAS se bhaag kar bahar chalegaye the? (Aren’t you the one who left the IAS and escaped?)” I was stumped, but, he then smiled and said: “I know that you have asked for an appointment with me — I will meet you soon”. I had been at the World Bank for some years after taking voluntary retirement from the Indian Administrative Service, when in late 2015, I happened to visit Delhi and meet the Cabinet secretary. He informed me that the incumbent secretary of the ministry of drinking water and sanitation (MDWS) had recently resigned, and that the government was considering a domain expert as a replacement for her. He asked if I was interested in the job. It took a few moments for his words to register. This was more than a dream come true. I remembered the urge I felt to participate in the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) the day I heard PM announce it from the ramparts of Red Fort in 2014. My wife and I were at home in Hanoi, Vietnam, and watching the new PM’s first Independence Day speech. Now I was being asked to lead SBM.I was fortunate in being selected for the job and became the first-ever lateral entry ex-IAS officer to become a secretary to the government. There were a few discordant notes from my former IAS colleagues about a technical “outsider” being appointed at such a senior level, but since my former IAS batchmates were also secretaries at that time, at least I was not breaking the civil service hierarchy!After the brief encounter with PM at Rashtrapati Bhawan, I got a call from his office a couple of days later to schedule an appointment with him, just as he had promised. At that meeting, I shared with him our proposal to focus the goal of the programme on making the country open-defecation-free (ODF) by launching a behaviour change programme to get people to use toilets, in parallel with a massive toilet construction programme. In the end, I left the room with the PM’s inspirational words ringing in my ears: “Jaiye, aur Bharat ko swachh banaiye. (Go and make India clean)”. I relinquish my post a week after Independence Day this year to go back to the United States (US) and spend some quality time with my family. I look back at my four-and-a-half years on the job with a lot of satisfaction over what SBM has been able to achieve, and gratitude for being given the chance to do this. To think that in 2014, India contributed to well over half of the world’s open defecation burden with over 600 million open defecators, to becoming open-defecation-free in 2019, is a testimony to what can be achieved if a people rally behind a cause. No praise is enough for the PM’s announcement of that huge, audacious goal, being the wind at our backs, and for being the SBM’s communicator-in-chief.Along the way, I have learned valuable lessons on management and programme delivery. This programme has reinforced the importance of achieving goal-congruence, with every part of the chain aligned to a common goal. It has highlighted the need for a team of believers to effectively execute any large and complex challenge. Believers punch above their weight and made the goal seem less audacious. It has also taught me the importance of end-to- end communication, with all stakeholders and at all times. I have learnt that keeping your superiors and critics informed of your good work is as important as communicating with your customers. It has demonstrated the power of the collective, and that when a programme is democratised, it can achieve more than any expectations. It has highlighted the importance of objective evaluation of progress and using these measurements to improve delivery at all stages. And, most of all, it has taught me that there is no such thing as mission accomplished. Follow-through for sustaining gains is as, if not more, important than achieving the gains in the first place. I leave behind an able team of officers who will take charge of the second phase of SBM which focuses on ODF sustainability and solid and liquid waste management. The Jal Jeevan Mission has its own enormously ambitious goal of delivering piped water supply to all households by 2024. With the systems in place for the successful implementation of both these programmes, I am confident that the teams will achieve even greater heights for the water and sanitation sector in India and get us even more global recognition for our path-breaking transformative programmes. My journey has been nothing short of a dream come true. It has been a roller coaster ride, with a thrill a minute. I leave with the satisfaction that Team SBM, at the national, state, district and village levels, put in a 100% effort to achieve the PM’s goal. I leave with gratitude for this amazing, life-changing opportunity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/a-personal-chronicle-of-swachh-bharat-mission/story-R4WpqZX7VjtiBj1jq2RtjJ.html
20-08-2020||News||Why Facebook is wrong, yet again |Opinion||The latest controversy concerning Facebook has forced greater public scrutiny over the company’s internal decision-making over political issues in India — and may well be the first technology debate originating domestically that has escalated to become truly international in scope.This debate centres on a lengthy, chilling investigation published last week by The Wall Street Journal. The report revealed that Facebook staff had considered a complete take-down of T Raja Singh’s profile on Facebook in 2018 on the basis that the Hyderabad-based Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state legislator spread hateful messages over the platform, targeting the Muslim community. At the time, however, Ankhi Das, who leads Facebook’s policy efforts in New Delhi, intervened in her colleagues’ process, to block the proposed ban of Raja Singh’s account. Raja Singh has since argued that his account was hacked, and has further implied that Facebook, in fact, facilitated the spread of hateful messaging coordinated by Muslim politicians.The situation is deeply concerning and should ring alarm bells. Here, you had an Indian employee of one of the most powerful American Internet firms that operates in India, quietly falling in line with Facebook’s corporate interests, while putting at risk the lives, let alone the social concerns and political hopes, of Indian citizens. Let us be clear that no one — no one — should experience the vitriolic hate and online threats of violence to which Das has alleged she was subjected in the aftermath of the publication of the story. Separately, however, one would hope that no citizen of India — whether a supporter of the BJP or Congress — would be treated as an unknowing pawn by the American tech titan, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram. For Das — as Facebook’s leading Indian policy voice, as someone who is empowered to speak for the Indian people to her chief executive Mark Zuckerberg — the social concerns of all Indian citizens should have come well before the commercial interests of Facebook. In this case, sadly, they did not.The core issue here is that there exists a delicate tension for the company. On the one hand, it faces tremendous pressure to “do the right thing”; all things considered, Facebook’s greatest asset still may be its brand and, despite all the belly-blows the company has endured in recent years, the big blue app still stands tall in the eyes of most Indian consumers. That brand is a corporate asset to be protected. And yet, on the other hand, Facebook feels a constant pressure to cater to all political interests — and all too often, Facebook has caved in under that pressure. And indeed, in this case, Facebook decided not to do the right thing — which would have been taking down Raja Singh’s blatant anti-Muslim posts — because doing so would raise the ire of the political dispensation of the day. The danger of such unilateral decision-making power — which, in 2018, apparently belonged entirely to one individual, for the Indian market — is tangible. In practice, Facebook is indubitably a monopoly that stretches across the Indian digital media ecosystem. With its extraordinary economic power should come an earnest responsibility to keep its platforms clean of hate. This is a standard we already have in the contexts of traditional media formats, thanks to a combination of corporate commitments and regulatory stipulations. Facebook played a dangerous game of calculus in 2018: Let’s not rankle the ruling party by taking action against violent political speech at a time when we are trying to expand our domination of the Indian social media market. Time and again, the company finds itself having to wade delicately through these issues after the harm has already been done. This is because Facebook is, in essence, a machine designed to maximise consumer engagement for forward monetistation. The reason that Raja Singh’s posts go viral is not only because he has a political base that follows his brand of political leadership. It is also because it is psychologically engaging to a vast set of people. Hateful conduct is shocking, and often, we consume it because we cannot believe what we are seeing. We cannot believe that a public personality could say such things. And in many cases, we only want to see more and more of it, even if we are in the marginalised group that politician is offending.It is this sort of engagement that Facebook craves. Because so long as it has our attention, it can collect the data it needs to behaviourally profile us and capitalise on our personalities. This commercial incentive threatens the very nature of democracy — and this is not a characteristic solely of Facebook’s, but rather is a theme across the breadth of the consumer Internet sector today.National politicians in India must set the right example — not endorse the wrong ones or, worse, sidestep the issue entirely. Indian citizens need to have the tools necessary to hold the technology industry accountable — and that is an imperative that must start with policy action in New Delhi.Dipayan Ghosh, PhD, is co-director of the Digital Platforms & Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School, and author of Terms of Disservice.

20-08-2020||Mumbai||Bidders invited to qualify for ₹1,642-crore CSMT redevelopment project||The Indian Railways Station Development Corporation Limited(ISRDC) has invited bidders for the request for qualification (RFQ) for the redevelopment of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT). The RFQ is a process to shortlist and qualify applicants who will be asked to submit financial bids for the redevelopment. ISRDC will be undertaking the redevelopment of the station at ₹1,642 crore. The project is likely to begin next year and is targeted to be completed in four years. “RFQ is called in order to inspect and check the information from the bidders. The process will take three months post which a station plan will be called for. The redevelopment work is likely to start next year.” said a senior ISRDC official. CSMT will be redeveloped through the public private partnership (PPP) model. The plan will involve construction of commercial spaces including restaurants and cafes along with parking spaces for passengers inside the terminus. Segregation of outstation and local train passenger movements with the help of connecting decks has been planned. The ISRDC plan includes construction of an elevated deck connecting platform number eight to platform number 18. The deck will be accessible for passengers coming via the P’D’ Mello Road entrance of the railway station towards the present main entrance of the terminus. ISRDC has also planned for the construction of an underpass for passengers near the present pre-paid taxi stand near the divisional railway manager’s (DRM) office at CSMT. This will be done by dismantling railway buildings that comprise the main reservation office and railway offices that are adjacent to the DRM office. An additional holding area for passengers will be created at the P D’Mello Road entrance along with the current main entrance for the outstation terminus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bidders-invited-to-qualify-for-1-642-crore-csmt-redevelopment-project/story-U5EmKLkFroGjSLjpxVnQpI.html

All four categories carried 1500 points each.Under the direct observation and citizen feedback categories, the city had a score in excess of 1000 each. In the service level progress, the city scored just above 800 while in the certification it scored around 500. Unlike previous surveys, where the survey of a city was done once at the start of the year, this time it was spread across three quarters.The service-level category rates a city on door-to-door collection of waste, segregation of waste, collection and transportation of waste, sweeping, percentage of wet waste treated, percentage of dry waste treated or recycled, management of C&D waste, remediation of waste dumpsites, number of bulk waste generators, number of houses processing wet waste at home, percentage of closed sewage connection, number of household toilets with direct water supply, number of toilets opened between 4 am-10pm, penalties on open urination, defecation or littering among other measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-ranks-62nd-out-of-382-cities-in-cleanliness/story-e2AIh6DucH409vraL1Y8GP.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||IMD downgrades forecast for Friday, predicts heavy rain this weekend||The weather bureau has downgraded its yellow alert (heavy rain across isolated areas) for Friday across Mumbai and Palghar, but retained the yellow alert for the weekend – the first two days of the 11-day Ganeshotsav festival.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) retained warnings (yellow alert) for Thane till Monday, and upgraded warnings to an orange alert (heavy to very heavy rain) for Ratnagiri, Raigad, Pune and Satara till Sunday.According to IMD Mumbai’s weather bulletin issued on Thursday, a well-marked low-pressure weather system over interior Odisha, adjoining Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand is likely to move westwards over three to four days, over parts of Madhya Pradesh, activating weather systems over the Arabian Sea. “This has already strengthened the southwesterly monsoon flow, enhancing rain activity over the Konkan coast and interior Maharashtra,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD.On Thursday, the city witnessed cloud cover through the day, with light to moderate rain and isolated intense heavy spells for brief periods. South Mumbai recorded 26.8mm rain while 15.4mm rain was recorded in the suburbs between 8.30am and 5.30pm. The weather bureau also warned that there would be gusty winds reaching 45-55 kmph along and off the coast over the weekend.

20-08-2020||Gurugram||Rain brings 12 hour power cuts in areas of Gurugram||Several residential colonies have been witnessing long hours of power cuts since Wednesday morning due to the persistent rainfall in the city. Residents of Tatvam Villas, Sector 56, 57, Palam Vihar, Ashok Vihar, Sector 45, Sector 40, Sushant Lok-1, Ardee City, Sector 31, Jalvayu Vihar, Sector 46 and several adjoining areas complained of unscheduled power cuts on Wednesday, which lasted for anywhere between eight to 12 hours. In some areas, residents complained that power supply had not been restored till Thursday morning. The basements in the societies were flooded with water, following which the developers had switched off the electricity and power backup system, residents claimed. On Thursday, residents took to social media to vent their anger against the power distribution utility DHBVN for failing to provide uninterrupted supply. Many complained that the power infrastructure in the city was poor, and even light spells of rain often lead to frequent power outages. Shuilu Dar, a resident of Tatvam Villas on Sohna Road, said that power went off around 9.30am on Wednesday and came back only around 7pm. “On Thursday again, there was a power cut of eight hours and the supply was restored only at 12.30pm. The authorities should inform residents about such long hours of power cuts. There is no communication on part of the distribution company and people, including Covid patients, are being left to suffer,” she said. Residents also said that the power outage hampered their work from home routine. A resident of Sushant Lok-3 said that his two sons are working in different states of the country but were here working from home . They could not attend the office meetings which has led to an explanation being called from them. “The invertor batteries also died as there is no power since Wednesday morning. There are senior citizens living alone and managing on their own. It becomes very difficult to manage without electricity,” said Umang Kumar (71). In many areas, the power supply was hampered due to faults in cables, said DHBVN officials, adding that the power was restored in the first half of the day. The residents, however, said that they had to remain without supply for almost 12 hours. The residents of Sushant Lok -1 complained that there was no power all day on Wednesday and on Thursday they barely got electricity for an hour. They could not even recharge their mobile phones and were stranded inside their homes, as roads outside were flooded. “The residents of Sushant Lok -1 suffered immensely due to the power cut that started around 9am. There was no water supply as without electricity we could not even pump up water,” said Sanjay Bakshi, a resident of Block A Residents also complained that despite DHBVN repeatedly asserting that it was upgrading infrastructure across the city, the situation on the ground had improved very little. Isha Tyagi, a resident of Ardee City said that there was a major fault in their area, which took almost 12 hours to be fixed. “The situation was really bad and everyone, including senior citizens,suffered due to power cuts. There was no power all night and on Thursday we got very little power supple. The fall in temperature helped a bit though,” she said. “Teams of DHBVN have been deployed in all the affected areas and they are attending to the complaints to ensure resumption of supply. During rains, the number of complaints increase because of snapping of trees which disrupt supply. All efforts are being made to restore power to affected areas at the earliest,” said KC Agarwal, chief engineer, operations, Delhi circle. Joginder Hooda, executive engineer, Gurugram I, said that the reason for power disruption was that 28 electricity poles collapsed, which caused supply disruption in various parts of the city. “The lines got snapped and supply was affected, but our teams managed to connect these snapped wires to other sources of supply, as poles could not be erected again. Power has been restored in most of the areas but during such heavy rains, such problems can arise,” said Hooda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/rain-brings-12-hour-power-cuts-in-areas-of-gurugram/story-q21ycWSdrzQlSAuSAwi3XJ.html
20-08-2020||Gurugram||Police personnel plug 187 potholes in the city to avert mishaps||Officers of Gurugram Police filled up at least 187 potholes between Wednesday and Thursday at more than 20 spots across the city to avert mishaps on the flooded streets. On Wednesday, Gurugram experienced nearly 158mm of rainfall between 8.30am on Wednesday and 8am on Thursday, inundating several stretches of the city. As a result, at least 28 cars and 35 two-wheelers got stuck in potholes that had to be removed with the help of cranes and ropes, said the police.Police personnel were seen standing in knee-deep water, helping commuters to cross roads and overseeing operations to remove cars, which had broken down in waterlogged areas. Photos and videos of the police personnel trying to fill the pothole were shared widely on social media by residents and drew widespread appreciation from netizens. At least 4,250 police personnel were deployed at 32 vulnerable points in Gurugram to manage the traffic situation on Wednesday morning after night-long incessant rains. Police personnel filled up potholes with the help of mud and interlocking tiles. Police commissioner KK Rao said mishaps due to potholes were reported from many stretches across the city such as Sector 10, Hero Honda Chowk, Sector 5 , Udyog Vihar , Jharsa chowk, Sector 31, Sector 15, New Railway Road, Sector 51, etc. “Many cars and two wheelers got stuck in the potholes, resulting in minor injuries and damaging of vehicles. As such, we took a call and started temporarily filling them,” he said. The Gurugram Police had earlier identified 265 accident-prone potholes across the city two months ago. Citing the danger posed by these potholes to citizens and commuters, Rao said that personnel were instructed to go ahead with the process of filling potholes instead of waiting for the civic body to repair them. Rao said due to the current situation they cannot depend on civic agencies to fill the potholes. Therefore, police officers have been asked to fill them up temporarily. Ajay Kumar, a constable deployed near Huda Metro station, said that he, with the help of his colleagues, filled up potholes with stones and bricks found near the spot. “Many cyclists and motorists got stuck and three of them got injured . It was difficult to identify these spots but we managed to fill up six such potholes with an hour,” he said.  The police personnel were also seen tying ropes to cars that got stuck and pulling them. Some officials were also seen pushing auto-rickshaws. Shahid Ahmed, in-charge of traffic control room, said that their team tracked the issues on a real-time basis and shared pictures of waterlogging and commuters who got stuck. “We were sitting in front of camera and were watchful. We were sending the screen shots and videos on our police group to apprise the officials deployed on the ground to manage the situation,” he said. Rao said that the police personnel who went beyond the call of duty and worked for more than 12 hours standing in knee-deep water helping commuters will be rewarded. “The personnel will be felicitated with appreciation letters, mementos and ₹5,000 as reward money,” he said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/police-personnel-plug-187-potholes-in-the-city-to-avert-mishaps/story-OoblkGs7bJ3hXCCH9rvs9K.html
20-08-2020||Gurugram||Two men booked for threatening district town planner during demolition drive||Two persons were booked by Gurugram police on Wednesday for allegedly threatening district town planner (enforcement) and obstructing the work of government officials during a demolition drive being carried out in Sector 34 on Tuesday.According to the complaint submitted by RS Bhath, district town planner(enforcement) to the police, the duo was allegedly involved in building an illegal colony in Sector 34 on land owned by two other persons. The suspects hadn’t got any permission and license from the department of town and country planning. “The two persons were developing an illegal colony without any license and on Tuesday when the enforcement team started demolition drive, they misbehaved with staff, obstructed the work being carried out by government officials and also threatened me,” Bhath said in his complaint.Based on Bhath’s complaint, a case was registered against the two suspects at Sadar police station under Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975 and sections 186 ( obstructing a public servant in the discharge of his public functions,) 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 34(Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and 353 (using criminal force to any person being a public servant in the execution of his duty as such public servant) of the Indian Penal Code. “A case has been registered in this matter and it is being probed,” said Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), Gurugram.During the demolition drive at the location, Bhath said, the enforcement team had cleared a five-acre area being illegally developed. Two makeshift tin shed offices, two rooms, and a tin boundary wall were demolished by the team, which was supported by a large team of city police.In his complaint, Bhath said the two suspects arrived in a luxury car at the spot and started arguing with officials. The duo allegedly told the officials that they had invested a lot of money in the project, and used abusive language against the officials apart from threatening Bhath. “We will not be deterred by such threats and the demolition drives against illegal colonies will continue. I am thankful to the Gurugram police and district administration for their active support and providing security to me after the incident,” he said.Two weeks ago, a property owner had allegedly hit the official while demolition was being carried out in Dharmpur village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-men-booked-for-threatening-district-town-planner-during-demolition-drive/story-iYIaSbwlFAPzTwdPkEfTXO.html

Gurugram received 118mm of rainfall on Wednesday, inundating several parts of the city. With more rain on Thursday morning, two underpasses — one at Hero Honda Chowk and the other at Rajiv Chowk — were also closed as a precautionary measure by civic body officials.As per a statement issued by DLF, the caretaker of the GCR underpass, more than 12 fire tenders, 11 de-watering motor pumps, 12 technicians, 20 housekeeping staff members, 10 technical managers from the district administration, 20 firemen, and a super suction machine of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) were pressed into service from Wednesday afternoon.“We started the draining operations at around noon on Wednesday and finally around 6pm on Thursday evening, the underpass was drained of rainwater. We are now cleaning the sediment and muck left behind by the rainwater, as it can potentially lead to accidents. The underpass is expected to open after midnight on Thursday,” said Satyawan Samriwal, assistant divisional fire officer (ADFO), Gurugram fire department.Samriwal said that each fire tender involved in the operation can disperse more than 1,800 litres of water per minute. However, with the underpass accumulating at least 24 crore kilolitre of rainwater, it took them more than 31 hours to clear it.“The underpass is nearly 3km long, and all of it was under water when we arrived. The volume of rainwater inside was simply too much. As such , it took us such a long time to clear the underpass of rainwater,” he said.Traffic police officials had closed the underpass at 11am on Wednesday. It is expected to become operational after midnight on Thursday.A statement by DLF on Wednesday had stated “the intensity of rainfall received this morning was 6-7 times higher than the designed capacity of the master drainage system of Gurugram.”As per DLF officials privy to the matter, the master drain of the Haryana Sahari Vikas Pradikaran (HSVP) had a blockage due to which rainwater in the underpass had nowhere to go. VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO) of Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) said that they are checking as to what caused the inundation and added that there is a possibility that the motor pumps of DLF Phase-1 failed to work properly.“We are investigating the exact cause of flooding, as this is first time flooding of such magnitude has taken place . We are suspecting that the motor pumps installed inside the underpass did not work properly or ran at a limited capacity. We are verifying this. Regardless, in the absence of drains on the surface, the underpasses on the Golf Course Road (of which the underpass is a part) remains vulnerable to waterlogging. It is, therefore, important to install motor pumps of adequate capacity to ensure that rainwater does not get accumulated,” said Kundu.A fresh statement issued by DLF statement on Thursday evening read, “Despite two consecutive nights of rains, a team of more than 60 people from DLF has been working tirelessly over the past 30 hours, with two fire engines, water tank and equipment like dewatering pumps, suction motor machine, alongside the government authorities, to make the underpass operational by today(Thursday) evening.We were extremely swift in deploying all our resources to clear 6 out of 7 underpass on Raghavendra Marg, in less than 6 hours time, despite high intensity rainfall which is 6-7 times higher than the designed capacity of the master drainage system of Gurugram (sic).” The statement further read.In other parts of the city more than 300 officials of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), MCG and their contractors were deployed overnight, along with 45 motor pumps, to clear the areas of rainwater.Other parts of the city:Following another spell of showers on Thursday morning, areas such as Narsinghpur, Khandsa, Hero Honda Chowk on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, and sectors 10, 27, 28, 42, 43, 56, 71, and 72 were once again inundated with knee-deep rainwater, thereby inconveniencing the residents of these areas. With a large amount of rainwater accumulating in the Hero Honda Chowk underpass, MCG officials closed it early morning on Thursday. The underpass is expected to reopen on Friday morning.“A lot of rainwater had accumulated inside the underpass. Although the volume of rainwater at the underpass is not alarming, but since it is located in a low-lying area and is in close vicinity to the Badshahpur drain, we have closed the underpass as a precautionary measure. There is always a possibility that Badshahpur drain may overflow and quickly inundate the underpass, resulting in traffic congestion. We decided not to take a chance,” said Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG.MCG officials said the underpass at Rajiv Chowk near Medanta Hospital was also closed as a precautionary measure and gunny bags were put in front of the facility to ensure that rainwater does not accumulate inside. They said that this underpass too will reopen on Friday morning, provided there is no more rain.Meanwhile, several other parts of the city were also cleared of rainwater. “Barring Gadoli village, located next to Badshahpur drain, most stretches of the city were cleared of rainwater by 4pm. At Gadoli village, the Badshahpur drain overflowed, flooding the village. Since this has never happened before, we were not adequately prepared. As a result, it is taking us so much time to clear it. We are expecting to clear all the rainwater by Thursday night,” said Kundu.Kundu said out nearly 150 workers from MCG and GMDA are involved in the draining operations. Some have worked for nearly 40 hours at a stretch. “Our officials were on the field ever since it started raining on Wednesday morning. Since then they were engaged in clearing operations and worked throughout the night. Only daily wage workers of the contractors worked in shifts and took limited breaks. The rest of the staff were on duty throughout the time,” said Kundu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/rainwater-from-dlf-phase-1-underpass-finally-cleared-after-more-than-30-hours/story-kZmJQgOjVmBamFYBZ1ry1H.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||State minister Nitin Raut detained in UP on route to meet family of slain Dalit sarpanch||Maharashtra energy minister and chairman of the scheduled caste department of All India Congress Committee Nitin Raut was detained by Uttar Pradesh (UP) Police at the border of Azamgarh district on Thursday morning. The minister was travelling to meet the family of a murdered Dalit sarpanch of Bansgaon. When Raut reached the Azhamgarh border, he was detained by the police. He was asked to accompany them to a guest house, but the Congress leader refused and started a sit-in protest at Baghpur village on the border. Raut later flew back to Nagpur. “I was heading towards Bansgaon to meet the family members of Dailit sarpanch Satyamev Jayate who was brutally killed a few days ago. Dalits are not safe under chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath rule. Men are brutally killed, while women face atrocities. Neither have the culprits been arrested, nor the family has been given any help by the government. Downtrodden are not tolerated if they try to raise their voice against injustice,” Raut said.Local Congress leaders including Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee chief Ajay Kumar Lallu, were with Raut during his visit and the protest. Jayate, popularly known as Pappu Ram, was allegedly shot dead by three men on motorcycles last Friday. He was allegedly killed by an upper-caste man as he had ‘advocated the cause of social justice’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-minister-nitin-raut-detained-in-up-on-route-to-meet-family-of-slain-dalit-sarpanch/story-i4ez3GZ6KXYDDtjkY5uFYM.html
20-08-2020||Gurugram||Government colleges conduct 2-day mock admission drill||With the online process for admission to undergraduate courses in government colleges expected to start by next week, colleges across the state carried out a two-day mock admission exercise to pre-empt potential errors. While the mock exercise was completed on Thursday, the final trial would take place on Friday. In a directive shared with principals of all government colleges across the state on Tuesday, the department said that it had commissioned an admission portal for first-year admissions and the two-day mock drill was aimed at testing the portal for any technical glitches that might crop up. As part of the mock exercise, colleges tested the portal by filling in various entries with student data that was already available with colleges. Pooja Khullar, principal of the Dronacharya Government College, said that each college in the state had been asked to carry out a mock online admission exercise. As part of the exercise, college teachers was asked to complete the admission process for 50 applicants by using already available information. “A mock exercise was carried out so that admissions can take place smoothly and students don’t have to face any difficulties. Due to the pandemic, the department wants to ensure that the entire process takes place online without any hassle, so that students are not required to visit colleges,” said Khullar. She added that a number of issues surfaced on Wednesday and feedback pertaining to these glitches was sent to a team for resolution. “Teachers from commerce, arts, and science streams were put in charge to check for problem areas and make recommendations for improvements,” said Khullar. Unlike last year, the higher education department has not roped in a private agency for admission this time. Satyamanyu Yadav, principal of Government College in Sector 9, said that the department was handling the complete admission process through the National Informatics Centre (NIC). “Private agencies are not involved in the admission process this time. The NIC has developed the portal, which is being tested. The mock drill is over for now and all the problems notified by us will be taken up and resolved after which a final trial will take place on Friday,” said Yadav. He said that the admission schedule is expected to be out by next week, once the final trial is complete. Centralised admissions for government colleges across the state are regulated by the department of higher education. The admission process usually starts in June every year with classes beginning in August. In view of the pandemic, the process has been delayed this year. Yadav said that the new online portal would be seeking exhaustive information from the students so that details shared can be used in the future as well. “Every year, scholarship forms are filled separately. This time, there is a possibility that the information sought from students during the admission process will be used in the future since uncertainty continues to prevail due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The department doesn’t want students to make unnecessary visits to colleges,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/government-colleges-conduct-2-day-mock-admission-drill/story-u6YxzCqNYrGpHet1r101ZN.html
20-08-2020||Gurugram||Motorcyclist killed after being hit by tractor on Gurugram-Faridabad Road||A 28-year-old man died after his motorcycle was allegedly hit by a tractor trolley near Gwal Pahari area on Gurugram-Faridabad Road on Wednesday afternoon. The police said the suspect, the tractor trolley driver, abandoned his vehicle near the spot after the collision and escaped on foot. He is yet to be arrested. According to the police, the victim, identified by first name as Sailesh, was a resident of Najafgarh in Delhi and worked in a construction company in Sector 48. On Wednesday around 2pm, his brother-in-law, Bharat, paid a visit to his office, following which they decided to head to Faridabad on their motorcycles. In the police complaint, Bharat said, “He told me he had some official work in Faridabad. Around 2.30pm, we left from Sector 48 on our respective motorcycles. I was driving ahead of him. Since he was lagging behind, I stopped at a restaurant on Faridabad road and waited for him. A few minutes later, I saw his motorcycle approaching the restaurant. Suddenly, a tractor trolley took a left turn and hit his motorcycle.” He added that his brother-in-law fell on the road and suffered severe injuries. “I ran towards the tractor trolley but the driver drove away. A commuter took my brother-in-law to a hospital in Sector 56, where he died during treatment.” The police said the tractor trolley was found abandoned a few metres from the accident spot. “The suspect escaped from the spot. His tractor has been seized. We are trying to trace him with the help of the regional transport authority officials,” said a police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity. A case was registered against the suspect under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 304A (causing death by negligence) of Indian Penal Code(IPC) at DLF Phase 1 police station on Wednesday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/motorcyclist-killed-after-being-hit-by-tractor-on-gurugram-faridabad-road/story-K4SAu6usODJoKeUAzl0fEM.html
20-08-2020||Gurugram||Road caves in at busy Iffco Chowk on Delhi-Gurgaon expressway||A sizeable chunk of road on the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway at the busy Iffco Chowk crossing gave way on Thursday morning, after two days of torrential rain and subsequent waterlogging across the city. After the matter came to the notice of NHAI and police officials, the damaged portion of road was immediately cordoned off around 9.30am and repair work started by the contractor around an hour later. Officials said around 700 sqft area of road was damaged due to the depression and it has been temporarily repaired. The is the second incident of road cave in at Iffco Chowk, the earlier incident having happened in August 2019. In 2019, a section of road along the L-shaped underpass on MG road had caved-in after heavy rain hit the city. The sidewalls of the underpass from Iffco Chowk to Mehrauli were damaged and it then took around two days for the contractor and authorities to repair the stretch. NHAI officials on Wednesday said that the damage at Iffco Chowk could have been worse. But the situation was saved partly because most of the rainwater from Aravallis — that in the past has caused damage and waterlogging at various stretches at NH8, including Iffco Chowk — this time collected mostly at Golf Course Road underpasses and heavy damage was prevented in areas downstream . “The damage at Iffco Chowk was caused due to waterlogging at a spot where large power transmission towers stood earlier. The towers were removed for construction of this road. Heavy digging was carried out at this spot and it seems that stagnation of water caused the depression. We have made initial repairs and stopped movement of vehicles,” said Vikas Mittal, manager, NHAI, who reached Iffco Chowk in the morning. As per officials, the affected stretch has been cordoned off and repaired temporarily by the contractor. “We have removed the road surface and dug the damaged area after which repair was done using construction material . The damaged portion of the road shall be repaired in a proper manner, when the rain subsides,” said Prem Kumar, an official of Gawar Constructions, who was overseeing the repair.Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAi said that two small portions of the road, measuring 10x 8 metres and 6x8 metres respectively, caved in due to ingress of water. “The cave-in happened in an area where earlier there were electrical HT 220kv towers, which were later shifted, the area dug up and the road constructed. The cave in has been repaired and the affected area was barricaded,” he said, adding that the road will be made motorable by evening. Sharma also.said that NHAI resumed traffic at the Medanta underpass on Thursday around 11 am. “We had cleared the underpass of water on Wednesday evening but in consultation with civic agencies started traffic on Thursday morning,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/road-caves-in-at-busy-iffco-chowk-on-delhi-gurgaon-expressway/story-0J00hrfGYHmmLL2xtlzrBM.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai crime branch probes underworld link to Juhu developer’s murder||Following the murder of 55-year-old Juhu real estate developer and chairman of AI Sofi Group, Abdul Munaf Shaikh on August 17, the Mumbai crime branch is now probing the possibility of an underworld connection to the case. Crime branch sources said that while two accused, Abdul Rehman Abdul Latif Shaikh alias Sonu, 30, and Nadeem Naushad Shaikh, 29, have been arrested in the case, it was not probable that Abdul planned the murder. Initial reports suggested that Abdul had given a contract of ₹5 lakh to Nadeem to carry out the murder, but investigations have revealed that the plot was hatched a long time back, said crime branch sources. Investigations have revealed that Abdul had given a similar contract of ₹2 lakh to Ankit Trikha alias Ankit Punjabi in October 2019 to kill Shaikh. Trikha had followed the developer for almost 10 days while he used to walk to the mosque to offer prayers. Trikha tried to attack Shaikh but backed off at the last moment as there were too many people present near the mosque. Trikha was reluctant to commit the murder and changed his mind, said crime branch officers. Later, he contacted a person named Anwar Mullah who lived in the same vicinity as that of the developer and allegedly told him about the murder contract. “Anwar Mulla took Trikha to meet Shaikh at his residence and Trikha narrated the entire story to Shaikh, who had recorded the conversation on his phone. Shaikh had then approached DN Nagar police station with a complaint,” said a police officer, requesting anonymity. DN Nagar police, however, did not register and offence but had questioned Abdul. Police had also questioned Trikha for two days without registering any offence, added crime branch sources. “The manner in which Shaikh’s complaint was not registered, Abdul was let off indicates a larger plot,” said a crime branch officer. “It is not possible that Abdul could plan all by himself to kill Shaikh, and we have information that another group that deals in real estate in the area might be behind the murder,” he added.“Preliminary inquiry reveals that the murder was due to a fall-out over a 6-acre slum plot on which Shaikh was to start an SRA project. It seems that someone associated with the underworld conspired to kill Shaikh through a local group that deals in real estate,” said the officer. “We will inquire all possible angles on who had given the contract to Abdul and also probe any underworld involvement,” said senior inspector Mahesh Desai of the Unit 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-crime-branch-probes-underworld-link-to-juhu-developer-s-murder/story-akilDxvZN42PJvZbgmvh9L.html
20-08-2020||Gurugram||Police evacuate 13 families as building tilts to a side after heavy rain||Thirteen families were evacuated on Thursday after a neighbouring four-storeyed building under construction in Gurugram’s sector 46 tilted slightly following heavy rain, said police. The building had a wall that would normally be almost touching the wall of another building only two storeys high. On Thursday people noticed that a 10-inch gap had formed between the two, suggesting one side of the four storey building’s foundation weakened following heavy rain. However, government agencies were yet to confirm thisAt the time of the incident, the unoccupied residential building had labourers working. Those who were moved were neighbours whose buildings may have been affected had the building fallen.Police commissioner KK Rao said that police were informed of the situation at around 8.15am. “A team of Sector 50 police station was sent to the spot and after conducting recce of the area, at least 13 families residing in the neighbourhood were asked to vacate for their own safety,” he said. Emergency response teams, a sub-divisional officer from the Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) and a disaster management team soon arrived.“All necessary procedures were undertaken immediately and the tenants were led to safety,” Rao said. Residents said that the building tilted towards the side where the support was weak. Gurugram witnessed heavy rainfall on Wednesday, clocking nearly 11.8mm, flooding many areas. Rajkumar Yadav, president, resident welfare association (RWA) of sector 46, said that the sector had been transferred to the municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG) two years ago, but was yet to construct a drainage system. “The sewerage pipeline is eight inches wide but that is only enough for a double storey building. The district administration instead permitted a four-floor building with stilt parking. There is no infrastructure in the area and residents are at risk,” he said. HSVP had made stilt parking mandatory for buildings higher than two floors in towns falling under hyper-potential category such as Gurugram. Dharamvir Punia (61), a resident of Sector 46 who vacated the house, said that the building may have to be razed. “If there was a house on the weak side, the building could have been saved. The water-logging weakened the foundation a lot and it is likely to fall,” he said. The owner of the building, Delhi resident Rajesh Kumar, said that he installed a hydraulic machine to support the structure after the building was evacuated. “I am consulting with contractors and experts but there is little chance to save the building. I will have to break the entire building which is a huge loss and hard work of nearly two years,” said Rajesh Kumar, the owner. MCG officials who visited the spot said that they were coordinating with the disaster management team to ensure the safety of nearby houses and residents. “We are coordinating with other departments and our prime concern is the safety of the residents,” said Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG. An HSVP team visited the spot and said a structural audit of the building would be carried out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/police-evacuate-13-families-as-building-tilts-to-a-side-after-heavy-rain/story-s7fUrC38gB1zbWoMb6QdIN.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||Why does Hindmata keep getting waterlogged? BMC to undertake topographical survey to find out||Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will map the topography and assess the condition of the stormwater drainage system between the chronic water logging spot of Hindmata on BA Road in Dadar (East) and the Britannia pumping station. The study will help determine reasons for continued waterlogging at Hindmata – Mumbai’s worse flood spot – even after BMC’s massive drain augmentation work at and around this junction over the past two years, worth over ₹50 crore.Mapping the topography will determine if the drains are damaged, have odd elevations preventing the free flow of water, have utility cables, or are blocked with tree roots or crusted garbage.Along with this survey, BMC is also planning to build more drains around Hindmata so that water from this elevated region does not flow downward toward BA Road, according to a stormwater drains department official.BMC in 2018 said it undertook a similar survey to map drains around Hindmata. A civic official from the stormwater drains department said, “This survey was done only in parts and not the entire stretch up to Britannia. We need to find out where the bottleneck is and why the water would not drain out even after the work BMC has carried out. Augmentation of the drain at and around Hindmata has reduced water receding time, but not prevented waterlogging entirely.”Since Hindmata is saucer-shaped, it used to receive water from Parel, Lalbaug, and Dadar. BMC planned to intercept this water via augmented stormwater drains before it reached Hindmata, and carry it to Britannia pumping station directly. Before the drain augmentation work, this water would flow to Hindmata, and one pipeline at the junction carried water from three localities to Britannia pumping station.BMC also augmented this pipeline to increase its capacity to 50mm rainfall per hour from the current capacity of 25mm per hour. It installed a box drain along 800 metres of BA Road from Hindmata.Swapnaja Kishirsagar, assistant commissioner of the F South ward, with jurisdiction over Hindmata, said, “About 10% work on the circular drain around Hindmata is incomplete at Chinchpokli, which may be the bottleneck. Work was affected because of the unavailability of labour due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Work on augmenting the 800-metre stretch of the drain on BA Road is complete.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/why-does-hindmata-keep-getting-waterlogged-bmc-to-undertake-topographical-survey-to-find-out/story-mwF9huzdDBQm78ItmEVUiI.html

20-08-2020||City||New Patripool bridge work begins, traffic prohibited at night till August 24||The Patripool bridge on the Kalyan-Shilphata stretch in Thane will be closed from 10pm to 5am till August 24. Thane traffic police had to announce this decision following the work of laying girders for the new parallel bridge.In a notification issued on Wednesday evening, Thane traffic police said since the work of laying girders for the parallel bridge had to be done, the existing Patripool bridge, which is being used, will remain closed during night hours.The 104-year-old Patripool bridge in Kalyan was dismantled in November 2018 before the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) took up the work of the new bridge. Several deadlines were announced for the completion of the bridge. However, none of them was met. Commuters and activists have been complaining about the delay in building the new bridge as they face traffic snarls on the existing Patripool bridge.The new deadline set by the MSRDC for the completion of the project is August-end.The work of the new Patripool bridge got a boost in May this year as the MSRDC officials planned to use the lockdown period to complete the project.“The bridge will remain shut as the work of laying girders will be undertaken. The existing bridge will be used to park the crane that will lift the girders and lay it for the new bridge. We have given alternative routes which should be followed to avoid any sort of congestion at the site,” said Amit Kale, deputy commissioner of traffic police, Thane.As per the notification from Thane police, heavy vehicles taking the Kalyan-Shil road will not allowed entry at Rajnouli chowk at Bhiwandi naka and will be diverted to Khategaon toll naka-Mumbra bypass road.Small vehicles taking the Shil road will not be allowed entry at Durgadi chowk and will be diverted to Adharwadi chowk-Khadakpada chowk-Waldhuni bridge-Kalyan east.Vehicles coming from Kalyan Nagar route will not be allowed entry at Subhash chowk and will be diverted from Netaji chowk to Waldhuni bridge. Those vehicles leading towards Patripool bridge from Kalyan-Shilphata stretch will not be allowed entry from Suchak naka.Work on the most-awaited new, two-lane Patripool bridge came to a halt on March 23 after the lockdown to fight Covid-19 pandemic was imposed. However, it was resumed by April 2 with minimum workers at the site.An officer from MSRDC , who did not wish to be named, said, ”The work for laying girders will take five days. It will be done during night hours while is no traffic movement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-patripool-bridge-work-begins-traffic-prohibited-at-night-till-august-24/story-KSz0VFlpfm4kPKZeMv8LGK.html
20-08-2020||City||Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan show improvement in Swachh ranking||In a marked improvement from the previous year, Thane city ranked 14th in the country and third in the state in the Swachh Survekshan 2020. The city was at the 57th position in the country last year. Navi Mumbai too showed improvement and ranked third in the country and the cleanest in Maharashtra. Kalyan-Dombivli and Ambernath also showed improved ranking compared to the previous year. The jump in ranking for Thane, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) claimed, is owing to increasing the number of community toilets, commissioning five new waste treatment plants and good public feedback. For the past few years, the city’s ranking has suffered due to lack of solid waste management. The city generates around 1,000 metric tonne waste a day, of which 425 metric tonne is wet waste, 375 metric tonne is dry waste and the rest is construction and demolition debris, most of which is dumped at the Diva dumping ground. Deputy municipal commissioner Sandeep Malvi said, “The city had ranked 57th last year in the category of cities with population of more than 10 lakh. This year we ranked 14th across the country and third in state, after Navi Mumbai and Nashik, with 4,606.35 points.” The corporation scored well on citizen’s feedback and direct observation, said officials from the solid waste department. An official said, “This year we have commissioned five new waste processing plants, which include plants for composting, wood waste and biomethanisation. These plants are set up at Hiranandani Estate, Vrindavan Society, Kausa, Kalwa and Kopri. The Diaghar biomethanisation plant is also operational. We have reduced the amount of waste dumped in Diva dumping ground which helped us improve the score.” He further said that sanitation was also another point of focus and added, “We have increased the number of community toilets and also ensured that the existing toilets are cleaned regularly. Citizens also gave a positive feedback which improved the ranking.” Residents, however, claimed more needs to be done. “Most of the solid waste processing plants are merely on paper, while waste continues to pile up in nooks and corners of the city. Emphasis should be given on cleanliness of slums, especially in Kalwa and Mumbra. The corporation had beautified roads and footpaths in some areas, but there are not enough dustbins in the city,” said Amol Suryarao, a 37-year-old resident. ‘Residents helped improve ranking’The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has given the credit for ranking as the cleanest city in Maharashtra and third in the country to its residents. The city had ranked seventh last year. NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar said, “Navi Mumbai is the only city in Maharashtra to have received a 5-star rating in becoming debris-free city under Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan, and is among the top six in the country. We have also received ODF+ (open defection free) rating. The credit should go to the residents who wholeheartedly supported the measures taken by NMMC.” Former NMMC Swachhata Mission Tadartha Committee chairperson Netra Shirke said, “Large housing societies and hotels are producing fertiliser through plants set up within their premises. The same is happening in all civic schools and gardens. Similarly, a zero-waste slum model has been implemented in Ramnagar area of Digha.” Ambernath ranks third in state in smaller cities categoryThe Ambernath Municipal Council (AMC) has ranked 18th in the country and third in the state among cities with population of less than 10 lakh as opposed to its last year’s 30th rank in the country. AMC officials claimed proper waste management, management of ghanta gadi, waste composting projects helped in improving the ranking. “The civic body has managed to implement ghanta gadi service efficiently which helped in reducing dumping of waste on roads. Volunteers conducted door-to-door visits to explain waste segregation. We focused on keeping chowks and prominent places in the city clean,” said Prashant Rasal, chief officer, AMC. Kalyan Dombivli ranks 6th in state The Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) ranked sixth in the state and 22nd in country, in a marked improvement from previous year’s ranking of 77th in the country. One of the major reasons for improvement in rank is implementing waste segregation rules, decreasing the amount of waste dumped at Adharwadi dumping ground, claim officials from the civic solid waste management department. “Citizen’s participation in waste segregation has improved the rank to some extent. Also some of our waste management projects have begun functioning. Similarly, we have reduced dumping waste at Adharwadi dump yard from 650 metric tonne to 50 metric tonne. We have also began processing dry and wet waste. We have plans to close the dump yard through bio-remediation method, and the work for the same is already under progress,” said Ramdas Kokre, deputy municipal commissioner, KDMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-navi-mumbai-kalyan-show-improvement-in-swachh-ranking/story-cRcNu9wzu5p0F8QC6UZ3mK.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||Milind Deora and Devendra Fadnavis agree middle ground in politics has shrunk, ideology has become divisive||Congress party leader and former member of Parliament (MP) Milind Deora on Thursday said that political parties across the spectrum need to encourage “inner party democracy and external democracy” and allow their members the latitude to express their views. “I have never strayed away from party’s core ideological viewpoint but on issues of governance or development... On peripheral issues, I see no harm, regardless of how disciplined a party is, to allow its members to take a different stand unless you are like the party spokesperson. Then you have to be disciplined and your voice is the gospel voice of the party. I could never really be my party’s spokesperson because I am free with my opinions at least on peripheral issues,” said Deora, who is often seen as a voice of dissent within his party. Deora, along with former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, were guest speakers at the online launch of ‘India Tomorrow: Conversations with the Next Generation of Political Leaders’ – a book by professor Pradeep Chibber and Harsh Shah, organised by the Centre of Policy Research. During the panel discussion, Fadnavis and Deora agreed on several talking points during this conversation, including that the space for a middle ground in politics has shrunk. “Fifteen or 20 years back, there was no political untouchability. There has been shrinkage of space in politics for people from opposite sides to have a dialogue or discuss. We can have different ideologies but we are not enemies. The situation in Maharashtra is still good, in some southern and northern states, people act like enemies. We need to introspect as to why this is happening, and all of us have to try and change this,” said Fadnavis. Deora asked Fadnavis if he felt that politics had become too extreme and ideologies were too divisive to allow for collaborations across the aisles. On the issue of coalition politics, Fadnavis said that while he could see coalition politics continuing in states for another two decades, he termed the alliance in Maharashtra as “unnatural”. “What is happening in Maharashtra is absolutely unnatural. The three parties are pulling in three different directions and we can feel the heat. There is no decision making, this kind of politics cannot take the state forward. When it was only Congress and NCP, at least there was some cohesiveness, some decision making,” said Fadnavis. However, Deora pointed out that such “unique alliances” are a part of political compulsions and will continue until the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) retains its stronghold in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/milind-deora-and-devendra-fadnavis-agree-middle-ground-in-politics-has-shrunk-ideology-has-become-divisive/story-yIC7fmybsiTR5YwYEwSawL.html

The residents of Jaypee Kosmos have been told to use the stairs instead to go to and come from to their apartments in the towers which have 17 floors each.Sunil Bharadwaj, a resident of Tower KM – 16, who lives with his family on the 16th floor, said: “It rained heavily on Thursday and the complex was waterlogged. The society’s drainage system is poor and choked, due to which the tower’s basement was flooded. Rain water entered about three feet deep in the elevator and the management stopped the lifts,” he said. Both the towers had two lifts each and all four were out of order.Ananda Banerjee, a resident of Tower KM – 15, said he had to use the stairs to come down to collect a courier and go back all the way up to his 11th floor flat. “This is the first time the basement got flooded. The maintenance department must be prepared to avoid such unwanted incidents,” he said. He also demanded a revisit of the fire safety exit in his tower.The developer has so far given possession of flats in 24 towers in the society. Each tower has 17 stories and each floor has six apartments.Bharadwaj said that about 100 families live in each tower and 200 families are affected. “I wanted to take my child out for some work but had to postpone as the lift was not functional. There are some residents who need to visit doctors and attend to emergency calls. How can a person use the stairs all the time if they live on the 17th floor,” he said.The facility management of the complex had informed residents via text message that due to excessive rain on Wednesday and Thursday, rain water has accumulated in the lower basement. When contacted, Ravindra Badesra, head of facility management at Jaypee Kosmos, told HT: “We are using pumps to de-water the area. We hope the problem will be fixed by Friday. We have advised residents to use stairs as we have no other option.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/basement-waterlogged-all-four-lifts-in-two-towers-of-17-floor-high-rise-stops-working/story-pAEUVSmqVQ4MBd6lVx9zEP.html

20-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Phone survey finds only 14 Covid-19 cases since June 1, residents concerned||A district-level survey being conducted by booth-level officers (BLOs) has found only 14 positive Covid-19 cases till August 18 since its launch on June 1. The outcome of the survey conducted over the phone, whose findings were shared by the district administration, has prompted residents to raise concerns over the way it is being conducted as the tally of coronavirus (Covid-19) cases continues to rise sharply in Ghaziabad.According to the data shared by the administration, the survey spanned over 431,341 households and covered 1,889,043 residents. The survey which is tasked with identifying cases with symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) found only 1,149 suspected cases of Covid-19 taking the positivity rate (with respect to the survey) to just 1.21%.District officials said the survey is conducted by the BLOs through a telephonic communication with the local population under their jurisdiction.“The results of the survey by BLOs is almost negligible considering the district is reporting 80 to 100 positive cases daily currently. There is no use of deploying such a huge workforce if the results are not credible. The workforce can be put to more productive works.More importantly many residents including my neighbours and have neither received any calls under the survey,” said colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of flat owners’ federation.In Ghaziabad, on an average 100 cases are being reported daily in the month of August. The cases are detected through tests conducted at static booths, mobile vans, random camps and also through testing by surveillance teams deployed in containment zones.With 81 new cases in the last-24 hours, Ghaziabad has 6,955 Covid-19 cases with a test positivity rate of 4.93% on August 20.As many as 3,048 BLOs are engaged in the survey, with 237 supervisors who are usually teachers, shiksha mitras (contractual teachers).“The results by the telephonic survey are of little or no use. Door-to-door surveys are much better considering that teams can meet residents in person. If the survey result is low and can’t detect many cases, there is no point in wasting the workforce’s time,” said VK Mittal, president of Kaushambi Apartment RWAs (resident welfare association).When asked about the low outcome of the survey, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said, “The survey by BLOs is an additional initiative taken up by the administration in order to zero in on suspected cases. The teams are in touch with people over the phone in order to find out about ILI and SARI cases. The survey will continue.”A previous district-level survey, conducted on directions of the UP government from July 2 to July 12, had yielded better results with the detection of 150 positive cases after surveying a population of 38 lakh people in ten days.In contrast to the survey by BLOs, the survey by surveillance teams in containment zones has also produced better results. According to official records shared by the administration, the surveillance teams surveyed 501,449 households and identified 500 suspected cases between July 17 and August 17, and 57 persons were found positive for the infection.“The low results survey by the BLOs is primarily because residents don’t cooperate with them, and usually do not disclose correct information about people in the family having symptoms. The teams which include our teachers are working diligently even as the results are low,” said Anuj Tyagi, state secretary of UP Prathmik Shiksha Sangh—a union of primary school teachers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-phone-survey-finds-only-14-covid-19-cases-since-june-1-residents-concerned/story-Okhb7toUF4y7y3mxANGguM.html
20-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad among 11 districts selected for sero surveillance||Uttar Pradesh will test a section of the population for antibodies against the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, an exercise called serological surveillance or sero-surveillance. In the first phase, it launch the exercise in 11 districts, including Ghaziabad.The other districts are Kanpur City, Varanasi, Agra, Kaushambi, Prayagraj, Gorakhpur, Meerut, Moradabad, Lucknow and Baghpat.Sources in the state health department said that an internal communication has been sent to the districts and the exercise will also cover the viral diseases hepatitis-B and hepatitis-C simultaneously. They did not clarify why the department was checking these disease along with the pandemic.A serological survey checks for an immune response against the coronavirus in the form of antibodies in the blood of a random sample of the population. It can help establish how far the disease had spread and how many people fought off the virus without showing symptoms.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had previously conducted an all-India sero-sruvey, the results of which are yet to be published. Cities such as Delhi and Mumbai too had conducted the exercises. The latest in Delhi had found that around 29% of the population had antibodies to fight off the virus.Antibodies generally appear around two weeks after a person has been infected and is expected to last several months. So, the antibody test is not useful for detecting acute infection but indicates previous infection. For the Uttar Pradesh exercise, the districts have been asked to form 10 teams for collection of samples starting August 26 to August 30. “It basically gives direction to planners to find out whether the surveillance, testing activities need to continue or not,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. “The state administration has decided to include Ghaziabad district for the survey and we are expecting a government order soon,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Once the formal government order is issued to the district, two days are required for identification of members of the teams while one more day will be reserved for finalisation of the standard operating procedures. Thereafter, the training session will start and sample collection activities will begin from August 26. “The survey will involve random testing of local population in order to detect whether they developed antibodies or not to Sars-Cov-2. We have started exercise to identify teams and collect data which may be required during the survey,” said an officer from the health department who wished not to be quoted. On August 11, Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health), had issued directions to officials of nine districts, including Gautam Budh Nagar, for sero-surveillance. According to the directions, National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research was assigned to take up studies in Gautam Budh Nagar district. “The sero-surveillnce teams arrived and activities started 3-4 days ago. They have probably completed the survey and the results are awaited,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-among-11-districts-selected-for-sero-surveillance/story-yKBifoqZUPqeSrvwY2jOcN.html
20-08-2020||City||Swachh Survekshan 2020: Ghaziabad slips six notches to land at 19th spot||Ghaziabad city slipped six position to finish at the 19th spot in Swachh Survekshan 2020 announced by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) on Thursday. On a state level too, the city slipped from the top position to third, with Lucknow and Agra gaining ground.Ghaziabad was evaluated among other cities that had more than 1 million population.“Overall, the city secured 4283.26 marks out of 6000 in the results announced on Thursday,” said Arun Kumar Mishra, accounts officer of the Ghaziabad municipal-corporation and the nodal officer for the survey. Lucknow secured 4728.28 points (nationally 12th rank) and Agra got 4391.51 (nationally 16th).He said that the lack of a waste disposal facility cost them dearly. “That alone lost us about 500 points. Our only landfill site at Pratap Vihar (a composting plant at the site processed 300 metric tonnes of waste daily) closed down on directions of the National Green Tribunal in January, 2019. Ever since, we have not been able to find a permanent site for our solid waste disposal. Secondly, construction is yet to begin for the proposed waste-to-energy plant at Galand. At present we are only dependent on temporary sites for disposal of solid waste,” Mishra said, adding that the city lost its 3-star rating under garbage free city survey under the MoHUA and now had a 1-star rating this May. The district produces about 850-900 metric tonnes of daily solid waste per day.Ghaziabad’s latest ranking was in stark contrast with its recent performances. In 2017, it was ranked 351 nationally, 36th (2nd in state) in 2018 and 13th (1st in state) in 2019.A sign of things to come came in January with the the Swachh Survekshan 2020 league ranking where the city stoodl 32nd nationally in quarter 1 results and 30th in the quarter 2 results. The survey, in its fifth edition, looked at four broad parameters – direct observation (DO) of ground level cleanliness by survey teams, citizens’ feedback (CF), service level progress in terms of provision of services to citizens (SLP) and certifications. Overall, the Ghaziabad district bagged 1069.15 point in SLP, 700 for certifications, 1376 in DO and 1138.11 in citizen feedback. Overall, 1300099 citizens from Ghaziabad provided their feedback for the city during the Swachh Survekshan 2020. However, the points bagged by the city were much higher than the state average of 2246.88 points and also higher than the national average of 2214.38 points under the category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/swachh-survekshan-2020-ghaziabad-slips-six-notches-to-land-at-19th-spot/story-PXCm1vjp4pKjJvjDSL7YwO.html
20-08-2020||Noida||Swachh Survekshan 2020: Noida cleanest city in UP, bags 25th spot countrywide||Noida has been ranked as the cleanest city in Uttar Pradesh with a population of less than 10 lakh under the Swachh Survekshan 2020, the Central government’s annual survey, announced on Thursday.Noida also bagged the 25th spot, in the category of cities with a population between 1 lakh and 10 lakh, in the survey held by the union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) under Swachh Bharat Mission. This is a considerable improvement from last year when the city bagged the 150th position on the national level in the category.The city, which ranked 15th in the state last year, scored 4433.22 out of 6000 points in the 2020 cleanliness survey.The Noida authority, which is primarily responsible of taking care of infrastructure development and the civic work in the city, said it is taking necessary measures to perform even better in the 2021 survey.“It is a good jump for Noida rising up to the 25th rank in the country from the 150th position it secured last year. We feel that we can perform even better in the future. We have taken multiple steps to make Noida the best city in terms of cleanliness,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer, Noida authority.Authority officials said Noida performed well on citizens’ feedback securing 25th spot out of 382 cities that competed in the category (cities with a population between 1 lakh and 10 lakh).The Swachhta survey results were delayed in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Noida authority officials. The survey, which covered 4,242 cities and saw the participation of nearly 1.87 crore citizens, was completed in 28 days.Earlier in June 2020, Noida had got a 3-star rating city in a survey of garbage free cities (GFC), also conducted by the Central government under the Swachh Survekshan 2020. Under the (MoHUA), a seven-star rating is the highest, conferred to the city with a perfect waste management system.Noida has around 165 sectors and 65 villages, where daily 900 metric tonnes of waste is produced. The Noida authority started collecting waste door-to-door with the help of 250 vehicles and 21 compact machines which crush waste for its easy transportation in 2018 when the authority started participating in the cleanliness survey seriously. Noida was at the 324th spot in the 2018 ranking and failed to make serious improvements even in 2019 as well.“Initially, there was some error in uploading the data on the city’s efforts in the Swachhta survey. As a result, we could not perform well in the initial rounds. However, we feel Noida is far better than many other cities in terms of cleanliness,” said Maheshwari.“In the last two years, the Noida authority has taken some steps on handling garbage, collecting waste door-to-door, and waste management. Noida could have performed much better in ranking if the authority had taken these measures much earlier,” said PS Jain, president, confederation of Delhi-NCR RWAs (CONRWA), an umbrella body of residents’ welfare associations (RWAs).Nearly 60 community toilets, 140 public toilets, 10 ‘pink’ toilets and 119 urinals were built by the authority in the city, in the last two years, to discourage people from defecating in the open, said officials. It distributed 20,000 home composting kits, installed 2,000 dustbins at different sites, and focused on reducing, reusing, and recycling waste, they added. A bio-remediation plant at Mubarakpur was also set up in Sector 145 to treat waste the city, spread over 20,000 hectares of area, produces with the aim to perform better in the survey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/swachh-survekshan-2020-noida-cleanest-city-in-up-bags-25th-spot-countrywide/story-eCER2I2abuOhYRj50oG4CO.html
20-08-2020||Noida||Noida sees heaviest rainfall of season; similar spell likely next week||Noida and its adjoining regions saw the heaviest rainfall of the season over the past 24 hours, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting a similar spell over the next five days.Parts of both Noida and Ghaziabad will, however, continue to receive light rain showers over the next three days as well, weather analysts said. According to IMD’s radar-based estimation, Noida received 133 millimetre (mm) and Ghaziabad 144 mm rainfall over the past 24 hours between Wednesday at 8.30am and Thursday at 8.30am, while Greater Noida saw 51.1 mm rainfall over the past 24 hours.With unmanned weather monitoring stations in Ghaziabad and Noida defunct, rainfall is being measured using Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) that uses radar signals to analyse precipitation that covers a 250 km area around Delhi’s Lodhi garden.“Favourable weather conditions have led to such heavy rains over Noida and Ghaziabad region, which have been the heaviest of the season. There were favourable conditions which included passage of low-pressure monsoon trough line from over Delhi-NCR, while at the same time there was also the convergence of south-west winds from the Arabian Sea and south-east and easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal. This is one of the most favourable meteorological reasons for the heavy rains. Now, the line of the trough is shifting slowly towards the north of Delhi but the region will see light rain showers in the region due to high moisture,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. The deluge of the past 24-hours helped cover 8% of the rainfalldeficit in the rain-deprived Gautam Budh Nagar district. According to IMD’sdata, up to Wednesday, the city had received an average of 26.2 mm rainfallagainst an expected 360.9 mm for the season. By Thursday this climbedto 34.2 mm against an expected 366.7 mm. However, the deficit is still 91%, despite the rainfall till Thursday.Rainfall below 15mm is considered light, between 15 and 64.5 mm is moderate and above 64.5mm is heavy. MORE SPELLS LIKELY NEXT WEEKThe weather department foresees a similar build up during the intertwining night of August 25 and 26, when a similar rain pattern is most likely to hit the region.“More or less similar weather conditions like on Wednesday are likely to form around August 25 and 26. We are watching the movement of the monsoon trough closely and it seems that similar weather conditions favourable for moderate to heavy rains in the region will be formed,” added Srivastava. On Thursday, the mercury stayed well under the season’s average recorded at 29 degrees Celsius, five notches below the season’s average, against 27.7 degrees a day earlier. The IMD predicts maximum temperature to rise further on Friday and likely to hover around 31-32 degrees Celsius. The humidity oscillated between 100 to 94%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-sees-heaviest-rainfall-of-season-similar-spell-likely-next-week/story-UlA33sF4StYrmIL5VFzrgM.html

Over 1 lakh residents, mostly migrant workers residing in the area, commute on these roads and accidents take place due to deep potholes. On Thursday, a truck full of construction material overturned in the area. The MC and the MLA are not paying heed to the problem. We will continue our protest until the civic body does not repair these roads.”MLA (Ludhiana south), Balvinder Singh Bains said, “I have already apprised the protesting residents that the work order for constructing the main Giaspura road has been issued. However, the work is going on at a slow pace due to rainy season.”Earlier on August 11, members of the Samajwadi party had also staged a protest against the state government and MC for its in constructing the roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/irked-by-bad-roads-giaspura-residents-go-on-indefinite-protest/story-qqjUoOAC6M1mGjqJUgGl5L.html
20-08-2020||Delhi||Braving floods and a boat capsize, Delhi Police nabs two for burglary, recover ₹12 lakh loot||While a family from north-west Delhi was away at native village late last month, to perform the last rites of the head of the household who died of Covid-19, two men broke into their home and made off with ₹10 lakh cash and jewellery. After a harrowing investigation, in which their team braved flood waters and a boat capsize, the Delhi Police on Thursday said they have nabbed the suspects and recovered a part of the loot.“A part of the cash and jewellery was recovered from one of the suspect’s house in Maharjganj district of UP and some of it from a water tank atop the house of another suspect in Delhi,” said Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (north-west).Police said the burgled house in Shakurpur in north-west Delhi belonged to 51-year-old Madan Kishore Pathak, an astrologer and a temple priest, who lived with his wife and three children.Pathak’s son Vedank said, “On May 1, my father was diagnosed with Covid-19. He had kidney ailments as well and died on May 10. On the day we cremated him, my mother, my two older sisters and I were found positive for the virus.” After remaining in home isolation for a fortnight, the family left for their native village in Ayodhya to perform Pathak’s last rites. “On July 30, my neighbours saw the windowpane of our house broken and lights inside switched on. They alerted me and we returned to Delhi on June 1,” Vedank said.The family found the house ransacked and ₹10 lakh cash and gold and silver jewellery missing. “The cash was for my father’s kidney transplant and the jewellery was for my sister’s wedding that was scheduled for November,” Vedank said.When the police began their probe, the CCTV footage showed two suspects ,with their faces covered, walking away from the house. “Later, they uncovered their faces, and this helped us identify them,” a senior investigator said.“Our probe revealed that the suspects may fled Delhi. One of them, 19-year-old Nageshwar, belonged to Maharajganj district of Uttar Pradesh,” the investigator said.The police team reached Maharajganj to find the streets under water following heavy rain. “On August 13, the team had to use a boat to ferry their car and themselves from one village to another. But the rain swollen river was difficult to navigate and the boat toppled. The policemen had to swim to safety,” the officer said.Eventually, the police were able to recover ₹3.1 lakh in cash and some jewellery from Nageshwar’s house. The police were then tipped off about the suspects fleeing to Delhi. “On August 14, we arrested Nageshwar and his 21-year-old accomplice, Mohammad Chand, from Shakur Basti. At their instance, we recovered more cash and jewellery hidden in a water tank atop Chand’s house,” the officer said.The police have so far been able to recover ₹12.10 lakh in cash – a little more than what was reported stolen – and some jewellery, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/braving-floods-and-a-boat-capsize-delhi-police-nabs-two-for-burglary-recover-12-lakh-loot/story-DxYvKsJOaGBVqr71VBCcAP.html

We shall field candidates in all (70) seats in the state,” Kejriwal told reporters in Delhi.The hill state is presently ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).He said, “A lot of people from Uttarakhand reside in Delhi. They encouraged us to take this decision. Earlier this year, we conducted a survey and more than 62% people of Uttarakhand responded that they want AAP to contest polls in the state. People there believe in our Delhi model of development. They believe we can make a similar model for Uttarakhand too.”“The state has a major problem of unemployment, which ultimately leads to extremely high migration to other states. Government schools and colleges are in a poor shape and so is the health care infrastructure. These are the three major issues. We are in the process of developing a cadre base in Uttarakhand. We have also learnt that people there have lost hope with the BJP and the Congress,” Kejriwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-to-contest-uttarakhand-polls/story-AdtHwCFudBU5HVnIlp9pUN.html
20-08-2020||Delhi||JNU hostel committees demand waiver of hostel, mess charges||Hostel committee presidents of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) have written to the Dean of Students, demanding a waiver of the hostel and mess charges and urging that a circular asking the students to clear their dues before registering for the monsoon semester be withdrawn.In a related development, the JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) also wrote to the university authorities “to urgently approve and act upon initiating a phased return of students, starting on a priority basis with those stuck in Delhi-NCR and otherwise bona-fide residents and students, and terminal-year research scholars”.They also appealed that research scholars be granted an extension of six months from the date of entry to submit their thesis or dissertations and those who are unable to return to Delhi be given a further extension.The letter of the hostel committees said the JNU administration has initiated the registration process of the monsoon semester 2020 “at a time when the worsening pandemic situation and the administrative response have led to a majority of students not being present on the campus”.“Most of the students left the campus in March after an administrative circular advised them to do so. While they have neither availed mess nor hostel facilities since, they are being arbitrarily and unjustly charged for the same. Similarly, if students have not used hostel facilities such as their rooms, utensils or crockery, the charges are not logical at this juncture,” it said.In a circular issued on August 14, the JNU administration announced the online registration for the monsoon semester and said the students are required to pay all their dues such as tuition fees, hostel fees, mess charges etc.The letter also alleged that huge discrepancies were observed in the mess bills of students.“The residents that remain on campus have not been provided breakfast since the lockdown commenced, yet the mess bill for the students exceed what could be presumed reasonable,” it alleged.It also claimed that the quality of meals, in terms of nutrition and variety, too has been far lower than what is usually provided.“Even though the mess bills have been clearly inflated artificially, the mess secretaries have not been given the opportunity to examine the bills for discrepancies in a clear violation of the provisions of the Hostel Manual,” it said.The letter also stated that even before the lockdown began and the campus was vacated, most of the due fellowships were not disbursed. “Even now, the situation has not improved much, with most students not having received either one or even two semesters of fellowship. In this situation, expecting students to pay mess dues is illogical, while forcing the same is unjust,” it said.The letter appealed to the Office of the Dean of Students to recommend the withdrawal of mess dues, “wherever published, until the same is examined and audited by the concerned mess secretary”.“After the same is done, students should not be coerced to pay the bill until and unless their due fellowships for the last two semesters are disbursed,” it said.According to a JNU official, the students have not received inflated mess bills and have not paid their dues from January to March. He said it is mandatory that the dues are cleared before students are allowed to register for the monsoon semster.The university administration had asked the students to vacate the hostels on March 19 while citing the Covid-19 situation and an order of the Delhi government to close all institutions till March 30.The students’ union urged the JNU authorities to allow the students to return and cited internet connectivity issues in far-flung areas and the absence of laptops and books with students.“For many, JNU provides a more viable place for their research than their family residence. Furthermore, students from Jammu and Kashmir are unable to continue their academics due to the internet speed ban that has been in place there. A similar predicament is faced by students who hail from regions with intermittent internet and electricity access,” the JNUSU said. It added that presuming that the closure would be short, a number of students did not take their laptops and books, and claimed that the university has not even allowed them to return to take their belongings back.“In academic programmes like the Sciences, Computer Application and Geography/Population Studies, it is nearly impossible to write thesis or dissertations without practical work which is inaccessible. Hence, asking the students to submit on December 31 for these reasons is unfair and impossible,” the students’ body said.It urged the university to reconsider its decision and said the Delhi government has already stated that it is willing to play its part in facilitating the entry of students after a proper screening and testing.“More than that, the university has got plenty of space, resources and means to set up isolation centres, quarantine facilities and other related logistics. Many other universities have initiated plans to facilitate a phased return of research students,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jnu-hostel-committees-demand-waiver-of-hostel-mess-charges/story-Wst26lpblWe9fd9fBdJCyL.html

Nine others had also been booked.“If the charge-sheet would be filed in court in the case, there is dim possibility of its success, which would waste the time of court,” reads the closure report that Hoshiarpur vigilance deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Dalbir Singh has filed in the Kapurthala court. Eight of 10 accused, including V-C Arora, had links with the RSS and the BJP.The vigilance had registered the case following an inquiry report that former IAS officer Surjit Singh Dhillon had submitted to the state government, indicting Arora for financial irregularities and bypassing norms to appoint consultants. Arora had remained V-C from 2008, getting a three-year extension in 2011.The vigilance FIR claimed that Arora made a payment of Rs 25 crore from the varsity to a private company, M/S NETiiT, as counselling fees, without following financial rules. In the closure report, the vigilance says that the board of governors of varsity had accepted the audit reports, after being put up before the finance committee. “As per the probe so far, neither any connivance has been found nor has there been any personnel benefit to Arora, which caused any financial loss to the varsity,” the closure report says. The vigilance also investigated the claim of Arora appointing six coordinators and facilitators, arbitrarily, without publishing any advertisement and of paying Rs 9.3 crore to them over two years. On this, the closure report says that the recruitment was either as per rules as no evidence could be found for the police file. Arora was also accused of causing a loss of Rs 1.6 crore to the varsity by opening the office of the Indian Institute of Excellence Programme in Delhi. The closure report, however, says that there was no audit note, reflecting that there was wastage of Rs 1.6 crore. On this basis, the vigilance gave a clean chit to Arora. On the vigilance closure report, the additional and district sessions court has issued notice to all 10 accused for September 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vigilance-closure-report-in-2018-ptu-case-says-further-probe-waste-of-time/story-sxcnyvkLaJQHHndF65me0M.html

The high court bench of justice Arun Kumar Tyagi observed that the confiscation of the vehicles will not be dependent solely on the basis of conviction of the accused, when the use of the vehicles for illegal mining may be proved by documentary evidence. The court was hearing bail pleas of 18 persons filed in June against an FIR registered in May 2020. The petitioners are alleged to be owners/drivers of 29 tippers (out of which eight tippers were filled with sand), two Poclain machines, two canters and one motorcycle found on the unauthorised site for illegal mining. It also came before court that since April, 201 FIRs have been registered and 299 vehicles have been confiscated. Seeing the gravity of the situation, the court had made director, department of mines and geology, Punjab as party in the case. “Due to undesirable human interference with forces of nature, calamities, which were a few years back considered to be un-scientific fiction or remote possibilities, have turned into harsh realities and become nightmares in many parts of the world, endangering human life and even posing a threat to the very existence of mankind if remedial measures are not taken,” the bench observed, adding that remedial steps by the state be taken in two weeks and court be informed of the same.MEASURES LISTED OUT BY STATE BEFORE COURTFor monitoring movement of vehicles, the mining department is developing a portal for online booking, registration and tracking of vehicles. Punjab has requested the Centre for implementing the mining surveillance system. The District Legal Committee and the District Level Environment Management Cell are to be substituted by District Mineral Foundation. DCs have been told to conduct review meetings on status of complaints and FIRs registered. DCs told to take action against officials for non-filing/delay in filing of FIRs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/trucks-with-illegal-mining-material-should-not-be-let-off-easily-hc/story-qU2ZBBIABgSkSHKlgENVZN.html

The SAD held an event at Gurdwara Kambowal Sahib where Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) chief Gobind Singh Longowal, acting jathedar of the Akal Takht Giani Harpreet Singh and other SAD leaders paid tributes to Longowal. Rebel Akali and SAD (D) chief Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa organised their function at Gurdwara Bhai Mani Singh in Longowal village. Punjab forests and minorities minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot and Sangrur deputy commissioner Ramvir paid their homage to Longowal at the grain market.Dhindsa alleged that SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal was not acquainted with the personality and philosophy of Longowal. “Sukhbir has no concern with the politics of Sant Longowal. He does not even know who Longowal was? The performance of SGPC chief Gobind Singh Longowal is zero as he is the yes-man of Sukhbir Badal,” he said. He also claimed that former CM Parkash Singh Badal and Gurcharan Singh Tohra were against the Rajiv-Longowal accord, but they had reached compromise just a day before the Sant’s assassination. Former finance minister and Lehra MLA Parminder Singh Dhindsa alleged that the SAD distributed tickets to rich candidates during assembly elections, which was never part of its politics.Terming the SGPC as an independent body, its president Longowal rubbished Dhindsa’s allegations. “Dhindsa is travelling in Punjab with an agenda and falsely accusing Badals. Dhindsa has great greed for power. He never noticed such wrongdoings a year back,” the SGPC president claimed. Addressing the gathering of few people, minister Dharamsot said that Sant Longowal had laid down his life for peace and prosperity of Punjab, and he would be remembered by people for centuries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/35th-death-anniversary-of-longowal-govt-sad-and-dhindsa-pay-separate-tributes/story-wnMczRIYPtspVvNftNYDHO.html
20-08-2020||Delhi||PhD scholars to be allowed to return to hostels in phased manner: DU||The Delhi University (DU) Thursday recommended all its hostels to allow PhD scholars to return in a phased manner. The administration’s fresh set of guidelines has also asked hostel authorities to “minimise” running expenses since very few students are staying on campus presently. The DU advisory, however, has not specified any date from when scholars can start returning and has left this to the discretion of individual hostels.While a majority of students residing in the 21 DU hostels left for their homes after the university closed in March in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, some of them could not do so because of the nationwide lockdown and the restrictions on travel. In the guidelines issued on Thursday, DU advised all hostels to allow registered bona fide PhD students to return to hostels in a phased manner. “The first preference may be given to senior PhD students followed by other PhD students in a phased manner. However, such residents will have to mandatorily self quarantine for 14 days in their rooms, following which they would be screened at the on-campus health centre,” read the notice issued by the university’s assistant registrar (colleges) on Thursday.“After the completion of the quarantine, hostels are advised to allow such PhD students to attend their respective research laboratories,” it added.The DU has also advised all hostels to minimise their running expenses. “Hostels which are located within a common hostel complexes or located nearby may opt for the centralised security, sanitation, garden and office staff/services to minimise their running expenses. Hostels with a very few residents may arrange for ‘packed food’ or ‘tiffin’ delivery from adjacent hostels (as per the printed/actual meal charges) in order to minimise mess operating expenses,” the notice further stated.The hostels have also been advised not to charge mess fee from students during their absence. However, students will have to pay 50% of the monthly electricity and water charges for the entire duration of their absence from the hostel. Students have objected to this. Dewanshi, a resident of an undergraduate hostel for girls in DU, said, “We understand that the university needs money to run the hostel but we believe that during these uncertain and unprecedented times, the onus of paying wages and maintenance of the hostel should not fall on students. We are also going through this crisis and many students are facing financial adversities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/phd-scholars-to-be-allowed-to-return-to-hostels-in-phased-manner-du/story-2qi7l7K4El4G2EDKzKTyPL.html

In 2018, Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal’s assembly constituency was not even in the top 100, securing the 104th position. Municipal commissioner Bikram Shergill said the corporation team worked hard, but the interpretation of ‘garbage-free city’ lead to loss of points. “As per Swachh Survekshan parameters, a commercial ward requires sweeping twice a day. Certain areas in the old locality of Bathinda have shops, even in residential areas. An independent agency hired by the central authorities said such areas are considered commercial areas and not residential zones. On this account, Bathinda lost 1,000 points. We will analyse to match up to given standards,” said Shergill, adding that garbage collection remained functional and hygiene levels were maintained in the city limits, even during lockdown, he added.Ferozepur, at 96th position, registered a considerable improvement as it ranked 174 in 2019.Muktsar, the home town of SAD patron Parkash Singh Badal did not change much. This time it was placed number 135 whereas, in 2019, the city had ranked 138. Moga city has secured 148th position; it ranked 185 rank last year.Abohar, the hometown of Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar, has been tagged as the third filthiest local body among 382 municipalities graded across the country.

20-08-2020||City||Delhi’s municipal bodies to start mega drive against dengue, chikungunya and malaria||New Delhi: Delhi’s three municipal corporations— north, east and south — will launch a mega campaign against vector-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and malaria from August 25.All seven members of Parliament from the city, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLAs and party councillors will be part of the “awareness cum preventive” campaign.The announcement was made at a joint press conference of the three mayors of the north, east and south Delhi municipal corporations.North mayor Jai Prakash said since the monsoon is in full swing, rainwater gets accumulated at empty patches of land, roadsides and even on rooftops of buildings, which provides a conducive atmosphere for the breeding of the aedes aegypti mosquitoes, known for spreading dengue, malaria and chikungunya.He said the campaign will focus on making people aware about vector-borne diseases and take preventive measures to control the spread of mosquitoes. “The mega campaign will start on August 25 and continue till September 30. All our seven MPs, all BJP MLAs and party councillors from the three civic bodies will participate with other municipal staff. They all will visit households and appeal to the public not to let water accumulate and discourage mosquito breeding. We will distribute pamphlets carrying information about preventive measures to be taken by people for dengue, malaria and chikungunya,” Prakash said.Prakash said DBC (domestic breeding checkers) employees have checked 71,65,882 houses and sprayed anti-mosquito drugs at 2,04,429 places. Mosquito larvae were found in 21,339 houses. Notices have been sent to 16,642 and challans issued to 360 people and households.According to civic records, 41 cases of dengue, 26 cases of chikungunya and 48 cases of malaria has been reported till August 17 this year in the national capital. No death has been reported. In 2019, as many as 111 cases of malaria, 57 cases of dengue and 20 cases of chikungunya were reported. The three civic agencies have around 5,000-6,000 DBC and malaria unit workers. The municipalities have a strength of around 71,000 sanitation employees. East Delhi mayor Nirmal Jain said the entire machinery of the three municipalities will visit every household to check if water has accumulated in the buildings. Fogging exercises and spraying of anti-larva solution has already started in most of localities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-s-municipal-bodies-to-start-mega-drive-against-dengue-chikungunya-and-malaria/story-yy1Yo1fjOABwgE2CisZhUO.html

20-08-2020||City||Poultry, meat products unlikely to transmit Covid-19: GADVASU V-C||The World Animal Health Organisation (OIE), Indian Meat Science Association, and department of animal husbandry and dairying, government of India issued a notification stating that poultry has no role in the transmission of Covid-19 to humans. This information was shared by Dr Inderjeet Singh, vice-chancellor of Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Ludhiana. He revealed that scientific findings clearly indicate that coronavirus is known to spread through human to human interactions. However, the person suffering from Covid-19 infection should be screened and not be allowed to handle either domestic animals or any food products whether of plant/animal origin or even cooked. They may cause secondary surface contamination of the products. Dr Singh emphasised that farmworkers, milkers, milk/meat handlers, butchers, dairy and meat industry personnel should be screened regularly and anyone showing symptoms of fever, cough, nausea, diarrhea and difficulty in breathing should not be allowed to enter the farm and meat/dairy industry premises. The infected persons should immediately consult the doctor and quarantine themselves. All the workers should be instructed to follow the general hygiene of frequent sanitisation and washing hands, wearing masks, and avoid spitting, sneezing, and coughing in public places to prevent the spread of disease. Everybody should take a protein-rich immunity booster diet to increase their strength to fight against the disease. The V-C urged the public to stop forwarding fake videos without ascertaining the facts. Undue fear among people adversely affects the demand for eggs and poultry meat or other products, and consumers will be deprived of good affordable sources of protein. Further, food products including milk, meat and poultry products should be consumed after proper cooking only, so that all the infectious agents including viruses may be killed. The general principles of food hygiene and proper cooking must be followed as per the suggestions of WHO/OIE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/poultry-meat-products-unlikely-to-transmit-covid-19-gadvasu-v-c/story-9EVkE6tL2qIaTyfQZAogCN.html

20-08-2020||Chandigarh||Security cover of slain YAD leader’s family reduced||After the bhog ceremony of slain Youth Akali Dal leader, Ravinder Singh alias Sonu, police have reduced the security cover provided to his family. Earlier, two police officers had been deputed for the security of the family. But, after the ceremony, it has been reduced to only one. Sonu’s mother Ranjit Kaur, sarpanch of Seh village of Samrala, whose younger son had also been murdered 17 months ago, said she is a target of the accused as she is pursuing the murder cases of her sons. “I had requested Khanna senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harpreet Singh for more security cover, but to no avail,” she said. She alleged that the police are hand in glove with the accused. Police had given a clean chit to Harjinder Singh alias Jinder, Bikramjit Singh alias Vicky, Amandeep Singh and another accused for the murder of her younger son, Gurpreet Singh, alias Gura She, who was killed on March 23, 2019. They are also accused for Sonu’s murder and so far police have arrested only two accused while the others are still at large. “After gunning down my elder son, Sonu, on August 11, the accused had openly challenged that they will kill his wife and 17-year-old son also. They had opened fire in the air near her house minutes after murdering my son,” she alleged. “After I had brought this to the notice of the police, two officers were deputed outside my house for security. After Sonu’s bhog ceremony, it has been reduced to only one,” she added. The sarpanch added that her 17-year-old grandson is the only male member in the family and they have not allowed him to go out of the house after his father’s murder. Former Shiromani Akali Dal MLA Jagjivan Singh Khirniya said that the police should arrest all the accused immediately and provide security to family of the victims. Ravinder Singh Sonu, 38, the Samrala rural unit president of the Youth Akali Dal (YAD), was murdered at Seh village in Ludhiana district on August 11, 17 months after his younger brother Gurpreet Singh, alias Gura She, was hacked to death on March 23, 2019. The accused are Congress supporters and allegedly murdered the siblings over a political rivalry. When contacted, Khanna senior superintendent of police Harpreet Singh said that one of the gunmen deputed in the security of family has gone to his village to bring his belongings. He has returned to his duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/security-cover-of-slain-yad-leader-s-family-reduced/story-tKmvhlIKFYNFNmUMbuyd0L.html
20-08-2020||Chandigarh||ASHA warriors in Ludhiana facing hard time at work amid residents’ apathy||ASHA workers, also termed front-line Covid warriors, are facing a hard time in fulfilling their duties. As the number of infections rise in the district, their problems at work are also increasing. Residents of micro-containment zones, particularly affluent classes, are posing a major impediment for the health department in conducting surveys. Many residents are either not opening the door or threatening health workers against pasting stickers outside their houses. Currently, there are 31 micro-containment zones in the city. ASHA workers are visiting these areas to get details of residents living there. The attack on a health worker, Mastan Singh, at Prabhu Da Dera in Khanpur village on August 12, has highlighted how health care workers are being treated cruelly, said Harmeet Kaur, an ASHA worker with mobile team no six of the health department. “In Haibowal, our colleague was scolded by a woman when she was conducting survey of houses to collect details of residents living in an area where a family was found infected by coronavirus,” Kaur said. “Recently, the family of a Covid patient in civil lines started yelling at us when we pasted a sticker outside their house. They told us to remove it and started dropping names of senior officials. As we refused to remove the sticker, a youngster came out of the house and peeled it off in front of us,” another ASHA worker said. Dr Parminder Kaur, in-charge of mobile team number 1, from civil surgeon’s office, also complained about the indifferent attitude of people. “We visited Rajguru Nagar to collect samples from micro-containment zones, but people are not cooperating. They told us that they are responsible for their health, and would provide sample only if they showed symptoms of the virus,” she said. Balbir Kaur, president of the ASHA workers’ Union, said, “We are facing a real challenge in posh localities where people who are suppose to be educated lot of society are reluctant to come forward for tests. Most of the times they do not open the door and if they do they speak rudely. We have brought the matter to the authorities and demanded that a medical officer should accompany the ASHA worker,” she said. Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga, expressing his anguish over the situation, said that ASHA workers are putting their life at risk to save others and people should empathise with them.“People living in micro-containment zones should come forward and get tests done. So far, it has been observed that asymptomatic patients have been a carrier and end up infecting patients with comorbidities. The health department employees are visiting micro-containments zone and asking people to get their tests done but people are still not coming forward,” the civil surgeon said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/asha-warriors-in-ludhiana-facing-hard-time-at-work-amid-residents-apathy/story-l4D9ZeKi1gzouNC8QnD2QI.html

20-08-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University students refuse proposal for staggered fee payment, demand complete waiver||Students in a meeting with Panjab University officials on Thursday refused the varsity’s proposal for payment of fee in three to four installments and demanded complete fee waiver.Dean students welfare (DSW) SK Tomar and dean university instructions (DUI) R.K Singla attended the meeting, which was boycotted by leaders of various student organisations.This was the second meeting of students with PU authorities amid growing demand for semester-fee waiver. During the meeting on Thursday, officials put forward the suggestions of allowing students to pay semester fee in instalments and giving scholarships to needy students. However, they failed to convince students.A university official, who attended the meeting, said, “We proposed the suggestions made by a panel, but students did not accept it. We had also suggested to them that a coordination committee will be formed with representation from students, but they refused that as well.”PU students have held multiple protests on campus this month, prompting the varsity to extend the last date to deposit semester fee to August 31 and constitute a committee to find a solution. The panel has suggested many solutions for students, but maintained that complete fee waiver is impossible for the varsity, which is already staring at revenue loss due to pandemic.Nikhil Narmeta of National Students Union of India (NSUI), said, “We have rejected the proposal of the university. We demand that students be given relief as many are not in a situation to pay fee.”“We have demanded complete semester fee waiver and will continue protesting unless the university makes a decision in the best interest of students,” said Chetan Chaudhary of Students’ Organisation of India (SOI).PU’s DSW, SK Tomar, said, “We have made many offers to students and given them opportunities according to what the university can afford. We will communicate their demands to the university authorities and seek relief for them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-students-refuse-proposal-for-staggered-fee-payment-demand-complete-waiver/story-tIVDXf3DaBDthd491VRxrO.html

20-08-2020||City||27.7% people in containment zones have Covid antibodies||Chandigarh Antibodies against the Covid-19 infection have been found in 27.7% of people in Punjab’s five containment zones, as per the findings of a serological (sero) survey that was conducted between August 1 and 17, covering a systematically selected random sample population of 1,250 people. A sero survey is conducted to determine the extent of exposure to the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes the coronavirus disease. Punjab’s first such exclusive survey was conducted by the health department in containment and micro-containment zones where the risk of infection spread was the highest. The survey findings, submitted to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh during a Covid review meeting on Thursday, showed the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV2 virus among 40% population in the containment zone of Amritsar district, followed by 35.6% in Ludhiana, 33.2% in SAS Nagar, 19.2% in Patiala and 10.8% in Jalandhar. For the survey, five containment zones with highest number of Covid cases were identified, each in Patiala, SAS Nagar, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Amritsar cities. The samples included 250 people from each zone, and from each of the selected households, an adult above the age of 18 was randomly tested. “However, in the remaining parts of the cities, prevalence of SARS-CoV2 antibodies will be lower, and in the rural areas the prevalence will be the least. The survey was done using Rapid Antibody Testing kits,” said an official spokesperson of the government. ‘Not much to be made of survey’ State government’s health advisory expert group headed by Dr KK Talwar said not much conclusions should be made from this survey as it reflects the scenario in containment zones and micro-containment zones only. “This survey only shows us the results of our containment strategies. The herd immunity can only be determined by the state-level survey that the ICMR is expected to start in all states this week,” said Dr Talwar. He said team of trained field assistants and laboratory technicians collected the data under the supervision of a medical officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/27-7-people-in-containment-zones-have-covid-antibodies/story-A13K6K51xu800RQvqFIHNP.html

Our major demands include waiver of exam fees except for final year students, reduction of fees by 30 per cent with 15 per cent of fee collection during admission and remaining in four instalments. As students hardly stayed in university hostel, so half of the hostel fees should also be returned to students,” said Dayanand Shinde, ABVP president of SPPU unit.The protest started at 12.30 pm from Aniket canteen inside the university campus before reaching the main building and stopping vice-chancellor’s vehicle. Later, SPPU registrar Prafulla Pawar met the protesting students and gave assurance to hold a meeting to discuss their issues in the next seven days.“We will soon hold a meeting to address their issues,” said Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/abvp-student-wing-hold-protest-at-sppu/story-YLk47WY19FPci7SLWHdAQN.html

20-08-2020||City||Ganpati preparations albeit with less enthusiasm||Pune With one day remaining to welcome Ganpati Bappa, there is lukewarm response from the city which sees more than 3 lakh ganpati at home, especially for buying the makhar (throne decorations) and the necessary offerings. The streets and shops on Laxmi road wore an empty look with owners showcasing their wares and following the social distancing norms by tying ropes outside their stores, and waiting for last-minute shoppers. “We haven’t got many orders for makhar and rangoli colours this year because of the pandemic,” said Yusuf Gheewala, showing the foldable ecofriendly makhar in Raviwar peth. He is among the many popular shops selling decorations, rangoli colours during the 10-day festival. Jewellers are looking forward to welcome customers for the usual buy for the Lord. “We are expecting good footfalls and orders for Ganesh Chaturthi. While celebrations are low-key this year, we believe the focus of people would be more on decor making it a more intimate celebration. We expect strong consumer interest in silver puja articles, ornaments to adorn the Ganesh idols. These ornaments and articles, including hibiscus flowers, crowns, necklace, mushak, modak, durva, paan supari and trishul, see a strong demand every year,” said Saurabh Gadgil, chairman and managing director, PNG Jewellers. Sayali florist on Fergusson road wears a melancholy look, despite blooms in many colours for attention. “So far, I have received only one order for fresh flower makhar and no one has ordered any flowers for decorations.” Kothrud-resident Dhanashree Sant, who visited the shops on Thursday, said, “We ordered shadu mati Ganpati online and thought of visiting shops at Mandai for vastra, flat paat, but found the shopping place crowded with last-minute shoppers not following social distancing norms and hence I came back. As flowers and rest of the material is very expensive this year, we have decided to make decorations at home using coloured marble paper. We don’t feel like celebrating because of the virus situation, but I am doing to keep the tradition.” For Amruta Joshi, resident of Warje, it was a last minute decision to celebrate the festival. “No one in the family wants to celebrate. The rules like only one person can go to pick up the idol a day before seems like a blow. My son looks forward to playing the manjira while bringing the Bappa home.” “We cannot call our relatives home this year as the festival used to be the occasion that brings all generations together. This year, it will be all alone, with others following us online,” said Shraddha Chaitanya, a homemaker. There are others who are looking at the pandemic as an opportunity to be a part of the festival. Financial advisor Sachin Ekbote said, “Every year I don’t get sufficient time to concentrate on Ganapati preparation and decorations. The work from home this year has given me time to welcome Ganpati Bappa. Right from items required for installation of Bappa, including the decor and puja items, I prepared a check list and am enjoying it to the fullest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ganpati-preparations-albeit-with-less-enthusiasm/story-iyXVDR2jJVMBY1In11dlyJ.html

The party’s executive committee has authorised Manjhi to take a decision on the future course of action,” said party’s spokesperson Danish Rizwan. Sources in the party said HAM(S) may either merge with the JD(U) or forge an alliance with it for the Assembly polls.“The decision to walk out of the five-party opposition coalition in Bihar was taken at the party’s core committee meeting convened at Manjhi’s residence here,” Rizwan said.The HAM, which contested the Lok Sabha elections as part of the Grand Alliance, had issued an ultimatum for formation of a coordination committee in the alliance by June 25 to start seat sharing talks.The Grand Alliance in Bihar is now left with RJD, Congress, Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) and Mukesh Sahni-led Vikassheel Insan Party (VIP).During the last few months, Manjhi had also been exploring options of alliance with different parties, including Owaisi-led AIMIM.Manjhi had fallen out with Nitish Kumar after he was made to quit the CM’s post in early 2015. He walked out of the NDA after a poor show in the 2015 Assembly polls. Of later, Manjhi has been heaping praise on the Nitish government.HAM-S has one member each in the Bihar Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council.Sources in the party said the HAM(S) becoming a part of the NDA is all but a formality. “The party has laid no preconditions on seats,” said a senior party leader.NDA leaders feel that if at all Manjhi joins their alliance, JD (U) will use it to silence LJP, which of late has been embarrassing the government by raising different issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/manjhi-s-party-exits-ga/story-sj3ihGnVHZ1iyZJRRxpO0I.html

I have full faith in Nitish Kumar as he has drawn a big line of inclusive development and it will be difficult for anyone to come even near it,” he said. He even hinted that his daughter could also contest and took a dig at the RJD for looking for safe seats for Tejashwi and Tej Pratap.The surprise induction today was that of Jaivardhan Yadav, first-time MLA from Paliganj. He is the grandson of former Congress leader Ram Lakhan Singh Yadav, who wielded enormous clout among Yadavs and backward classes before the emergence of Lalu Prasad in the 1990s. Ram Lakhan Singh Yadav also served as minister in the state and the Centre. He was MLA six times and MP twice. He had later joined the Janata Dal.All the three MLAs later called on the chief minister at his official residence. JD(U) leader and minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav said the RJD leaders switching to his party was a natural corollary as they all had clearly seen the writing on the wall.Bihar’s health minister and BJP leader Mangal Pandey claimed more leaders from the opposition were waiting to switch to the NDA due to the “dictatorial style of RJD leader Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandrika-rai-2-more-rjd-mlas-join-jd-u/story-wnsecB2l9klewmWiWx1uvI.html

While addressing mediapersons, Singh said, “After many years, the J&K administration advertised 8,575 Class IV posts for which a whopping 5.62 lakh youth have applied so far because the BJP has allowed people from Bihar, UP, MP, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and other parts of the country to apply here.” “If outsiders apply in such big numbers then what will happen to our youth. Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has recently announced that his government will be exclusively for its youth. So, why the BJP has been handing a raw deal to the youth of J&K. Why are they maintaining double standards,” he said. He said his party will fight for the youth and people of J&K and hold BJP accountable for all its misdeeds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jobs-for-outsiders-in-j-k-panthers-party-accuses-bjp-of-double-standards/story-k5kkWQdd8fNHM63HSr6HRP.html

20-08-2020||Chandigarh||HC summons probe records of Chandigarh’s PG fire tragedy||The Punjab and Haryana high court has summoned the probe records of the PG fire incident in Sector 32, Chandigarh, which led to the death of three girls. The incident had taken place in February this year when a fire tore through the illegal paying guest (PG) accommodation, owned by Gaurav Aneja, who had further rented it to Nitish Bansal and Nitish Popli, who ran the PG. As per information, the duo had started the business in August 2018, allegedly without registration with the UT estate office. The record was summoned by the bench of justice Karamjit Singh, acting on the bail plea of Aneja, who is behind bars since the incident was reported. Aneja had argued that being the owner of the premises in question, he is not liable for prosecution as he had only rented out the place. “This bail application cannot be disposed of in the absence of the entire police record. Accordingly, the state is directed to produce the entire police record of this case on the next date of hearing,” the bench said, posting the matter for September 2. The bail plea had been filed on July 3. Bansal, Popli and house owner Gaurav Aneja were booked under Sections 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code in February in view of the widespread public outrage over the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-summons-probe-records-of-chandigarh-s-pg-fire-tragedy/story-sbLCbMM3I1Y35uTM1WrMbL.html
20-08-2020||Chandigarh||Amritsar second cleanest city in Punjab after Ludhiana||Amritsar city was ranked the second cleanest city in Punjab after Ludhiana, slotted 39 and 34, respectively, among 47 cities across the country with a population of more than 10 lakh in the Swacch Survekshan Awards 2020 announced on Thursday. The city also registered a steep rise up the rankings from 184 last year and 208 in 2018. In the previous years, however, the results were not categorised on the basis of population. The cities were each scored on 6,000 points, of which 1,500 points each were allotted to direct observation, service level progress, citizen feedback and urban local body (ULB) documentation. Amritsar was awarded 2459.31 points and scored 1,046.27 points in citizen’s feedback, even higher than the state and national average.Commenting on the matter, municipal corporation (MC) commissioner Komal Mittal said, “The MC had initiated awareness campaigns in schools and colleges pertaining to cleanliness. The city has already been declared open defecation free, which has contributed to the improved score. We are working to improve the cleanliness and waste disposal in the city and have already started segregation of wet and dry waste from households. A biogas plant at the Bhagtanwala dump is also scheduled to be set up which will improve the cleanliness of the city.”However, authorities can hardly afford to be complacent as Amritsar still has a long way to go. Garbage remaines piled up in many parts of the city, most public toilets are in a bad shape with no maintenance or water supply. Plastic is yet to be banned and there are not enough dustbins and cleaning equipment. The green belts are unkempt and require proper care. Also, the biogas plant project at the Golden Temple is still hanging fire after 1.5 years as MC is yet to get approvals from the Amritsar Development Authority.“We are working on numerous cleanliness projects in the city as our ranking is not up to the mark. We have hired a new private company for looking after cleanliness in the city and efforts are being made to get a more improved ranking next year,” Mittal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amritsar-second-cleanest-city-in-punjab-after-ludhiana/story-sz7eA6N2h5pkHcpPmdP2fP.html

20-08-2020||Chandigarh||From non-SCS to IAS: HC stays final selection of candidates||The Punjab and Haryana high court has stayed the final selection of candidates for the five posts of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) from amongst the non-state civil service (non-SCS) officers in Haryana.The order was passed by a high court bench of Justice RK Jain and Justice Ashok Kumar Verma on the plea of Surender Singh Dahiya, 52, additional director, agriculture department, who had challenged the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) order of August 7.The CAT had upheld the Haryana government’s June 9 order on Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) conducting a written test to shortlist non-SCS officers to fill five IAS posts observing that there was no merit in the plea and “by no stretch of imagination, the HPSC is entering the realm of central government or UPSC”.As per the Haryana government, HPSC was only to conduct a written examination and then forward list of 25 meritorious candidates to the chief secretary and he would then forward this list to the UPSC. Before the HC, it has been argued that HPSC can conduct the exam only with respect to state civil services and not the all-India services. Further, the only criterion for adjudging the outstanding ability and merit of the candidate is by way of service record of a candidate while performing his duties as a non-SCS officer. The court was also told that a change in selection rules has been made through an executive order and no specific delegation of power has been conferred upon the state by the Centre for the same. The move goes against the provisions of the All India Service Act, 1951, and the Indian Administrative Service (Recruitment Rules), 1954, the court was told.

As we have over 1,800 new students in the school, we wrote to the higher authorities to allow us to operate in two shifts for maximum optimisation of our resources.”“We require more teachers and classrooms to ensure delivery of quality education,” he added.School education secretary Krishan Kumar, while permitting the school to run in double shift, directed the district education officer (secondary) to identify schools with surplus teachers and shift them to this school.Currently, the school is closed due to the pandemic outbreak but once it reopens, students of the humanities and science streams will attend the morning shift (7.30 am to 12.30pm) while those in the vocational and commerce streams will attend the afternoon shift (12.30pm to 5.30pm). Students of Classes 6 to 10 will also have the afternoon shift. ABOUT THE SCHOOLThe school is 145 years old. It had turned co-educational last year. This year, it topped the district with 100% new enrolments. The school currently has 43 teachers and requires 19 more to adjust to the new strength. In terms of facilities, the school is equipped with smart classrooms, closed circuit television cameras and other essential infrastructure etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/government-senior-secondary-school-multipurpose-gets-nod-to-run-in-double-shift/story-g3cO71MwgGPfv6F1sFlqUL.html

Besides, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has taken action against its five employees for their involvement in the pardon row.Langah, who also served as a member of the SGPC, was excommunicated in October 2017 as the Sikh clergy found him guilty of misconduct and violation of the Sikh tenets after a video allegedly showing him in an objectionable position with a woman was widely shared on social media. He was pardoned by the ‘panj pyaras’ (five beloved ones of the Guru) at Gurdwara Baba Banda Singh Bahadar in Gurdaspur district on August 3.Confirming the development, Jaspal Singh, personal assistant of Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said: “He (Sarchand Singh) has been asked to submit his clarification on August 22. If his reply is unsatisfactory, the five Sikh clergies will take against him as per the maryada.” People privy to the development in the Akal Takht secretariat said the jathedar, after going through media reports, got Sarchand’s role probed in the pardon row. Sarchand has also been president of Sikh Students Federation (SSF) and media adviser to former Akali minister and incumbent MLA Bikram Singh Majithia. Meanwhile, acting on a report of the probe panel, SGPC has taken departmental action against five of its employees for their involvement in the pardon row. Mahinder Singh Ahli, personal secretary to SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal, said two managers of historic gurdwaras — Ranjit Singh (Gurdwara Burj Sahib, Dhariwal, Gurdaspur district), and Jagdish Singh (Barath Sahib, Pathankot district) — have been shifted to Haryana. The former has been shifted to Gurdwara Patshahi Chhevin, Thanesar, Kurukshetra, as supervisor, while the latter to Gurdwara Dhamdhan Sahib, Jind, as assistant manager. Both have been fined Rs 2,000 each.Besides, religious preachers Balbir Singh and Jagroop Singh were shifted to Sikh Mission, Haryana, while another preacher Gurnam Singh was transferred from Garhi Gurdas Nangal gurdwara to headquarters Dharam Parchar Committee, Amritsar.Prior to this, Akal Takht declared SGPC member Gurinderpal Singh Gora and Rattan Singh Zaffarwal, who is husband of another SGPC member, ‘tankhaya’ (guilty of religious misconduct) for accompanying Langah and playing a role in pardoning him. A day after both visited the Takht to tender a written apology. On Takht’s direction, the SGPC expelled Gora from all the sub-committees.The next meeting of the Sikh clergy is expected to be held by month-end to take action against the remaining persons, said the PA to jathedar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pardon-to-langah-takht-summons-taksal-s-media-adviser-sgpc-takes-action-against-5-employees/story-srVrV99ZFBizegMziUpxpK.html

Two men in their early twenties are absconding and one of them is the son of a Punjab Police inspector. The one arrested has been identified as Akashdeep Singh of Sadhu Wala village in Ferozepur district, while Jaspal Singh, 24, and Inderjeet Singh Gill, 23, of Moga’s Rauli village are absconding. Jaspal’s father is a police inspector, posted in Muktsar. Akashdeep, who reportedly filmed the incident, was arrested from Bathinda. Jaspal and Inderjeet had put up the flag with Khalistan written on it on the terrace of the administrative complex at 8:15am on August 14, police said. While fleeing, the two men also removed and took along the Tricolour hoisted on the premises. Moga senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harmanbir Singh Gill said the accused indulged in the crime in response to a call given by US-based pro-Khalistan outfit Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) led by Gurpatwant Singh Pannu who offered a reward of $2,500 for any such act. “A recce of the place was done on August 13 around 1.30pm by Jaspal and Inderjeet and later they contacted Akashdeep. The three reached the district administrative complex around 8am on August 14 on two motorcycles. Jaspal and Inderjeet went inside, while Akashdeep was instructed to make a video of the incident,” SSP Gill said. “The trio left and met in Rauli village where the video was transferred to Jaspal’s phone, who shared it with the WhatsApp number given by Pannu in his video,” he said. SSP Gill said that Akashdeep has confessed to having shot the video. “During his interrogation, he revealed that they were misguided by videos of Sikhs For Justice and committed the crime to make some quick money,” he added. The accused have been booked under sections 115, 121, 121A, 124A, 153A, 153B, 506 and 2 of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act; Section 66-F of the IT Act and Sections 10, 11, 13 of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act by the Moga city police.

20-08-2020||Chandigarh||Weekend lockdown, curfew from 7pm in Punjab amid spike in Covid cases||Chandigarh: As Covid-19 cases continue to see a sharp spike in Punjab, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday ordered a series of emergency measures, including extension of weekend lockdown with daily night curfew from 7pm to 5am in all 167 cities and towns of the state. Calling for war-like preparedness to deal with the pandemic, the chief minister has ordered a total ban on all gatherings except weddings and funerals across the state till August 31. Government and private offices will work at 50% capacity till the end of this month. Amarinder, who held a virtual review meeting with top officials, also directed the officials to restrict public visitors in government offices and to encourage the use of online grievance redressal system. VEHICULAR CURBS IN FIVE WORST-HIT DISTRICTS In the five worst-affected districts of Amritsar, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Patiala and SAS Nagar, restrictions on vehicular capacity have been imposed again, with buses and other public transport operating with 50% capacity and private four-wheelers not allowing more than three passengers per vehicle. The deputy commissioners of these districts have been directed to allow only 50% of the non-essential shops to open on a daily basis to check crowding. These five districts account for 80% of the active case load in the state. NO POLITICAL GATHERINGS TILL AUGUST 31 Amarinder directed director general of police Dinkar Gupta to strictly enforce compliance of rules with regard to the number of persons allowed to attend weddings and funerals, and also to ensure a total ban on political gatherings till August 31, when the situation will be reviewed. He also asked the DGP to crack the whip on all political protests and gatherings, and asked his own party, Punjab Congress, leadership to enforce the ban strictly. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH: CM “Enough is enough,” said the chief minister, adding, “We need to be tough without affecting the state’s economic activity.” Pointing to the 920 Covid deaths in the state so far, he said “each death pains me, and the projections for the coming weeks are grim.” Underlining the need to promote public participation in creating awareness on the measures to check the spread of Covid, the chief minister asked the health department to promote public participation by involving all other departments, NGOs and local politicians to educate the people. He said the state was in an health emergency, necessitating harsh measures, which might have to be further intensified in the coming days to curb the Covid spread. Though the cases were currently concentrated in urban areas, rural areas were also witnessing an increase, he said, adding that if needed, travel restrictions may have to be imposed. ‘TEST 10 CONTACTS OF POSITIVE PATIENTS’ The CM also asked the officials to increase testing to 30,000 a day, with at least 10 persons in the immediate circle of every positive patient to be tested. The health department has been asked to supply ventilators free of cost to medical colleges and private hospitals. Chief secretary Vini Mahajan said tenders had been floated for the procurement of nine more RT-PCR machines and the same were expected next week. Adviser, health, medical education and research, Dr KK Talwar, in his presentation, said that though deaths per million in Punjab, at 30.8, was lower than India’s 39.9, the situation was grim and the state’s recovery rate at 62.9% was lower than the nation’s 73.9%. The percentage of co-morbid patients was higher in Punjab as compared to Haryana, explaining the greater number of deaths here, he added. Principal secretary, health, Hussan Lal said while the number of tests had gone up to nearly 20,000, the positivity rate had come down slightly to 8.05% for the week from August 11 to 18, as against 9.31% from August 3 to 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/weekend-lockdown-curfew-from-7pm-in-punjab-amid-spike-in-covid-cases/story-SOrirs5Y2shu9QylAqo2nK.html
20-08-2020||City||Ludhiana residents hostile to covid frontline workers collecting data||Ludhiana A day after Punjab principal secretary health, Hussan Lal, said contact tracing and testing is key to fighting the covid-19 pandemic in the state, it is proving to be a troublesome task in Ludhiana, already among the worst-hit due to the disease. Around 2,000 Accredited Social Health Activist (Asha) workers, who are tasked with collecting and tabulating crucial data and are thus the frontline warriors, say residents’ attitude towards them is hostile and indifferent. The state has 17,000 Asha workers and all are women.Whenever a covid-19 case is detected, a team of two Asha workers has to survey the area, usually called micro-containment zones, and get details of number of people staying in the zone, the pregnant women, vulnerable section etc. Ludhiana, to date, has 31 micro-containment zones. They are also to paste stickers of quarantine outside houses, wherever applicable. Based on their data and report, mobile teams of the health department visit these zones, if required. Balbir Kaur, president of Asha Workers Union, said, “We are facing real challenges in posh localities, where people who are suppose to be educated, are reluctant to come forward for tests. The majority of the times they do not even open the door, and if they do they speak rudely. We have demanded that a medical officer should accompany Asha workers.” Sometimes, health workers are even attacked. “The attack on health worker Mastan Singh at Prabhu Da Dera in Khanpur village near Jarkhar village on August 12 highlighted the cruelty and bias of the layman towards health workers,” said Harmeet Kaur, an Asha worker attached with mobile team number six of the health department. Dr Parminder Kaur, in-charge of mobile team number 1 from civil surgeon office, said, “We had visited visit Rajguru Nagar to collect samples from micro-containment zones, but people are not cooperating.”Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said, “People in micro-containment zones should get themselves tested and be compassionate towards health workers. Asymptomatic patients end up infecting patients with co-morbidities. It is unfortunate that people do not come forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-residents-hostile-to-covid-frontline-workers-collecting-data/story-QjQJwaTEV1QFAzn35OJslJ.html

Officials believe the skull belongs to special police officer (SPO) Shadi Lal whose throat was slit and head carried off by militants. Ind police post in-charge sub-inspector Mohammad Ramzan said, “The skull was found by locals while fishing. We will take it to Gool to match the DNA with Lal’s family. In case the DNA matches, the skull will be handed over to the family. In all probability it is Lal’s skull.” On the night of March 15, 2003, around 15 to 20 armed Pakistani terrorists had attacked a police post in Ramban’s Ind village and killed eleven policemen and two village defence committee members. Udhampur-based Satpal Sharma, who hails from Ind, and on whose land the police post stood, said, “The attack was carried out to avenge the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen divisional commander Amanullah Peer and three of his commanders in January, 2003, by cops of the Ind post.” “The post was attacked with rocket launchers, grenades and AK-47 rifles. It was then set afire. Lal’s head was taken away by the terrorists and could not be traced. Sadly, a probe is yet to be ordered in the matter. The case should be re-investigated,” said Sharma. “Lal’s father, Tirath Ram, has been informed of the discovery. Lal’s body was cremated without a head in 2003”, said Sharma. Hizbul chief Salahuddin had mourned Peer’s killing saying his right hand had been chopped off and had planned the attack to avenge his death. Among those killed were Khurshid Ahmed, Farid Ahmed, Angrez Singh, Shaukat Ali, Sher Singh, Shadi Lal and Mohammad Iqbal, Bashir Ahmed and Mohammad Altaf. Nissar Ahmed, Manzoor Ahmed, Jan Mohammad and Sher Mohammad were kidnapped and later killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/skull-found-in-ramban-rivulet-officials-suspect-it-belongs-to-spo-killed-in-2003-police-post-attack/story-O2SxIhfdBo02peTfA02SiL.html

It also came in second in the region after the union territory of Chandigarh, which secured 8th position and emerged as the cleanest city in north India with a population of above 10 lakh. Ranked 24 last year, Karnal scored 4,655 marks out of 6,000 in 2020. Nishant Kumar Yadav, Karnal deputy commissioner as well as commissioner, municipal corporation, said the district achieved the cleanest status not just in Haryana but in several states across the country as well. Around 9,289 residents in the city, which already had a 3-star rating as garbage-free city and was open defecation-free++ (ODF++) had participated in a survey to garner their feedback. Four in top 100Besides Karnal, three cities of Haryana with a population below 10 lakh: Rohtak (35), Panchkula (56) and Gurugram (62) were among the 100 top cities. Faridabad was ranked 38 in the category of population above 10 lakh. Notably, MC had taken several initiatives to improve cleanliness in Karnal such as night sweeping, door-to-door garbage collection and installation of mobile and e-toilets in the city, which helped rankings jump from 65 in 2017 to 41 in 2018 and 24 in 2019. On further improvements, Yadav said, “Now, our focus will be on improving our garbage free rating and in the area of service level progress and certification.” Renu Bala Gupta, MC mayor, congratulated the people of Karnal for the achievement and thanked them for their cooperation. “This is a result of the collective efforts of the residents, especially the sanitation workers who work day and night to keep the city clean.

20-08-2020||Chandigarh||Nepalese labour shortage amid Covid curbs, strained ties upsets Himachal’s applecart||The Covid-19 pandemic has left apple growers of Himachal Pradesh struggling with challenges of high labour cost due to shortage and strict curbs. With apple picking underway in the lower hill areas of the state, orchard owners are scouting for skilled Nepalese workers, who form the backbone of the Rs 4,500-crore apple economy. Apart from travel restrictions due to the pandemic, India’s strained relations with Nepal after the recent border dispute has hit the movement of labourers from the neighbouring country. The apple economy is the main source of income for most in Shimla, Kullu, Kinnaur, Mandi and parts of Chamba and Sirmaur districts. The apple season in the lower hills is about to wind up but it will continue in the higher altitude areas till mid-October. INSTITUTIONAL QUARANTINE TOUGHER Many Nepalese labourers working in orchards returned home amid the tension between India and Nepal and those wanting to come back to earn a livelihood could not make it due to travel restrictions. Somnath Jaishi, 42, from Nadda village in Nepal’s Accham district worked in an orchard in Rohru for six months a year but this time he could not make it back in time. “Initially, when I wanted to come, we were stopped by Indian border police and when we made another attempt, we were stopped by Nepalese police at Banbasaha,” he said over phone. Now that the Nepal government has eased travel restrictions, the stricter Covid-19 guidelines in Himachal Pradesh have made it tougher for both labourers and orchardists. Earlier, the government allowed apple growers to quarantine labourers coming from outside the state in the orchard for 14 days. Now it has made institutional quarantine mandatory for labourers. They are housed in dingy rooms of nearby government buildings and orchard owners are to provide food and bedding. “What’s the fun when orchard owners have to make all the arrangements in institutions? Isn’t it better to allow them to be quarantined in orchards?” says Narendra Chauhan, an apple grower from Kotkhai. Initially, the government had assured orchardists of facilitating migrant labourers but later left it to apple growers. Shimla deputy commissioner Amit Kashyap, however, took the initiative and workers from Lakhimpur Kheri, Azamgarh and Motihari in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were arranged. But these labourers are not skilled in picking and packaging apples. MORE THE DEMAND, HIGHER THE WAGES Gyan Chand Thakur, an orchardist from Kullu, says, “Most of the labour available is local and from Mandi district. This time, there are no Nepalese labourers. We have no choice but to pay up to Rs 1,000 daily.” Apple growers in Kotgarh region of Shimla district are also forced to spend more on wages. The few Nepalese workers available in the region are in high demand and asking for higher wages than previous years. Aalok Chauhan of Banot village in Kotgarh says, “This year, a Nepalese labourer charges Rs 500 a day, which is Rs 100 higher than the wages paid last year.” Kotgarh had a lean crop this time so growers with smaller orchards managed harvesting on their own. “We are three in the family. Two of us plucked the apples and took them to the store in the ‘kilta (a cone-shaped basket). We even packaged the crop ourselves,” says Pratap Singh of Kotgarh. The orchardists say labourers in the area are more interested in construction activities as they get paid better there. “They are paid by the hour by the contractor and earn up to Rs 700 a day so not many are interested in farm work,” says Ajay Thakur of Dadesh village in Kotgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nepalese-labour-shortage-amid-covid-curbs-strained-ties-upsets-himachal-s-applecart/story-0jb7o4Hykrq8qburxU3sKP.html

20-08-2020||Mumbai||BMC to undertake topographical survey, assess ground condition to resolve water logging||Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Mumbai’s governing civic body, will map the topography and assess the condition of the stormwater drainage system between the chronic water logging spot of Hindmata on BA Road in Dadar East and the Britannia pumping station. The study will help determine reasons for continued waterlogging at Hindmata--Mumbai’s worse flood spot--even after BMC’s massive drain augmentation work at and around this junction over the past two years has been worth over Rs 50 crore, officials said.Mapping the topography will determine if the drains are damaged, have odd elevations preventing the free flow of water, have utility cables, or are blocked with tree roots or crusted garbage.Along with this survey, BMC is also planning to build more drains around Hindmata so that water from this elevated region does not flow downward toward BA Road, according to a stormwater drains department official.BMC in 2018 said it undertook a similar survey to map drains around Hindmata. A civic official from the stormwater drains department said, “This survey was done only in parts and not the entire stretch up to Britannia. We need to find out where the bottleneck is and why the water would not drain out even after the work BMC has carried out. Augmentation of the drain at and around Hindmata has reduced water receding time, but not prevented water logging entirely.”Since Hindmata is saucer-shaped, it used to receive water from Parel, Lalbaug, and Dadar. BMC planned to intercept this water via augmented stormwater drains before it reached Hindmata, and carry it to Britannia pumping station directly. Before the drain augmentation work, this water would flow to Hindmata, and one pipeline at the junction carried water from three localities to Britannia pumping station.BMC also augmented this pipeline to increase its capacity to 50mm per hour from the current capacity of 25mm per hour. It installed a box drain along 800 metres of BA Road from Hindmata.Swapnaja Kishirsagar, assistant commissioner of the F/Southward with jurisdiction over Hindmata, said, “About 10% work on the circular drain around Hindmata is incomplete at Chinchpokli, which may be the bottleneck. Work was affected because of the unavailability of labour due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Work on augmenting the 800-metre stretch of the drain on BA road is complete.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-undertake-topographical-survey-assess-ground-condition-to-resolve-water-logging/story-Prq7Mlvel3VtbzJHu3ushP.html

Till now, 1,375 roads (7,228 km) have been constructed in Bastar Division and 692 more (3,009 km) are under construction.“Due to Maoist activities and time-consuming construction time, long-span bridges are not feasible on these roads. Instead, construction of steel bridges is preferred owing to the prefabricated nature of steel bridges thus reducing the construction time,” Baghel wrote.He emphasised that even maintenance and upgradation time is also significantly less for steel bridges and these bridges can be relocated or shifted conveniently.Baghel said the Chhattisgarh government is committed to constructing rural roads as part of a multifaceted approach to reduce Maoist activities.Chhattisgarh has a rural population of 76% of which the majority are tribals. The forest cover of Chhattisgarh amounts to approximately 44% of the total geographical area.Baghel wrote the state has till now constructed 7.300 rural roads amounting to 33,622 km along with 264 LSB including nine steel bridges. He added 1,240 roads (7737 km) along with 114 LSB are under construction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chhattisgarh-cm-writes-to-centre-seeks-funds-for-bridges/story-bRCFbDhPVCqSZmr7NsMVaO.html

Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said the government needs to answer the queries on various issues like unemployment and the law and order situation. In a tweet in Hindi, Yadav said, “This session of the UP Legislative Assembly is going to be historic in a number of ways. The government has to answer questions raised by the opposition and its own people on coronavirus, unemployment, casteist atrocities and poor law and order.” “The Government’s thoko neeti (encounter policy) has become a point of internal discord (aantarik kalah) instead of becoming a point of reconciliation (sulah),” Yadav claimed. Party members of both houses of the legislature staged a protest in front of the statue of former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, holding banners against the state government. Speaking on the occasion, Member of the Legislative Council Naresh Uttam alleged that there was jungle raj in the state . Incidents like murder, loot, rape and kidnapping were taking place on a daily basis and it appeared that criminals had no fear of law, he said. The Yogi government has totally failed to check Covid-19 pandemic. The height is that in the name of this disease funds are being misused, Uttam alleged.

20-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi second sero-survey: All you need to know||The results of the second serological survey conducted in Delhi were announced by Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday. The results showed that there has been a six percent increase in terms of prevalence of antibodies among the city’s inhabitants. The earlier survey revealed that 22.86% of the population have developed antibodies but the second survey results show the number has reached 29% now. Doctors and epidemiologists conduct serological surveys to map the outbreak of a pandemic in a particular city or a region. The surveys provide insights to the researchers about the ability of a region’s inhabitants to produce antibodies and what measures to undertake to curb the contagion. This also indicates whether residents of a particular city or a region are headed towards achieving ‘herd immunity’ from a disease. Also Read: 29% of Delhi has antibodies for Covid-19: Second sero-surveyThe second serological survey was undertaken between August 1 to August 7 and the sample size was 15,000.

The survey results outlined that certain districts are developing antibodies faster than the others. Delhi’s southeast district saw prevalence of antibodies go up by almost 11% but southwest Delhi’s inhabitants have not shown any remarkable increase in antibodies.

The survey also highlighted that women in the city have a higher antibody prevalence compared to men. Several other cities in India have conducted serological surveys to map the growth of coronavirus among the people living in the city. Pune saw more than 51% of its population have developed antibodies. Mumbai conducted a serological survey in three slums and saw that 57% of the sample population have developed antibodies. Bihar, Haryana and Chhattisgarh are among the states who will start the second-phase of their serological surveys.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-second-sero-survey-all-you-need-to-know-coronavirus-herd-immunity-vaccine-corona-trial-remdesivir-corona-deaths-india-recovery-rate-updates/story-1awlR6Z2O2tMoV3zGkSgFP.html

20-08-2020||Delhi||Fire breaks out in east Delhi building, family rescued||A couple and their child were rescued after the building in which they live, in east Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar, caught fire early Thursday. Firefighters said the family was trapped on the first floor as the fire had originated from the electricity meters installed under the staircase, the only exit and entry.Those rescued were identified as Mohammad Aadil, 52, who owns a shop in the same area, his wife Ishrat Aadil and their son Ali Aadil, 12.According to the firefighters, the incident took place around 5.20am. “We received a call at 5.24am at the control room informing us that a residential building in Murti Gali, Krishanganj in Laxmi Nagar has caught fire and there are people inside the building. We immediately rushed eight fire tenders to the site,” said an officer who wished not to be named. The director of Delhi Fire Services Atul Garg said the team that reached the spot found that an apartment building comprising 17 flats was on fire. “We found that the fire had sparked from meters installed under the building’s staircase, which was the only exit and entry point. While most of the occupants had managed to vacate the building and had jumped to adjoining buildings via rooftops, Aadil and his family, who lived on the first floor were trapped because of the smoke,” Garg said.The director said they could also not leave the building as there were 11 two-wheelers parked under the staircase, and all of them had caught fire blocking the only escape route completely. Station officer of the Laxmi Nagar fire station, Mohammad Firoz Khan, who led the rescue, said that since it was raining and the area had a lot of open wiring around, they first got the electricity supply of the area disconnected. “As one team of firefighters sprayed water to contain the fire, another team entered the first floor with hazmat suits and brought all three out, one by one. They were asked if they want to go to a hospital but they refused due to the fear of Covid-19,” Khan said.DFS director Garg said the probable cause of the fire was a short circuit and they were probing further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/fire-breaks-out-in-east-delhi-building-family-rescued/story-Bs0A19O9Usw2KMFNTRsdpM.html

20-08-2020||Kolkata||Kolkata hospital penalised for refusing to admit Covid patient without advance payment||The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission has directed a private hospital in Kolkata to deposit ₹10 lakh after a Covid-19 patient died on August 10. The hospital had refused to admit her if her family members did not deposit an initial sum of ₹3 lakh.“Ideally, the hospital’s license should have been cancelled for this. But since many patients were still being treated and there are no other allegations of negligence, we didn’t want to take such a step. We have directed the hospital to deposit ₹10 lakh while the case is being heard,” said retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee, the chairman of the commission. The commission has barred the hospital from taking any advance deposit while admitting Covid-19 patients, he added. The 60-year-old woman died on August 10, allegedly while waiting in an ambulance outside the private hospital in east Kolkata. Her son said that the hospital demanded ₹3 lakh as an advance payment, without which they wouldn’t admit her. While the family took an hour to arrange the money, the woman died. “This is the first case in which the commission took suo moto cognizance. It was inhuman and very unfortunate,” said Banerjee. The commission had earlier put a cap on the advance payment demanded by private hospitals in the state. It had said that private hospitals could not charge patients over 20% of the estimated cost of treatment or a maximum of ₹50,000 at the time of admission. In a separate case, the commission recommended that the license of another private hospital be cancelled as it had declined to pay ₹2 lakh to a complainant. The commission had awarded a compensation of ₹3 lakh to the complainant about a year ago. The hospital only paid ₹1 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-hospital-penalised-for-refusing-to-admit-covid-patient-without-advance-payment/story-lYFatFTAZdCblnlF1lbVGM.html
20-08-2020||Chandigarh||Agents taking bribe of ₹3,500 each from NRIs for early, fake Covid test report in Punjab’s Moga civil hospital||Moga: Doctors at the Moga civil hospital have been accused of running a racket in connivance with agents to conduct early Covid-19 tests, especially of non-resident Indians (NRIs), in lieu of money. Charanjit Singh, a resident of Dehadka village in Ludhiana district, has submitted a written complaint to deputy commissioner Sandeep Hans alleging he paid a bribe of ₹3,500 for each test of nine of his NRI family members to get the reports early. In the complaint, he said his parents are residents of Hong Kong and they were stranded at India for the last six months due to the coronavirus pandemic. “Our flight to Hong Kong was scheduled on August 4. We had only 72 hours to get the test reports. When I reached the Moga civil hospital along with my parents and my sister-in-law’s family on August 2, the doctors informed they cannot conduct our tests that day due to long waiting. In the meantime, one Om Parkash of Moga came to me and said that if we paid ₹3,500 each the tests would be done that day. We had no option but to pay ₹31,500 for the nine tests.” “I demand a probe to unearth this racket so that no other NRI should be looted by agents and doctors. My call details and the CCTV footage should be checked to confirm my claims,” he said. On Wednesday, Om Parkash also submitted an affidavit to the deputy commissioner, claiming he had given ₹1.7 lakh to district epidemiologist Dr Naresh Amla to get reports of 48 NRIs early. He said that Dr Amla assured him that if any of them is tested positive, they will be given a fake negative test report. The voice recordings of the calls with the health official were also submitted by Parkash, it is learnt. Deputy commissioner Sandeep Hans said, “The complaint was forwarded to the police for investigation and appropriate action will be taken after confirming the facts.” Civil surgeon Dr Amarpreet Kaur Bajwa said the police are investigating the matter and the guilty will be punished. Dr Amla denied the allegations, claiming he has never met Om Parkash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/agents-taking-bribe-of-3-500-each-from-nris-for-early-fake-covid-test-report-in-punjab-s-moga-civil-hospital/story-MBWKRZp43mdvYlpZhQ234M.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||MSRTC resumes inter-district bus services after five months||Inter-district bus services of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) resumed on Thursday morning after a gap of almost five months, officials said.The Maharashtra government on Wednesday permitted the state-owned undertaking to re-start inter-district bus operations, which were stopped in March after the enforcement of lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19.On Thursday, the first bus from Mumbai Central depot, where the MSRTC headquarters is located, left around 8.30 am for Chiplun in Ratnagiri district with six passengers boarding at the starting point, a transport corporation official said.More passengers were expected at Dadar and other stops, he said.Bus services from various depots in Mumbai and other parts of state are planned later in the day on some selected medium and long distance routes, sources in the MSRTC said.While allowing the inter-district MSRTC bus services to resume, the state government did away with the condition of e-pass, which was earlier compulsory for passengers in view of the lockdown.The MSRTC said it will be mandatory for passengers to maintain Covid-19 prevention protocols, like wearing masks and adhering to the social distancing guidelines.Earlier, the transport corporation resumed intra- district services from May 22 and also ran special buses to ferry migrants to the state boarders.It was also operating special services for passengers in the Konkan belt ahead of the Ganesh festival, which will begin on Saturday.With a fleet of over 18,000 buses and nearly one lakh workforce, MSRTC is one of the biggest state road transport corporations in the county.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/msrtc-resumes-inter-district-bus-services-after-five-months/story-ieDysVGmYiyeP4gXLRjJFM.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||Delhi businessman arrested by Mumbai customs for evading duty||The Customs department has arrested a Delhi-based businessman in connection with a duty evasion case. Officials said the man had illegally imported used and second-hand hard disk drives (a restricted item) by misdeclaring them as new ones to evade custom duty and receive undue benefit.Girlish Vijay Dhingra, 39, the proprietor of South Delhi-based firm Cruiser Technologies, was arrested from Delhi and brought to Mumbai on Wednesday and produced in court. The court remanded him to 14 days’ judicial custody.According to the preventive unit of the customs department, Mumbai, Dhingra has been arrested in connection with a January 2020 case. Customs officials, on January 10, had intercepted a container at Nhava Sheva and seized a huge consignment of second-hand hard drives that had been misdeclared as new ones.Further investigations revealed that Dhingra has unlawfully imported second hand hard drives in the guise of new ones and sold them in the past as well . He is accused of illegally importing old hard disks worth ₹7.40 crore, involving customs duty worth ₹1.33 crore.Officials said the investigation revealed that Dhingra, through his firm, had imported second-hand hard disk drives, but misdeclared them as new ones to evade duty. He allegedly did so because under the Foreign Trade policy, the import of second-hand goods or refurbished or reconditioned spares of refurbished parts of personal computers or laptops are restricted. The import of old hard disk drives requires authorisation from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT). Dhingra’s firm did not have authorisation to import second-hand hard drives.His firm also did not have the mandatory permission from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, which is compulsory for the second-hand hard drives that are under the ‘other waste’ category as per the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016, and cannot be imported without the ministries’ permission.Following the seizure of the second-hand hard drives, Dhingra was interrogated by the customs officials in February and was asked to produce relevant documents for the imported items. Dhingra failed to submit complete and accurate information about the imported goods and continued to buy them. He also stopped responding to the summons of the customs department. Dhingra’s lawyer Ravi Hirani, however, said that his client had already paid duty for previous consignments. “How it is possible to clear the goods without completing the customs formalities? It’s a false case against my client,” said Hirani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/delhi-businessman-arrested-by-mumbai-customs-for-evading-duty/story-7H9rgd9K6Yda32x7jEkrPP.html
20-08-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab students, teachers who attended smartphone distribution in Bathinda, Mansa on August 12 at risk of Covid infection||Bathinda: Even as the health department is tracing, testing and quarantining contacts of a Punjab minister, an MLA and a senior police official, who were found positive for Covid-19, since the Independence Day function, none of the students, teachers and others present at the August 12 phone distribution events the three attended at Bathinda and Mansa have been asked to go for testing. Fifty-nine Class 12 students of government schools along with teachers were invited to the smartphone distribution functions attended by state revenue minister Gurpreet Singh Kangar, Mansa MLA Nazar Singh Manshahia and the Bathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP) Bhupinder Jit Virk. While Kangar, accompanied by Manshahia, distributed handsets to 20 students in Mansa, SSP Bhupinder Jit Singh Virk was present at the Bathinda event where 39 students from three government schools were given phones by state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal. Kangar was found infected three days after the distribution function and Manshahia tested positive after his sample was taken on Monday. The SSP’s report came on August 17. Health officials said as per protocol, all those who were present at the venues should have been tested for coronavirus. “A person is considered to be in high-risk category if they get exposed to an environment where an infected person spends over half an hour. It cannot be ruled out that the minister and two others may have contracted the infection from virus carrier(s) at the function,” said a health official involved in Covid-19 management. Bathinda district education officer (DEO secondary) Iqbal Singh said no one from the students or the education staff was advised to give a sample for Covid test. Mansa DEO Surjit Sidhu said he and few others have been directed to undergo test on Thursday as they were present at the Independence Day function after which Kangar and Mansa MLA tested positive. “The students belong to underprivileged families and they may not be aware of the protocol of quarantine and testing. It has been a week but the administration did not contact any one of us,” said a teacher. Bathinda civil surgeon Amrik Singh Sandhu said the August 12 event was not brought to the notice of the health department. “Testing of those present at the function is important to check their risk status. We still have time and we will try to contact students and all others present at the function,” he said. Mansa officiating chief medical officer Dr GB Singh said they will start the exercise to trace students and others present at the phone distribution function soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-students-teachers-who-attended-smartphone-distribution-in-bathinda-mansa-on-august-12-at-risk-of-covid-infection/story-Y511VbKu1P3ORQKxpUtxkK.html

20-08-2020||Delhi||Restaurants body asks Delhi govt to allow liquor in eateries||Two months after restaurants were allowed to reopen, restaurant owners are demanding that they be allowed to serve liquor in the national capital. The National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) has written to the Delhi government’s excise department in this regard.Restaurants in the city were allowed to operate from June 8, though with restrictions, to ensure social distancing and other precautionary measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19.While business is gradually picking up, owners say the sale of liquor in restaurants will help them make up for their losses as they are operating on about 50% occupancy to ensure social distancing.In its letter dated August 16 to the excise commissioner, NRAI wrote that retail sale of liquor was one of the first few activities to start in all states and requested the government to de-link liquor service in restaurants from the generic term ‘bars’.While the Union ministry of home affairs allowed restaurants to operate in June, the sale of liquor in bars was prohibited.“People are anyway buying liquor from retail stores. It makes no difference whether guests consume alcoholic beverages or coffee along with food at a restaurant. People come to restaurants to have a good time and permission to serve liquor will help us cut losses,” said Manpreet Singh, the owner of Zen restaurant in Connaught Place and the treasurer of NRAI.Singh said business will increase if the liquor service is allowed. According to restaurant owners, currently business is just 10-20% during weekdays and 45-55% during weekends of what it was during pre-Covid times .“With liquor service in restaurants, other sales will also pick-up. We will be able to employ more people,” said Singh.The Union ministry of home affairs has prohibited ‘bars’ from reopening in its Unlock guidelines. NRAI members say that dine-in restaurants are being unfairly clubbed with bars.A Delhi government spokesperson did not respond to HT’s requests for comment.When contacted, a senior official with the excise department said the Delhi government is following the MHA’s guidelines regarding the pandemic. The official, requesting anonymity, said that there is no concept of a stand-alone bar in the capital.“A liquor licence is given to a restaurant that has all necessary approvals from various government authorities. There is no concept of stand-alone bars in Delhi. For now, there is no plan to allow restaurants to serve liquor as we are strictly adhering to MHA guidelines that prohibit serving liquor in bars,” said the official.The association has cited Punjab and Rajasthan governments’ decisions to push their case. “Punjab allowed restaurants to serve liquor in June, while Rajasthan allowed it recently. The Union home ministry guidelines have prohibited ‘bars’. Dine-in liquor service in restaurants should be removed from the prohibited list,” said Prakul Kumar, secretary general, NRAI.Demanding that dine-in restaurants be de-linked from ‘bars’, NRAI suggested some additional guidelines such as keeping the bar counter closed, can be kept while granting permission.“The restaurant industry is has been hit the worst and is fighting for survival. If liquor service is allowed, it will help restaurants recover quickly,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/restaurants-body-asks-delhi-govt-to-allow-liquor-in-eateries/story-W8D1AUm4xKEiC4Xo2KPO4M.html

A video of two persons swimming next to the car went viral over social media.Also read: Drained of all hope, NCR cities left to sink or swim“The underpasses on Raghavendra Marg have been in use for the last 3/4 years. Until today, we have never experienced water logging of this magnitude,” said a spokesperson for DLF, the caretaker of the underpasses on Golf Course Road and Cyber City.“The intensity of rainfall received this morning was 6-7 times higher than the designed capacity of the master drainage system of Gurugram. Of the seven underpasses on Raghavendra Marg, six are fully operational. The seventh, Arjun Marg underpass in DLF Phase I was severely impacted due to reverse discharge of rain water from the main drainage system. The DLF team along with government authorities are working tirelessly towards making it operational by tomorrow morning,” they said.Also read: Heavy rain likely in north-west, central IndiaSatyawan Samriwal, assistant divisional fire officer (ADFO), said that 11 fire tenders, including four from DLF fire services, were used to drain water from the seven underpasses.As per fire department officials, rainwater from five out seven underpasses was cleared by 5 pm.DCP traffic Chander Mohan said that more than 4,000 police personnel were deployed across the city to manage traffic, 20 cranes were used to tow more than 50 vehicles that had broken down at different points of the city. Mohan said that the Narsinghpur-Hero Honda Chowk stretch on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway was the worst affected, as water rose to more than four feet there, which resulted in the carriageway carrying traffic from Delhi to Manesar slowing significantly.Also read: 11 days account for 80% of Delhi’s monsoon rainfall this yearIn several condominiums and residential sectors situated in low-lying areas, such as Belvedere Park in Cyber City, Suncity on Golf Course Road, DLF Phase 1-2, sectors 27, and 28 there was knee-deep rainwater, which not only prevented residents from venturing outside but in some cases flooded ground-floor houses as well.MCG chief engineer Raman Sharma said that the level of rainwater at Najafgarh drain was extremely high, and, as a result, a large portion of Gurugram’s main drain-Badshahpur drain- flowed back on to the roads, leaving the city without any outlet to drain rainwater.Also read: Why Noida handles rain better than Gurugram“Overall more than 45 pumps were deployed across various points of the city to drain out rainwater. As per our estimates, the city received more than 130mm of rainfall today. The volume of rain was much higher than usual as a result of which there was severe waterlogging across the city. We initiated measures as soon as rains started and in most parts of the city, barring low-lying areas by 6 pm, rainwater was cleared.

20-08-2020||Delhi||Incessant rainfall, thunderstorm in parts of national capital||Heavy rainfall lashed several parts of Delhi on Thursday morning. India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast more rainfall in the national capital region till August 25. For two days in a row, heavy rain brought respite from the humid weather as temperature dipped. However, it threw life out of gear in several parts of the national capital on Wednesday as it caused traffic jams, wall collapse and water logging. Areas of Vasant Kunj, Satyam Nagar, Dhaula Kuan and Ring Road were few of the places that experienced traffic snarls throughout the day due to water logging. The boundary wall of Apeejay School in Saket’s J Block collapsed due to rain around 11.30am, damaging several vehicles. No injuries were reported.On Thursday morning, Delhi Traffic Police put out warnings of water logging in areas of Burfkhana Chowk and MB Road. Traffic will remain affected in these areas, the warning read.Out of the five weather stations of Delhi, rainfall was highest in Ayanagar this monsoon, an HT analysis of IMD gridded dataset showed. Enhanced rainfall activity with heavy to very heavy showers is expected over northwest India, including the western Himalayan region till August 20, IMD said in its Monday bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/incessant-rainfall-thunderstorm-in-parts-of-national-capital/story-yIi7LgKMcMlvY7onW2fYiL.html
20-08-2020||Patna||Lockdown impact: 51% report complete loss of income, reveals study||It has been two months since Pankaj Kumar (28), a native of Badirabad village in Arwal district, came back along with his family after losing his job at a cloth factory in Surat.Now, Kumar is barely able to meet his ends, thanks to a small agricultural holding in his village and a roof to live under.But for Sanjay Das, of Basan Bigha in Arwal district and father of five children, things are getting difficult with each passing day. Das worked in a vegetable mandi in Mumbai. But ever since he returned to his native village, things have gone awry for him.These are just two examples.A joint study, titled Qualitative Assessment of Impact of Covid-19 on Migrant Workers and Their Families in Bihar, conducted by Unicef and DMI (Development Management Institute), Patna, reveals that reverse migration of more than 21 lakh migrant workers due to job losses and uncertainty has caused unprecedented hardships and devastating consequences for migrant labourers and their families, according to Dr Urvashi Kaushik, social policy specialist, Unicef in Bihar.Though the sample size for the study was less than 2,000, the findings are an eye-opener. Nearly 51% of the migrants surveyed reported complete loss of income, while 30% reported major reduction of income. Only 7% of the migrants surveyed said there was no impact on their income.About half the households have lost their whole income. Over two-thirds of the households reported complete loss of income due to lockdown and said their finances were just sufficient for less than a month of survival.Job loss was relatively higher among the SC/STs. About one-fifth of them reported that their primary source of income was from government schemes. However, they said they received ration from the public distribution system (PDS), although only 42% reported sufficiency of ration. More than half of the migrant households received financial assistance from the government and the average amount received was Rs 1,320.Lack of work has compelled them to rethink about their return. A large chunk has already returned to different work places, while about 70% said they would go to destination areas in an average time of 4.4 months while nearly 6% of the migrants want to return quickly.Nearly 21 lakh people returned to Bihar during the lockdown and the state government, till June-end, had conducted skill mapping of 14 lakh migrants. Of this, 8.40 lakh were engaged in different spheres, like construction of road, bridges, dams, painter, centering mechanic, unskilled workers in construction, mason helpers, etc.Based on their skills, migrants were broadly categorized into 10 groups -- handicrafts, mechanics, healthcare, general services, electronics and electrical, construction, computer and IT, banking and financial services, agriculture and others.Construction and related activities seems to be the major source of livelihood for all those who returned from different states, while the second largest chunk of people who came back belonged to other services like cooks, drivers, daily wagers, domestic helps, drivers and tailors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-impact-51-report-complete-loss-of-income-reveals-study/story-hsMZMwYZJpLwbDzGUPMB0J.html

20-08-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: A man with possessions||He doesn’t have a house, he says. But he does have possessions.“I carry them all the time with me,” says Vijay Kumar. This morning he is sitting on the steps of a shuttered shop in a central Delhi market. The lane is still largely empty. Mr Kumar’s possessions consist of a bag (with a broken strap) and a wooden walking stick. The black bag is crammed with personal stuff, so much so that it is bulging out on all sides like the cheeks of a naughty child holding water in his mouth, and refusing to swallow it down. While the bag’s zip does work, it is still tied with a strap of red plastic. “This has all my clothes—shirt, pants, kurta, sandals, gamcha and a tauliya (towel).”He pauses for a while and says, “It has a katori (bowl) and chammach (spoon) too.”Mr Kumar says matter-of-factly that he is a beggar. “I worked in an eatery until some years ago.” His only other possession, the walking stick, is covered from top to bottom with a series of colourful rubber bands. “Can’t you see this is for decoration? It looks good this way.”Mr Kumar acquired the stick about three years ago. But isn’t it true that he is able to walk without any support? He nods lazily. “Yes, but the streets always have more dogs than people, and some of them bark at the very sight of me... I use the danda to keep them away.” He silently shrugs his shoulders in response to a query on how he landed into his present way of living. While he generously lets himself be clicked, as well as his bag and walking stick, he requests that his face picture be not shared publicly “since I’m a kind of person who doesn’t want publicity.” He now falls quiet, looking amused with the brief photography session. “Arre, I forgot to show you my teesra samaan (third possession), which is perhaps the most important,” he comments wryly, showing his bundle of beedis, lying by his sandals, along with a packet of matchbox—the matchbox cover shows a ship. “I have travelled so much but I have never been on a boat... I always walk,” he notes. Mr Kumar reveals he has been in the city for several years and locates his roots in Bareilly, UP.“I do have a family but I haven’t gone home for a long time.” He stopped contacting them a few years ago and they too didn’t try to find his whereabouts, he guesses.Absentmindedly running his hand upon his scraggly grey beard, Mr Kumar says he doesn’t regret being alone. “Sometimes I feel lonely but Dilli is a big city and I always find people like myself... these men have living conditions just like mine, and we sit together and talk of important things.”By “important things”, he means the weather and places with easy availability of food.Turning towards his bag and walking stick, Mr Kumar says he doesn’t feel anything for his belongings. “I keep losing the things in my bag... sometimes they are stolen while I’m asleep... but these things are easily replaceable, so there is no nuksaan (loss).”Every night, however, as he settles down to sleep (on the pavement), Mr Kumar does make it a point to remove all the rubber bands from his walking stick. “Because I have collected them over time,” he explains, throwing a hurried glance towards the stick, looking relieved to see it is still there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-man-with-possessions/story-1iuvceH6X6vycC5gsayWoL.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||10.87 crore household toilets constructed across rural India from 2015: Centre to HC||The Union government, in its reply to the Bombay high court (HC) regarding a petition that sought directions to include of sanitary napkins as an essential commodity, said that it has initiated various measures to ensure hygiene among all strata of the society, and under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), it constructed nearly 10.87 crore household toilets and 85,784 community toilets across rural India. Hence, Centre said, the claim of the petitioner law students that there was failure on the part of the Central government to implement the Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) schemes for the poor was not justified. The affidavit filed by the department of drinking water and sanitation (DDWS) in reply to the issues raised in the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Nikita Gore, a law student, through advocate Vinod Sangvikar, has said that the MHM grogramme was included in the SBM since 2015. The Central government scheme is implemented by states under the SBM (Grameen) programme which aims at making villages open-defecation free. Pursuant to this, the department had constructed nearly 10.87 crore household toilets and 85,784 community toilets across India. The affidavit further states that the grouse of the petitioners that the MHM was not being implemented properly, was unfounded as the initiatives had been taken under the SBM (G) scheme to not only distribute sanitary napkins to women and girls, but a mechanism was also put in place to dispose of the napkins. In light of this, the affidavit filed by Magan Lal, under-secretary, ministry of Jal Shakti, department of drinking water and sanitation, has stated that along with toilets, the issue of MHM was also taken care of.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/10-87-crore-household-toilets-constructed-across-rural-india-from-2015-centre-to-hc/story-JZGKZdu9QJ7r0VFi7yBWFL.html

She was found by locals who rushed to a hospital where she was declared dead on arrival. Sweety has ventured out of her house to play but when her mother could not find her, the neighbours formed a search party for the girl. Locals later found her floating inside the drain, which was filled with rainwater and muck. “We have registered a case of accidental death and are investigating further. We will register a case against the contractor of the Vasai civic body only after the post mortem report is received,” said an officer from Nallasopara police station. Santosh Yadav, a social worker from the area said the open manhole had no lid since the past few months and the Vasai civic body did not put any cover over the drain, which led to the accident. “We want the guilty contractor punished for the loss of the girl,” he said. Pratap Koli, officer of F ward said, “We will be taking up the issue to Rajendra Lad, executive engineer, Vasai-Virar City Municipal Corporation, and other officials, on Thursday. We will also take action against the concerned contractor who was awarded the contract.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/18-month-old-girl-drowns-in-open-manhole-at-nallasopara/story-Nn2tO6Dni648onR4WjWt1L.html

20-08-2020||City||Baroda abuzz with political activities ahead of bypoll||Leaders of various political parties have started addressing gatherings in the villages falling under Sonepat’s Baroda constituency to win over the support of people ahead of the bypoll. While Karnal MP Sanjay Bhatia and agriculture minister JP Dalal are canvassing for the saffron party, Rajya Sabha member Deepender Hooda is leading the Congress and Abhay Chautala has taken charge of the INLD.Neither local people nor leaders, however, can be seen adhering to safety guidelines issued to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. Wednesday marked the fourth day of Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) general secretary and Ellenabad MLA Abhay Singh Chautala’s five-day tour. He visited five villages and while addressing a gathering amid rain in Bichpadi village, he said three ordinances related to agriculture announced by the Union government will “destroy the farmers’ and commission agents”.“The BJP government has prepared a blueprint of damage by aiming to implement three ordinances. You (people) have a chance to teach the BJP a lesson by making their candidate lose the security deposit in the upcoming Baroda byelection. If these ordinances are implemented, farmers will have to sell their produce at minimal prices, which would be decided by the private players,” he added.“When the all citizens was locked inside their homes, ministers of the Haryana government were busy doing liquor scam. The excise minister (Dushyant Chautala) and home minister (Anil Vij) are at loggerheads over the liquor scam. The excise minister has flayed the report of special enquiry teams which reveals that Manohar Lal Khattar is a weak chief minister,” Abhay said.I dare Digvijay to contest this bypoll: AbhayThe Ellenabad legislator has dared his estranged nephew Digvijay Chautala to fight the upcoming Baroda byelection.“My brother Ajay Chautala had stated that I reached the state assembly because they helped me in winning the Ellenabad seat. I want to tell him to bring his younger son Digvijay Chautala to the poll fray from Baroda as he aspires to become an MLA since they formed their own party. They (Ajay’s family) betrayed the state voters by supporting the BJP, which they used to abuse during the assembly elections. The people of Baroda are ready to teach a lesson to traitors,” he added. Meanwhile, Loktrantra Suraksha Party (LSP) chief Raj Kumar Saini was barred from addressing a gathering at Baroda’s Jagsi village on Wednesday. Villagers asked him to go back, urging him not to “spoil the brotherhood”.“Saini sahab aap chale jao. Bhaichara kharab mat karo. Chunav se pehle aap iss gaon mein kabhi nahi aaye, ab maahol kharaab karne aaye ho (Please go back. Don’t spoil the brotherhood. You never visited this village before the elections, and came here now to destroy the harmony),” the villagers said. They asked him whether he helped anyone from their village to secure a job.However, Saini told the people that he had a right to deliver his speech and they cannot stop him from addressing the public.“I did not burn the state. I was always in favour of giving 100% reservation to all communities. I never enjoyed power, so I could not provide job to anyone,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/baroda-abuzz-with-political-activities-ahead-of-bypoll/story-JkeCNdYIBnsulbIpJ7BNMN.html

Soham Foundation, through this initiative, is not only promoting eco-friendly Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations but also plans to use the funds collected from the sales to help funds the education of tribal children in and around Ulhasnagar. Around 50 idols made of red mud were purchased from Pen in Raigad district, which were designed by local tribal artists. The NGO has set up a shop at Century Rayon staff gate near the Shahad bridge and managed to sell 35 idols within a week. “We pledged to take up the promotion of red-mud idols this year as this mud can be used to plan saplings. During our visits to several places, were came across the Yusuf Meherally Centre in Pen where tribal artists were making idols. We bought 50 idols from them,” said Rajendra Dethe, founder of the Soham Foundation. “We set up a shop in Ulhasnagar and promoted the idols. We got orders for 35 of them. Whatever we earn out of this, we will use for the education of the tribal kids in our region,” said Dethe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ulhasnagar-ngo-promotes-red-mud-ganesh-idols-made-by-tribal-artists/story-rOkU9MiN7YvVvxvOrfRZCN.html
20-08-2020||City||Ganeshotsav to skip a beat this year as dhol tasha groups go silent||This year, the dhol tasha and brass band troupes that typically practice at different nooks and corners of the city, especially below the flyovers in Thane, a month before Ganeshotsav, are nowhere to be seen or heard. With the lockdown norms preventing large groups from taking part in the traditional festive procession, these musicians have no employment this year.Vrushali Waghule, 25, member of Veer Garjana Pathak from Dombivli, said, “This year, there are no dhol-tasha pathaks practicing anywhere in Thane, Kalyan or Dombivli. Our prime focus is on the safety of everyone in the team. Thus, we have decided to stay away from any kind of public performances. There are more than 100 of us who gather a month ahead of the festival every year to practice for eight hours daily. We had 10 to 15 bookings a day during Ganeshotsav.”Waghule claims that this time, there will be no performance and no money for the group of performers. Additionally, they will be unable to carry out the maintenance of their musical instruments due to a lack of funds.Aarambh, another group from Dombivli, has over 250 members. Advait Korgaonkar, 23, one of the members, said, “We have performers from nine years to 55 years of age, and all of us await the 10-day festival each year. This year it is not possible to perform, so most of us have started doing social work – distributing food packets or providing ration kits to the needy. We will miss the energy, rhythm and vigour this year.”Brass band members and DJs are facing a financial crisis this year due to a lack of demand. Nitin Shelar, 39, of Thane’s Sanskriti Banjo, said, “We have been performing for the Ganpati festival for the last 12 years. From April we would be busy performing for marriages and festivals. This time, we haven’t received a single order since April. Our families’ survival is dependant on this business. At least during Ganeshotsav, we were expecting orders but we haven’t received any even though we have assured to follow social distancing” The case is the same for DJ supplier and a brass band member, Gajendra Mahadik from Kalyan, who said that no bookings have come through this year. “We would have more than 12 bookings for banjo and 30 to 32 orders for DJs. My team of 62 people has started searching for different jobs as we haven’t received any orders since April. We are not well educated, but we are good artists and popular in Kalyan-Dombivli. Our source of income is completely gone this year, and we are hoping that things will be back to normal soon,” Mahadik said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ganeshotsav-to-skip-a-beat-this-year-as-dhol-tasha-groups-go-silent/story-rcTa85Vj75srf4s1Mlx20I.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||Sharad Pawar seeks PM Narendra Modi’s intervention to give justice to cooperative banks||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has criticised the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) over its alleged “untouchable” approach towards cooperative banks and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene in the matter.“The outlook of RBI is that the share of the cooperative banking sector in the overall banking sector is merely 3%... It has been insisting on the conversion of cooperative banks into private banks. It is pertinent to mention here that RBI, since 1993, has been trying to convert urban cooperative banks (UCBs) into private banks by setting up various committees and issuing circulars from time to time to implement recommendations of these committees, but could not succeed,” Pawar said in a letter written to PM Modi on August 15.“In the wake of the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank’s fallout due to a scam similar to that of Madhavpura Cooperative Bank, to end existence of the cooperative banking sector, the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2020, was introduced in Lok Sabha on March 3 by making several amendments in the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, as suggested by RBI. When the Parliament was suspended due to Covid-19 and no discussion it could be held, the bill was converted into an ordinance on June 24,” the letter states.Pawar said that he agreed that there should be financial discipline in the banks, but it would be certainly incorrect to say that such a conversion of the cooperative sector into a private sector would completely or partially prevent misappropriation of funds, financial irregularities and frauds.To prove his point, he shared data published by RBI regarding financial fraud in the banking sector for the last financial year. “In the financial year 2019-20, an alleged fraud of ₹4,355 crore was identified in the PMC Bank scam, while during the first half of the year, fraud of approximately ₹95,700 crore was reported in nationalised banks. Therefore, it is not correct to say that misappropriation of funds or financial irregularities are observed in cooperative banks only. Further, it seems absurd to claim that privatisation of cooperative banks would curb or reduce banking fraud,” the letter mentioned.“I therefore earnestly request you [Modi] to kindly look into the matter personally and give justice to the cooperative banking sector, which has a legacy of more than 100 years and is striving hard not only to exist but to grow despite all odds,” Pawar wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sharad-pawar-seeks-pm-narendra-modi-s-intervention-to-give-justice-to-cooperative-banks/story-BFEH4sRpDeGzPRbEknXzmK.html
20-08-2020||City||Potholes on Thane roads: Officials, contractors to be held responsible||With the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) receiving flak for pothole-riddled roads, the civic commissioner has now issued directives that officials and contractors will be held responsible for shoddy pothole filling work. Action will be taken against them if potholes are not filled or quality of work is questionable. The issue of potholed roads was also raised by the Thane mayor on Wednesday. Mayor Naresh Mhaske conducted a meeting with civic officials to start the work of filling potholes on a war footing. According to a survey conducted by the Thane civic body, last week, the city had 1,016 potholes, covering a total area of 2268 sqm. Potholes were reported at Teen Hath Naka, Dalmil Chowk, Kashish Park and Louis Wadi. “I have given orders to fill all these potholes on a war footing. Action will be taken against the contractor or the officer in charge of the roads where potholes aren’t filled. No negligence in the work will be tolerated,” said civic commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma.Mhaske claimed that the corporation had gained a good name for its Covid handling, which is now maligned due to the road situation. “The basic infrastructure was ignored during the pandemic due to which most roads in the city have developed craters. Commuters are facing a tough time due to these potholes. Every year the city roads develop potholes during monsoon, however, the authorities continue to ignore the repair works before monsoon. We have demanded an inquiry into the officials who have ignored the pre-monsoon road repair works,” he said.The mayor demanded that the roads be repaired before Ganeshotsav begins so that residents can bring home the idol without any bumps along the way. The Congress party decided to take matters into its own hands and organised a pothole filling drive as a mark of protest against the corporation. Vikrant Chavan, president of Thane Congress, said, “We have stationed our volunteers in different wards who will be filling these potholes as a mark of our protest against the shoddy work of the TMC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/potholes-on-thane-roads-officials-contractors-to-be-held-responsible/story-hJYUw2IPk3RdZDo9JBl1NO.html

We need to check if a permanent solution can be found, such as deep tunnelling,” said a senior officer from the stormwater drains (SWD) department. The consultant will have technical and engineering expertise in SWD along with prior experience of handling such projects. They will be given a list of chronic waterlogging spots, including Hindmata, Gandhi Market near Matunga, Chembur Colony and Andheri subway, for the study. The decision comes on the back of allocating and spending dedicated budgets to find solutions to waterlogging at 273 spots across the city, over the last four years. The officer said, “Despite our efforts, waterlogging happened in the city this year too.” After the monsoon of 2018, BMC tried micro-planning to deal with flooding in the city and the SWD department was tasked with studying chronic flooding spots individually and come up with personalised solutions, in addition to cleaning water entrances and laterals, and desilting drains. However, waterlogging has remained a recurring problem. On August 4 and 5, Mumbai experienced very heavy rainfall and various parts of the city experienced severe waterlogging, including locations that usually do not see flooding, like Babulnath, Girgaum chowpatty and Nariman Point in south Mumbai. Waterlogging was reported at nine prominent locations in the island city, four locations in the eastern suburbs, and three locations in the western suburbs. As in 2019, the water took several hours to drain, though the flooding may be partially due to the city recording its highest ever August rainfall 1974 on August 5. BMC’s 2020-21 budget allocated Rs 912.10 crore to the SWD department. The civic body had declared that during the 2020 monsoon, only 24 waterlogging spots would remain since the rest had been dealt with over the past three years. SWD department has spent Rs 2,903.28 crore for capital expenditures including repair and cleaning of drains and water laterals, nullah desilting, widening, repairing manholes, etc, between 2016 and 2019. However, during the lockdown, BMC lost out on crucial months for its monsoon-preparedness work and was unable to complete fixing over 40 waterlogging spots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/why-did-mumbai-flood-this-year-too-bmc-to-find-out/story-NhREmCIZUqtKvvJfE9InVI.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||Bandra-Kurla Complex to get art district plaza, fest on lines of Kala Ghoda||Mumbai’s top commercial hub is all set to get vibrant with its own dedicated art district plaza and an annual art festival on the lines of the famous Kala Ghoda Festival in South Mumbai.The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which is the special planning authority for the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) is planning to develop space under the Kalanagar flyover, connecting it to the Kalanagar junction and the Nandadeep garden and making it completely pedestrianised.Space will include an amphitheatre, seating area, stage, cafeteria, green space, art installations and parking space. MMRDA is also planning to hold an annual art festival where artists can showcase their works, in this area. Besides, it also expects revenue-generation and the art plaza in itself to increase the land value. RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA said, “The art district will add to the vibrancy of BKC. It will also be a platform for many artists to showcase their talent. We were planning to initiate the festival from December 2020 before the pandemic hit the city.” The total space open for the public will be around 8,343 square metres.Maharashtra tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray recently inaugurated an art installation at the Kalanagar junction as the first step towards this project. He tweeted, “Very soon, the Kalanagar flyover, Nandadeep garden, Kalanagar junction, pedestrianisation of BKC will be completed, and most importantly the BKC art district will be established.” MMRDA has invited bids for the construction and maintenance of the plaza. It is expected to open the Kalanagar flyover for traffic from October, post which works under the bridge will be completed in another six months, MMRDA officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bandra-kurla-complex-to-get-art-district-plaza-fest-on-lines-of-kala-ghoda/story-3b0wyQlg0goUfrdC2j08WL.html

It also marked the 29th tunnel breakthrough of the total 32 for the Metro line.The 1.5-km up-line stretch between Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) and Dharavi was commissioned in August 2019. In March, the down-line tunnel of 1.5km from BKC to Dharavi was completed.Of the total 3-km (up and down-line) stretch from BKC to Dharavi, 484m of the tunnel lies below the active Mithi river channel.Ranjit Singh Deol, managing director, MMRC said, “Notwithstanding the fact that the project is challenging; with high water tables and complex geology, I am happy that our team has accomplished the assigned task despite Covid-19 related restrictions.”Till date, MMRC has completed 85% of tunnelling with the help of 17 tunnel boring machines. Around 59% of the overall construction work for Metro-3 has been completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mmrc-completes-tunnelling-below-mithi-river/story-f0SsTsiwRsJjItJRsMUMDK.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||KEM Hospital to start clinical trial of anti-TB BCG vaccine||King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital in Parel will soon to start clinical trial on anti-tuberculosis vaccination (TB) — Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine (BCG) to treat Covid-19 patients. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has selected the hospital for the trial which will be conducted on 200 people of the age group of 60-75 years. KEM Hospital, the biggest civic-run hospital in Mumbai, has been treating the highest number of severely-ill Covid-19 patients since the outbreak of the virus in March. Last week, ICMR informed the hospital about the trial and the proposal to conduct the trial has been sent to the ethics committee of the hospital for final approval. In India, BCG vaccination started in 1949 under the national immunisation programme. The vaccine, an annual vaccine administered to newborns, protects against disseminated tuberculosis and meningitis in childhood. In the clinical trial, the vaccine will be administered to citizens aged above 60 years to examine if it can stimulate the immune response among older people against Covid-19. “ICMR has initiated a multi-centric study to see if BCG can reduce the severity of Covid-19 infection among individuals above 60 years of age. The vaccine is effective among children to control TB, but the study will see its implications on elder people and its correlation with Covid-19,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Despite repeated calls, Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of the hospital, didn’t respond to HT. The trial will be conducted on 1,000 healthy volunteers aged above 60 years of age in six states —Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi. “Volunteers will be tested for antigens to check if they are infected with Covid-19. They will have to undergo antibody test to see if they were infected with the virus in the past,” said Kakani. Often Covid-19 patients develop inflammatory reactions which lead to severity of their infection and even death. In this backdrop, doctors have opined that BCG vaccination, by enhancing innate immune response, may have deleterious effects on coronavirus. “Several researches have shown a correlation that people who received BCG vaccination did not get sick more often or become seriously ill. It has long-lasting effects to boost the immune system. It is believed that despite having such a huge population, Covid-19 fatality rate in India is low because of BCG vaccine which is given to all children since the early 90s,” said Dr Lalit Anande, medical superintendent of Sewri TB Hospital. “Impact of routine infant BCG vaccination in the young generation on prevention of local Covid-19 spread in Japan” — a study published on August 11 — suggested that BCG vaccination does play an influential role in protecting against the spread of infection on a mass scale. In the conclusion, the authors wrote, “Our findings suggest that routine infant BCG vaccination coverage in the young generation had a significant impact on prevention of local Covid-19 spread in Japan.” Another study, Safety and COVID-19 Symptoms in Individuals Recently Vaccinated with BCG: a Retrospective Cohort Study, published on August 5 in Cell Reports Medicine showed the vaccine is safe and induces immune responses. The study was conducted on people who have received a BCG vaccine in the past five years in Netherlands. “BCG vaccination might be associated with a decrease in the incidence of sickness during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as lower incidence of extreme fatigue…(sic),” reads the report. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) overruled the significance of BCG vaccine in April. In a statement on its official website, it stated, “There is no evidence that BCG protects people against infection with Covid-19 virus. Two clinical trials addressing this question are underway, and WHO will evaluate the evidence when it is available. In the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of Covid-19.” Meanwhile, KEM Hospital expects to receive approval from the ethics committee to run the clinical trial on Covishield within the next two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kem-hospital-to-start-clinical-trial-of-anti-tb-bcg-vaccine/story-jPVHT3zhOSOWFD2Mw2K8zH.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||A conspiracy to defame Aaditya Thackeray: Sena on Sushant Singh Rajput probe||Hours after the Supreme Court announced its judgment to hand over the Sushant Singh Rajput death case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Shiv Sena said the entire episode was a “conspiracy” to defame party leader and Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray. The Sena, which was being cornered by the Opposition through the case, said neither the party nor the Thackeray clan was afraid of the CBI probe. While state home minister Anil Deshmukh stuck to a brief statement to the media on the case being taken over from the Mumbai police, Sena legislator and transport minister Anil Parab, who is known to be close to Sena chief and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, took on the Opposition. “The Opposition intended to malign Aaditya Thackeray. They are aching as they thought nobody except them can form the government. As they could not point fingers at the government, they came up with the conspiracy. They have no sympathy for Sushant Singh [Rajput]. The entire thing is just political, and the truth in the case will soon emerge.” Earlier in the day, Sena’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut said: “It is not a loss for the Thackeray-led MVA government. When there is a legal battle, such things happen.” On being asked if the Sena minister will cooperate with the investigating agency in the case, Parab said it is too premature. “The Shiv Sena has gone through several challenges and has brought the party to power today. The Sena is not afraid of them, and the Thackeray family is absolutely not afraid. We are followers of Balasaheb [Thackeray]. So being afraid of this made-up issue is out of question.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/just-a-conspiracy-to-defame-aaditya-thackeray-sena-on-sushant-singh-rajput-probe/story-fDmUwrCFKCRjjfmKNIWumO.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||22 of city’s 24 wards have fewer than 1,000 active cases: BMC||Of the 24 wards in Mumbai, 22 have less than 1,000 active Covid-19 cases, according to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) available until August 17. The R-Central (Borivli West) and R-South (Kandivli West) wards are the only two wards with over 1,000 active cases. While R-Central has 1,158 active Covid-19 cases, R-South has 1,006. R-Central ward has a recovery rate of 79.13%, and R-South has a recovery rate of 80.13%, lower than Mumbai’s recovery rate of 81.91% as of August 17. Recovery rate is the number of Covid-19 patients who have been discharged by BMC, in comparison to the total Covid-19 cases recorded in Mumbai so far. The K-East ward corresponding to Andheri East has 940 active cases, and a recovery rate of 82.81%. The B ward, corresponding to areas of Bhendi Bazar, Mohammad Ali Road, Dongri, and Pydhoni, has the lowest number of active Covid-19 cases at 213, but a low recovery rate of 75%. Daksha Shah, deputy executive health officer, BMC, said, “The two wards in the north have a high number of active cases because a comparatively higher number of new cases are still emerging from high-rises in north Mumbai. The general trend is that the virus is shifting from south Mumbai to north Mumbai. Earlier, there were many hot spots in the island city such as Worli, Dharavi and E ward area in Byculla. The infection rate has subsided in those areas. BMC is now concentrating efforts on wards that are showing high cases.” BMC has data on ward-wise bifurcation for 125,782 cases, of which 103,031 have recovered, 15,987 are active, and 6,764 have died, as of August 17. The data also showed that of the 40,969 cases in the island city, 5,399 are active, with an average recovery rate of 81.28%. Of the 51,455 cases in the western suburbs, 6,844, the highest in the city, are active, with an average recovery rate of 81.83%. The eastern suburbs have 3,699 active cases from its total of 33,358, and an average recovery rate of 82.85%. Mumbai on Wednesday recorded 1,132 new cases taking the total to 131,542, and 46 deaths, taking the toll to 7,268. There are 17,194 active cases in Mumbai. On Wednesday, Mumbai had a total of 106,057 recovered patients, with a recovery rate of 80.62%. On any day, there is a slight difference in number of cases registered by BMC and state due to difference in the timing when both record figures from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal which is updated in real time, a civic officer said, requesting anonymity||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/22-of-city-s-24-wards-have-fewer-than-1-000-active-cases-bmc/story-lKqUc0SeOmoR2UrDRzWw7K.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||Shivneri buses allowed to operate||Passengers will now be able to travel between Mumbai and Pune by Shivneri buses starting Thursday. Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) will also start its inter-district services in Maharashtra. Maharashtra government, under Mission Begin Again, has allowed MSRTC to resume its bus services within the state. According to a government directive issued on Wednesday, passengers would not require e-pass, permission or approval for inter-district travel in MSRTC buses. However, MSRTC will issue a standard operating procedure (SOP) for travellers.MSRTC stated that bus services will resume phase wise. “The operation of bus services will bring relief to commuters, especially during Ganeshotsav. All types of buses including Shivneri, Shivshahi, long- and medium-range buses will resume. Advance reservations will also be made available. The operations will start in a phased manner,” said Abhijeet Bhosale, public relation officer, MSRTC. Inter-district bus operations in the state were suspended after the nationwide lockdown was enforced to contain the spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shivneri-buses-allowed-to-operate/story-pEIczT7n6Rpx86akQhDpbN.html
20-08-2020||City||TMC may convert Covid hospitals into non-Covid ones||With the number of Covid-19 cases decreasing, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) is considering to convert Covid hospitals to non-Covid ones. These hospitals will be reviewed, and non-Covid status will be granted based on number of cases in the vicinity of the hospitals. The first Covid hospital to be converted into a non-Covid one is Kalsekar Hospital in Mumbra, as the number of new cases in the area has been in single digits. TMC is especially keen on allowing smaller hospitals to convert to non-Covid ones. TMC commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma said, “We have released this order for Kalsekar Hospital considering the fact that Mumbra has fewer cases now. In the past few weeks, the daily numbers were either zero or in single digits. We have also added hospitals or beds wherever necessary. In areas where the situation is under control, we are ready to allow hospitals to start regular operations.” While releasing the order for Kalsekar Hospital, the civic body has announced a set of guidelines for the same as hospitals are approaching TMC seeking non-Covid status. Dr Afreen Saudagar, chief executive officer of Kalsekar Hospital, said, “Based on the guidelines, we have to discharge all patients currently in the hospital. We will not be admitting any new patients for a week. After all patients are discharged, we will take a few days to sanitise the entire hospital. By the last week of August, we shall start functioning as non-Covid hospital.” The hospital currently has 28 patients in regular wards and 12 in intensive care unit (ICU). Dr Raju Murudkar, civic health officer, said, “All those hospitals that will go back to being non-Covid hospitals will have to ensure that patients who are currently admitted are discharged after completion of treatment and that the hospital is sanitised thereafter. After this, they are allowed to admit non-Covid patients. In case any new patient tests positive, they should inform the war room and ensure a bed is available in a Covid care facility before discharging them.” Non-Covid hospitals have to display a list of Covid hospitals and important contact numbers outside the hospital building for the convenience of patients. “There are patients with monsoon ailments or fever. Such cases will increase and there will be a need for non-Covid beds. With fewer load of Covid cases within TMC jurisdiction, around 50% of private hospitals are keen on getting non-Covid status,” said Dr Santosh Kadam, president of Indian Medical Association, Thane chapter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tmc-may-convert-covid-hospitals-into-non-covid-ones/story-vt53h5ntk0Fa4ytSCMmZ6I.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||BMC starts to shut down some Covid Care Centres||With fewer than 1,000 new cases of Covid-19 being reported on an average in the city, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is shutting down some Covid Care Centres (CCCs). At present, Mumbai has 332 CCCs for high-risk contacts, with bed capacity of more than 48,000. There are 173 CCCs for positive asymptomatic patients, with over 23,000 beds. As the pandemic curve has flattened in Mumbai, almost 70% CCCs are now empty. Consequently, BMC is gradually handing these rented lodges, schools, auditoriums and hotels back to owners. Medical equipment from the CCCs, like oximeters, glucometers, oxygen cylinders and blood pressure monitors, will later be used in secondary healthcare facilities. “At present, we aren’t handing over all the equipment. We have to remain prepared in case Mumbai is hit with a second wave of Covid-19. Annually, peripheral hospitals, dispensaries and health posts have their own demand for medical devices. So these equipment will be sent to these facilities for future usage,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. BMC runs 16 peripheral hospitals, 175 municipal dispensaries, 29 maternity homes with over 200 health posts across the city. CCCs were set up in all civic wards by BMC in March, to quarantine high risk contacts and asymptomatic patients. By June, BMC was conducting around 4,500 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests every day and an average of 1,100 new Covid-19 cases were reported daily. Since the inclusion of rapid antigen tests, daily average testing is over 7,000, with more than 10,000 tests being conducted on some days. Despite the increased testing, the daily average caseload for Covid-19 has remained below 1,000 in the city. The positivity rate has come down from 22% in July to 19.51% in August. The civic body has spent around Rs 850 crore on health infrastructure in the ongoing pandemic, of which Rs 130 crore was spent on essential machines. “Most equipment that was donated by philanthropists will be used at secondary health care facilities along with purchased equipment. Rented equipment will be handed over to owners,” said Kakani. Health activists have welcomed civic body’s decision. Pradeep Patil, who is associated with the non-government organisation (NGO) Jan Kalyan, said, “Even through health posts and peripheral hospitals form the backbone of the healthcare system in Mumbai, they lack basic amenities. It will be a great boost for medical infrastructure if BMC can also shift all additional equipment like ventilators and x-ray machines for Covid-19 patients to these centres once the pandemic is over.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-starts-to-shut-down-some-covid-care-centres/story-1eycZgsvErY6sLYRPICGXL.html
20-08-2020||Gurugram||Limited drainage capacity, delayed monsoon response: Why Gurugram flooded on Wednesday||The city’s limited drainage capacity, which results in Badshahpur drain overflowing during heavy rains, disruption of the hydrological flow of natural drains, which has stopped the flow of water into traditional dams, and delayed monsoon preparedness were the main reasons for Gurugram sinking after Wednesday’s rains, experts said.City-based urban planning experts said that the rain on Wednesday was not an exception but a cyclical phenomenon, which will happen once every few years based on historical rainfall data. The civic agencies in the city, they said, will have to plan for this. Natural drains, which were spread across the district and prominent dams, which were in existence since the British time at Ghata, Wazirabad, Nathupur, Jharsa and Manesar, have vanished and this is the reason that Golf Course Road and areas along near it flood. “Around 100mm of rain is too much too be absorbed but based on hydrological data, exigency plans need to be created and special emphasis should be put on rainwater harvesting and creating small lakes, which can absorb water. Presently the storm water drainage system is inadequate to take this heavy load,” said Prof Sewa Ram from School of Planning and Architecture in Delhi. Another expert, who preferred anonymity as he closely works with local government, said that there was a need to ensure separate storm water drainage and sewage system in the city and both of these need regular cleaning. “The Ghata dam spread to 5 square miles during monsoons in 1940s. Now it is non-existent. Similarly, other dams spread across Gurugram helped save the Aravallis water, which is going waste. The greenery in Aravallis is protecting us but we are bent on changing the status of these forests,” he said, adding that mechanical pumping of rainwater was not a permanent solution. Prodded about the matter, VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO) of Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), also said that deployment of motor pumps is only a short term relief measure and until the city’s drainage system is augmented, waterlogging will remain a common occurrence.“Due to the heavy volume of rain, the city was severely waterlogged. Motor pumps are only relief measures. Increasing their deployment is not a solution but simply a damage-control measure. The GMDA has done a comprehensive study of the city’s drainage system. We had some measures we wanted to introduce to augment the city’s existing drainage capacity, but could not do so due to officials being engaged in Covid-19 duty. Until, we augment the city’s drain capacity, waterlogging will continue to be a hindrance,” said Kundu.Kundu said that on Wednesday, Badshahpur drain was at its optimum capacity and due to the city witnessing heavy rains, it flowed back and inundated most parts of the city.MD Sinha, additional CEO, GMDA, who is an Indian Forest Service officer, added that there is need to focus on effective rainwater harvesting in every sector of the city. “We also need to develop and implement proper hydrological management plan for Gurugram for a long term solution,” he said. Besides inherent drainage issues, with officials of both GMDA and Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) engaged in containing the spread of coronavirus since March this year, monsoon preparedness also took a major hit.In June, HT had reported that due to civic bodies allocating most of their resources and attention towards fighting Covid-19, tenders for cleaning drains in most areas of the city were floated as late as the last week of May and early June, leaving them very little time to do the work and it was likely that in the upcoming monsoon season, most parts of city will witness heavy waterlogging.It usually takes officials more than two months for desilting and cleaning one leg of drains, and hence, the tendering process is carried out in late March or early April every year, usually.In addition, with a large number of migrant workers also returning home, contractors faced an acute shortage in manpower and the work progressed at a snail’s pace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/limited-drainage-capacity-delayed-monsoon-response-why-gurugram-flooded-on-wednesday/story-Jky4BQMdL6A6jZaQP9ieCK.html
20-08-2020||City||Gurugram: Seven of city’s 11 underpasses drown in rainwater||Gurugram At least seven out of city’s 11 underpasses were heavily flooded on Wednesday after a spell of heavy rainfall lashed the city. Most of of the underpasses remained shut for commuters till late Wednesday evening.Three underpasses on Golf Course Road (at DLF Phase 1, Genpact Chowk and Bristol Chowk), two in Cyber City next to Shankar Chowk, and two others at Iffco Chowk and Rajiv Chowk on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway were submerged in rainwater and were closed for commuter use at various points, starting 10am, officials said.Barring the underpass at DLF Phase 1, all the remaining had been cleared of rainwater by 8pm. “The level of rainwater is extremely high at the underpass in DLF Phase 1. More than five crore kilolitres of rainwater has accumulated there. Five fire tenders have been deployed at the underpass, and it will be cleared by tomorrow (Thursday),” said Satyawan Samriwal, assistant divisional fire officer (ADFO), after a ground assessment.Samriwal further said that a sedan was recovered from the DLF Phase 1 underpass, after its driver had got stuck midway and had to abandon his car. He said the car driver managed to swim out before the underpass was completely inundated.The officer said that a total of 11 fire tenders were used in draining rainwater from the seven underpasses. “Drainage operations commenced around 11am. Seven fire tenders of ours and four from DLF fire services were used at different points of the city. Two each were deployed at Iffco Chowk and Rajiv Chowk. While the remaining were spread across the underpasses on Golf Course Road and Cyber City,” said Samriwal.The underpasses at Iffco Chowk and Rajiv Chowk on the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway had been closed last year too due to flooding during the monsoon. The closure of underpasses on Golf Course Road and Cyber City due to flooding, however, occurred for the first time this year, the officials said.According to officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), rainwater from MG Road and nearby under-construction HUDA City Centre underpass and flyover flooded the low-lying Iffco Chowk underpass, while at Rajiv Chowk, a drainage issue on CH Bakhtawar Singh Road resulted in the flooding of the underpass.“At both the underpasses, we installed four pumps each, to drain out rainwater along with the deployment of four fire tenders, two at each of the underpass. At the IFFCO Chowk underpass, there was additional rainwater from nearby construction at HUDA City Centre which was diverted towards it, as a result of which it got flooded. At the Rajiv Chowk, rainwater from nearby residential areas as well as the disadvantage of the underpass being located on a slope, led to flooding. After intensive clearing operations, the two underpasses were free of rainwater by the evening,” said a NHAI official.“Flooding was observed at MG road underpass, Medanta underpass and Hero Honda Chowk, all of which were tackled well in time by the NHAI, GMDA and MCG jointly, with assistance of local police. While the MG road underpass is already open for public use, at Medanta underpass rainwater was cleared by the evening. However, it likely to be functional by midnight as cleaning of mud is required,” said Ashok Sharma, project director of NHAI.In August, 2018, the Hero Honda Chowk underpass was closed for more than 50 hours after 50 million litres of rainwater had accumulated there. The problem is recurrent due to uncontrolled rain water hitting NH8 at these locations, said experts. Until some permanent arrangement is done by local agencies to control rain water from hitting NH8, it will continue. Officials from DLF, the caretaker of the underpasses on Golf Course Road and Cyber City, declined to comment on the matter.As per Samriwal, the underpasses in these two areas were flooded as the main HSVP drainage line flowed back.“In both these areas, the main drainage line through which the underpasses were connected, was either choked or filled to its maximum capacity. As a result, it flowed back and flooded the underpass. With no outlet for rainwater to get cleared, the volume of rainwater accumulation kept on increasing at the underpasses and eventually they were totally submerged,” said Samriwal.Sewa Ram, an urban transport systems design expert and a faculty member at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Delhi said that the drainage of underpasses in the city, needs a complete overhaul.“It is not the first time that underpasses have been flooded with rainwater in the city. It is obvious that an underpass is located in a low-lying area, hence it will remain vulnerable to waterlogging. The main reason why they get flooded is due to either poor linkage to the main drains or the master drain itself has a low capacity. The entire drainage system needs to be reworked and capacity increased or else this will remain a continuous problem,” said Sewa Ram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-seven-of-city-s-11-underpasses-drown-in-rainwater/story-d0b3zUB0ZRHd9KSf6DR64I.html
20-08-2020||City||Gurugram: From swimming to escaping floating cars, city residents brave rain aftermath||Gurugram: Amit Kumar, a resident of MG Road said he was going towards DLF 5 when his Hyundai i20 got stuck near the Mega Mall underpass on Golf Course Road. “It was raining heavily around 8.30am. I entered the underpass though it was waterlogged and thought I would quickly pass through. However, when I reached the middle of the underpass, I found my car submerged in water. The engine stopped and the brakes had stopped working. I feared that the automatic system might get stuck so I immediately rushed out of the car to save myself and had to swim to cross the stretch,” he said. His car was removed with the help of a tow-away vehicle and ropes but he had to send it to the workshop directly. Another resident of Sector 109 got stuck near Narsinghpur on Wednesday morning and he had to get down from his Toyota Fortuner to ensure he was not locked inside. “I was driving towards Manesar when my car began floating on the water. I feared that my car would get damaged as there was an open drain on my right side and it could fall into it. The water level kept rising and I barely managed to crawl out of the window to save myself. Some passersby helped me, ensuring somehow that the car remained afloat till help arrived,” said Vikram Yadav, a resident of Narsinghpur.More than 100 commuters were stranded with no cabs while autos and cycle rickshaws charged double the rate to cross even 50 metres on Wednesday as heavy rains submerged the city. Some commuters said they waited for two to three hours for transport before deciding to head back. Most of the inner and outer sector roads in the city were submerged in water.The waterlogging also hit public transport as people were not able to avail of services provided by app-based cab aggregators for at least three hours from 8.30am to 11.30am. High demand for cabs and auto-rickshaws meant that hundreds of people were stranded for long hours to start for office and were seen standing on roadsides. Sohna Road residents said waterlogging in the area had left them virtually ‘landlocked’, and that their basements and courtyards were completely flooded. “There was knee-deep water everywhere. It was virtually impossible to get out of the house. On certain roads, water was waist-high. Using vehicles was not an option at all. People used boats to come out of Tatvam Villas,” said Meenakshi Kapoor who was visiting a friend and came out in a boat fearing that she will be stuck there all day. “I started booking cabs at 9am, but none were available. There was a high demand and I managed to get one at 10am. I reached the office at 12.15pm. The cab aggregator charged Rs 600, though the fare usually remains between Rs 150 to 200,” said Vaibhav Kumar, a resident of DLF Phase 1. Roads leading to Cyber hub, Cyber City, Sohna Road, Udyog Vihar and Hero Honda Chowk were submerged as water showed no signs of receding. These sectors have a huge influx of employees as many IT firms, manufacturing units and corporate offices are based here. Fed up with the situation, frustrated commuters took to Twitter and social networking sites, criticising the authorities.Vehicles also moved at a snail’s pace at major entry and exit roads such as Gurugram-Jaipur Expressway, Sohna Road connecting Badshahpur and Kherki Daula. Traffic police and MCG officials brought in pumps to drain the submerged roads.The Gurugram traffic police also started issuing advisories on its official Twitter handle asking people to avoid congested routes. Sanjeev Balhara, assistant commissioner of police (traffic) said: “Due to water logging, traffic movement slowed down at various places such as the expressway, Signature Tower to Huda Metro Station, Golf Course Road, and Sohna Road. Police remained vigilant at these areas to ensure a jam doesn’t take place. In peak hours, it is a priority that vehicles don’t get stuck and we ensured that help was immediately provided as soon as vehicles were seen stuck,” he said. “The problem in Gurugram will continue till the monsoon ends. It shows the preparation level of the civic agencies. Water barely has any place to recede. Drains are not cleaned and have not been desilted properly before the onset of monsoon,” said Isha Tyagi, a resident of Ardee City, Sector 52. Dr Joyeeta, a resident of MG Road who has a clinic in Galleria market in DLF Phase 4, said she got stuck on Golf Course road at 9.50am and reached the clinic at 11.30, the stretch is hardly a 10 minutes drive but it was the longest ever.Urban Local Bodies Minister Anil Vij said: “I have asked the Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gurugram to send a report on why the water drainage measures failed today (Wednesday).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-from-swimming-to-escaping-floating-cars-city-residents-brave-rain-aftermath/story-5cAhmwmVDi3YheLzgCwNnK.html
20-08-2020||City||Gurugram: Woman found dead at her house, husband among three booked||htreporters@hindustantimes.comGurugram A 25-year-old woman was found dead at her house in the Sector 5 area on Tuesday morning. The police have booked the woman’s husband, brother-in-law and mother-in-law in the case after her mother alleged that she was subjected to continued harassment over dowry. The incident was reported around 10.30am by the victim’s brother, the police said, adding that the victim was found lying on the floor. The police said the victim’s mother alleged in the complaint that since her daughter’s marriage in December 2017, her in-laws had been harassing her for dowry. “We had given them an SUV at the time of the wedding. On several instances, her husband and her in-laws harassed her for dowry and put pressure on her to ask for more money. Her husband used to beat her up. On Monday night, my daughter told me over phone that her husband and his family were beating her. I told her that we would visit the next day and discuss the matter,” she said in the FIR. The police said that the victim’s family was informed by their in-laws that she had died by hanging. However, the victim’s mother said that when they reached her house, she was lying dead on the floor and her room had been ransacked. She alleged that her daughter was killed. A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “The cause of death would be established after the post-mortem report is received. The viscera samples have been sent to the forensic laboratory. We are verifying the allegations. The suspects are yet to be arrested.” A case was registered against the suspects under sections 304-B (dowry death), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and 498-A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) of Indian Penal Code at Sector 5 police station, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-woman-found-dead-at-her-house-husband-among-three-booked/story-3NpfJyO9bntbrU7CPsP5dK.html
20-08-2020||City||Gurugram: Over 4,000 cops deployed as rain grinds city to halt||Gurugram At least 4,250 police personnel were deployed at 32 vulnerable points in Gurugram to manage the water logging situation on Wednesday morning after night-long incessant rains. Gurugram police department said a team of police officials, deployed at the Integrated Command Centre set up by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) to monitor the CCTV feed, shared real-time data with police teams on the ground to ensure that vehicles and commuters stranded on waterlogged roads could be rescued and the traffic diverted. The police said they deployed 25 PCR vehicles, 30 individual riders, 20 towing vehicles, five earth moving machines and 150 police station vehicles at the affected stretches.According to Sanjeev Balhara, assistant commissioner of police (traffic), any major traffic congestion could be prevented as the volume of traffic was less as compared to previous years as not all offices are open, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, and those which are open are not working to full capacity but with only 50% staff. “More than 100 cars broke down at different stretches and at least nine vehicles had drowned, including at the Narsinghpur stretch and the Golf Course Road. We had also roped in a Civil defence team to control the affected areas,” he said. The police control room started receiving calls from 8.30am. Officers said they received 273 calls throughout the day regarding waterlogging, traffic congestion, diversion of roots and requesting tow away help.Gurugram has 5,800 police personnel and about 73% of them were engaged in attending to individual calls for help, shifting of broken-down vehicles and ensuring traffic movement despite the water on roads on Wednesday, said KK Rao, police commissioner, Gurugram. “Real-time information sharing between police personnel on the ground, in the police control room and Integrated Command Centre ensured proper coordination and helped in managing the situation in an effective manner,” he said. The police said communication was sent out to all senior officers and personnel living in police lines and other areas regarding their deployment early morning as soon as it became clear that heavy rain was on the anvil. “Calls were made to all the station house officers and they were asked to reach the most vulnerable spots identified in their jurisdiction and share the status of the situation through videos and pictures on WhatsApp. The senior officers were also on their toes until the situation was controlled,” Rao said. Around 2,500 personnel were sent to different spots, before it started raining heavily, to ensure traffic could be managed early on and the remaining 1,750 personnel were called after waterlogging started at all important junctions. More than 300 ropes were given to the officials deployed to pull broken and submerged vehicles out of which they used close to 250 ropes, the police said.The commisioner said he has granted class 1 certificates to the cops with a cash reward of Rs 5,000 each for exemplary duty during rainy day.Rao said they had prepared a monsoon deployment plan in advance and names of all officials to be deployed were finalised. “Preparations in advance helped the personnel on ground as they were ready for any situation,” he said.Many students missed their entrance exams on Wednesday morning and some of them were lucky as they were picked up and dropped by the traffic police. Sanjeev Balhara, assistant commissioner of police (Traffic), said they transported nearly 30 students to different examination centres. “Parents and their wards were in tears as they missed entrance examination. We tried our best and transported more than two dozen students but parents were stuck at different spots and couldn’t make it to the examination halls,” he said.The worst-hit identified spots in Gurugram where the police was deployed were Rajiv Chowk, Hero Honda Chowk, Iffco Chowk and major arterial roads including Cyber City, Shankar Chowk, Signature Towers, MG Road, Old Delhi Road, Ghata Chowk, Sector 15, Vatika chowk, Udyog Vihar, Palam Vihar, Narsinghpur, Sector 10, Sector 5, Bajghera Road, Golf Course extension road and Sector 69 to 71, which witnessed heavy waterlogging and traffic jams due to the deluge.Police also said they had analysed each trouble spot in advance and knew what was needed to deal with the traffic situation. In some areas, Rao said, they had realised that a higher number of personnel was needed to be deployed due to a high volume of traffic seen usually, such as Hero Honda Chowk, Rajiv Chowk, Shankar Chowk and Sirhaul. In other areas, like Sohna Road and Golf Course extension Road, the volume of vehicles was low but people had got stuck. Refreshments, tea and food was served at the spot, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-over-4-000-cops-deployed-as-rain-grinds-city-to-halt/story-73XkTHnhCRQu8yd0cuTFkI.html
20-08-2020||City||Gurugram: Rain affects second round of sero survey, 7 of 16 clusters covered on first day||Gurugram The second round of serological survey started in the district on Wednesday, with the collection of 90 samples. However, the health department could not conduct the survey as planned due to heavy rain and waterlogging across the city, officials said, adding that only seven areas out of the 16 identified clusters were covered.The survey in Gurugram is part of the statewide exercise that will test at least 21,000 people to detects IgG antibodies against coronavirus, which they might have developed without showing any symptoms like cough, cold and fever. In the district, 850 people are to be covered under the survey, which includes 500 residents from rural and 350 from urban areas. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said that the survey started after 1pm on Wednesday.“There are 16 teams comprising three members each -- one medical officer, a lab technician and a health care worker -- who were to visit different clusters for sample collection. Due to rain and waterlogging, only seven teams could move out to collect blood samples for IgG antibody testing. Four urban areas – Tigra, Patel Nagar, Khandsa and Basai – were covered. In the rural areas, samples were taken from Pataudi, Sherpur and Inchhapuri,” said Yadav.Serological survey detects IgG antibodies against Covid-19, which people might have developed without showing any classic symptoms of the virus like cough, cold and fever. It helps in gauging the extent of spread of and the actual burden of Covid-19 infection in the society. IgG antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 virus develops in the human body two weeks after the onset of the infection and it remains in the body for long time, indicating that the episode of the infection happened in the past.Out of the 16 identified clusters, only four are in urban areas. In the rural areas, the 12 clusters include Daulatabad, Badshahpur, Pataudi, Bajghera, Palra, Sherpur, Sarai, Aklimpur, Inchhapuri, Bhudka, Bhorakalan and Rathiwas. Going by the plan prepared by the state health department, each cluster in urban area will be divided into four quadrants comprising 11 households where 88 samples will be taken from each cluster. Likewise, rural area clusters are divided into four quadrants, with each quadrant comprising 22 households. 42 samples will be taken from each of the clusters. For this, 21 lab technicians have been trained who will take blood samples for antibody detection, the officials said.Gurugram had gone through first round of serological survey from June 24 till mid-July. At that time, 454 IgG antibody tests were done in July, out of which 56 were positive and 398 negative. Along with Gurugram, survey was conducted in Ambala, Faridabad, Panchkula and Sonepat, where at least 1,544 people were tested, of which 180 had antibodies while the remaining 1,364 were negative. To ascertain the overall spread of the infection across the state, the survey is being conducted in all 22 districts this time with a larger sample size.The Gurugram CMO said that the survey will be completed within a week’s time as the overall survey report of the state will be released by August-end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-rain-affects-second-round-of-sero-survey-7-of-16-clusters-covered-on-first-day/story-3zyQSXLbZc7ZXIeX8z7nTL.html
20-08-2020||City||Gurugram conducts over 100k tests per million population||Gurugram The Gurugram health department has conducted more than 100,000 Covid-19 tests per million population -- the highest in the state, as per the state health bulletin. At the state level, Haryana has conducted 34,000 tests per million residents till Wednesday, with a test positivity rate of 5.6%. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “ With a total of 1,42,466 samples tested so far for Sars-CoV-2 virus, the tests per million for Gurugram has reached 100,018. It is the highest in Haryana. We are probably the only district in the country to have conducted more than one lakh tests per million population. It shows how extensively people are being tested across the district to identify new cases and control the transmission in areas where multiple cases are being reported.”According to experts, higher number of tests per million is helpful in reducing the positivity rate and controlling the outbreak. Notably, India has conducted 23,002 tests per million people till Wednesday, as per national health bulletin.Gurugram’s tests per million is higher than Delhi’s 70,388. Currently, Gurugram’s test positivity rate is 6.95% while the daily growth rate of the cases is 0.98%. “Gurugram is conducting both rapid antigen tests and gold-standard RT-PCR testing in somewhat equal proportion to identify new cases and get an overall picture on the total positivity rate. Due to ‘test, track and treat’ strategy, the department has been able to locate areas where cases are being reported frequently, bringing down the test positivity rate to 6.95% from 18% reported in mid-June. If the positivity rate reduces to 5% as per the World Health Organisation standard, the testing numbers will be reduced from current 2,000 to 700-1,000 per day,” Yadav said. Meanwhile, Delhi’s current positivity rate is 6.8% while the total number of tests done (till Tuesday) stands at 1,337, 374, leading to 70,388 tests per million population, as per the national capital’s health bulletin. At the state level, Faridabad -- which has the highest number of coronavirus cases -- has done over 56,000 tests per million population, and the test positivity rate is as high as 10.9%. Similarly, Rohtak has also done over 56,000 tests per million, but its test positivity rate is low at 3.6%, as per the state data. “The tests per million indicate how widely Covid-19 tests are being made accessible to the masses. Scientifically, the tests per million comprise testing of samples collected from hospitals, containment zones and overall general population. The data on tests per million population is useful in monitoring the prevalence of infection if it gives details on these three aspects,” Dr Rajib Dasgupta, chairperson, Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health, Jawaharlal Nehru University, had told HT recently. The experts also said that tests per million has nothing to do with the overall population of any district or state. It continues to rise as the number of tests are being conducted. Its impact is seen if the positivity rate declines, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-conducts-over-100k-tests-per-million-population/story-5i7tye69ocbNHwoDl6xHrI.html
20-08-2020||Gurugram||Banker ‘killing’: Police add murder charge to FIR, scan CCTVs for clue||The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the death of a 38-year-old senior executive of a private bank, whose body was fished out from a water treatment plant in Delhi on August 7, has added murder charge to the FIR filed in the case. Police said the statement of the victim’s wife was recorded on Tuesday and based on that, section 302 (punishment for murder) of Indian Penal Code was added to the FIR lodged at Sector 50 police station. A police official, privy to the investigation, said, “In the statement, the victim’s wife has said that the family suspects that the man Dheeraj Ahlawat, 38, was kidnapped and then murdered. The family has not named any suspect. Based on her statement, the murder charge has been added to the FIR.” Police said they have also recorded statements of some of the victim’s friends, including a friend from the neighbourhood with whom the victim was taking a stroll before he went missing. “We have scanned footage from CCTVs in the areas where the victim was last seen around sector 39 and sector 46, but no clue has emerged so far,” said the official , adding that no evidence has emerged of the victim receiving any threats in the past. On Tuesday, the police had said that the victim’s last traced location was near Unitech Cyber Park in sector 39 at 8.02 pm on August 5 – roughly 17 minutes after he disappeared. Around the same time, both the mobile phones Dheeraj was carrying were turned off. Dheeraj, who worked in corporate banking, was last seen walking near a service lane around 7.45pm on August 5. His family said that he had gone for a stroll with a friend at 7pm. Around 7.30 pm, his wife had called him and he had told her over the phone that he was nearby and would return shortly. At 8.30pm, when his wife called him again, both his phones were found switched off. The family members had then contacted his friends and relatives and tried to locate him. On August 6, they filed a missing person’s complaint under Section 346 of Indian Penal Code at the Sector 50 police station. A day later, the victim’s body was found by a Delhi police team of K Katju police station from Haiderpur water treatment plant in Rohini. On August 12, a relative in Delhi police had informed his family regarding a dead body that was kept in a hospital in Rohini. The victim was identified through his undergarment and a rakhi, which had ‘veera’ written on it, tied by his sister two days before the incident. After the post-mortem examination in Delhi on August 13, the kidnapping charge was added to the FIR. An SIT was formed on Monday after the victim’s family had met the police commissioner and demanded a probe alleging that police had not carried out a proper investigation after they had initially approached them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/banker-killing-police-add-murder-charge-to-fir-scan-cctvs-for-clue/story-3dv6VVaiY7CI2jjP23Ae1N.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||Be clear, avoid calls during classes, BMC tells teachers||The education department of Mumbai’s governing civic body has issued a set of guidelines to teachers about online classes and asked them to speak clearly, avoid compound and complex sentences, answering calls in the middle of classes, and asking questions.Officials said the guidelines have been issued to improve the quality of teaching as schools are holding only online classes because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Teachers have been asked to stick to Maharashtra State Council for Educational Research and Training’s curriculum and state education department’s lesson plan. They have been asked to focus on the background of topics taught in the previous classes to ensure continuity in learning. “In the beginning, they should conduct mock classes and try to use interactive tools like PowerPoint, animation, video clips, etc., to make lessons more interesting. They should use proper intonation, exclamation, pauses, and interrogation while speaking,” said the guidelines of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)’s education department.The teachers are required to ensure there are no network issues or distractions while the classes are on. “Care should be taken to ensure that students are made to feel at ease,’’ the guidelines said.An official said online method is a new medium for teachers as well as the students and there are bound to be hiccups in the beginning. “However, care should be taken to ensure that learning happens as efficiently as it does in the offline mode...” said the official, who did not wish to be named.The new academic year in the state began on June 15. Officials said the government issued standard operating procedures for online classes earlier. The guidelines issued on Monday are for teachers to ensure a distraction-free and effective learning experience for students, they added.Rajesh Pandya, a teacher at Mumbai’s Fatimadevi High School, said teachers are under immense pressure as online classes are not as easy. “It is a difficult thing for teachers to get used to this transition. There are so many students and one cannot focus on everyone at the same time. ...there are distractions even from the students’ side which we have to get rid of. Teachers should thus be given some time to adapt rather than putting too many rules in place.”A principal from a BMC school said some guidelines were required to help teachers. “Online learning does not mean that it should be a one-way process. It is a good thing that the BMC is trying to make the process easy and student-friendly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/be-clear-avoid-calls-during-classes-bmc-tells-teachers/story-TTVusRh2kR1O2eWV3BeMfM.html
20-08-2020||City||District-level patient management system announced in Thane||With the number of cases decreasing in most parts of Thane district and increase in discharge rate, Thane district collector has announced a district-level patient management system to manage surplus hospital beds available across the district. This will ensure that a patient can get access to beds anywhere in the district depending on availability. Patients will have to call on a toll-free number — 1800 1205282 — to get a hospital bed nearest to their homes. If there are no beds available, bed in a nearby city will be made available to ensure none of the patients suffer due to lack of beds. Thane district has a total of 115,923 Covid-19 cases, of which around 19,541 are active while 3,400 deaths have been reported so far. District collector Rajesh Narvekar said, “Since March, when the first case in the district was detected, we have come a long way in containing the pandemic. Cases are decreasing; however, the district is far from being free of Covid-19. We have now launched a district-level patient management system. Patients can call on the toll free number after testing positive to get a bed near their home.” Narvekar added, “A message will be sent to the patients on their mobile phones as well as the hospital, confirming the bed allotment. The system will be applicable in Thane rural as well as municipal limits. In case, there are no beds available in the patient’s city and a neighbouring city has vacant beds, we will shift patient to that city. No local body can reject any patient from any of the cities in the district.” He claimed that such a system will ensure no patient dies or suffers due to lack of availability of beds in their area. “This will curb deaths due to unavailability of beds and also improve recovery rate due to timely treatment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/district-level-patient-management-system-announced-in-thane/story-9mwOlBYDA7u5YDfI6CCkQO.html

20-08-2020||Mumbai||Expect heavy rain on day 1 of Ganeshotsav||The city and suburbs could expect an increase in rain intensity between Thursday and Saturday as the weather bureau on Wednesday issued an alert for possible heavy rain across isolated areas on Thursday, Friday and Saturday (August 22) — first day of the 11-day Ganesh festival.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued an orange alert (heavy to very heavy rain) for Thane and Palghar for Saturday and yellow alert for remaining days up to Sunday. Raigad district is likely to witness maximum rain till Sunday with the possibility of extremely heavy rain across isolated areas. Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Pune and Satara, too, can expect heavy to very heavy rain, IMD’s forecast said. “With the formation of a low-pressure weather system over northwest Bay of Bengal, which is very likely to move westwards and develop into a depression over the next 24 hours, widespread rainfall is expected over Maharashtra, Goa, Gujarat from Thursday to the weekend,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy-director general, western region, IMD. “The possibility of heavy to very heavy rain is maximum between Friday and Saturday (with the arrival of Ganeshotsav). However, rain intensity is likely to reduce for the Mumbai region from Sunday onwards.”On Wednesday, the city and suburbs witnessed partly cloudy conditions with isolated spells of light rain. Between 8.30am and 5.30pm, the suburbs recorded 5mm rain, while 0.4mm was recorded in south Mumbai. Over 24 hours (8.30am on Tuesday and 8.30am on Wednesday), 11.5mm and 13mm rain was recorded in the suburbs and south Mumbai. The day and night temperatures were at the normal mark.Experts highlighted weather factors such as the offshore trough was going to intensify in response to the low-pressure system moving over central India. “This will increase the moisture amount over the Mumbai region, thereby resulting in an increased frequency of showers during 20-21 August. With mostly moderate rainfall, no severe weather threat is expected. Rainfall will substantially reduce after Saturday, and widespread heavy rain appears unlikely through the rest of August,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom.With 17% excess rain for the entire state between June 1 and August 19, only three districts — Akola, Amravati, and Gondia — all in Vidarbha have recorded deficient rain this monsoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/expect-heavy-rain-on-day-1-of-ganeshotsav/story-z1MTj7qXfB1VtMPxY12n1N.html
20-08-2020||City||Seven underpasses, homes, flooded as Gurugram witnesses its worst waterlogging since 2016||Gurugram: The best laid plans were taken and tossed into the drain on Wednesday as rain fell on Gurugram, the likes of which were seen last in 2016. The city received 118mm rain -- not unexpected for August -- in around six hours and made a mockery of the drainage system. Seven underpasses were drowned, people living in low-lying houses were forced out and most of the city’s major roads were flooded till late evening.For Gurugram residents, it evoked memories of the infamous “Gurujam” where commuters were stuck on roads for more than 20 hours in July 2016. In fact, Wednesday received almost double the rain than that fateful day, but this time a repeat was avoided thanks to authorities understanding local drainage issues and taking counter measures and the deployment of first responders -- police and fire personnel -- quickly.But the “great escape” was by a narrow margin.Three underpasses on the Golf Course Road at DLF Phase 1, Genpact Chowk, and Bristol Chowk, two in Cyber City next to Shankar Chowk and Cyberhub, two on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway at IFFCO Chowk and Rajiv Chowk were flooded and traffic police closed them off to the public.The only serious motor victim of the rain seemed to have been driver of a sedan who had to abandon his vehicle on the DLF Phase 1 underpass when water rose suddenly. A video of two persons swimming next to the car went viral over social media.“The underpasses on Raghavendra Marg have been in use for the last 3/4 years. Until today, we have never experienced water logging of this magnitude,” said a spokesperson for DLF, the caretaker of the underpasses on Golf Course Road and Cyber City. “The intensity of rainfall received this morning was 6-7 times higher than the designed capacity of the master drainage system of Gurugram. Of the seven underpasses on Raghavendra Marg, six are fully operational. The seventh, Arjun Marg underpass in DLF Phase I was severely impacted due to reverse discharge of rain water from the main drainage system. The DLF team along with government authorities are working tirelessly towards making it operational by tomorrow morning.”Satyawan Samriwal, assistant divisional fire officer (ADFO), said that 11 fire tenders, including four from DLF fire services, were used to drain water from the seven underpasses.As per fire department officials, rainwater from five out seven underpasses was cleared by 5 pm. “We had started drainage operations around 11am. The underpasses at IFFCO Chowk, Bristol Chowk, Cyberhub, Genpact Chowk were cleared by 4pm while the underpass at Rajiv Chowk was cleared by 5pm. The underpass at Bristol Chowk we are aiming to clear by 7pm. The underpass in DLF Phase 1, the level of rainwater is extremely high. More than 5 crore kilolitres of rainwater (enough to flood the Tau Devi Lal Cricket Stadium) is accumulated there, it may take us till tomorrow to clear it,” said Samriwal.DCP traffic Chander Mohan said that more than 4,000 police personnel were deployed across the city to manage traffic, 20 cranes were used to tow more than 50 vehicles that had broken down at different points of the city.Mohan said that the Narsinghpur-Hero Honda Chowk stretch on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway was the worst affected, as water rose to more than four feet there, which resulted in the carriageway carrying traffic from Delhi to Manesar slowing significantly.“The volume of vehicles overall was not high across the city as a result of which we were able to ensure vehicles did not stall at one point but kept on moving at a slow pace. Hence, there were no snarls as such. Besides the expressway, due to the closure of underpasses on Golf Course Road and one at IFFCO Chowk, vehicles had to be diverted via MG Road, due to which there was congestion at the stretch till around 2pm. In other areas, we did not experience much hindrance with regard to traffic movement,” said Mohan.In several condominiums and residential sectors situated in low-lying areas, such as Belvedere Park in Cyber City, Suncity on Golf Course Road, DLF Phase 1-2, sectors 27, and 28 there was knee-deep rainwater, which not only prevented residents from venturing outside but in some cases flooded ground-floor houses as well.“Around 11am, such was the extent of rainwater accumulation that the electrical panels were submerged causing the backup power to cut off. We had no electricity till 5 pm. Our vehicles were also submerged and some of them may have developed mechanical issues as well. We reported the issue to our developer following which two motor pumps were used to drain out rainwater. For a couple of hours, we simply couldn’t step outside and were virtually locked in our houses,” said Deepak Malhotra, a resident of Belvedere Park.“As we are situated next to the foothills of the Aravallis, we always remain vulnerable to waterlogging during monsoon. However, today, the extent was even worse as rainwater entered our homes as well. We placed our carpets, bed sheets, to fill the gap between the door and floor to ensure minimal amount of rainwater enter our houses but it was of little use. After three hours of continuing clearing, with help of buckets and mugs did rainwater finally recede,” said Divya Surekha, a resident of Suncity.MCG chief engineer Raman Sharma said that the level of rainwater at Najafgarh drain was extremely high, and, as a result, a large portion of Gurugram’s main drain-Badshahpur drain- flowed back on to the roads, leaving the city without any outlet to drain rainwater.“Overall more than 45 pumps were deployed across various points of the city to drain out rainwater. As per our estimates, the city received more than 130mm of rainfall today. The volume of rain was much higher than usual as a result of which there was severe waterlogging across the city. We initiated combating measures as soon as rains started and in most parts of the city, barring low-lying areas by 6 pm, rainwater was cleared. More than 150 GMDA and MCG officials are still on-ground and efforts are ongoing to for clearing rainwater from remaining areas by midnight,” said Sharma.Heavy waterlogging is a common occurrence across the city during the monsoon season. VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO) of Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) said that deployment of motor pumps was only a relief measure and until the city’s drainage system is augmented.“Due to the heavy rain, the city was severely waterlogged. Motor pumps are only relief measures. Increasing deployment of them is not a solution but simply a damage-control measure. The GMDA has done a comprehensive study on the city’s drainage system, we had some measures we wanted to introduce to augment the city’s existing drainage capacity but could not do so due to officials being engaged with Covid-19 counter measures. Until we augment the city’s drain capacity, waterlogging will continue to be a hindrance,” said Kundu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/seven-underpasses-homes-flooded-as-gurugram-witnesses-its-worst-waterlogging-since-2016/story-rnHKjkZk1mzekYwQIyNIbJ.html
20-08-2020||City||NMMC conducts 59K antigen test in a month||The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has conducted more than 59,000 rapid antigen tests for Covid-19 in the past one month. The civic authority started conducting rapid antigen tests from July 16 under its mission Break the Chain and has set up 22 testing centres since. In addition, 34 mobile antigen testing vans and six public awareness vehicles have been deployed to go to housing societies in different parts of the city under Mission Zero Navi Mumbai. Municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar said, “In a month (till August 16), we have managed to conduct 51,323 antigen tests, of which 6,629 came positive. The testing number has increased further to 59791 on August 18. Since August 10, we have covered 69 housing societies and tested 6,999 people. Of them, 325 have tested positive.” Under this initiative, residents who test negative but show symptoms of Covid-19 have to mandatorily undergo RT-PCR test, which gives the result in 24 hours. NMMC has also increased the number of RT-PCR test with the state-of-the-art testing lab in Nerul which can conduct 1,000 tests a day. Bangar said, “Since the start of our lab earlier this month, 3,257 RT-PCR tests have been conducted there, of which 865 came positive. We are targeting high-risk contacts of positive patients, senior citizens and those with comorbidities. Until their test results come, they are kept in isolation. The increased testing is certainly helping us in early identification, isolation and treatment; thereby bringing down fatalities. We appeal to residents to continue to cooperate with us to ensure Navi Mumbai is free of the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nmmc-conducts-59k-antigen-test-in-a-month/story-7r9NEuvm4ujJ20qqy5Xn0K.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||BMC slashes water cut from 20% to 10 %||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) announced on Wednesday that the existing water cut of 20 % will be reduced to 10% from Friday.The stock in all seven lakes that supply drinking water to Mumbai can last the city for nearly 328 days, considering a daily water supply of 375 trillion litres, officials said. The total water stock in catchment areas has reached 85% with three of the seven lakes filled to the brim.The current water stock is less than that of last year (94.28%) and 91.83% in 2018 during the same time. The decision to completely remove the water cut was yet to be taken as BMC said they would wait till all lakes are full. A senior civic official said, “The catchment areas have received heavy rainfall for the past two-three weeks. We still cannot revoke the water cut as the total water stock is yet to reach its full capacity. Previously, there has been instances where it did not rain post mid-August, which led to a water shortage. We cannot rely on the same and we will have to wait till the water stock is full.” BMC had announced a water cut from August 5, owing to low rainfall in catchment areas. The total water quantum in the seven lakes went up to 1,232 billion litres. The total storage capacity of these lakes is 1,447 billion litres. The water stock in Upper Vaitarna is 69.83%, Middle Vaitarna is 91.71%, Tansa is 92.18% and Bhatsa is at 83.38%. The seven lakes are bifurcated into two systems: the Vaitarna system, which supplies to the western suburbs and the island city; the Bhatsa system, which supplies to the eastern suburbs. The lakes are situated in Mumbai, Thane and Palghar districts. While Bhatsa makes up for 50% of the water supply to the city, Middle Vaitarna, Upper Vaitarna, and Modak Sagar together make up for 37% of the water supply, Tansa makes up for 10%, Vihar makes up 2% and Tulsi makes up 1%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-slashes-water-cut-from-20-to-10/story-DzlXKk27xV0A6n1jlNxR5H.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||Record rise of 13,165 cases as Maha surge likely till mid-Sept||Maharashtra on Wednesday recorded its highest single-day jump in Covid-19 infections with 13,165 new cases, taking its tally to 628,642, even as officials expect the daily caseload record to be broken multiple times owing to increased testing, at least till mid-September. The state also breached the 21,000 mark in fatalities with 346 deaths reported, taking the toll to 21,033. Active cases in the state have climbed to 160,413.The previous highest single-day spike recorded in the state was on August 8 with 12,822 cases. Of the deaths reported on Wednesday, 249 were from the previous 48 hours and 59 were from last week. The remaining 38 deaths were from the period before last week. The recovery rate of the state improved to 71.09%, with 9,011 people discharged on Wednesday. So far, 446,881 have recovered in the state.Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 1,132 new infections, taking the city’s tally to 131,542. Mumbai reported 46 fatalities, taking its death toll to 7,268. Besides Mumbai, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) reported 2,318 new cases and 63 fatalities. Senior state government officials said the rate of infection was still high in MMR.An official said the situation in municipal corporations in the MMR needed to come under control as a chunk of population from these areas travel to Mumbai for work and other economic activities. “Mumbai is showing signs of stabilising with a weekly growth rate under 1%. If the movement of people from these areas increases to Mumbai, then cases can go up in the city. The state had not recommended restarting the suburban railway service as cases were high in the MMR,” he said, requesting anonymity. The state government on Wednesday allowed resumption of inter-district bus service of the state transport corporation from Thursday. People wishing to travel between districts in their private vehicles will, however, have to take permission or get an e-Pass.Maharashtra chief secretary Sanjay Kumar issued an order announcing that inter-district plying of only Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) will be allowed under the sixth phase of Mission Begin Again. “No permission/approval/ e-pass will be required for the buses and passengers travelling in the buses of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation,” the order stated.State transport minister Anil Parab said that the demand for ST buses was increasing and therefore the government took the decision to provide this relaxation. With the Ganeshotsav commencing on Saturday (August 22), several people travelling to their native town or villages will benefit from this relaxation. “We had kept the buses prepared. Looking at the demand of the people, we are starting the ST service. The guidelines for travel will, however, remain the same. Physical distancing will have to be maintained. Only 22 passengers will be allowed to travel on a bus to avoid close contact among the passengers,” he said. The minister added that there has been no revision in the ST bus fares.Maharashtra, meanwhile, is expected to see highs in the daily caseload with an increased number of tests, state health department officials said. As per the data of the health department, 73,464 samples were tested on Wednesday and the state had a positivity rate of 17.92%. On Tuesday, 58,136 samples were tested and 11,119 were found positive and had a positivity rate of 19.12%. The overall positivity rate of the state stood at 18.83%.“Generally on weekends, the number of samples tested is lower, therefore, the numbers tend to show a decline on Monday and Tuesdays. The number of cases increases around mid-week, but correspondingly the tests, too, has gone up. Largely, the cases that are added daily are asymptomatic. Besides that, districts have been directed to ramp up beds with oxygen supply considering cases have spiked in tier-two cities and rural areas.” the health department official said. The department said that Covid-19 infections will see a downward trend after mid-September in the state.Maharashtra’s case fatality rate (CFR) continued to be a cause of concern for the state government. So far, in August alone the state has reported 6,039 deaths. The CFR in the state stood at 3.35%, much higher than the national rate of 1.91%. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has already directed the state administration to control the number of fatalities with interventions. In a Covid review meeting held on Tuesday, Thackeray asked district health officials to engage with the State level Covid task force.On Wednesday, Pune district, which consists of Pune rural, Pune city and Pimpri-Chinchwad, reported 2688 new cases. Pune city reported 1,233 cases and 38 fatalities, while Pimpri-Chinchwad saw 795 cases and 27 deaths. The rural area of the district reported 660 cases and 21 fatalities. Pune district is the worst-affected district in the state with 1,37,601 confirmed cases so far. Of the total cases, 40,665 are active in the district.Rural and semi-urban areas of the state are reporting a high number of cases in the last month. Nagpur city, the state’s second capital, reported 817 new infections, taking the city’s tally to 11,395. It also reported 23 fatalities. Nagpur rural reported 180 new cases and three fatalities. Nashik rural and Nashik city reported 231 and 520 new infections, respectively.Ahmednagar district saw 603 new infections. While Jalgaon rural saw 496 new cases and Jalgaon city reported 109 new cases. Solapur rural reported 399 new cases and 15 fatalities, while Kolhapur rural saw 387 new cases and 13 fatalities. Sangli district recorded 319 new infections, while Aurangabad district reported 546 fresh cases. Osmanabad and Beed reported 306 and 263 new cases respectively, taking their respective tallies over 4,000 and 3,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/record-rise-of-13-165-cases-as-maha-surge-likely-till-mid-sept/story-r54izJieeH9z9iAZndc2gM.html
20-08-2020||Delhi||Heavy rain pours misery on commuters, triggers a wall collapse, but Minto bridge stands tall||Delhi woke up to heavy rain on Wednesday morning that led to waterlogged roads and major snarls in several parts of the city. It also triggered a school wall collapse damaging several cars, but surprisingly, decades-old Minto Bridge fared better this time with hardly any water-logging. While the showers that continued till late evening came as a respite to residents from the muggy weather -- the city’s maximum temperature fell to 27.7 degrees Celsius, six degrees below normal -- it spelt bad news for office goers, who were caught in jams on waterlogged roads. Delhi traffic police officers said jams were reported from Dwarka Link Road, Barapullah, Rao Tula Ram Marg, Moti Bagh intersection, South Extension (Ring Road), Ashram intersection, Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway, Noida Link Road and Vikas Marg. Traffic crawled at a snail’s pace near Dhaula Kuan towards Gyarah Murti, Surajmal Marg, Bhairon Marg, near Sultanpur Metro station on MB Road, near Munirka Metro station, Sanjay T-point towards Rao Tula Ram Marg, Civil Lines police station towards Mall Road, Mathura Road, Chandgiram Akhara Road, Rani Jhansi Road and Mayur Vihar phase-2 underpass. Traffic from Vasant Kunj to the airport was diverted towards Mahipalpur Chowk because of knee-deep water on the stretch. Vehicles were also diverted away from Pul Prahladpur underpass that got inundated. “Portions of roads were under water, slowing down traffic on arterial stretches. Our personnel were stationed to direct traffic, but in many areas, the situation was quite bad,” said a senior Delhi traffic police officer, requesting anonymity. Even residential colonies of Krishna Nagar, parts of Amar Colony, Model Town, Prem Nagar in Kirari, Sant Nagar and Laxmi Vihar in Burari, and Rajiv Nagar in Begampur, among others, were inundated. “It doesn’t look like we are living in the national capital. Every year, we suffer the pain of water-logging. It’s been raining since morning and the colony streets are under water, because of choked drains and sewer lines,” said BS Vohra, a resident of Krishna Nagar and the president East Delhi RWAs Joint Front. According to the Delhi traffic police, civic bodies and road owning agencies, water-logging was reported from over 45 locations in the city. The public works department (PWD) maintained that adequate arrangements were in place to drain the accumulated water. “Temporary pumps have been installed at waterlogged streets to clear roads. Our staff are in the field to constantly monitor and immediately address the water-logging issues,” a senior PWD official said. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) data shows that till 5.30 pm, Safdarjung observatory, which is taken as representative of the city, recorded 32mm of rain, Palam observatory 49.4mm rain and Lodi Road 25.1mm rain. Aya Nagar received 66.1mm rain while Ridge recorded 42.7mm rain. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the axis of the monsoon will remain close to Delhi-NCR till Thursday. He said south-westerly winds from the Arabian Sea and south-easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal were also adding to moisture in this region, which was causing the downpour. “We will continue to receive spells of heavy rain till Thursday,” he said. At least seven parked cars were damaged after a portion of the boundary wall of Apeejay School in Saket’s Block J collapsed in the rain, said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur. Nobody was hurt, he added.Delhi Fire Services officials said it received a call at 11.46am and dispatched two rescue teams. “The debris removal operation is on,” a fire officer said.Residents lodged a police complaint and demanded that school authorities compensate them for the damages. Meanwhile, Minto Bridge near Connaught Place, a rail underpass known for going under water every time it rains, saw no water-logging on Wednesday, largely due to prompt response from the authorities.On July 19 this year, a heavy spell of rain had inundated the underpass; a bus was submerged and a 56-year-old driver of a mini-truck had drowned. After the incident, the PWD and the Delhi traffic police took a number of measures, including installing a monitoring system, additional pumps and imposing restrictions on traffic flow, all of which seems to have paid off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/heavy-rain-pours-misery-on-commuters-triggers-a-wall-collapse-but-minto-bridge-stands-tall/story-v1xAxCzK6fl77kCZ9I8iaP.html
20-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai diamond trader duped of ₹1.29 lakh in commonplace KYC update fraud||A diamond trader (63) from south Mumbai lost ₹129,428 lakh after a fraudster posing as a bank employee duped him.The incident, which had occurred in end-July, used the familiar modus operandi of conning the diamond trader in the guise of updating the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) details of his e-wallet account.The complainant, Amit Navindchandra Zaveri, a resident of Babulnath in south Mumbai, had received a message on his mobile phone on July 27, asking him to update the KYC details of his e-wallet account.The message also included a mobile phone number that he could contact for further details.Zaveri called on the mobile number, which was mentioned in the message, at around 10.30am on July 27.A man, who claimed to be the representative of the e-wallet company, answered the phone.The man discouraged Zaveri from visiting the e-wallet’s office to update his KYC details and insisted that he could it online because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.Soon, the cyber fraudster sent a link to Zaveri and asked him to fill his credit card details.Later, he asked Zaveri to open the e-wallet account from his mobile phone and punch in any number between one and nine.Zaveri followed the process, while the fraudster made five transactions from his credit card and withdrew ₹34,131, ₹25,099, ₹40,099, ₹25,099, and ₹5,000 within a few seconds.An alert bank employee, who noticed the five suspicious transactions from Zaveri’s credit card, contacted the diamond trader and asked him about the transactions.Zaveri denied making any transaction.This led the bank employee to block Zaveri’s credit card, said an official from Gamdevi police station.Zaveri received the details of the bank transactions of ₹1,29,428 lakh a week later.He filed a complaint with Gamdevi police station after the bank authorities were unwilling to redress his grievances about the fraudulent transactions.A case under section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and also under relevant sections of the Information Technology Act, 2000, has been filed at the police station.The police are probing into the commonplace fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-diamond-trader-duped-of-1-29-lakh-in-commonplace-kyc-update-fraud/story-LbhtelIxINHcLlzp6EgB0I.html

However, according to her, the police had been thwarting her efforts to try and get an FIR registered . She had contended that she and her family were getting regular threats to withdraw their complaints.Earlier on July 17, Justice Vibhu Bakhru had directed the DCP to ascertain the threat perception to Shanno and her family and provide them security, if warranted, after she had moved the court seeking protection. In her previous plea, Shanno had alleged that while her husband was stopped at ISBT and his phone snatched. She had also stated that her son and grandson were hit by a car when they were on a motorcycle in which the child was seriously injured.On Wednesday, appearing for the petitioners, advocate Mehmood Pracha told the court that Shanno and other women of the locality had lodged a complaint on August 6 against the nuisance created by the mob . On August 8, she along with the other complainants was called to the police station to collect the copy of the FIR.However, when she went there, the SHO referred to her first complaint (filed in May) and asked her to withdraw the names of the BJP leaders and police officials and instead give the complaint against anonymous persons, the plea said.

20-08-2020||Mumbai||IIT-B students’ virtual avatars will get degrees at convocation||Students graduating from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) will not be physically present for their convocation this Sunday, but their virtual avatars will walk up the stage and receive degrees. The institute has created a virtual reality platform for students to experience their convocation ceremony from the comfort of their homes. Around 2,100 students who are graduating can access their three-dimensional virtual avatars via an application on their smart devices. From Saturday, students can use the application to take a virtual tour of the campus and hang out with friends at their favourite joints. Once downloaded, the application does not require internet connectivity to run.“At the designated time of the convocation ceremony (1.30pm to 3.30pm), the application will work enabling synchronised viewing. We did not want students to miss out on any of the aspects of the convocation function,” said Subhasis Chaudhuri, director of the institute. On August 13, HT had reported that several IITs were planning to hold virtual or online convocation ceremonies this year in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, IIT-Bombay claimed that such virtual reality convocation is likely the first in the world.The entire campus has been replicated in virtual reality, enabling students to interact with each other as well as faculty members. “The departments, hostels and popular meeting points for students have been created virtually so that students can engage and experience the convocation as they would have physically,” said P Sunthar, co-convenor of the Convocation Committee. Duncan Haldane, Nobel Laureate for Physics in 2016 and professor of Physics at Princeton University, is the chief guest of the ceremony while Stephen Schwarzman, chairperson, chief executive officer and co-founder of Blackstone, will deliver the commencement speech. Their address will be aired through video and they will present awards to students in their virtual avatars alongside the director’s avatar.The award of degrees will be followed by a synchronised oath-taking — the traditional convocation pledge where the graduates swear to be honest in their discharge of duties as professionals. The entire ceremony will be telecast on the institute’s YouTube and Facebook channels as well as Doordarshan Sahyadri.Most students are excited by the prospect. Charit Verma, a civil engineering graduate, said while the virtual convocation is a welcome move, his parents are disappointed that they will not have the opportunity to visit the institute. It took the effort of 20 experts, most of them from the IDC School of Design, to plan, design and create this platform and mobile application. “It took more than 5,000 person hours to build the whole thing,” added Sunthar.“The convocation ceremony is the highlight of a student’s life at IIT-Bombay. We didn’t want to deprive them and their families of the sense of achievement and pride of graduating from India’s premier engineering institute. The virtual convocation is a way of showing how we do things at the institute,” said S Sudarshan, deputy director, academic and infrastructural affairs. Once the ceremony is over, the application will remain as a souvenir for students to cherish their convocation memories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-b-students-virtual-avatars-will-get-degrees-at-convocation/story-pcws8bBlSzcqd0tG7zy0kN.html

Nobody was hurt, he added.Delhi Fire Services officials said the fire control room received a call at 11.46am and dispatched two rescue teams. “The debris removal operation is on,” said a fire officer from the control room.Residents of the area lodged a police complaint and demanded that school authorities compensate them for the damage. Pawan Soni, president Saket J-block RWA, said the wall collapsed around 6.30am, burying nearly eight cars. He said it was a 12-feet-high wall with concertina wire fixed on the top.“The wall, grilles and wires fell onto cars parked near the wall. It was not well constructed, as it had no pillars or foundation. The other sides of the school’s walls are also weak. It is a case of negligence on part of the school administration, and have registered a complaint with the police against them. We want them to compensate those whose cars have been severely damaged,” Soni alleged. He added that the South civic body should take cognisance of the incident and serve a notice to the school authorities.A video of the cars buried in the debris was circulated widely on social media by residents of the area. “Due to extremely heavy rains across the city a small part of our boundary wall broke down in an area where vehicles are not meant to be parked. There are no injuries. We regret since school is in Covid-19 mode and therefore an immediate response was not possible. We are working with authorities to rebuild the wall. Our focus is first to remove debris and ensure the safety of everyone there. We are working with all stakeholders involved to arrive at the best possible solution,” the school said in a statement released Wednesday evening.According to civic officials, at least 13 incidents of wall or building collapse were reported till the evening, however, no casualty was reported. Some of the areas where portions of building collapsed include Chirag Dilli, Shahdara, Tahirpur, Gandhi Nagar, Todapur, Moti Nagar, Ashok Vihar, Nangloi Extension among others. Incidents of tree felling due to rain were reported from at least 12 locations across the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cars-crushed-after-school-wall-collapses-in-saket-owners-demand-compensation/story-h2Rk8uwiTiUrQuYPTxHaSI.html
20-08-2020||City||Minto Bridge spared of water logging||New DelhiMinto Bridge near Connaught Place -- a rail underpass known for going under water almost every rainy season -- was spared of water logging after Wednesday’s heavy monsoon showers, largely due to prompt response from the authorities.On July 19 this year, a heavy spell of rain had inundated the underpass, where a Delhi Transport Corporation bus submerged and a 56-year-old driver of a mini-truck drowned. After the incident, the public works department (PWD) and the Delhi traffic police took a number of measures, including installing a monitoring system, additional pumps and imposing restrictions on traffic flow, to avoid a repeat.The PWD, which manages the road, had set up a monitoring system comprising CCTVs to keep a check on the water level.A senior PWD official privy to the development said CCTVs had been installed at Minto Bridge last month. One of these cameras monitor levels of water in the underpass while the other one was fixed in the pump room to keep a check on the staff and the pump panel. “There are around 12 permanent water pumps at Minto Bridge. At least two pump operators remain present all the time. Water sensors along with alarms are installed in the sump (underground water reservoir). The alarm goes off as soon as the water reaches a danger level. The pump operator then starts pumping out water and clears the road. If required, we deploy temporary pumps to drain out the water. This is how we stopped accumulation of water in the underpass on the last couple of occasions after the July 19 incident,” the PWD official said.He said the traffic police work in close coordination with PWD authorities and close the stretch for vehicular movement as soon as water starts to accumulate in the underpass. “We now have a provision of registering FIR against those who deliberately try to manoeuvre through the water-logged Minto Bridge even when it is closed for traffic,” the official added.Traffic officials said Minto Bridge had been a priority stretch for them, especially after a 56-year-old man drowned under this bridge during last month’s water logging.“On two previous occasions too, when Delhi received similar spells of rainfall, we had closed the stretch and immediately drained out the water with the help of the civic agencies. We managed it before the situation got worse. In the morning, we did see some water logging under the bridge but it was immediately cleared,” a senior traffic police official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/minto-bridge-spared-of-water-logging/story-V64FsYb2GYQ5C1Jq4IS0UJ.html
20-08-2020||Delhi||Evaluation of DU’s online exams a challenge for teachers as time runs out||As Delhi University heads towards wrapping up its first online open-book examination (OBE) for final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students of regular and non-collegiate courses, teachers are now worried about the evaluation process ahead of them.In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the central university – as a one-time measure—introduced the online OBE exams amid much resistance from students and teachers. The exams started on August 10 and will continue till August 31 for around 260,000 students.According to the guidelines, students can either upload their answer sheets on the website or email it to the varsity in the wake of technical glitches. Former academic council member Pankaj Garg, who teaches Mathematics at Rajdhani College, said, “If there are over 2.4 lakh examinees and each of them upload around four pages on the portal, there will be at least 10 lakh answer sheets to sort and compile. Students have four subjects on an average, which will only increase the number of answer sheets. Some students have both uploaded the answer sheets on the website and emailed it to the university as well as their colleges, leading to further increase in the number,” he said.Garg, and several other teachers HT spoke to, said this will create problems for teachers who are not used to conducting a digital evaluation. Many pointed out that not all students have high-end smartphones, which may result in unclear answer scripts.Sanam Khanna, who teaches English at Kamala Nehru College, said moderation can be a factor due to online evaluation of answer scripts. “Teachers rue the fact that there is no clarity even now on the exact modalities of assessment. Generally, we went to the common evaluation centres where a robust moderation was in place, especially for humanities courses where marks can be subjective. Teachers discussed the questions and answers among themselves and moderate marks accordingly. But this time, we don’t know how it will happen.”She said teachers won’t be able to check for the academic quality of the answers since there were no time-tested mechanisms in place. “An open-book exam for which students don’t have to cite sources runs the risk of compromising academic quality. There may be plagiarism as well but where are the checks and balances?” Khanna asked.Another cause of worry is that this time around, teaching for third and fifth semesters for UG courses will overlap with evaluation unlike other times. “Most of the teachers are involved in online teaching. So in addition to reading e-resources and taking online classes, they will also be expected to evaluate papers digitally – something teachers were not prepared for. Many don’t even have the necessary devices. The university should take some measures to print the answer sheets uploaded on the portal and send it to the teachers to offer some respite,” said Garg.The Delhi University Computer Centre (DUCC), the central IT institution of the varsity, is in the process of compiling the answer sheets. “We have a team that is working on this to ensure the same answer scripts are not repeated. A system is being set up where we will filter roll numbers that students mentioned in the e-mail submission and match it with the data uploaded on the website,” said Sanjeev Singh, joint director at DUCC. The university’s Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani said it is likely that the evaluators will start receiving the answer sheets by next week.The Delhi High Court directive on Tuesday, asking for expediting the results of final-year students to ensure that their higher education prospects are not affected, necessitated the need for a quicker evaluation process.“While the evaluation process won’t be affected by the offline exams [slated to be conducted from September 14] because different sets of teachers will go for invigilation and evaluation, declaring the results is still a challenge because we have to expedite the process and do it as soon as possible to ensure students don’t suffer,” Pani said.Offline exams only for those who were unable to appear for their papersWhile the Delhi High Court on Monday asked the varsity to conduct offline exams for students who could not appear for their papers beginning September 14, students are confused over the eligibility criteria.“There is a confusion among students whether they are allowed to appear for offline exams for improving their marks. If so, the results of their online exams should be declared before offline exams start,” said Garg. “Else, the university must provide them with details of how many answer scripts were received by them so that the students can take a call on appearing for the offline exams.”DU Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani, however, clarified that only physically challenged students or those who were unable to appear for their OBE papers will be allowed to sit for the offline exams. Asked about students who may not have appeared for all OBE papers, Pani said, “We will look at it on a case-to-case basis and consider accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/evaluation-of-du-s-online-exams-a-challenge-for-teachers-as-time-runs-out/story-dgjcXHjHt6jNPM2bsoNWCP.html

These deaths also included a two-month-old infant who died at the Sushila Tiwari Government Hospital in Haldwani due to ‘Acute Respiratory Illness, Pneumonia, Septicemia, DIC, Intra Cranial Hemorrhage, Upper GI Bleed, Pulmonary Bleed, Shock, Respiratory Failure.’ A total of 178 patients have died in Uttarakhand so far with 40 dying due to the virus and rest due to co-morbidities and other causes, according to health officials. Out of the total cases, 9,132 people have recovered successfully, bringing the state’s recovery rate to 69.05%. According to the bulletin released by the state health department on Wednesday evening, maximum fresh cases were reported from Dehradun district (118), followed by Nainital (60), Haridwar (39), Chamoli (19), Pauri (13), US Nagar (7), three cases each from Tehri and Champawat and one case each was reported from Rudraprayag and Uttarkashi districts. Haridwar district has reported the maximum cases in total (3,206) followed by Dehradun (2,655), US Nagar (2,394) and Nainital (1,942). Also, 408 Covid-19 patients were discharged from different hospitals in the state on Wednesday with maximum being (175) from the US Nagar district. The rate of doubling of cases based on last seven days now stands at 31.11%, while the infection rate is at 5.12%. Over 2.79 lakh samples have been tested for Covid-19 in the state of which results of over 15,000 are awaited. Uttarakhand currently has 390 containment zones in eight districts including 333 in Haridwar district. To effectively fight the pandemic, the state government has operationalised 17 dedicated Covid Hospitals and 381 Covid Care Centres (CCC) across the state. It has also started home isolation of asymptomatic Covid-19 patients recently. Meanwhile, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat interacted with doctors engaged in the treatment of coronavirus patients on Wednesday via video conferencing. “The way you all (doctors) are treating Covid-19 patients in the midst of difficult situations; it can be only be called a great penance. Physicians are performing their duties with patience and readiness. With the help of doctors, we are confident that we will definitely win our fight against Covid-19,” Rawat said. The chief minister also learnt about the status of patients, the availability of ventilators, ICUs, oxygen beds and other equipment needed to treat patients. He said that all possible efforts are being made by the government to control Covid-19. While speaking to the patients of Covid-19 admitted to hospitals, Rawat inquired about facilities of treatment, stay and food..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-logs-highest-single-day-jump-of-covid-fatalities-state-tally-over-13-000/story-NpjvYGsMe08elnohhBgdjL.html
20-08-2020||Delhi||Traders with weekly markets in Delhi upbeat, gyms weighed down||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA) decision on Wednesday to allow weekly bazaars to open but leave out gyms brought cheer to thousands of traders and individuals associated with these markets but left gym owners disappointed.The DDMA – chaired by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal – on Wednesday approved the Delhi government’s decision to let weekly markets in the city operate on an experimental basis but prohibited gyms from reopening. The central government, though, had allowed gyms to reopen in its latest guidelines on scaling down of lockdown restrictions that were imposed to arrest the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The weekly markets are managed by committees and, by now, most of them have drafted rules on how they would ensure safety from potential transmission of the virus. “Shops would maintain at least 1 metre distance from one another, customers will have to maintain distance too from the shops and among themselves. There will be provision for hand wash and all traders have been asked to wear masks, gloves and have sand sanitisers with them,” said Vinod Kumar, secretary of a weekly market committee in Narela.Sanjay Kumar, president of a weekly market at the Yamuna embankment in Geeta Colony, pointed at the challenges ahead. “We shall often have to ask customers to avoid touching the products to ensure safety. But it will be a big challenge because such markets are often visited by families and groups, and it is difficult to monitor who is touching what at which point amid constant haggling. But it has to be done because it is a question of livelihood.” Delhi has around 2,700 locations that host weekly markets by small-scale traders – dealing in literally anything ranging from garments, footwear, utensils, books, toys and everyday kitchen essentials. These markets cater to millions, especially those living in low-income group localities, and provide employment to more than 400,000 people in different roles – from traders to small-time transporters and labourers. The reopening move comes as a huge relief for them, said Brijesh Goyal, president of the Delhi-based Chamber of Trade and Industry.Letting weekly markets on an experimental basis means officials and the police would keep a close eye on whether social distancing norms are followed and submit assessment reports on which the government may revise its call. Delhi has around 5,500 gyms that employ around 100,000 people, ranging from trainers to housekeeping staff. The industry is in a terrible shape and thousands have lost jobs. The central government has allowed gyms to open. So, why should a few state governments restrict them?” asked vice-president of the Delhi Gyms Association.“Gyms have safety protocols in place. They have been asked to ensure time shifts and pre-booking of slots for their clients, distance between equipment and regular sanitisation of every equipment after use by one client and the indoor areas in general, among other things suggested by the central government. They are operating in other states from August 5 and, so far, we have not come across any complaints. It should be allowed in Delhi too,” said Vinay Sangwan, co-owner of a gymnasium chain under the brand Anytime Fitness.Twenty-eight centres of Sangwan’s fitness chain in Delhi are closed but 12 branches are open in NCR cities such as Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram and Faridabad in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/traders-with-weekly-markets-happy-but-gym-owners-disappointed/story-dopbMe7YuwMV3m8RRb8XHM.html

The complainant, Harminder Singh of Badhmajra, Mohali, whose wife is a constable with Chandigarh police, had initially told the police that a masked man had snatched the car from him at gunpoint outside Burger King, Sector 35, but police say he has been continuously changing statements. It now turns out that it was his female friend who had been threatened by the robber.Police have recorded the statement of the female friend, who is said to be associated with the Punjabi music industry. In her statement, the woman said, “I was sitting in the SUV, waiting for my friend to return when a man came, sat in the driver’s seat and asked me to get out. He had a pistol in his hand,” she said.A case under Section 392 (robbery) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered following her statement. POLICE SCAN CCTVs IN AREA Meanwhile, cops are scanning closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in the area to gather more clues but they have so far not got any leads on the identity of the accused.

20-08-2020||Noida||Huge fire at power substation in Noida’s Sector 148, none hurt||A massive fire broke out at a power substation in Safipur village in Noida’s Sector 148 on Wednesday around 8am. According to fire officers, the blaze originated through a transformer and spread to another transformer and both went up in flames. Due to oil and inflammable materials there, the fire spread swiftly and thick black smoke could be seen from far away in the skyline. Harinder Bhati, a resident of Greater Noida Sector Beta 1, said he was feeding his cows when he heard about the fire incident. “I reached the sub-station and saw the fire had spread massively. It was also raining but it could not dampen the fire. Later, the power department informed the firefighters who reached the spot to control it,” he said.Officials said 12 fire tenders were rushed. Officials said a probe will find out the exact reason behind the incident. The repair works may take around one month as the sub-station was badly damaged in the fire.Arun Kumar Singh, chief fire safety officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said the fire was doused by 10.30am. “We doused the fire and no one was injured. We and the police will investigate what led to the incident,” he said. The sub-station had come up in October last year to cater to the power supply of establishments and residential sectors along the Noida-Greater Noida expressway. It was also providing power to the Noida-Greater Noida Metro’s Sector 148 station. The power department said the incident took place due to an internal fault and that the supply has been resumed from an alternate line.VN Singh, chief engineer, Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), said there is a 400 KV power sub-station in Sector 148. “We received information that a 500 MV transformer had caught fire due to internal faults. Power department officials swiftly moved into action to control it and also informed the police and fire departments,” he said.The sub-station supplied power to Sector 93, Sector 84 and the nearby metro station at Sector 148 which was briefly halted. “We have made alternative arrangements for power supply. This incident will not affect the power supply in the area,” he said. The power sub-station is about 500 metres away from the metro station. The power department has not filed any complaint in this regard, Varun Pawar, station house officer, Knowledge Park police station, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/huge-fire-at-power-substation-in-noida-s-sector-148-none-hurt/story-3ACAPje7ohqyVj9OCI8UuM.html
20-08-2020||Noida||Noida waives ₹225 crore time extension fee for 16 housing projects||The Noida authority has waived off time-extension charges to the tune of ₹225 crore on as many as 16 housing projects under its zero-period policy.The Noida authority officials said the move that extends the deadline for builders in developing their housing projects without a fee being levied on them will help the latter to complete more than 20,000 units.“We have given a total waiver of ₹225 crore in time-extension fee to 16 housing projects. The move will help in the delivery of 22,064 units in all these 16 projects,” said Ritu Maheshwari chief executive officer of the Noida authority. Work on these housing projects was disrupted due to court disputes over land, the authority said.On December 3, 2019, the Uttar Pradesh government had approved a ‘zero-period’ scheme that enabled development authorities to give waivers on interest, penalties, and time-extension fees to builders in cases wherein land disputes or court orders had delayed housing projects. These benefits are meant for projects scheduled to be finished by June, 2021. The authority charges 1% of the land cost as time-extension fee if any developer wants to get an additional one year to finish the project.While the authority gave time extension to 16 housing projects without imposing a fee, it rejected the proposals of 23 housing projects on various grounds. It also said that none of the 39 projects were eligible for interest waivers. These housing projects whose time-extension charges have been waived off include those being developed by Logix Infrastructure Pvt Ltd in Sector 137, Logix City Developers Pvt Ltd in Sector 143, Logix Infratech Pvt Ltd in Sector 143, Ajnara India Ltd in Sector 74, Greater Value Projects India Ltd in Sector 107, IV County Pvt Ltd in Sector 121, Kindle Infraheights Pvt Ltd in Sector 143, RG Residency Pvt Ltd in Sector 120, Laureate Buildwell Pvt Ltd in Sector 108, Nexgen Infracon Pvt Ltd in Sector 78, PAN Realtors Pvt Ltd in Sector 70, AVP Buildteck Pvt Ltd in Sector 77, Supertech Limited in Sector 74, Sikka Infrastructure Pvt Ltd in Sector 143B, E-Homes Infrastructure Pvt Ltd in Sector 75 and IVR Prime (Avadi) Developers Pvt Ltd in Sector 118.“After the time-extension and in wake of the Covid -19 pandemic, the 16 developers can deliver their housing projects by December-end in 2021,” said a statement by the Noida authority.The developers, however, are not too happy with the waivers on time-extension.“We were hoping to get the interest waivers for the time when the construction was stopped. We are yet to examine how much the latest move will benefit our projects,” said Shakti Nath, a promoter of the Logix group of companies.The Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI), a developers’ group, said the time-extension fee waiver will not make much difference to the realty sector.“The authority should have given waivers to all 39 projects who had applied for the waivers because their work got affected by land disputes. We also demand that the authority should give a waiver on interest imposed on the land dues,” said Prashant Tiwari, president, CREDAI’s Western UP wing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-waives-225-crore-time-extension-fee-for-16-housing-projects/story-3Ay26T5sAtdnGzXmn0BWfP.html
20-08-2020||City||Lukewarm response at Covid test centres in Vaishali, Indirapuram||Despite an uptick in Covid-19 tests, two of the four sampling centres in Ghaziabad, both in the trans-Hindon (old city) residential localities of Vaishali and Indirapuram, are seeing fewer collections of swabs for testing.The district has two other sampling centres, or static booths, at MMG District Hospital and at IMS College in Dasna in the cis-Hindon region (city). While the MMG hospital is in the middle of the old city, the Dasna centres is in the city outskirts.All four collect for the “gold standard” reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test as well antigen test. According to official data, the booth at Vaishali, a healthcentre, collected 1,644 samples and Indirapuram, at a gurudwara, collected 3,516 over 49 days -- from July 1 to August 18 -- totalling 5160 samples. During the same period, the cis-Hindon area accounted for 9843 samples --- 6,288 at the hospital and 3,555 at the Dasna college. Officials said each booth could collect 150 samples a day -- 7,350 over 49 days. Although this may suggest all four centres were not being used till capacity, factors such as distance, weekend lockdowns and containment zones play a role in collections.The test positivity rate (TPR, which is the total number of positive cases per 100 tests) at these each of these booths were, however, close -- Indirapuram 7.65% (269 positive cases), Vaishali 6.39% (105 cases), MMG Hospital 7.95% (500 cases) and IMS college 7.17% (255 cases). These are, however, not the only ways by which samples are collected. Surveillance teams are conducting surveys and camps to test people with symptoms or those with certain co-morbidities. Many private and government laboratories also offer testing, according to Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines.Residents believe there is a sense of fear in the community and the belief that the declining fatality rate was reason enough to stay away from getting tested at these booths.“There is still a sense of fear among the residents and they do not wish to get tested even if home isolation is allowed. The booth at Vaishali caters to localities of Vaishali and Kuashambi etc. In our areas we approached the health department for a testing camp on Wednesday in order to encourage residents to come out and get tested,” said VK Mittal, president of Kuashambi Apartments’ residents’ welfare association. “There is a sense among residents that as fatality rate is on the decline and those getting recovered is increasing, with majority remaining asymptomatic, so, they somehow feel that testing can be avoided. There had been long queues outside the sampling booth in Indirapuram once, but they are no more now,” said Alok Kumar, founder-member of federation of association of apartment owners in Ghaziabad. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey could not be reached for comments over the issue. The officials of the district health department said that they are trying to maintain overall daily sampling/testing in range of 3000-3500 per day. “To ensure that more sampling and testing is done we have roped in mobile vans besides holding camps in different areas. We have also come up with sampling centres in rural areas. In urban areas we are encouraging residents to come out for testing and suspected cases are being traced with the help of our surveillance teams. Help of local councilors and RWAs is also being taken,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. According to the state health bulletin, Ghazaibad has 1,099 active Covid-19 cases so far. With 85 cases reported in the last 24 hours, the district tally has reached 6,874, including total 5,708 recoveries and 67 deaths. In neighbouring Gautam Budh Nagar, a total of 6,700 cases have been reported so far. The tally includes 104 new cases, 5,872 total recoveries and 43 deaths.Overall, the district, till August 18, collected about 160,086 samples of which test reports of 158,239 were received. Of the overall sampling, 90238 samples were conducted through rapid antigen kits. Meanwhile in UP, the state officials said that 107768 samples were tested till Tuesday and overall testing has reached 4075174 tests. “The chief minister has directed for more testing and we plan to conduct 1.3 lakh tests in next phase. This will be done through 45000 tests through RT-PCR and 75000 through rapid antigen kits per day. The CM has asked for names of districts conducting less testing. The increase in testing is helpful in early detection of case and early treatment. This also helps in contact tracing in order to prevent infection from spreading further,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lukewarm-response-at-covid-test-centres-in-vaishali-indirapuram/story-DQp7wb6WbpFiIebP6ofxXM.html
20-08-2020||City||UP-Rera to audit escrow accounts of registered projects||The Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP-Rera) has decided to audit the escrow accounts opened by builders for projects registered with the authority, and has asked the promoters to submit the account details online till August 31.“Considering the numerous complaints received by the authority regarding non-compliance with the provisions of the Rera Act, the authority has decided to conduct the verification audit of designated accounts,” Rajive Kumar, chairman, UP-Rera, said on Wednesday.According to the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, 70 % of the money realised from the allottees of the project shall be deposited from time to time in a designated separate account (escrow account) to be maintained in a scheduled bank to cover the construction and land cost of the projectonly.UP-Rera said it will penalise promoters for not submitting details of the escrow account within the stipulated time.“It is mandatory for the promoter of a project to adhere to the Rera act, and its rules and regulations governing operation and management of the designated separate account. Section 38 of the Act empowers the authority to impose a penalty in regard to any contravention of obligations cast upon the promoters,” said Kumar.The act mandates that withdrawal of money from the designated separate accounts to cover the cost of the project needs to be in proportion to percentage completion of the project and such withdrawals need to be supported by certificates from an engineer, an architect, and a chartered accountant.Abrar Ahmed, secretary, UP-Rera, said, “The promoters of all the project registered with the authority have been directed to submit online information regarding the details of projects’ bank accounts and any other bank accounts being utilised for depositing the sale proceeds and project finance availed. The last date for submission is August 31, and non-compliance with the instructions will lead to the imposition of penalties.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-rera-to-audit-escrow-accounts-of-registered-projects/story-Nb2gmWJvGz3xVedOwbiHAO.html
20-08-2020||Noida||Why Noida handles rain better than Gurugram||On Wednesday morning, as people in Gurugram stared at parts of their city turning into a lake, people in Noida reported little inconvenience. The situation was not entirely trouble-free there -- water accumulated at the foot of flyovers and access/exit ramps to the DND -- but it was nowhere near like the situation in Gurugram, where commuters swam to safety as their cars sank and rescue teams patrolled on rafts looking for anyone marooned.The contrast is explained by how the two cities were planned. The Uttar Pradesh government set up the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida) in 1976 to develop a planned township on the state’s border with the national Capital. The objective was to blueprint an integrated, modern industrial city with all provisions required for an urban space. On the other hand, Gurugram did not have a metropolitan development authority till 2017 and a municipal corporation till 2007. It had, although, begun finishing its first housing projects in the 1980s. On Wednesday, when 70mm of rain poured down on Noida and 118mm on Gurugram, this difference manifested itself in water-logged roads, flooded homes and serpentine traffic jams that were seen in one city, but not the other. “Noida is a planned city while Gurugram was developed in isolation. In Gurugram, a developer buys 100 acres or 500 acres from a farmer, develops a township, lays infrastructure inside the township and empties rain water outside the campus. It was a piecemeal approach,” said SC Gaur, chief coordinator and planner with the UP national capital region cell, while explaining how town planning methodologies used for Noida and Gurugram were different.“In Noida, the authority develops roads, drainage network and other civic infrastructure before allotting the land to a developer,” Gaur said. Rajvir Singh, former chief town planner, Haryana, who is now a consultant, said urban planning failed on many counts in Gurugram. “Initially, when the development plan for the city was being prepared, it was pointed out that natural drains and dams should not be disturbed. However, real estate development was allowed in a haphazard manner. Also, despite a master plan for the city, most of the features remained on paper and thus the civic infrastructure in the city is still catching up with the urban growth,” said Singh. Experts pointed out that flooding during monsoon is also because of the difference between the topography of the two cities. “Noida is surrounded by Yamuna and Hindon and is located on plains, where stormwater drains empties out in the two rivers. Also, the city has a planned drainage system. Gurugram, on the other hand, is a hilly terrain with a poor gradient. Moreover, with natural drains such as Najafgarh and Badshahpur being encroached upon in many places, stormwater floods on the city roads,” said Professor Dr Gauhar Mehmood of the department of civil engineering, Jamia Millia Islamia, Delhi. Mehmood worked with the Gurugram Municipal Corporation and helped set up water conservation structures to conserve rainwater in 2010-11.Natural drains, which were spread across the Gurugram district and prominent dams, which existed since the British period at Ghata, Wazirabad, Nathupur, Jharsa and Manesar, have vanished due to encroachments. City officials said it is one of the main reasons for the flooding of Golf Course Road and adjacent areas. “The current stormwater drainage system is inadequate to take the load. Exigency plans need to be created and special emphasis should be put on rainwater harvesting and creating small lakes, which can keep roads free of stormwater,” said Prof Sewa Ram from School of Planning and Architecture in Delhi. VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO) of Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), said deployment of motor pumps is only a relief measure and until the city’s drainage system is augmented, waterlogging will persist.Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty, Noida authority, said: “Teams from water department were on standby to address waterlogging complaints. We had also set up water pumping stations. At the Mamura underpass, water-logging did take place but we managed to pump out water from all low-lying areas soon after rain stopped. We were able to perform better also because Noida has well-planned roads, drainage network and the irrigation drain takes rainwater into the Yamuna and Hindon.”Gurugram also has a plethora of civic agencies: HSVP, HSIIDC, GMDA and MCG. Noida has one. While the Noida Master plan 2031 defines land use of each sector before it is allotted to builders for housing or for setting up industries, most of the new sectors in Gurugram (from sector 58 to 115) lack roads, water supply, power infrastructure and sewerage system. KK Rao, Gurugram police commissioner, said waterlogging has been one of the biggest challenges for all government agencies, including the police. “Poor road engineering, improper drainage system and human negligence are the reasons which lead to such situations.

In fact, chief minister ML Khattar had once sounded non-committal on the prospect of enacting such a law.Thus, Arya’s move to reserve the proposed law for the President’s review has the potential to sour the relations between the two allies. Chautala did not respond to calls made in this regard.After approving the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Ordinance, 2020, in July, the Haryana cabinet had sent it to the governor for promulgation. Under Article 213 of the Constitution, the governor has the powers to promulgate an ordinance or a law when the state assembly is not in session. However, he can refuse to do so and refer it to the President.The Haryana ordinance which has now been reserved for review would go through time-consuming scrutiny of central ministries before the President takes a final call on it.TOOK LAW SECRETARY’S ADVICEThe governor, who had to deal with two contrary pieces of legal advice from the law secretary and the advocate general, seems to have agreed with the former’s counsel.The law secretary’s advice on referring the proposed law for presidential review was primarily based on two counts. “Section 23 of the proposed law gives it an overriding effect over other laws. Such a broad provision has the potential to be repugnant to an Act of the Parliament or an existing law and thereby needs presidential assent. Another provision for preference in jobs to the candidates domiciled in Haryana is seemingly in contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution pertaining to equality before law and Article 19 (1)(g), which provides for protection of certain rights to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business,” said an official familiar with the developments.Advocate general BR Mahajan, however, had said the proposed rule did not violate any central law. “It also does not come in conflict with Article 14 of the Constitution,” Mahajan had said.POLITICS BEHIND THE MOVEIt came as a surprise to many that governor Arya, despite knowing well that an assembly session has to been convened from August 26, chose to reserve the proposed law for the President’s consideration, instead of waiting for the assembly to replace it with a Bill. The BJP government at the Centre has a very different view on the issue. At least two former central ministers had answered in negative to Parliament questions about possibility of reservation in appointments in private companies. Arya who is a BJP appointee would have weighed the political implications of implementing a law that would put migrants from his home state of Bihar at a disadvantage in terms of employment opportunities in private sector. “He himself is an eight-time Bihar MLA and with Bihar assembly polls later this year, this factor would also have influenced his decision,” said a political analyst. The BJP is a coalition partner in the Janta Dal (U)-led government in Bihar.About the lawTitled Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Ordinance, 2020, it provides for 75% of the new employment to local candidates for jobs having salary less than ₹50,000 per month in private companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms, partnership firms, etc situated in the state. Employers will also have the option to recruit local candidates from one district to the extent of only 10%. The proposed law also contained a bail-out clause for the industry if suitable local candidates are not available for a particular category of industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/private-sector-job-quota-haryana-governor-sends-proposed-law-to-president/story-P7WXWMIXIGgY1G6Bvb9l3L.html

PMC has been warned against dumping fresh garbage at the waste plant. MPCB issued a notice on Wednesday and instructed the civic body to follow the norms as per the solid waste management act and submit a report to its office in the next three days. PMC has landfill site at Uruli Devachi and Phursungi. MPCB, in its letter to the PMC, said, “We did a joint visit at the garbage depots on March 3 along with PMC officials. It was found that PMC is processing fresh 250 to 300 metric tonne waste. It is observed that leachate treatment provided is not adequate and a huge quantity of leachate is flowing through without treatment in the nallah. As the untreated leachate is mixing in water source, it would pollute the surrounding area.”MPCB has directed PMC to stop the processing of fresh solid waste in biomining plants at Uruli Devachi immediately and process it scientifically. PMC solid waste management department head Dyneshwar Molak said, “We received the letter from MPCB and will submit a reply in three working days. The garbage lifting process is smooth in the city.” Recently, residents of Uruli Devachi and Phursungi had demanded permanent closure of garbage depots at their neighbourhood. They also planned to stage agitations on Independence Day [August 15], but police did not permit the protest and arrested agitators because of the Covid situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/mpcb-warns-pmc-against-dumping-fresh-waste-at-garbage-depot/story-ztk0pE3V27OLSz9pdzCdlI.html
20-08-2020||Pune||Commuters await completion of six-lane road near Navale bridge in Pune||Commuters using the Katraj to Wadgaon Navale bridge stretch are awaiting the completion of a six-lane concrete road replacing the existing four-lane road on the 4 km stretch. The work is to be carried out by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Central Public Works Department (PWD). The work has been at a standstill since the past few months. The commuters are facing difficulties with the road dug up, construction material lying on the side of the road and some stretch submerged in water at the service road. In February last year, Nitin Gadkari, the union minister for road transport and highways, allocated Rs 135 crore for the project. Until now, Rs 69 crore have been already given for the work. The work of the highway road stretch started in January this year, but was put on hold due to the lockdown. “Due to the countrywide lockdown, the construction work of the highway was halted, but it has resumed now and will be completed in the given time. There will be two pedestrian underpasses coming up on the stretch and the existing two vehicular underpasses will be widened.” said Ganesh Choure, executive engineer of Central PWD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/commuters-await-completion-of-six-lane-road-near-navale-bridge/story-Drr2n4KoVWlmUbLwMuNdsK.html
20-08-2020||Pune||Busiest highway passing through Pune riddled with problems||Located on the national highway number 4 along the Mumbai-Bengaluru route, Rajiv Gandhi Infotech park, Maharashtra’s largest IT park, employs over 3.5 lakh people. Incomplete road works, encroachments and poorly designed service roads have turned the highway into an accident-prone spot, especially for motorists and riders passing through the stretch between Katraj and Balewadi. The 40-kilometre stretch under the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is riddled with potholes. The ongoing road work at Chandani chowk and Balewadi has made commuting a nightmare with no continuous crash barriers, lane markings or reflectors, say regulars travelling on the stretch. Pune police in 2018 had identified 12 accident-prone spots on the stretch and authorities had taken corrective measures at some of these locations. “I travelled to Mumbai last week to drop my relatives to the airport and when we passed through the highway it took more than an hour to connect to the Pune-Mumbai expressway as there were several potholes on the bypass stretch. The potholes were so huge and deep that my car suffered a scratch. The highway authorities should immediately carry out repairs before it causes a major mishap,” said Bipin Gandhi, a commuter on the highway. Atul Namekar, secretary of Sinhgad road-Warje residents association said, “The bypass highway is a busy stretch that connects several parts of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad areas. Many mishaps have been reported on this road due to potholes, but some patch up is carried out only before monsoons. NHAI should come up with a permanent solution.” The Katraj-Dehu road bypass highway was started in 1989 and the reason behind it was for heavy vehicles to travel from outside the city limits. So, trucks and trolleys coming from Bengaluru and Kolhapur and going towards Mumbai and Gujarat would use this bypass highway. However, the bypass in its 40 km stretch connects several parts of the city starting from Katraj, Sinhgad road, Warje, Kothrud, Baner, Balewadi, Hinjewadi, Chinchwad and Dehu road. NHAI Pune project director Suhas Chitnis said, “We have started repair works on the bypass highway and are aware that potholes have increased on the stretch.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/busiest-highway-passing-through-pune-riddled-with-problems/story-XbshhU0ZOuMlIe3oqqhmCK.html

20-08-2020||Pune||Pune civic body’s hike in biomedical waste disposal charges puts burden on patients||Private hospitals are passing on the additional burden of hike in charges for biomedical waste disposal imposed by Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on patients. PMC hiked the charges for biomedical waste disposal from hospitals from April 1. A Covid-19 positive patient’s family had to pay Rs one lakh for personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and Rs 1.25 lakh as disposable charges for the same kits, including gloves, foot covers and headcovers for about 97 PPE kits which were used during the 30-day treatment. This amounts to Rs 2,319 per PPE kits, including the disposable charges. Such huge costs cover a major portion of the bill, according to a patient’s relative. The hospitals, on the other hand, say that despite facing losses the civic body is now pressing additional charges under biomedical waste disposal. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman, Hospital Board of India, Pune chapter, said, “It is true that hospitals have started charging patients for the additional biomedical waste disposal charges that the PMC has hiked recently. We had written to PMC a month ago seeking waiver given the current circumstances, but are yet to get any response.” “Since these charges are drafted as per the number of beds and the waste generated, big hospitals are most affected. They pass these charges to patients,” he said. Dr Ramchandra Hankre, chief, health department, PMC, said, “These charges are not imposed by PMC, but are an annual hike as per the consumer price index drafted by the Government of India. These prices are decided based on the city and follow multiple criteria. We cannot waive off the charges because the civic body has to dispose of the waste which includes manpower and machinery.” Although the government of Maharashtra capped prices, as per the May 21 notification, the annexure C says that these capped prices do not include PPE kits, interventional procedures Covid testing, and high-end drugs, which allows private hospitals to charge for these items as per their standard charges. Sunil Dandawate, who runs a common biomedical waste treatment facility in Pune at Kailas crematorium, said, “Before the pandemic, we received about 3,500 kg to 4,000 kg waste which was of the yellow incinerate waste which we are still getting. In addition, we are also getting about 4,000 kg to 5,000 kg waste related to Covid-19 daily which needs to be incinerated.” “In the beginning phase of the pandemic, the non-Covid waste had gone down drastically which is now back to normal because pending surgeries are now taking place,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-s-hike-in-biomedical-waste-disposal-charges-puts-burden-on-patients/story-J6TFu4nhYq7qlkoRKEGMFO.html
20-08-2020||Pune||Pune civic body audit reveals 36 hospital bills were inflated||An audit carried out by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) of private hospital bills related to Covid-19 patients found that out of the 49 bills scrutinised 36 were inflated. As of Tuesday, the progressive positives of the city are 81,674 and death toll is 2,131, according to the state health department. According to the civic administration, as of Tuesday, the number of active cases went up to 14,469 out of which 760 are in critical condition with 463 on ventilator while 297 in ICU without ventilator. Also, 2,472 are undergoing oxygen treatment. The civic body has appointed auditors to verify bills issued to Covid-19 patients admitted at various private hospitals in the city. The audit is being done from August 14. Vikram Kumar, Pune municipal commissioner, said, “As instructed by state government and district administration, we appointed auditors to verify bills issued by private hospitals to Covid-19 patients. The drive had started from August 14 and will continue. During the audit, 49 bills were scrutinised and 36 were found to be inflated. We corrected the bills and reduced amount to Rs 19 lakh,” he said. Elected members from the city have raised the issue of overcharging Covid-19 patients at various private hospitals in the city. At a PMC general body meeting, Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol instructed the administration that they should make the auditors’ names public to help residents verify their bills. Mohol said, “Many complaints related to overcharging are reported. PMC should verify all bills above Rs1.5 lakh and the state government has also instructed us to do so. I have instructed the municipal administration to check bills issued by private hospitals with the help of auditors. Hospitals should not issue bills directly to patients, instead it should get scrutinised by the municipal administration.” “Also, there is a need to check whether hospitals give 80 per cent beds to PMC,” he said. MLAs and MPs have raised the issue at a meeting held by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in Pune. They also asked Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar to look into the matter. Recently, guardian minister Ajit Pawar had instructed the administration to take action against hospitals who overcharge patients. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, Congress and Shiv Sena members raised the issue of overcharging at the PMC general body meeting held on August 18. Arvind Shinde, Congress leader, said, “We are raising the issue for the last three months, but the administration is doing nothing.” MNS leader Vasant More, said, “Hospitals and medical shops attached to hospitals are overcharging patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-audit-reveals-36-hospital-bills-were-inflated/story-laQjMMqM7N5rh9GvF9t7kK.html

20-08-2020||Pune||Government constituted task force seeks a rethink on Konkan refinery||The task force set up by the Uddhav Thackeray government to revive the state’s economy during the Covid-19 pandemic has recommended starting the refinery proposed in Konkan to boost employment and encourage investment. The chief minister, however, said that the government will approve projects only if locals are in favour of it. Prominent economist and government-appointed task force member Vijay Kelkar asked Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to reconsider the proposal regarding the starting of the refinery at Konkan, which according to him, will help generate employment for one lakh individuals. The chief minister in April had said that the government set up task force, including Kelkar and well-known scientist Dr Raghunath Mashelkar as its members, to help the state recover its economic condition. The proposal came up when members of the Pune International Centre (PIC), a think-tank, whose members are also a part of the task force, held a meeting with Thackeray over video conferencing on Tuesday. According to Mashelkar, proposal on starting the refinery is a part of the report submitted to the chief minister as the post-Covid economic recovery measure. “Based on instructions from the Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, we have recommended various measures which include short, medium and long term steps. The chief minister is likely to discuss our suggestions in the cabinet meeting,” said Mashelkar, also president of PIC. During the interaction, members also discussed other proposals to boost investment and revive sectors like real estate during the Covid-19 crisis. The PIC, according to its director Prashant Girbane, has been entrusted by the state government to give inputs, which the think-tank has submitted to the Chief Minister’s Office. “Kelkar sought starting the Konkan refinery so that it will create employment for one lakh individuals and bring in an investment of Rs 3 lakh crore. He also asked about shifting the refinery at Chembur to free up the space, which can be redeveloped,” said a release from the chief minister’s public relation department. Following opposition from the Shiv Sena, the previous Devendra Fadnavis government in 2019 had to scrap a proposed refinery project at Nanar in Ratnagiri. Later, Fadnavis, as the then CM, had hinted that project will be moved to neighbouring Raigad district. The oil refinery, proposed to be built with 50 per cent investment from Saudi Aramco, the state-owned company of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, was being touted as the world’s largest refinery, with a capacity of 60-million tonnes an annum, by the state and central government. It was to help in generating direct and indirect employment for over one lakh people. Responding to Kelkar’s suggestion about the refinery, Thackeray said that for any project to be set up, an interaction with locals and taken them into confidence, is necessary. “Our government will not disrespect sentiments of the local people while bringing any project,” Thackeray was quoted in the release. Besides Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and PIC members, including Dr Raghunath Mashelkar, Deepak Parekh, Ajit Ranade and Vijay Gokhale, among others were also present during the online interaction. “The PIC has submitted multiple reports to the state government in the last four months during Covid-19. These reports are about investment, industry and emergency management. The government has already accepted a few of our reports and have started implementing them,” said Girbane, who was part of the interaction. Among the other proposals discussed during the interaction with Thackeray were decentralising industrialisation across the state, development along the Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi expressway and offering sops such as exemption in tax duty to help the real estate sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/government-constituted-task-force-seeks-a-rethink-on-konkan-refinery/story-FmMdn8SpATCdapX71nkqEO.html

The Mumbai police conducted an internal survey which showed that most policemen who succumbed were either posted near containment zones or lived or worked in a containment zone or close to one. Of the 59 personnel, most were above the age of 50 and some of them were about to retire, added the senior police officer.“Apart from the funds sanctioned by the state government, the Mumbai Police have released ₹10 lakh from the Mumbai Police Foundation for each of the martyrs.

20-08-2020||Jaipur||Menstrual health of adolescent girls in Rajasthan took a hit during lockdown: Survey||Seven out of 10 adolescent girls faced problem in procuring sanitary pads during the lockdown in Rajasthan, reveals a study by a non-government organisation (NGO).“It is deeply worrying that a large number of young female adolescents have had zero access to sanitary napkins during the lockdown,” said Poonam Muttreja, executive director, Population Foundation of India (PFI), which carried out the rapid assessment among 1,000 people across Rajasthan, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.“Things need to change at the ground level. The government needs to distribute sanitary napkins through the ASHA and ANM workers’ network. It takes tremendous convincing on the part of frontline workers to encourage and educate school-going girls to use sanitary napkins,” she added.Muttreja said the unmet need of adolescent girls is bound to have an adverse effect in the coming months. “The unavailability of sanitary napkins can push up the worrisome school drop out rates for girls. This could impact the young girl psychologically as well as lead to health issues,” she said.The idea behind the study was to understand the level of knowledge of the young population (15-24 years) regarding Covid-19; how it has impacted their lives and mental health, and their needs and priorities.The survey gave several critical insights into some of the worst fears that health care experts have had about adolescents during the lockdown, Muttreja said.The main areas of impact were the effect on mental health; sources to obtain information on Covid-19; increase in workload at home and increase in unmet need for sanitary napkins since schools were shut.The other findings in Rajasthan were that 23% of the total respondents listed schools as a reliable source of information on Covid-19. The school administration worked in disseminating information about the pandemic. A whopping 84% said that TV was the main source of information on Covid-19The study also revealed that 33% of young adolescents in Rajasthan witnessed an increase in tension and fights at home during the lockdown.Two out of every 10 adolescents that PFI spoke with felt depressed due to the lockdown.

20-08-2020||World||Record melt: Greenland lost 586 billion tons of ice in 2019||Greenland lost a record amount of ice during an extra warm 2019, with the melt massive enough to cover California in more than four feet (1.25 meters) of water, a new study said.After two years when summer ice melt had been minimal, last summer shattered all records with 586 billion tons (532 billion metric tons) of ice melting, according to satellite measurements reported in a study Thursday. That’s more than 140 trillion gallons (532 trillion liters) of water.That’s far more than the yearly average loss of 259 billion tons (235 billion metric tons) since 2003 and easily surpasses the old record of 511 billion tons (464 billion metric tons) in 2012, said a study in Nature Communications Earth & Environment. The study showed that in the 20th century, there were many years when Greenland gained ice.“Not only is the Greenland ice sheet melting, but it’s melting at a faster and faster pace,” said study lead author Ingo Sasgen, a geoscientist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.Last year’s Greenland melt added 0.06 inches (1.5 millimeters) to global sea level rise. That sounds like a tiny amount but “in our world it’s huge, that’s astounding,” said study co-author Alex Gardner, a NASA ice scientist. Add in more water from melting in other ice sheets and glaciers, along with an ocean that expands as it warms — and that translates into slowly rising sea levels, coastal flooding and other problems, he said.While general ice melt records in Greenland go back to 1948, scientists since 2003 have had precise records on how much ice melts because NASA satellites measure the gravity of the ice sheets. That’s the equivalent of putting the ice on a scale and weighing it as water flows off, Gardner said.As massive as the melt was last year, the two years before were only on average about 108 billion tons (98 billion metric tons). That shows that there’s a second factor called Greenland blocking, that either super-charges that or dampens climate-related melting, Gardner said.In the summer, there are generally two factors in Greenland’s weather, Gardner said. Last year, Greenland blocking — a high pressure over Canada that changes the northern jet stream — caused warm southern air to come up from the United States and Canada and flow into Greenland, forcing more melting.In 2017 and 2018 without Greenland blocking, cooler Arctic air flowed from open ocean into Greenland, making summer milder, he said.This year, Greenland’s summer melt has been not as severe, closer to normal for recent times, said Ruth Mottram, an ice scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute, who wasn’t part of Sasgen’s research.Mottram and several other outside scientists said Sasgen’s calculations make sense. In her own study this month in the International Journal of Climatology, she found similar results and also calculated that Greenland coastal regions have warmed on average 3 degrees (1.7 degrees Celsius) in the summer since 1991.“The fact that 2019 set an all-time record is very concerning,” said New York University ice scientist David Holland, who wasn’t part of either study.___Follow AP’s climate coverage at https://www.apnews.com/Climate___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

20-08-2020||World||Trump, Iraqi leader discuss IS, US troops and Iran||President Donald Trump and the prime minister of Iraq met Thursday to discuss ways to confront Iranian aggression in the region, threats from Islamic State sleeper cells and the president’s desire to shrink the US military’s footprint in the country.There are more than 5,000 American troops in Iraq now. Last month, the top US general for the Middle East said he believed the US will keep a smaller but enduring presence in the country. Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, the commander of US Central Command, said after he met with Iraq’s new prime minister, Mustafa al-Kadhimi, that he believes the Iraqis welcome the US and coalition troops, especially in the ongoing fight to keep IS fighters from taking hold of the country again.McKenzie would not say how many US troops might stay. But he said Iraqi conventional forces now operate on their own. US and coalition forces continue to conduct training and counterterrorism operations, including with Iraqi commandos. Any final decisions, he said, would be coordinated with the Iraqi government.Al-Kadhimi, who is backed by the United States, assumed office in May when Baghdad’s relations with Washington were precarious following the US killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike at the Baghdad airport.Al-Kadhimi has often had to walk a tightrope due to the US-Iran rivalry. Asked if he was bringing any messages from Tehran following a recent visit there, al-Kadhimi told The Associated Press before he left for Washington: “We do not play the role of postman in Iraq.”The US recognizes the cultural and religious ties that exist between Iran and Iraq, but the administration wants to decrease Iran’s destabilizing influence, often exercised by pro-Iranian militias, on the political and security in Iraq.Al-Kadhimi’s administration inherited a myriad of crises. State coffers in the crude oil-dependent country were slashed following a severe drop in prices, adding to the woes of an economy already struggling with the aftershocks of the global coronavirus pandemic. The US wants to make sure the Baghdad central government’s limited resources also find their way to the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq.State violence used to quell the mass protests that erupted in October brought public trust in the government to a new low. Tens of thousands of Iraqis marched decrying rampant government corruption, poor services and unemployment, leading to the resignation of the previous premier, Adel Abdul-Mahdi.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who met Wednesday with Iraq’s foreign minister, Fuad Hussein, said the US was committed to helping Iraq regain and maintain security, despite Trump’s oft-stated desire to reduce and then eliminate American troops’ presence there. Armed groups are not under the full control of the Iraqi prime minister, Pompeo said. He said those groups should be replaced by local police as soon as possible and that the US could and would help.The Iraqi prime minister told Pompeo that Iraq currently does not need direct military support on the ground, and that the levels of help will depend on the changing nature of the threat. Three years since Iraq declared victory over IS, sleeper cells continue to stage attacks across the country’s north.Pompeo and the Iraqi foreign minister expressed hope that as the security situation improves, there will be greater economic cooperation between the two countries, particularly in the energy sector.On Wednesday, Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette announced energy agreements worth up to $8 billion between the Iraqi minsters of oil and electricity and five US companies — Honeywell, Baker Hughes, GE, Stellar and Chevron. Brouillette said US private investment will help Iraqi’s energy sector and stressed a need for Iraq to reduce its dependence on energy from Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-iraqi-leader-discuss-is-us-troops-and-iran/story-8b9baQYyCrznLrQpx9ayMM.html
20-08-2020||World||Time for world to show solidarity with Lebanese people, says UN||The head of the UN refugee agency says it’s time for the international community to show solidarity with the Lebanese people by offering assistance to a country that has hosted hundreds of thousands of refugees for decades. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi also said the UNHCR is making its capacity and expertise as a humanitarian agency available to the Lebanese people and is ready to assist the country as part of a broader international response. Lebanon has been going through multiple crises, including widespread corruption, political divisions and economic difficulties, and Grandi said the international community should find long-term interventions to assist. “All of this is a bigger package than the humanitarian package, and this package needs to be addressed by the international community,” he told The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday night. Grandi, on his first official mission since March, when lockdowns were imposed in Europe due to the pandemic, is visiting Lebanon two weeks after a catastrophic explosion at the Port of Beirut destroyed a large part of its capital Beirut. The August 4 blast killed a least 180 people, injured about 6,000 and left nearly 300,000 people with major damage to their homes. It was the most destructive single incident in Lebanon’s history, leaving losses worth between $10 and $15 billion. There are 30 still missing after the explosion. Among those killed were 43 Syrians — a reflection of the country being host to the largest number of refugees per capita — and Grandi said some refugees are among those still missing. More than 1 million Syrian refugees are in Lebanon, having fled the war next door. Grandi, who toured the site of the explosion on Wednesday, also said he is very concerned about the impact of Lebanon’s worsening economic crisis on Syrian and other refugees in the country. “The time has come to also show the Lebanese when they are in the hour of need that the international community responds,” he said. The tiny country now faces a surge in new coronavirus cases, made worse in the aftermath of the explosion, which knocked several Beirut hospitals out of service, including two who were hosting patients with Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus. Grandi said so far the number of refugees who have tested positive for the virus is relatively small. “Where we are worried, and we are worried in Lebanon as well, is the economic impact, because as we know the lockdowns have created a lot of new poverty among the most vulnerable in society” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-for-world-to-show-solidarity-with-lebanese-people-says-un/story-4dFqu91qnfiynSJTq06gKL.html
20-08-2020||World||Ex-Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon charged in border wall scheme||Former White House adviser Steve Bannon was arrested Thursday on charges that he and three others ripped off donors to an online fundraising scheme “We Build The Wall.”The charges were contained in an indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court.Federal prosecutors alleged that Bannon and three others “orchestrated a scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of donors” in connection with an online crowdfunding campaign that raised more than $25 million to build a wall along the southern border of the United States.Multiple messages were left seeking comment from a spokeswoman for Bannon and his lawyer.According to the indictment, Bannon promised that 100% of the donated money would be used for the project, but the defendants collectively used hundreds of thousands of dollars in a manner inconsistent with the organization’s public representations.The indictment said they faked invoices and sham “vendor” arrangements, among other ways, to hide what was really happening.We Build the Wall originally promoted a project for 3 miles of fence posts in South Texas that was ultimately built and largely funded by Fisher Industries, which has received about $2 billion in funding for wall contracts. Tommy Fisher, CEO, didn’t respond to calls for comment.Trump recently criticized that section of wall after it showed signs of erosion, saying it was “only done to make me look bad,” even though it was built by his supporters.Bannon led the conservative Breitbart News before being tapped to serve as chief executive officer of Trump’s campaign in its critical final months, when he pushed a scorched earth strategy that included highlighting the stories of former President Bill Clinton’s accusers. After the election, he served as chief strategist during the turbulent early months of Trump’s administration.The blunt-spoken, combative Bannon was the voice of a nationalistic, outsider conservatism, and he pushed Trump to follow through on some of his most contentious campaign promises, including his travel ban on several majority-Muslim countries. But Bannon also clashed with other top advisers, and his high profile sometimes irked Trump. He was pushed out in August 2017.Bannon, who served in the Navy and worked as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs before becoming a Hollywood producer, has been hosting a pro-Trump podcast called “War Room” that began during the president’s impeachment proceedings and has continued during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-donald-trump-adviser-steve-bannon-charged-in-border-wall-scheme/story-k9wxa6Sd4HZu15FQ6JNB9H.html
20-08-2020||World||China, US say talks on implementing trade pact coming soon||Chinese and US trade envoys will hold a meeting by phone “in the near future” to discuss an agreement aimed at resolving a tariff war, a Commerce Ministry spokesman said Thursday.The spokesman, Gao Feng, gave no details of the timing at a ministry news briefing.White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Thursday that the talks are part of the process of implementing the US-China trade deal, though he did not say when they would actually happen. He attributed any delay to “scheduling issues.”“It’s part of the process, part of the governance process of this large trade deal,” Kudlow said on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends.” “It was on again, off again, that’s all that was, was scheduling issues. It’s a normal review.”Under the “Phase 1” trade agreement signed in January, both governments agreed to suspend potential additional penalties on each other’s goods in a fight that erupted in 2018 over Beijing’s technology ambitions and trade surplus.The truce called for talks to be held after six months, but those were delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. A meeting scheduled for last week was to be held online but was postponed.“Both parties have agreed to hold a call in the near future,” Gao said.Kudlow, President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, said the administration has “many huge complaints about China, many,” but that both sides are engaged on the deal. He said China has been buying “a ton” of commodities, mostly agricultural goods, and that the US trade representative believes China is “following their script.”“So far, so good,” Kudlow said.The two governments have rolled back some penalties but most of the punitive tariffs imposed on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other’s goods remain in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-us-say-talks-on-implementing-trade-pact-coming-soon/story-C8aum1L5AO6XnoDAEVrpqN.html
20-08-2020||World||Democratic nominee for US vice-president Kamala Harris makes history||Kamala Harris made history on Wednesday after being officially nominated by the Democratic party as its nominee for vice-president. She is the first Indian American and Black woman — actually, the first woman of colour — to be fielded for the second highest political office in the US by a major political party.Harris accepted the nomination as a tribute to her Indian-born mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who came to the US to pursue her interest in breast cancer research, met and married Donald J Harris, an immigrant from Jamaica, during the civil rights movement, and raised her and her sister as a single mother.“How I wish she were here tonight but I know she’s looking down on me from above. I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman—all of five feet tall—who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California,” Harris said in a semi-virtual speech, from a room with some reporters.“On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now speaking these words: I accept your nomination for Vice President of the United States of America,” she added.“I do so, committed to the values she taught me.”And, in an unmistakable acknowledgement of her Indian-ness at this highest point of public recognition in her life, Harris used a typical word from Tamil, her mother tongue, for aunts when talking about her expansive vision for the campaign: “Family is my uncles, my aunts—my chitthis,” she said.Harris was introduced by her younger sister Maya Harris, who is a lawyer and a political operative; Maya’s daughter Meena Harris, also a lawyer by profession; and step daughter Ella Emhoff, who is a student at Parsons School of Design in New York City, according to her LinkedIn profile.Harris was scheduled to deliver her acceptance speech before former President Barack Obama, who was to headline Night 3 of the Democratic convention, but was given the prime slot at the former president’s request, who wanted her be the star of the evening, in a symbolic passing-of-the-torch to the next generation of Democratic leaders.Obama used his rescheduled speaking slot to launch an uncharacteristically pointed attack on his successor. “I have sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president. I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously; that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care.“But he never did. For close to four years now, he’s shown no interest in putting in the work; no interest in finding common ground; no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends; no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves.”Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called for Democrats to go out and vote citing her own failed run because many people either did not vote or had not realized how “dangerous” Trump can be. “This can’t be another woulda-coulda-shoulda election,” she said. “If you’re voting by mail, request your ballot now, and send it back as soon as you can. If you vote in person, do it early.”President Trump responded to the attacks in real time with a string of angry tweets in all-caps. “WHY DID HE REFUSE TO ENDORSE SLOW JOE UNTIL IT WAS ALL OVER, AND EVEN THEN WAS VERY LATE? WHY DID HE TRY TO GET HIM NOT TO RUN?” he said in one of them.Harris accepted the nomination in a speech steeped in her personal story of being raised, along with her younger sister, by a strong-willed mother to be “proud, strong Black women … (and to)… be proud of our Indian heritage”.Harris invoked her mother again to frame her historic run as Joe Biden’s running mate. She said she accepted the nomination committed to the values taught to her by her mother. “To the word that teaches me to walk by faith, and not by sight. And to a vision passed on through generations of Americans—one that Joe Biden shares. A vision of our nation as a Beloved Community—where all are welcome, no matter what we look like, where we come from, or who we love.”That nation “feels distant” today, she said, naming the president she and Biden are running to unseat for the first and only time in her 15-minute long speech, “Donald Trump’s failure of leadership has cost lives and livelihoods,” she said, attacking the administration’s handling of the Covid-19 epidemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democratic-nominee-for-us-vice-president-kamala-harris-makes-history/story-JCR2j9kv6bly884mTpCKsN.html
20-08-2020||World||55-year jail term for brother of Manchester terror attack bomber||Hashem Abedi, brother of the 2017 Manchester terror attack in which 23 people were killed, was on Thursday sentenced to at least 55 years in jail following a two-day hearing attended by relatives of those killed, most of whom were young attending a music concert by a teen pop music idol.Abedi, 23, will not be considered for release for 55 years, the judge said, adding that he was equally responsible for the attack as his brother, Salman Abedi, who died after detonating a shrapnel-laden homemade bomb after US singer Ariana Grande’s concert.Justice Jeremy Baker said: “Although Salman Abedi was directly responsible for detonating the explosive device that evening, it is clear that the defendant had taken an integral part not only in the planning of such an event but also in participating in its preparation”.“I am satisfied that, as the prosecution opened its case to the jury, the defendant and his brother were equally culpable for the deaths and injuries which were caused by the explosion…The defendant should clearly understand that the minimum term which he will serve in relation to the offences of murder is 55 years in custody”.“He may never be released, as that will only occur if and when the Parole Board is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that he should be confined. Even if he is released, he will remain on licence and subject to recall for the remainder of his life”, the judgement said.The judge noted that the two Libya-origin brothers gathered material needed for the improvised explosive device over six months preceding the attack. The explosive material was used in the device was Triacetone Triperoxide, known as TATP.“Neither of these materials was purchased by the two brothers in their own names, rather they were purchased in the names of members of their family or friends who were unaware of the reason why these purchases were being made”, the judgement noted.Hashem persuaded close acquaintances to purchase chemicals that could be used to manufacture explosives, sourced metal drums that were used to build bomb prototypes and bought a white Nissan Micra car that was used to store bomb components in Manchester while the brothers were in Libya.He also acted as his brother’s driver, travelling with Salman between addresses where the brothers manufactured explosives. The Greater Manchester Police said the judgement marked the end of a three-year quest for justice.Ian Hopkins, GMP chief constable, said: “Of course, for the families and friends of those twenty two souls whose lives were brutally cut short that night in May 2017, the pain will never fully diminish”.“I can only hope it brings some small measure of comfort to them that Abedi will spend the vast majority of the rest of his life behind bars – where he belongs”.During the court hearing, many relatives of the victims broke down as they recalled the incident and how they discovered that their children had died. Hashem, who was expected to be present in the court, refused to attend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/55-year-jail-term-for-brother-of-manchester-terror-attack-bomber/story-q4SOn4kELRSS86zbiaukyL.html
20-08-2020||World||Russia to begin Covid-19 vaccine trials on 40,000 people next week||Mass testing of Russia’s first potential Covid-19 vaccine to get domestic regulatory approve will involve more than 40,000 people and will be overseen by a foreign research body when it starts next week, backers of the project said on Thursday.These were the first details on the shape and size of the upcoming late-stage trial of the vaccine given by its developers, who are aiming to allay concerns among some scientists about the lack of data provided by Russia so far.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe vaccine, called “Sputnik V” in homage to the world’s first satellite launched by the Soviet Union, has been hailed as safe and effective by Russian authorities and scientists following two months of small-scale human trials, the results of which have not been made public yet.But Western experts have been more sceptical, warning against its use until all internationally approved testing and regulatory steps have been seen to be taken and proved a success.“A range of countries is running an information war against the Russian vaccine,” Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) that is backing the vaccine, told a briefing.The vaccine data will be published in an academic journal later this month, he said.Russia has received requests for up to a billion doses of the vaccine from around the world and has capacity to produce 500 million doses per year via manufacturing partnerships, he said.A director at Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute, which developed the vaccine, said 40,000 people would be involved in the mass testing at more than 45 medical centres around Russia.The data is being provided to the World Health Organization (WHO), Dmitriev said, and to several countries that are considering participating in the late-stage trial, including the United Arab Emirates, India, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines.Sputnik V has already received approval from domestic regulators, leading President Vladimir Putin and other officials to name Russia the first country to license a Covid-19 vaccine.The registration took place, however, ahead of the start of the large-scale trial, commonly known as a Phase III trial, considered by many as a necessary precursor to registration. At least four other potential Covid-19 vaccines are currently in Phase III trials globally, according to WHO records.Two-shot inoculationBut Russia’s early registration of the vaccine will permit it to begin administering it to people in high-risk groups, such as healthcare workers, alongside the late-stage trial, from October, Dmitriev said.He said the process would be conducted on a voluntary basis and participants would have regular medical check-ups.The trial itself will be supervised by a foreign clinical research organisation, Dmitriev said, ensuring the data collection is fully in line with international standards. He did not give details of the research organisation.The Sputnik V vaccine will involve a two-shot jab, using two different vectors of the human adenovirus. As this vector had a significant track record of use in previous vaccines, it had more historic data supporting its safety than some other potential Covid-19 vaccines, Dmitriev said.This has been echoed by researchers outside Russia. Ian Jones, a virologist at Britain’s Reading University, said of the Russian vaccine: “I think there is enough general background data on recombinant adenovirus-based vaccines to assume the vaccine itself will be safe at the usual doses.”Russian researchers have said that early trials showed the vaccine eliciting a significant immune response, but how long protection would last remains unclear.“Each person may react differently,” the head specialist in infectious diseases at the Russian Health Ministry, Vladimir Chulanov, was cited as saying in an interview by Gazeta.Ru on Thursday.“Some may develop very strong protective immunity, while others may not. In such cases, (coronavirus) infection may be possible, but the illness should, theoretically, have light symptoms. And in general the share of such people will be very small.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-to-begin-covid-19-vaccine-trials-on-40-000-people-next-week/story-s986H29oqnWLjSlfZZ882N.html

20-08-2020||World||PLA to deploy robot cooks, reduce oily and deep fried diet to cut food wastage||China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will deploy AI-driven robot cooks, eschew luxury cooking, cut down on deep-fried dishes and oily diets to reduce food wastage and introduce frugality in food habits of soldiers and officers, a state media report said on Thursday.These measures and the introduction of advanced cooking techniques including “high-energy saving stoves” and more steamed dishes are part of the PLA’s response to President Xi Jinping’s “clean plate campaign” clarion call – a renewed effort to reduce food wastage in China.Xi’s campaign comes in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has battered the Chinese economy into contraction this year, and the worst floods in years.Chinese official media, Xinhua, quoted Xi calling the issue of food waste “shocking and distressing” and said it was important to “…maintain a sense of crisis regarding food security”.The PLA has been among the first to respond to the boss’s campaign. Besides being the general secretary of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), Xi is the head of the Central Military Commission (CMC), which is the armed forces’ administrator.A report published in the PLA Daily said the PLA’s effort will be to “…create an atmosphere of shame in waste and pride in saving”.The focus will be to “Avoid over-processing and luxurious cooking, increase the number of cooked vegetables, reduce the variety of fried vegetables, and reduce the consumption of edible oil”.The CMC’s Logistic Support Department will oversee the changes, the report said.New technologies will be adapted to cook in a “green, intelligent” way, the report added.It includes exploring the “…application of advanced cooking equipment “…such as high-efficiency energy-saving stoves, universal steaming ovens, cooking robots, improve the mechanization and intelligent-level meal preparation, reduce cooking labour intensity, and reduce cooking energy consumption.”For the 2-million strong PLA, the improvement in nutrition has been gradual.“From 1978 to 2000, the PLA improved the nutrition standards mainly by raising the percentage of meat and vegetables in the personnel’s diet to help them meet the needs of training and fighting,” the state-run China Daily reported earlier.“Since 2000, the CMC has been focusing more on balanced nutrition. Over the past decade, the PLA has prepared different menus for officers and soldiers deployed at different posts to fully protect their health, and the ingredients for every dish are selected to ensure balanced nutrition.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pla-to-deploy-robot-cooks-reduce-oily-and-deep-fried-diet-to-cut-food-wastage/story-blOwQJAzyzOTXvFzSYa07M.html
20-08-2020||World||India likely to be key topic at Chinese, Pak FM strategic meet in Hainan||Fraught ties with India, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and the Covid-19 pandemic will likely be key topics of discussion at a strategic dialogue between Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi and Pakistani counterpart, Shah Mahmood Qureshi in the sunny south China province of Hainan on Thursday and Friday.The Chinese foreign ministry on Thursday formally announced that minister Wang, who is also the state councilor, will host Qureshi for the two-day second round of China-Pakistan strategic foreign ministers’ dialogue in Hainan, beginning today.Qureshi’s visit will be one of the first high-profile diplomatic visits to China as the country emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic; the Indonesian FM Retno Marsudi is already here on a two-day visit, which began Wednesday.The two top diplomats from China and Pakistan will meet at a time when both Beijing and Islamabad’s ties with New Delhi have taken a nosedive over the Sino-India border tension in eastern Ladakh, and (with Pakistan) on the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir and terrorism.“This time the strategic dialogue is highly relevant and the two sides will take the opportunity to discuss anti-epidemic cooperation, bilateral ties and other regional and international issues of mutual interest,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian announced at the regular ministry briefing on Thursday.“We believe this dialogue will help to enhance our strategic mutual trust, deepen our practical cooperation and strengthen our close coordination on international and regional affairs,” Zhao emphasised.The last China-Pakistan foreign ministers’ strategic dialogue was held in March, 2019. Zhao said it had led to consensus on several matters and played an important role in the development of bilateral relations.Zhao added that this dialogue mechanism is a platform for the two “iron brothers” to coordinate exchanges in various fields, discuss policy suggestions on the bilateral ties and enhance coordination and communication on international and regional issues.Also Read: Qureshi heads to Beijing after Imran Khan’s ‘Pak future with China’ remarkTackling the Covid-19 pandemic will also be in focus, Zhao added.Wang and Qureshi will discuss the progress of the CPEC, the flagship project under President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the ambitious connectivity venture that aims to connect China with Asia and Europe through infrastructure like highways and ports.“Indeed, the CPEC has not progressed as planned, with several large projects shelved and others still uncompleted. The Covid-19 pandemic is likely to slow things down further, even though Pakistan on Thursday approved the costliest project to date, a $6.8 billion upgrade to railway lines,” an analysis in the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post said in the first week of August.The bilateral meeting comes in the backdrop of Beijing in July, for the first time, urging Afghanistan, Nepal and Pakistan to carry “four-party cooperation” in fighting the coronavirus pandemic and continue to build projects under the BRI including the CPEC.Presiding over a virtual meeting with ministers from the three countries on July 27, Wang said the four should work together to extend the CPEC to Afghanistan.The four countries should “…Give full play to geographic advantages, strengthen exchanges and connections between the four countries and Central Asian countries, and maintain regional peace and stability,” Wang said.Wang and Qureshi are also likely to discuss ways in which China could play a bigger role in war-torn Afghanistan’s peace process.Interestingly in a television interview this week, Prime Minister Imran Khan said: “It should be clear that our future is connected with China… China also needs Pakistan very much. China is our only friend which has remained politically steadfast with Pakistan during good and bad times,” PM Khan had said.In the same interview with Pakistan’s Dunya News, Khan said Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to visit Pakistan later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-likely-to-be-key-topic-at-chinese-pak-fm-strategic-meet-in-hainan/story-rDbd275NgmE68w8chRDCKI.html
20-08-2020||World||Democrats pound their message: To oust Trump, you must vote||Former President Barack Obama warned that American democracy could falter if President Donald Trump is reelected, a stunning rebuke of his successor that was echoed by Kamala Harris at the Democratic Convention as she embraced her historic role as the first Black woman on a national political ticket.Obama, himself a barrier breaker as the nation’s first Black president, pleaded with voters Wednesday night to “embrace your own responsibility as citizens — to make sure that the basic tenets of our democracy endure. Because that’s what is at stake right now. Our democracy.”Throughout their convention, the Democrats have summoned a collective urgency about the dangers of Trump as president. In 2016, they dismissed and sometimes trivialized him. Now they are casting him as an existential threat to the country. The tone signals anew that the fall campaign between Trump and Joe Biden, already expected to be among the most negative of the past half-century, will be filled with rancor and recrimination.Yet on the third night of the Democrats’ four-day convention, party leaders also sought to put forward a cohesive vision of their values and policy priorities, highlighting efforts to combat climate change and tighten gun laws. They drew a sharp contrast with Trump, portraying him as cruel in his treatment of immigrants, disinterested in the nation’s climate crisis and in over his head on virtually all of the nation’s most pressing challenges.Democrats also demonstrated a hope that Biden, a 77-year-old white man, can revive the coalition that helped put Obama into office, with minorities, younger voters and college-educated women blunting Trump’s lock on many white and rural voters.The evening marked a celebration of the party’s leading women, including remarks from Hillary Clinton, the first woman to become a major ticket presidential nominee; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who challenged Biden during the primary and is now supporting his campaign.Harris, a 55-year-old California senator and the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, addressed race and equality in a personal way Biden cannot when he formally accepts his party’s presidential nomination on Thursday.“There is no vaccine for racism. We have got to do the work,” Harris said, her words emphatic though she was speaking in a largely empty arena near Biden’s Delaware home.“We’ve got to do the work to fulfill the promise of equal justice under law,” she added. “None of us are free until all of us are free.”Just 76 days before the election, Biden must energize the disparate factions that make up the modern Democratic Party — a coalition that spans generation, race and ideology. And this fall voters must deal with concerns over the Covid-19 pandemic that has created health risks for those who want to vote in person — and postal slowdowns for mail-in ballots, which Democrats blame on Trump.Democrats hope that Harris and Obama in particular can help bridge the divide between those reassured by Biden’s establishment credentials and those craving bolder change.The pandemic forced Biden’s team to abandon the traditional convention format in favor of an all-virtual affair that has eliminated much of the pomp and circumstance that typically defines political conventions. It was completely silent, for example, as Harris took the stage to make history at the Chase Center in downtown Wilmington. She was flanked by American flags but no family, and her audience consisted of a few dozen reporters and photographers.After two nights that featured several Republicans, the proceedings on Wednesday emphasized core Democratic values on areas like climate change and gun violence that particularly resonate with younger voters.On guns, Biden wants to repeal a law shielding firearm manufacturers from liability lawsuits, impose universal background checks for purchases and ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high capacity magazines. On climate, Biden has proposed a $2 trillion plan to invest in clean energy and end carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 2035, even though his proposals don’t go as far as activists’ preferred Green New Deal.Wednesday night, former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords reflected on her own journey of pain and recovery from a severe brain injury nearly a decade after being shot while meeting with constituents. She urged America to support Biden.“I struggle to speak, but I have not lost my voice,” Giffords said. “Vote, vote, vote.”It’s Trump’s turn next. The Republican president, who abandoned plans to host his convention in North Carolina and in Florida, is expected to break tradition and accept his nomination from the White House lawn.In the meantime, he’s seeking to take attention from Biden. Trump will stop near his Democratic rival’s birthplace of Scranton, Pennsylvania, on Thursday. He’s also participating in a prime-time interview with Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity.Hillary Clinton, Trump’s 2016 rival, implored Democrats to turn out in larger numbers in November to block his reelection.“For four years, people have said to me, ‘I didn’t realize how dangerous he was.’ ‘I wish I could go back and do it over.’ Or worst, ‘I should have voted,’” said Clinton, the first woman nominated president by a major party. “Well, this can’t be another woulda coulda shoulda election.”“Vote like our lives and livelihoods are on the line,” she added, “because they are.”Obama spoke harshly of Trump, too.“Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t,” Obama said, speaking from the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia, a backdrop chosen to reinforce what the former president sees as the dire stakes of the moment.“I have sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president,” Obama continued, describing Biden as his brother. “I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously.”Obama confidants say that the former president’s support for Biden is unequivocal, but he worries about enthusiasm among younger voters, particularly younger voters of color. Democrats concede that one of the reasons Trump won the presidency in 2016 was because those voters didn’t show up in the same large numbers as when Obama was on the ballot.Beyond the carefully scripted confines of the virtual convention, there were modest signs of tension between the moderate and progressive wings of Biden’s Democratic Party.In particular, some progressives complained that pro-Biden Republicans such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich have been featured more prominently than the party’s younger progressive stars like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Climate activists also complained that the party appeared ready to drop a provision in the platform that calls for an end to fossil fuel industry subsidies and tax breaks.Sen. Warren, a favorite of progressives for demanding bold change, spoke for around five minutes.And While Warren urged people to vote for Biden and gave a hearty endorsement for several of his economic and child care plans, she hinted that she would not retreat from her push for a more progressive agenda should her party retake the White House.“We all need to be in the fight to get Joe and Kamala elected,” Warren said. “And after November, we all need to stay in the fight to get big things done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-pound-their-message-to-oust-trump-you-must-vote/story-aMCxMq0yxJuu8DWJhafs3L.html
20-08-2020||World||Russia’s opposition leader Alexei Navalny in coma after alleged poisoning||Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny is in a coma and on a ventilator in a hospital intensive care unit after falling ill from suspected poisoning that his allies believe is linked to his political activity.The 44-year-old foe of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin felt unwell on a flight back to Moscow from Tomsk, a city in Siberia, and was taken to a hospital after the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk, Navalny’s spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said on Twitter.“He is in a coma in grave condition,” she said on Twitter.She also told the Echo Moskvy radio station that during the flight Navalny was sweating and asked her to talk to him so that he could “focus on a sound of a voice.” He then went to the bathroom and lost consciousness.Yarmysh said the politician must have consumed something from tea he drank at an airport cafe before boarding the plane early Thursday.“Doctors are saying the toxin was absorbed quicker with hot liquid,” she tweeted, adding that Navalny’s team called police to the hospital.Anatoliy Kalinichenko, deputy chief doctor of the Omsk hospital where the politician is being treated, told reporters that Navalny was in grave, yet stable condition. Kalinichenko said doctors are considering a variety of diagnosis, including poisoning, but refused to give details, citing a law preventing doctors from disclosing confidential patient information.State news agency Tass reported that police were not considering deliberate poisoning, citing an anonymous source in law enforcement who said “it is not unlikely that he drank or consumed something yesterday himself.”Yarmysh on Twitter bristled at that suggestion: “Of course. It’s just the tea was bad. This is what the state propaganda is going to do now — yell that there was no deliberate poisoning, he (did something) accidentally, he (did something) himself.”Last year, Navalny was rushed to a hospital from prison where he was serving a sentence following an administrative arrest, with what his team said was suspected poisoning. Doctors then said he had a severe allergic attack and discharged him back to prison the following day.Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption has been exposing graft among government officials, including some at the highest level. Last month, he had to shut the foundation after a financially devastating lawsuit from Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to the Kremlin.Belarus’ authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko accused Navalny last week of organizing unprecedented mass protests against his re-election that have rocked Russia’s ex-Soviet neighbor since Aug. 9. He did not, however, provide any evidence and that claim was one of many blaming foreign forces for the unrest.Like many other opposition politicians in Russia, Navalny has been frequently detained by law enforcement and harassed by pro-Kremlin groups. In 2017, he was attacked by several men who threw antiseptic in his face, damaging one eye.The most prominent member of Russia’s opposition, Navalny campaigned to challenge Putin in the 2018 presidential election, but was barred from running.He set up a network of campaign offices across Russia and has since been putting forward opposition candidates in regional elections, challenging members of Russia’s ruling party, United Russia. One of his associates in Khabarovsk, a city in Russia’s Far East that has been engulfed in mass protests against the arrest of the region’s governor, was detained just last week after calling for a strike at a rally.In the interview with Echo Moskvy, Yarmysh said she believed the suspected poisoning was connected to this year’s regional election campaign.Vyacheslav Gimadi, a lawyer with Navalny’s foundation, said the team is requesting Russia’s Investigative Committee open a criminal probe.“There is no doubt that Navalny was poisoned because of his political stance and activity,” Gimadi said in a tweet on Thursday.Navalny is not the first opposition figure to come down with a mysterious poisoning. In 2018, Pyotr Verzilov, a member of Russia’s protest group Pussy Riot, ended up in an intensive care unit after a suspected poisoning and had to be flown to Berlin for treatment. Opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza was hospitalized with poisoning symptoms twice — in 2015 and 2017. Both said they believed they were poisoned for their political activity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-s-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-in-coma-after-alleged-poisoning/story-4Nl6uwySMK5wfj8UIQDEgI.html
20-08-2020||World||China says Taiwan hacking allegations are ‘malicious slander’||China on Thursday branded as “malicious slander” accusations from Taiwan about hacking attacks linked to the Chinese government, further adding to tensions between Beijing and Taipei.Taiwan has been urging its people to be alert for what officials call “omnipresent infiltration” from China, ranging from Beijing-backed media campaigns to cyberattacks, against the island that China considers its territory.This week, Taiwan said hacking groups connected to the Chinese government had attacked at least 10 government agencies and some 6,000 email accounts of government officials in an “infiltration” to steal important data.Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian poured scorn on the allegation.“The criticisms from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities are malicious slander, pure and simple,” Zhao told reporters, referring to Taiwan’s ruling party. “China is a staunch defender of cybersecurity, and is one of the victims of hacking attacks.”The Chinese government routinely denies involvement in hacking and says it punishes those who do it.The hacking allegations come during a period of growing strains between the island and China.China has stepped up its military activity near Taiwan and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-taiwan-hacking-allegations-are-malicious-slander/story-GUv7qjWulEDAc8zDfRBRaM.html
20-08-2020||World||Hong Kong government slams United States’ decision to suspend treaties||The Hong Kong government on Thursday condemned the US’s decision to suspend bilateral extradition and tax exemption treaties with the semi-autonomous Chinese city, saying it was being used as a pawn in geopolitics.On Wednesday, the US suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong, becoming the latest country to do so after Canada, Australia and Britain suspended such agreements. The US also suspended a bilateral agreement with Hong Kong on the reciprocal tax exemptions on income derived from the international operation of ships.“The US’ unilateral decision reflects its disrespect for bilateralism and multilateralism under the current administration and should be condemned by the international community,” the statement said.“The HKSAR Government strongly objects to and deplores the US’ action, which is widely seen as a move to create troubles in China-US relationship, using Hong Kong as a pawn.” The government said that the bilateral agreements were not preferential treatment given to Hong Kong, but were negotiated in good faith to benefit both parties.Also read: United States suspends extradition and tax agreements with Hong KongHong Kong has faced mounting international pressure over the implementation of a national security law, approved by Beijing, which has been viewed as an attack on the “one country, two systems” framework under which the city has been governed since its return to China in 1997.Jeffrey Bader, a former US diplomat, said the actions taken so far are unlikely to dissuade China.“Hong Kong is an issue that’s going to be with us for quite some time, and in a frustrating way,” said Bader.“It’s part of China and things that are internal to China, even if they have an international dimension, like Hong Kong and Xinjiang, the Chinese have a demonstrated disdain for outside opinion and are inflexible in reaction to it.” Separately on Thursday, lawmakers from Hong Kong’s largest pro-democracy party, the Democratic Party also said they planned to hold a poll and debate to determine whether they will continue serving in the legislature another year, following the postponement of elections due to the coronavirus outbreak.Opinions within the pro-democracy camp differ on whether lawmakers should boycott the extension of their term or stay to have a voice in the legislature. Lawmakers in favor of boycotting say staying sets a precedent to delay elections.“The public opinion is still very divided, we want the solidarity of the people,” said James To, a member of the Democratic Party, at a news conference. “We would prepare at least one debate in order … to have a comprehensive range of arguments and points so that the whole society can decide.” The elections were to be held in September but have been postponed a year after the city’s virus outbreak grew again.Democratic Party lawmakers did not specify a time frame or details of the public poll.Several pro-democracy lawmakers have already spoken out against serving another year in the legislature.Ray Chan, chairman of the People Power party, said on Twitter he would boycott the “illegitimate” extension and that accepting the appointment would mean accepting the authority of city leader Carrie Lam’s government and would allow Beijing to “arbitrarily change the term” of legislators.“It’ll open the floodgate for all kinds of meddling for years to come,” said Chan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-government-slams-united-states-decision-to-suspend-treaties/story-4jUaVO1rWabKZ8lihnzp6K.html
20-08-2020||World||North Korea to unveil new economic plans in January party meeting||North Korea will hold a rare ruling party congress in January where leader Kim Jong Un will announce a new five-year plan to develop the country’s dismal economy ravaged by US-led sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic, state media said Thursday.The plans were confirmed Wednesday during a plenary meeting of the Workers’ Party’s decision-making Central Committee where Kim acknowledged economic shortcomings caused by “unexpected and inevitable challenges in various aspects and the situation in the region surrounding the Korean Peninsula.” The report by Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency didn’t directly mention nuclear diplomacy with the United States, which has stalled over disagreements in exchanging sanctions relief and denuclearization steps.The Workers’ Party last convened for a full congress in 2016, which was its first in 36 years, where Kim announced his initial five-year national development plan, which included goals for improving power supply and increasing agricultural and manufacturing production.Entering the plan’s final year, Kim during the Central Committee’s last plenary meeting in December declared a “frontal breakthrough” against sanctions while urging his nation to stay resilient in the struggle for economic self-reliance.But experts say the Covid-19 crisis has clearly derailed some of Kim’s major economic goals after North Korea imposed a lockdown that significantly reduced trade with China — its major ally and economic lifeline — and likely hampered its ability to mobilize its workforce.It’s also possible Kim could use the party congress, which would take place after the US presidential election in November, to announce a new foreign policy approach toward the United States and rival South Korea.Kim’s economic setbacks have left him with nothing to show for his high-stakes summitry with President Donald Trump, whom he first met in June 2018 in Singapore, where they issued an aspirational statement on a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing when and how it would occur.Their diplomacy deteriorated last year in Vietnam, after their second meeting, when the Americans rejected North Korea’s demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.The North has recently said it has no immediate intent to resume talks with Washington, vowing not to gift Trump with meetings he could boast as foreign policy achievements unless it gets something substantial in return.Some experts say the North would likely avoid serious negotiations with the United States before the election as it wouldn’t want to make any major concessions when there’s a chance US leadership could change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-to-unveil-new-economic-plans-in-january-party-meeting/story-JeHE4z3eCFPXXZfJNa64FK.html
20-08-2020||World||Angela Merkel hosts Greta Thunberg for talks on climate crisis||German Chancellor Angela Merkel hosted Greta Thunberg and other leading Fridays for Future activists in Berlin on Thursday for talks on the EU’s climate goals, with the campaigners expected to condemn “political inaction”.Merkel said Swedish 17-year-old Thunberg and her co-campaigners Luisa Neubauer from Germany and Belgium’s Anuna De Wever and Adelaide Charlier had requested the meeting and she was “pleased” to welcome them to the chancellery.The activists warned ahead of the talks that they were dismayed at the lack of progress in fighting climate change despite lofty promises by European governments.“When it comes to action we are still in a state of denial. The climate and ecological crisis has never once been treated as a crisis,” they wrote in a letter published in Germany’s Der Spiegel and Britain’s The Guardian on Wednesday.“We will tell Merkel that she must face up to the climate emergency -- especially as Germany now holds the presidency of the European Council. Europe has a responsibility to act.”The meeting comes exactly two years after Thunberg, then 15, started skipping school to strike outside the Swedish parliament to dramatise the need for action against global warming.The strike movement has since spread across the world and Merkel has repeatedly expressed her admiration for the masses of young people demonstrating on Fridays for more climate protection.But the activists say nothing concrete has changed.“Effectively, we have lost another two crucial years to political inaction,” they wrote, calling on countries to urgently halt all fossil fuel investments.Despite its green reputation abroad, Germany is struggling to meet its own climate targets as the country remains heavily reliant on coal because of its decision to phase out nuclear energy after the 2011 Fukushima disaster.Europe’s top economy was widely expected to miss its goal of reducing climate-heating greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent this year compared with 1990 levels.But a government report on Wednesday said the coronavirus could unexpectedly help it meet the target after all, after the pandemic wrecked economic activity and lowered demand for polluting coal. Germany has promised to abandon coal-generated power by 2038, a date considered far too late by climate activists.The European Union as a whole aims to achieve carbon neutrality -- or net zero greenhouse emissions -- by 2050.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-hosts-greta-thunberg-for-talks-on-climate-crisis/story-ioE8qPBjOXBe6ji7gRcU2M.html
20-08-2020||World||Qureshi heads to Beijing after Imran Khan’s ‘Pak future with China’ remark||Pakistan foreign minister Makhdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi is leaving for Beijing for ‘strategic level’ discussions with his Chinese counterparts on Thursday, days after Prime Minister Imran Khan underscored that Pakistan’s future is connected with that of its long-time ally China.Qureshi will be accompanied by a team of diplomats including foreign secretary Sohail Mahmood, people familiar with the development said.Qureshi is scheduled to meet China’s foreign minister and state councillor Wang Yi. On the agenda, according to reports in China and Islamabad, are discussions linked to belt and road projects, bilateral ties and preparations for President Xi Jinping’’s visit to Pakistan expected later this year. Qureshi is also expected to seek support for Pakistan’s stand on Kashmir and discuss the India-China standoff in east Ladakh.PM Imran Khan had underscored the importance of ties with China this week when he, in a television interview, insisted that reports about breakdown in relations with Saudi Arabia were “baseless”. On China, PM Khan said, Pakistan was strengthening ties with China. “It should be clear that our future is connected with China… China also needs Pakistan very much,” he said.“China is our only friend which has remained politically steadfast with Pakistan during good and bad times,” PM Khan had said.Like when Saudi kingdom signalled its displeasure by demanding that Pakistan return $ 1 billion out of a $ 3 billion loan extended by Riyadh in 2018, Pakistan had turned to China. Also Watch | ‘Pakistan is the nerve centre of terrorism’: India’s envoy to United NationsQureshi’s visit to Beijing comes at a time he has been under attack in Islamabad, both from within and without the Imran Khan government, for his broadside at Saudi Arabia for not convening the Organisation of Islamic Conference, or OIC meeting of foreign ministers on Kashmir.Pakistan army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa made a quick visit to Saudi Arabia this week in an effort to smooth relations between Islamabad and Riyadh.Qureshi had threatened to approach other Muslim countries for a conference on Kashmir outside the OIC platform if Saudi Arabia did not play ball, a remark that did not go down well in Riyadh that last year prevailed upon Pakistan at the last minute to absent itself from a joint attempt by Turkey and Malaysia to create a new forum of Islamic countries. Foreign ministers of Malaysia, Turkey, Qatar, Iran, and Indonesia attended this meeting.People familiar with the development in New Delhi said China has been pushing Pakistan to play a lead role in the OIC with support of Turkey and Malaysia.Gen Bajwa, according to diplomats in New Delhi and Riyadh, is learnt to have conveyed Imran Khan’s regret at Qureshi’s comment and asked Saudi Arabia to agree to a meeting of the smaller group within the OIC, formally called the OIC contact group on Kashmir. From all available indications, Gen Bajwa didn’t get far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/qureshi-heads-for-beijing-today-after-imran-khan-s-pak-future-with-china-remark/story-14n7ENI2yVovD5SzXdKcTI.html
20-08-2020||World||Indian-Americans describe Kamala Harris’ nomination as quantum leap forward for the community||Several prominent Indian-Americans have applauded Kamala Harris formally becoming the Democratic Party nominee to be the US vice-president, describing it as a historic moment in American politics and a quantum leap forward for the community. Harris, 55, scripted history on Wednesday by becoming the first Black and Indian descent individual to be nominated as a vice-presidential candidate of a major political party.“Kamala’s story is the American story. Her acceptance of the vice-presidential nomination is a quantum leap forward for Indian-Americans, showing that we are taking our place in American history books,” said Neil Makhija, executive director of IMPACT, a leading Indian American advocacy organisation.After four years of incendiary anti-immigrant rhetoric coming from the White House, this milestone is a welcome moment that immigrant communities of all backgrounds can celebrate, he said.“Asian Americans are the fastest-growing bloc in the country, and Kamala’s candidacy is energising and mobilising our communities in a way that will have lasting reverberations for decades to come,” Makhija said.Eminent Indian-American and Democratic fundraiser Frank Islam said that Kamala Harris is not only a great choice from an electoral standpoint but also a morally sound choice.“Kamala Harris is galvanising the African American community, Indian Americans and women in general,” he said.“In 2016, America had a chance to elect a woman as the commander in chief. Now the country gets to elect a woman of colour — an African American and Indian American woman — as its Vice President. I am confident that this time around, America will get it right,” Islam said.Describing it as “truly historic moment for Indian-Americans” community leader Ajay Bhutoria from California said that it gives the community great pride and joy to be able to witness this important moment in history.“No matter where your parents come from, no matter what race, religion you belong to, if you work hard and have the right values and character you can rise to become the vice president and one day the President of the United States. Everything is possible for people who work hard in this country. Merit is recognised and rewarded,” he said.“Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have the experience and leadership to lead us out of the economic and healthcare crisis which the Trump administration has burdened us with,” Bhutoria said. “Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the right partners who will move America forward and bring India and the US closer. Under their leadership Indo US relations will be Stronger Together!” he added. This was a historic moment for the entire community, a profound reminder of just how far the diaspora has travelled in American public life in such a short amount of time, Ronak D Desai, a scholar at Harvard University’s Lakshmi Mittal South Asia Institute, said. Although this is the latest milestone for the Indian-American community, it will certainly not be the last, he said.“Senator Harris proudly declared that her Indian heritage is an integral part of who she is, that her progress is the community’s progress and that her story is the story of both the American dream and the Indian diaspora. It is so utterly remarkable and yet so familiarly common at the same time,” Desai said.The story of Dr Shyamla Gopalan, Harris’ mother, and the ways she shaped her daughter is a poignant one that resonates deeply with the Indian-American community, he said, adding her journey is the community’s journey. “And her daughter represents the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of so many within the community,” Desai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-americans-describe-kamala-harris-nomination-as-quantum-leap-forward-for-the-community/story-m0zvXoKXWmPwlS3xJEkEnM.html
20-08-2020||World||‘He spied on my campaign, and got caught’: Trump tweets all-caps rebuke to Obama||The third night of the Democratic National Convention in the United States proved to be the most fiery one. And President Donald Trump was also tuned in.His Twitter account suggested so, as Trump live-tweeted his rebuke to predecessor Barack Obama for his comments on his presidency.“I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously; that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care. But he never did,” Obama said in his criticism of Trump’s tenure.“Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t,” Obama added.“He spied on my campaign, and got caught,” Trump said on Twitter in all caps. “Why did he refuse to endorse slow Joe until it was all over, and even then was very late? Why did he try to get him not to run??” the US President went on. HE SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN, AND GOT CAUGHT!Obama listed failures of Trump administration because he didn’t take his job seriously. “170,000 Americans dead.

Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before.”“Tonight, I am asking you to believe in Joe and Kamala’s ability to lead this country out of dark times and build it back better,” said Obama.After avoiding direct criticism for most of Trump’s first term, the scathing broadsides from Obama constituted an unusually harsh assessment of one president by another. His assertion that Trump, a Republican, is incapable of meeting the demands of the presidency echoed the remarks from his wife, Michelle Obama, on Monday, that Trump “simply cannot be who we need him to be.”Thursday was also the day when Indian-origin US senator Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination to be Joe Biden’s runnin mate for the November presidential election.Harris is the first Black woman on a major party presidential ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/he-spied-on-my-campaign-and-got-caught-trump-tweets-all-caps-rebuke-to-obama/story-y2XmRaTxGyjlDuG5OkDUSO.html
20-08-2020||World||Trump touts convalescent plasma as a coronavirus treatment||US President Donald Trump on Wednesday touted the use of convalescent plasma as a treatment for Covid-19 and suggested a reported decision by regulators to put on hold an emergency authorization for its use could be politically motivated.“I’ve heard fantastic things about convalescent plasma,” Trump told a briefing.An emergency approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of blood plasma as a coronavirus treatment has been put on hold over concerns the data backing it was too weak, the New York Times reported on Wednesday.“It could be a political decision,” Trump said.“You have a lot of people over there that don’t want to rush things because they want to do it after November 3,” he said, referring to the presidential election.“I’ve heard numbers way over 50% success. And people are dying and we should have it approved if it’s good and I’m hearing it’s good. I heard from people at the FDA that it’s good,” he said.The FDA did not respond to a request for comment. People who survive an infectious disease such as Covid-19 are left with blood plasma containing antibodies the body’s immune system created to fight off a virus. This can be transfused into newly infected patients to try to aid recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-touts-convalescent-plasma-as-a-coronavirus-treatment/story-7rp0apmFaFfsI9c6uhPZpN.html
20-08-2020||World||Iraq PM to meet Trump with US troops on the agenda||Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi will meet US President Donald Trump for the first time in Washington on Thursday, with the presence of American troops in the country at the top of his agenda.The meeting comes as attacks on American targets by pro-Iranian fighters have been on the rise, and with Tehran and Washington competing for influence in Iraq, the gulf between pro-Iranian factions and Baghdad’s US-friendly premier is growing.Kadhemi, who took office in May, faces challenges from factions of the Hashed al-Shaabi, a coalition of Iraqi Shiite paramilitary groups with close ties to Iran.The Hashed al-Shaabi is officially integrated into the Iraqi state, and its political representatives have called for the expulsion of the 5,000 US troops deployed in the country as part of anti-jihadist efforts.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that “armed groups not under the full control of the prime minister have impeded our progress,” calling for them to “be replaced by local police as soon as possible.”Pompeo -- who was speaking at a press conference with Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein -- appeared to be referring to Shiite paramilitary groups, though he did not identify them by name.Asked about the plan for cutting the 5,000 US troops now in Iraq, Pompeo said he had no numbers and urged people “not to focus on that.”On the troop issue, a senior administration official said: “There are no hard fast timelines, and there are no hard fast numbers but that certainly would be part of the discussion, as we evaluate what Iraq security requirements are, and what the United States believes it can do.”The official described “armed groups” as “a persistent problem that challenges Iraqi security, has threatened US forces’ interests in the region, and certainly it’s a challenge to Iraq sovereignty.”“We think that Iraq’s internal security needs are best met by forces that are, first and foremost, under the sovereign control the government of Iraq,” the official said.Pro-Iranian factions were hit hard by Washington’s assassination in January of one of their top chiefs, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, in a strike that also killed top Iranian commander General Qasem Soleimani.ATTACKS ON THE RISEThe Hashed al-Shaabi denies any connection to a recent spate of anti-US attacks, but videos and claims on social media hint at its involvement, through groups operating under other names.Kadhemi has angered armed groups by seizing border posts where they ran lucrative smuggling networks and imposed taxes on traders.Attacks have risen in recent weeks, with the Iraqi army reporting another rocket attack on Tuesday evening targeting Baghdad airport, where US troops are based. The projectile did not cause damage or casualties, the army said.From October to the end of July, Iraqi armed factions carried out 39 rocket attacks against American interests in the country.But after the White House earlier this month confirmed that Trump would meet Kadhemi, the pace intensified.Between August 4 and 18, 14 bomb and rocket attacks targeted Iraqi logistics convoys for the US military, bases housing US soldiers and the US embassy.While the impact has been limited, the attacks have served as a show of strength.After an attack on a convoy in Iraq’s south, a man was arrested in possession of bombs and a Hashed al-Shaabi military ID card that allowed him to cross checkpoints without a search, an intelligence source told AFP.At the end of June, 14 fighters from the Hezbollah Brigades, a Hashed al-Shaabi faction, were arrested for attacks on Americans.Three days later, 13 were released on the decision of a Hashed military judge.Kadhemi over the weekend hosted Iranian commander Esmail Qaani, Soleimani’s replacement, telling him that “no country” could interfere in Iraqi-US relations, a source close to the discussions told AFP.The relationship between Baghdad and Tehran, meanwhile, must be “state-to-state and not via militias,” the source quoted him as saying, adding that groups that “draw their strength from Iran” had bombed Iraqi targets and embezzled money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-pm-to-meet-trump-with-us-troops-on-the-agenda/story-hYWqv0pHsQvaXJG0bR7q0J.html
20-08-2020||World||Taiwan says China behind cyberattacks on government agencies, emails||Taiwan said on Wednesday hacking groups linked to the Chinese government had attacked at least 10 government agencies and some 6,000 email accounts of government officials in an “infiltration” to steal important data.Democratic Taiwan has been urging its people to be alert for what officials call “omnipresent infiltration” from China, involving from Beijing-backed media campaigns to cyberattacks, against the island that China considers its territory.“Chinese hacking groups have been infiltrating government agencies and their information service providers for a long time,” said the deputy director of the Taiwan Investigation Bureau’s Cyber Security Investigation Office, Liu Chia-zung.“They were aiming to acquire important government documents and data,” Liu told reporters. “Some government data might have been leaked. This has posed a great threat.”The attacks, which started as early as 2018, targeted at least 10 government agencies and the email accounts of some 6,000 officials, Liu’s office said, adding it had not been able to identify what data has been stolen as the hackers had concealed their tracks.Among those who were attacked and infiltrated by two Chinese hacking groups were at least four Taiwan tech companies that had been providing information services to the government, the office said.China’s Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment. The Chinese government routinely denies involvement in hacking and says it punishes those who do it.Liu said Taiwan believed the two hacking groups involved, Blacktech and Taidoor, were backed by the Chinese Communist Party. They targeted loopholes in the systems provided by the Taiwan government’s information service providers, he said.Government agencies should increase scrutiny of their providers, Liu said.He said his office was investigating service supply chains to see if any Taiwan companies or individuals have worked with the Chinese hackers.News of the hacking comes during a period of heightened tension between the island and China.China has stepped up its military activity near Taiwan and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-says-china-behind-cyberattacks-on-government-agencies-emails/story-4jk4Qe9lcdeI8poCSUuSTP.html
20-08-2020||World||Virtual prayer and meditation session held for Hindu delegates at Democratic convention||The ongoing Democratic National Convention on Wednesday organised a virtual prayer and meditation session for Hindu delegates and members attending the four-day event.The session was led by Anurima Bhargava, vice chair, US Commission on International Religious Freedom, Harini Krishnan, Indian classical vocalist and South Asians For Biden state director, Neel Gonuguntla, South Asians For Biden state director and community leader, and Ajay Tejasvi, AAPI Faith Leadership Council and Art of Living instructor.Murali Balaji, South Asians For Biden communication team and community leader, and Ajay Bhutoria, AAPI Leadership Council For Biden and National Finance Committee member, also led the prayer session.“The DNC’s inclusion and recognition of Hindus at the convention is particularly meaningful on the day that Senator Kamala Harris -- who has Indian heritage -- accepts her nomination as vice presidential candidate,” Dewan said.“Today, meditation has become an essential tool for mental health. In the midst of the many challenges that modern life throws at us, it is important find a sense of calm and clarity of thought to truly be successful in life,” Tejasvi added.Speaking on the occasion, Bhutoria said that earlier this year, he had hosted Dr Jill Biden at his home in California and had presented her a statue of Lord Ganesha.“I Pray to Lord Ganesha and Hanumanji to remove all obstacles from the path of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to get elected,” he said.“We want to be able to worship in temples, gurdwaras, mosques and churches without the fear of racism and hate crimes. We want to leave a better planet for our next generation, to grow our small businesses, and for our family and friends to be welcome here as immigrants,” Bhutoria said.“So, I am in this fight with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to restore the soul of our nation for all of us. Joe Biden is and will be the best friend of India and Indo-Americans. US and Joe Biden share the same values - ‘Family is most important and it all starts with the family’,” he said.“One of my favorite pictures of Joe Biden and Dr Jill Biden is at Raj Ghat, paying homage to Mahatma Gandhi during his four-day India trip under the Obama–Biden Administration,” Bhutoria added.“South Asians for Biden recognises that Hindus will be instrumental in getting the Biden-Harris ticket elected in November,” Dewan said.“Leaders like Harini Krishnan, Dr Murali Balaji, and Neelima Gonuguntla, who were among the individuals who led the DNC’s prayer event, will be crucial in persuading the Hindu faith community that Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris are the best choice this November,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virtual-prayer-and-meditation-session-held-for-hindu-delegates-at-democratic-convention/story-qEQu3zgVFFX1wcVF0TteJM.html
20-08-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine won’t be mandatory in US, says Anthony Fauci||Anthony Fauci, the United States’ top infectious diseases official, said Wednesday the government wouldn’t make any future Covid-19 vaccine obligatory for the general public -- though local jurisdictions could make it mandatory for some groups, like children.“You don’t want to mandate and try and force anyone to take a vaccine. We’ve never done that,” said Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, during a video talk organized by George Washington University.“You can mandate for certain groups of people like health workers, but for the general population you can’t” he added, citing the example of the National Institutes of Health, where health workers can’t treat patients without a flu shot.Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison hours earlier announced that coronavirus vaccines, once approved, would be mandatory for everyone in his country, barring medical exemptions.But the United States’ decentralized system of government, and anti-vaccine sentiments that have been building for decades, had in any case made a program of mandatory immunization unlikely.“It would be unenforceable and not appropriate,” said Fauci.This however doesn’t prevent states from making a vaccine mandatory for children to attend school, as is already the case for certain diseases such as measles, though some are exempt for medical or religious reasons.At any rate, the administration of President Donald Trump has pre-ordered hundreds of millions of vaccine doses from six companies, and these will be distributed for free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-won-t-be-mandatory-in-us-says-anthony-fauci/story-qmrv1BZxA2vQDWKGrlDA8I.html
20-08-2020||World||Kamala Harris to get vice presidential nod, make history at Democratic convention||US Senator Kamala Harris will make history when she accepts the Democratic nomination for vice president on Wednesday, saying the country is at an inflection point and “we can do better” than four more years of President Donald Trump.The first Black woman and Asian-American on a major U.S. presidential ticket, Harris can be expected to unleash her prosecutorial skills at the Democratic National Convention as Joe Biden’s running mate in the November 3 election.Former U.S. President Barack Obama also will speak, telling the convention that Trump’s failures as his successor had led to 170,000 people dead from the coronavirus, millions of lost jobs and America’s reputation badly diminished in the world, according to excerpts of his speech released by organizers.On the third day of a four-day convention, Harris will aggressively press the case against Trump and for Biden, likely speaking directly to millions of women, young Americans and voters of color, constituencies Democrats need if Biden is to defeat the Republican Trump.“We’re at an inflection point. The constant chaos leaves us adrift. The incompetence makes us feel afraid. The callousness makes us feel alone. It’s a lot. And here’s the thing: We can do better and deserve so much more,” Harris says in excerpts of her prepared speech.As the largely virtual proceedings began, Harris made a brief surprise appearance to urge Americans to develop a plan for voting and thwart any voter suppression efforts that could hinder casting a ballot.Democrats have been alarmed by Trump’s frequent criticism of mail-in voting, and by cost-cutting changes at the U.S. Postal Service instituted by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a Trump supporter, that could delay mail during the election crunch.DeJoy said recently he would delay those changes until after the election.“Why is there so much effort to silence us? When we vote, things change,” Harris said. “Each of us need a plan, a voting plan.” She offered a number where people could text to get help voting.In excerpts made available ahead of time, Obama, whose vice president was Biden from 2009-2017, says he had hoped that Trump would take the job seriously, come to feel the weight of the office, and discover a reverence for American democracy.“Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t. And the consequences of that failure are severe. 170,000 Americans dead. Millions of jobs gone. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before,” Obama was expected to say.The coronavirus has complicated life with many Americans expecting to cast votes by mail to avoid crowds at the polls. Trump has repeatedly and without evidence attacked mail voting as susceptible to fraud, though voting by mail is nothing new in American political life.Speaking at a virtual fundraiser on Wednesday with elected officials from Pennsylvania, Biden repeated his calls for unifying the country.“This moment requires us to sort of rise together and get everyone we know involved, remember who we are as a nation, to build back a better future. That’s what America always does in a crisis,” Biden said.CHILD OF IMMIGRANTSIn her speech later, Harris will have an opportunity to outline her background as a child of immigrants from India and Jamaica who as a district attorney, state attorney general, U.S. senator from California and now vice-presidential candidate shattered gender and racial barriers.She gained prominence in the Senate for her exacting interrogations of Trump nominees, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Attorney General Bill Barr.Biden, 77, named Harris, 55, as his running mate last week to face incumbents Trump, 74, and Vice President Mike Pence, 61. She will deliver her speech from an austere hotel ballroom in Biden’s hometown of Wilmington, Delaware.Obama will speak to the convention live from the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia. He will speak about how he worked closely with Biden, his vice president, to lead the country out of the last recession, according to the excerpts.The first two nights of the four-day Democratic convention showcased elder statesmen and rising stars in the party who said Biden’s election would repair a pandemic-battered United States and put an end to the chaos of Trump’s four years in office.But the party comprises a range of ideological positions.Some on the left complained that Republicans like former Ohio Governor John Kasich, who is backing Biden, a moderate Democrat, over Trump, were given more air time than the party’s own progressive wing.U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a leading progressive voice from New York, had one minute for her remarks on Tuesday night.The Republican National Convention, also largely virtual, takes place next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-get-vice-presidential-nod-make-history-at-democratic-convention/story-8z57eCxEmbsOEFmvKMrrtN.html
20-08-2020||World||California wildfires chase people from homes into smoky air||Crews worked in blistering heat Wednesday to beat back wildfires that ignited across Northern California, sending thousands of people from their homes into smoky air and killing a pilot on a firefighting mission.Hundreds of fires are burning across California, including including 23 major fires or groups of fires that Gov. Gavin Newsom blamed on “this extraordinary weather we’re experiencing and all of these lightning strikes.” He said the state has recorded nearly 11,000 lightning strikes in 72 hours and knows of 367 fires.Ash and smoke filled the air in San Francisco, which is surrounded by wildfires burning to the north, east and south. The LNU Lightning fire is made up of several fires in five counties north of San Francisco, including in Vacaville, and had consumed 72 square miles (186 square kilometers).Police and firefighters went door-to-door before dawn in a frantic scramble to warn residents to evacuate as flames encroached on Vacaville, a city of about 100,000 between San Francisco and Sacramento. At least 50 structures were destroyed, including some homes, and 50 were damaged.“This is an incredibly emotional and stressful time for most of us who’ve endured a number of wildfires over the last few years,” said Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick.John Gardiner, 60, stayed up all night after receiving an alert from a neighbor of oncoming fire just before midnight. His house and neighbors’ homes were still safe, but he worried that could change with crews anticipating hot winds.“It was incredible — things swirling, winds just whipping through like a howling, ripping sound and then you could hear explosions going off,” he said. “You can taste smoke in your mouth.”Victoria Gregorich, 54, said her family loaded up the car and left their Vacaville home after deputies came around 12:30 a.m. to tell them to evacuate. The fire destroyed her greenhouse, but the house was spared. Her neighbors were not so lucky.“It’s devastating,” she said. “I just thank God we have our home.”Elvis Castaneda, 28, and his father, Silverio, spent the night moving ranching equipment to a safer location, removing vegetation and making firebreaks with their tractor around friends’ properties.“We couldn’t see the flames, but the sky was pretty orange, and we knew it was coming our way,” Elvis Castaneda said.He said he drove home at 3 a.m. and started packing documents, photos, passports and his guns after hearing that his girlfriend’s family, who live 2 miles (3 kilometers) away, were told to evacuate and move all their farm animals to safety. He got the order to leave after dawn Wednesday.The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in a statement that the helicopter that crashed was fighting a wildfire in the central part of the state and the pilot was the only one aboard.In eastern San Francisco Bay, a cluster of 20 separate lightning-sparked fires called the SCU Lightning complex was threatening about 1,400 structures in rugged terrain with dense brush. The fires have torched 133 square miles (344 square kilometers).To the south of San Francisco in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties, about 22,000 people were ordered to evacuate because of a fire burning in dense wooded parkland that threatened communities, Cal Fire spokesman Jonathan Cox said.About 22 fires are part of the complex and most had been burning in relatively remote, dense brush until strong winds overnight Tuesday pushed them into more populated areas, merging some of the fires together.Resources are strapped, he said, given the number of fires burning in California.“We’re in the unfortunate position where firefighters are going to be spending several days out on the fire line,” he said. “It’s grueling, it’s exhausting.”Christopher Godley, Sonoma County’s emergency management director, also conceded that resources are thin.“It’s difficult to second-guess what the fire commanders are doing with their aircraft. But it’s not like last year when we saw just a huge wealth of resources flowing into the county,” he said. “It is what it is.”The cluster of wine country fires threaten an area that only last year grappled with another massive blaze that forced 200,000 to flee — a task made more complicated this year because of the pandemic.South of Carmel, nearly 50 miles (80 kilometers) of scenic Highway 1 along the coast was closed due to fires.In Southern California, an 8-day-old blaze grew to more than 40 square miles (100 square kilometers) near Lake Hughes in northern Los Angeles County mountains.Chewing through century-old fir, oak and pine, the fire continued to be a threat to 4,570 structures after destroying a dozen. Dangerously hot weather and rough terrain challenged firefighters’ efforts to increase containment, currently estimated at 38%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-wildfires-chase-people-from-homes-into-smoky-air/story-ARLpYep5DRoumtDCKNNGgJ.html
20-08-2020||World||Closing colleges amid Covid-19 outbreaks ‘could cost lives’, says Donald Trump||President Donald Trump has blasted universities that have cancelled in-person classes amid coronavirus outbreaks, saying the move could ultimately cost lives rather than saving them.Raising the issue at a White House press briefing on Wednesday, Trump said the virus is akin to the seasonal flu for college students and that students pose a greater safety threat at home with older family members than on college campuses. He cited no evidence to support either contention, and the White House did not respond to a request for information about on what Trump based his remarks.Also read: Trump administration rescinds foreign students orderHealth experts have said the novel coronavirus appears to be deadlier than the seasonal flu and more easily transmitted. In addition, most college students are 18 and older and thus considered adults, who are more susceptible to coronavirus illnesses than children.“It’s significantly safer for students to live with other young people than to go home and spread the virus to older Americans,” Trump said.While older adults face greater risks from Covid-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last month that otherwise healthy young adults can experience lingering symptoms, including cough, fatigue and body aches, for two to three weeks.Trump’s comments follow recent suspensions of in-person instruction at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and at the University of Notre Dame. UNC announced Monday that, after a surge in cases during the first week of classes, all undergraduate courses would shift online. A day later, Notre Dame canceled campus classes for two weeks amid a sharp increase in cases.Also read: Amid Covid-19 crisis, Donald Trump tells schools to ‘reopen or you may lose federal funds’Those schools’ struggles have prompted some other colleges to backtrack on plans for campus classes. Michigan State University told students Tuesday to stay at home for the fall term, citing rising virus cases and the recent experiences of “other institutions.” Clusters of cases at UNC, Notre Dame and elsewhere have been tied to off-campus parties, in some cases at fraternity houses. In his comments Wednesday, Trump did not address health risks tied to students’ off-campus behavior.Trump has said for weeks that schools and colleges must reopen and that they can do so safely. He has threatened to cut funding to schools that don’t reopen, and he threatened to revoke schools’ and colleges’ tax exempt status. The White House says schools are key to the nation’s economic recovery, and Trump has said students need to be in school and on campus to learn.“There’s nothing like campus. There’s nothing like being with the teacher as opposed to being on a computer board,” Trump said Wednesday.He said there are simple measures universities can take to open safely. “Students who feel sick should not attend class and should limit social interaction, as they would for any other illness,” he said. “Universities should implement measures to protect the high-risk students or professors.” Some colleges, however, say the risks of reopening are too great.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/closing-colleges-amid-covid-19-outbreaks-could-cost-lives-says-donald-trump/story-3v8yj88BGgrTihTkOmOKFI.html
20-08-2020||World||Helicopter pilot killed fighting California wildfire||A helicopter pilot died on Wednesday when his aircraft crashed while fighting one of hundreds of wildfires raging in California after lightning storms.California was hit by nearly 11,000 lightning strikes in 72 hours, sparking 367 fires, with over 50 structures destroyed in Northern California’s wine country where thousands fled their homes, authorities said. In central California, a helicopter was on a water dropping mission in Fresno County about 160 miles (258 km) south of San Francisco when the aircraft crashed, killing the pilot who was the only person aboard, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in a statement.To the north of San Francisco, a group of fires covering over 46,000 acres (18,615 hectares) near the city of Vacaville raced through hills and mountains, destroying 50 homes and other structures.The city of 100,000, about 30 miles southwest of Sacramento, was under a partial evacuation order after flames from the LNU Lightning Complex fire burned west side homes, leaving dead livestock among the properties or wandering around, a Reuters photographer said.To the south, police gave communities west of Fairfield, a city of 117,000, about 30 minutes notice of mandatory evacuations, the Daily Republic newspaper reported. “We are experiencing fires the like of which we haven’t seen in many, many years,” California Governor Gavin Newsom told a press conference, adding that he had requested 375 fire engines from out of state.Fanned by “red-flag” high winds, fires sparked by dry-lightning from rainless thunderstorms are sending flames racing through vegetation parched by a record-breaking heat wave and low humidity. The blazes follow devastating fires across Northern California in 2017 that killed 44, wiped out numerous wineries and destroyed nearly 9,000 homes and other structures.A group of fires called the SCU Lightning Complex, centered about 20 miles east of Palo Alto, more than doubled in size overnight and is now burning over 85,000 acres. The CZU August Lightning Complex, meanwhile, has grown to over 10,000 acres and forced evacuations around 13 miles south of Palo Alto.To the west, drought stricken Colorado faced its second-largest wildfire in history on Wednesday. The Pine Gulch blaze has produced its own weather system with thunder and lightning as it burned across 125,100 acres. It covers an area larger than the city of Denver, in remote mountain terrain about 20 miles north of Grand Junction, authorities said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/helicopter-pilot-killed-fighting-california-wildfire/story-fJ5jFsh62vsV5boKIOPW9K.html
20-08-2020||World||Trump pushes UN to renew Iran sanctions in blow to nuclear deal||President Donald Trump said he would call on the United Nations Security Council to restore all nuclear-related sanctions on Iran, an attempt to kill off the 2015 nuclear agreement and force Tehran back to the negotiating table.“Mark it down, Iran will never have a nuclear weapon,” Trump said at a White House news conference on Wednesday. “We paid a fortune for a failed concept, a failed policy that would have made it impossible to have peace in the Middle East.”The move will set the Trump administration on a collision course with other world powers, including key allies, who say the US doesn’t have the authority to reimpose international sanctions and that they won’t go along. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo will formally propose the “snap back” of sanctions at the UN on Thursday.While many nations are wary of Iran, the US has been almost totally isolated at the UN in its most recent efforts to raise pressure on the Islamic Republic, abandoned by even close allies such as France and the U.K.An effort last week to indefinitely extend an expiring, 13-year-old arms embargo on Iran was defeated in historic fashion: 11 members of the Security Council abstained, with just the Dominican Republic joining the US as China and Russia vetoed the measure.The State Department referenced that rebuke in a statement after Trump spoke on Wednesday.“Secretary Pompeo’s notification to the Council follows its inexcusable failure last week to extend the arms embargo on the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism and anti-Semitism,” according to the statement. It added that the snapback would extend the arms embargo by default.Since taking office, the Trump administration has used increasingly tough sanctions and diplomatic pressure to try to convince European allies to quit the 2015 nuclear deal, saying Iran used the revenue it got from eased sanctions to finance conflicts from Syria to Yemen without permanently ending Tehran’s ambitions for a nuclear weapon.The president long called the agreement reached during the Obama administration the “worst deal ever,” and his announcement came just hours before President Barack Obama was due to speak at the Democratic convention.Trump has repeatedly said he believes that ending the deal under tough restrictions will convince Iran’s leaders to enter talks on a bigger, better accord that will help foster peace across the entire Middle East.The sanctions did deal a crippling economic blow to Tehran. European allies supportive of the nuclear deal struggled to find a way around the US restrictions, depriving Iran of investment and causing its currency to plunge and widespread shortages of basic goods. But President Hassan Rouhani’s government stood firm and repeatedly ruled out any talks while under the force of what they called “blackmail.”Under the unique “snapback” process outlined in the 2015 nuclear deal, once the US submits its complaint, the Security Council has 30 days to vote on a resolution to continue Iran’s sanctions relief, a move the US could then proceed to veto. If such a resolution is not adopted, UN sanctions that were eased in return for constraints on Iran’s nuclear program would theoretically be restored, effectively killing the Iran nuclear deal.“Any US attempt to reimpose sanctions will be controversial, given the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and likely to create deadlock at the Security Council,” International Crisis Group analysts wrote in a report on Wednesday. “The administration’s goal is clear: Kill the deal or make it that much harder for a successor administration to rejoin it.”The process, as enshrined in a UN resolution, appears straightforward, but every other party to the multinational deal, including America’s European allies, say the US can’t invoke the process from an accord it already quit. They argue that snapback was a right given to the deal’s participants, and since the US said it is no longer a part of the accord, its move will be seen as invalid.Europe will not “support unilateral proposals leading to the return of sanctions,” French Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere said in June. “They would only deepen divisions in the Security Council and beyond and would not be likely to improve the situation on the ground of nuclear nonproliferation.”Yet the US has a different legal interpretation, arguing that UN Resolution 2231 lists the US as a participant for purposes of snapping back sanctions.The resolution describes the US as a participant of the nuclear agreement and “includes no provision for altering that definition based on the future behavior or activities of the defined parties,” Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which has helped guide the Trump administration’s Iran sanctions policies, wrote. “Therefore, the United States remains” a participant “in perpetuity, as defined by” the resolution, he added.Pompeo vowed to hold countries like Russia and China accountable if they refuse to go along with the US declaration that the nuclear deal is void and, instead, move ahead with sales of advanced weapons to Iran once the arms embargo expires in October.“Absolutely,” Pompeo said Wednesday when asked in a Fox News interview whether the US would sanction those countries. “We’ve already done that when we see any country violate our current sanctions, the current American sanctions, we’ve held every nation accountable for that. We’ll do the same thing with respect to the broader UN Security Council sanctions as well.”A Debate Since 2015Supporters of the agreement say it took Iran off a path toward nuclear weapons, but since the day it was reached critics said the deal provided the Tehran government with economic benefits in the short-term without any long-term guarantee that the nation wouldn’t eventually decide to restart its nuclear program.In the years after the accord was reached, inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency repeatedly affirmed that the Iranians were abiding by the accord. But after the US quit the deal and began reimposing sanctions, Iran starting abandoning parts of the agreement, stockpiling enriched uranium beyond agree upon levels but saying it would reverse course if the US returned to the accord.The dispute between the US and the rest of the permanent members of the Security Council could plunge the body into a crisis with no clear path toward a resolution.“It will be one of the worst crises to face the UN Security Council in a generation because the council will be hopelessly divided, without any clarity on how to move forward,” said Richard Nephew, who was the lead sanctions expert for the Obama administration team that negotiated the accord.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-pushes-un-to-renew-iran-sanctions-in-blow-to-nuclear-deal/story-nfMyuosox5NTcyt37s0VuL.html
20-08-2020||World||Trump praises QAnon conspiracists, appreciates support||President Donald Trump praised the supporters of QAnon, a convoluted, pro-Trump conspiracy theory, and suggested he appreciates their support of his candidacy.Speaking during a press conference at the White House on Wednesday, Trump courted the support of those who put stock in the conspiracy theory, saying, “I heard that these are people that love our country.” It was his first public comment on the subject.QAnon has ricocheted around the darker corners of the internet since late 2017, but has been creeping into mainstream politics more and more. The baseless theory centers on an alleged anonymous, high-ranking government official known as “Q” who shares information about an anti-Trump “deep state” often tied to satanism and child sex trafficking.Trump insisted he hadn’t heard much about the movement, “other than I understand they like me very much” and “it is gaining in popularity.” Trump has retweeted QAnon-promoting accounts, and shirts and hats with QAnon symbols and slogans are not uncommon at his rallies.Pressed on QAnon theories that Trump is allegedly saving the nation from a satanic cult of child sex traffickers, Trump claimed ignorance, but asked, “Is that supposed to be a bad thing?” “If I can help save the world from problems, I’m willing to do it,” Trump said.Trump’s comments came a week after he endorsed Marjorie Taylor Greene, who won her GOP House primary runoff in Georgia last week. Greene called the QAnon conspiracy theory “something worth listening to and paying attention to” and called Q a “patriot.” Trump praised her as a “future Republican Star.” Trump has a long history of advancing false and sometimes racist conspiracies, including last week, when he gave credence to a highly criticized op-ed that questioned Democrat Kamala Harris’ eligibility to serve as vice president even though she was born in Oakland, California.Asked about the matter, Trump told reporters he had “heard” rumors that Harris, a Black woman and US-born citizen whose parents were immigrants, does not meet the requirement to serve in the White House. The president said he considered the rumors “very serious,” but later he and his campaign indicated they were not making an issue of the claim. Constitutional lawyers have dismissed it as nonsense.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-praises-qanon-conspiracists-appreciates-support/story-hEiLa410WuEdOspCjAs6pI.html
20-08-2020||World||Covid-19: Rise in kids attacking parents in UK lockdown||A ‘pressure cooker’ environment in British homes during lockdown has seen a ‘significant’ rise in children and adolescents attacking parents in already volatile households, a new study by experts at the University of Oxford and Manchester said on Wednesday.Parents told researchers that lockdown pressures had made the problem worse. Being confined at home with a young person was described by one parent as having a ‘cabin fever effect’, while another said lockdown had created a ‘pressure cooker’ environment.The police said more such incidents had been reported by parents during lockdown, but the study says parents suffering such violence are usually reluctant to call the police for fear of adverse consequences for the children and adolescents in police cells.Rachel Condry, professor of criminology at Oxford, says: “Parents are often reluctant to report their child, fearing the consequences of criminalisation….and when they do seek help, it is often not forthcoming.”“Violence can be serious and sustained. Parents describe living in fear of their own child, often for years. It can range from criminal damage in the home and verbal abuse to some of the most serious forms. One mother told us her son ‘beat me so badly that if the police did not come when they did, I would not be alive’.”The situation has been compounded by school and college closures, lack of other services and increased expectations about engaging remotely and home schooling. One parent told the research team, “Everything is amplified, there’s no escape, and it’s not just the person being hurt who’s affected, it’s everyone that sees and hears it. The other children are traumatised by seeing us hurt.”Caroline Miles of the University of Manchester noted that many children who are violent towards their parents have safeguarding needs of their own, having experience trauma of some kind themselves, and/or have mental health problems, learning difficulties, or additional needs.“These children are likely to have found the lockdown especially challenging and may have lost much of their external support network”, she adds.The study called for increased planning and support from central government and local authorities, to prevent young people being criminalised and families being left to cope alone.The study of 104 families, 47 social workers and several police forces took place between April and June 2020, involving an online survey with open-ended questions to ask parents who had experienced violence from a child aged 10-19 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-rise-in-kids-attacking-parents-in-uk-lockdown/story-BEuuNTlrcxFsvhxo4nVPyH.html

She was previously found guilty of one count of failing to disclose information regarding terrorist activity.Her brother Mohuissunnath, who was previously sentenced to life imprisonment, was recorded at home telling his sister that he was “doing another attack”, and asking her for help to practice stabbing people – information which she did not report to police.Commander Richard Smith of the Counter Terrorism Command, said: “There is no acceptable reason for listening to someone say they are planning to kill innocent people, and watching them practice how they will do that, then not reporting it to police”.“Sneha Chowdhury willfully kept her brother’s horrific secret, but not every case has to end this way. If relatives report indications that a loved one is becoming radicalised early on, there is an opportunity for authorities to intervene and help them before they become too deeply entrenched. All it takes is a phone call.”The Woolwich Crown Court jury had earlier found her brother guilty of preparation of acts of terrorism, for a plot to carry out an attack at a tourist hotspot in London; dissemination of a terrorist publication; and possession of information useful to terrorism, for having a guide to carrying out terror attacks on his phone.He was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment on July 9, and must serve a minimum of 25 years in prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-sister-who-knew-of-brother-s-terror-plot-jailed/story-DHRbJCCjsEv4FuUya90LdJ.html
20-08-2020||World||In fight over H-1B visas, Donald Trump points to presidential authority||The Trump administration said a lawsuit seeking to throw out immigration restrictions, including those on H-1B visas used by technology workers, would “cut at the heart” of the president’s legal authority over border control when it is needed most.The US Department of Homeland Security is in sharp conflict with several US business groups over the visa restrictions, especially those issued to highly skilled workers with expertise in specialty fields.The US Chamber of Commerce and other groups seek a court order blocking implementation of President Donald Trump’s June 22 proclamation, which they say repeals entire visa categories for temporary workers. Ahead of a Sept. 11 hearing in San Francisco federal court to weigh the request, the Justice Department cited the coronavirus pandemic to argue that Trump properly relied on his “broad authority to suspend the entry of certain aliens.“Their entry would be detrimental to the interests of the United States in light of the significant economic harm the Covid-19 pandemic continues to inflict on the nation,” the US said in the filing.The groups, including the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Retail Federation, sued in July, arguing Trump exceeded his authority when he temporarily halted access to several employment-based visas, affecting hundreds of thousands of people seeking to work in the US The groups say the restrictions will drive talented workers away from the US and to competitors.The president’s order freezes new H-1B and H-4 visas, used by technology workers and their families, as well as L visas for intra-company transfers and most J visas for work- and study-abroad programs, including au pairs, through the end of the year.The case is US Chamber of Commerce v.

She said that slogan has become so painful to her it amounted to “emotional abuse.”“It’s not okay to repeat my son’s dying words because it’s all you think you can do ... that hurts me,” the mother said in the posting calling off a march that had been set for Sunday. A separate rally honoring Elijah McClain and other African-Americans slain by law enforcement will go on as scheduled on Saturday at the state capitol in nearby Denver, organizers said.Last week, the McClain family filed a civil rights lawsuit in federal court against Aurora police officers who applied a carotid chokehold on Elijah McClain, and paramedics who injected him with the powerful sedative ketamine.Elijah McClain was approached and subdued by three policemen on Aug. 24, 2019, responding to a report he was acting suspiciously, though he had committed no crime. He went into cardiac arrest after the encounter and died at a hospital days later.Local prosecutors declined to file charges against police or paramedics, citing an autopsy listing the cause of death as undetermined.The autopsy said that combined with the chokehold, ketamine could have contributed to his death. The family’s lawsuit disputes that he met criteria for injection with the drug. Following a public outcry, Colorado’s attorney general launched two investigations, and the US Justice Department has initiated a civil rights inquiry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mother-of-black-man-who-died-after-encounter-with-police-in-colorado-cancels-rally/story-flxIh0wez2ELXAXN5XsDbI.html

20-08-2020||India||France opens borders to Indian students||France has become the first country to open its borders to Indian students, researchers and teachers who have been invited by a French academic establishment or laboratory, and to holders of the “Talent” passport. Seven French visa processing centres in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kochi became operational from August 17 to receive select visa applications, while complying with Indian travel regulations and the safety of consular teams. Universities in France have readied themselves to receive international students, either wholly or partly on campus, said a statement from the French embassy. Addressing thousands of Indian students who have chosen to study in France, ambassador Emmanuel Lenain said: “France is returning to normalcy and I am delighted that international students will be among the first to benefit from it. The French embassy is fully mobilised to ensure that students can pursue their studies in France in the smoothest conditions possible, despite the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic.” The move “reaffirms France’s priority to academic mobility”, he said. The facility is limited to Indian students travelling to France in autumn for studies for more than three months on long-term visas, and short-term studies or internships, with accommodation in France. It is also available to professors or researchers employed or invited by a French academic institution or research laboratory who are travelling at the end of their studies or for teaching, and to those having a valid long-term visa or a “Talent” passport. These persons must possess an “International Travel Certificate to Mainland France” (Attestation de déplacement international dérogatoire), available on the website of the French interior ministry. This certificate has to be presented to the travel company before departure and to border control authorities on arrival in France.The certificate must be accompanied by an undertaking that the person does not have any symptoms of Covid-19 and has not been in contact with an infected person 14 days prior to departure. The visa applications will be processed in small batches every week to ensure adequate safety measures at the processing centres. Social distancing and other recommended protective measures are being adhered to, and mobile biometric data collection and courier services are available to limited in-person contacts at the centres. All travellers displaying any symptoms of Covid-19 on their entry in French territory will be prescribed quarantine or self-isolation. In order to prepare students, pre-departure sessions called “Bienvenue en France” are scheduled online during August 22-31. These sessions will acquaint students with administrative procedures, ways of finding accommodation, tips from alumni, and practical advice on student life in France. Around 118 Indian students are preparing to travel to France at the end of September as English language assistants for a stint in French schools. The programme offers an opportunity for French-speaking Indian students to live and work in France and gain professional exposure. The number of Indian students opting for higher studies in France has risen from 3,000 in 2014 to around 10,000 in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/france-opens-borders-to-indian-students/story-mSez6g2S9UYU5C4V1jxD7I.html
20-08-2020||India||Conclusion of US-India trade talks to be phase 1 of bilateral trade deal: Envoy||Indian Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu on Thursday made a strong case for conclusion of the ongoing trade negotiations which would become the first phase of a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement between the two nations. Bilateral trade between India and the US, which touched $150 billion last year, has dropped 25 per cent in the first half of this year, he said at webinar organised by industry body Ficci. Sandhu observed that India’s bilateral trade has been growing at the rate of 10 per cent on a year-to-year basis, reaching $150 billion in 2019. “Our bilateral trade has not been immune to COVID-19 as total trade between the two countries has reduced by nearly 25 per cent in the first half of 2020 as compared to 2019,” he said. The US is today India’s biggest trading partner, but the real potential of the trade relationship is yet to be reached, he added. The Indian Ambassador to the US said the “first step in realising this potential is to conclude the ongoing trade negotiations which would become the phase 1 of a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement.” Such an agreement would reflect the full potential of bilateral and commercial relations, increasing bilateral investments and job creation in both the countries, he emphasised. India and the US are negotiating a limited trade deal with a view to iron out differences on trade issues to boost economic ties. India is demanding exemption from high duties imposed by the US on some steel and aluminium products, resumption of export benefits to certain domestic items under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), and greater market access for its products from sectors such as agriculture, automobile, automobile components and engineering. On the other hand, the US wants greater market access for its farm and manufacturing products, dairy items and medical devices, apart from cut in import duties on some information and communication technology products. The US has also raised concerns over high trade deficit with India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conclusion-of-us-india-trade-talks-to-be-phase-1-of-bilateral-trade-deal-envoy/story-gRNoBS2FQ9xooymMJJloaJ.html

20-08-2020||India||Trade unions urge PM Modi to withdraw draft EIA 2020 rules||Ten central trade unions on Thursday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to withdraw draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 2020 notification, saying it is contrary to India’s commitment to international climate change treaty and against national interest. In a letter shot off to the Prime Minister on Thursday, the unions said, “We submit our concerns, strongly urging you to withdraw this proposal in the interest of our people and environmental protection.” They stated in the letter, “We, the joint platform of central trade union organisations, would like to express our opposition to the proposed draft rules EIA 2020, which are in contravention to India’s commitment to International Climate Change Treaty as well as to our own national interest in protecting our environmentally sensitive zones.” The EIA 2020 is a gross departure from EIA 2006 and appears to be for facilitating private commercial mining of coal and other minerals and the land-use management sought to be restructured and overhauled through various so-called reform measures being taken by the government in concerned fields, they explained in the letter. “Your goodself is aware that the environmental degradation and ecological disturbances are causing natural calamities of various kinds including the health emergencies,” it said. The greed of corporates for limitless exploitation of nature and natural resources without necessary precautions and protection of nature is leading humanity to continuously face the backlash, the letter said. “It is neither good economics nor is it sustainable development.” India should remain committed to world sustainable development goals whereas the proposed draft rules are in contravention to them, they opined. Moreover, they said the victims of this policy would be vulnerable sections of our society, especially the scheduled tribes.  The ten central trade unions are INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF and UTUC. There are 12 central trade unions in the country including RSS affiliate Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trade-unions-urge-pm-modi-to-withdraw-draft-eia-2020-rules/story-imJnEs0E7ATwPVnV9dC1OL.html
20-08-2020||India||India to launch new cargo ferry service to Maldives in September||India will launch a new cargo ferry service to the Maldives, which will link Kochi and Tuticorin with Male, in the third week of September to further bolster bilateral trade relations. A vessel operated by the Shipping Corporation of India, capable of carrying 200 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) or containers and 3,000 tonnes of general cargo, will be used for the service, the Indian high commission in the Maldives said in a tweet on Thursday. The turnaround time for the cargo ferry service will be 10 days, the high commission said. “Sea-connectivity for prosperity! A direct ‘Cargo Ferry Service’ connecting #Kochi/#Tuticorin with #Malé will be flagged off [from India] in the 3rd week of Sep,” the mission tweeted, adding the service will fulfil a commitment made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to the Maldives in June 2019. “It is expected to revolutionise bilateral trade linkages & support dvpt. of the northern atolls with extension of the service to #Kulhudhuffushi in future,” the mission said in another tweet. The launch of the ferry service was discussed during a virtual meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Maldives counterpart Abdulla Shahid on August 13. During the same meeting, India unveiled a $500-million package to help the Maldives build a connectivity project linking its capital Male with three islands, and provided $250 million as budgetary support to help the Indian Ocean archipelago cope with the Covid-19 crisis. People familiar with developments said the direct cargo ferry service will be an opportunity for India to replace other countries and become the top trade partner of the Maldives. Exports from India had registered a relative increase amid the Covid-19 pandemic, making the country the second largest exporter to the Maldives, the people said. “With many bilateral projects slated to commence in the next few months, this is the right time to start a cargo ferry service with the Maldives,” said one of the people cited above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-launch-new-cargo-ferry-service-to-maldives-in-september/story-bLft9o2oEH0q5aDRgNA6rJ.html

Although the use of gargle specimens is not new, at present, there is little published information on the suitability of gargle specimens to diagnose SARSCoV-2 infection, the study stated.This study was, therefore, conducted to assess the performance of gargle lavage in comparison to nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for the detection of novel coronavirus.This was a cross-sectional study conducted at the AIIMS, New Delhi over a period of one month (May-June) on 50 confirmed Covid-19 patients.Paired swab and gargle samples were taken within 72 hours of their diagnosis. Samples were processed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Post-sample collection, a 10-point scale was administered to assess the level of discomfort with either of the collection methods, the study said.Also read: India conducts record number of Covid-19 tests in 24 hours, recoveries near 21 lakh-mark“All gargle samples were positive and comparable to their corresponding swab samples irrespective of the symptoms and duration of illness. The cycle threshold (Ct ) values for gargle samples were slightly higher but comparable to those of swabs. Bland-Altman plot showed good agreement between the two methods,” the study said.Majority (72 per cent) of the patients reported moderate-to-severe discomfort with swab collection in comparison to 24 per cent reporting only mild discomfort with gargle collection. “In conclusion, the study highlights the usefulness of gargle lavage as an appropriate respiratory sample collection method. “It is a viable alternative to conventional swab collection with several distinct advantages and will have significant clinical and public health impacts in terms of better acceptability, easy self-collection, sparing of healthcare workers and cost-effectiveness,” the study said.The major limitation of this study was its cross-sectional design and it was performed only on a limited number of positive cases. In addition, it would be necessary to evaluate the performance using different viral RNA isolation platforms, the study said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gargled-water-samples-may-be-viable-alternative-to-swabs-for-detecting-covid-study/story-MTVzeiQ1Ny0dIohyCqTpjN.html

Alok Sinha, UP agriculture production commissioner and Israeli ambassador to India, Ron Malka, signed the agreement here on behalf of their governments. The India –Israel – Bundelkhand Water Project comprises three key components including water conservation, water efficient transportation and advanced water practices for agriculture. “We have signed the project on a day when ‘India Day’ is celebrated in Israel. For this project, 28 districts across the country, including two in Uttar Pradesh, have been selected,” said Alok Sinha, agriculture production commissioner. In the first phase, 25 villages in Babina block of Jhansi district had been selected, he added. The agreement has been signed for two years and will be extended later. The project aims to address water crisis in drought hit regions of Bundelkhand. It will help farmers of the region with latest farming technologies, including drip irrigation, meant for water deficient regions like Bundelkhand. “The water reservoir of Pahuj dam in Jhansi will be enabled with integrated drip irrigation. Assistance of experts from Israel will also be taken for implementing latest farming technologies,” said Sinha. Sinha said the project will also be a role model for ground water management, irrigation and potable water management for the rest of the country while addressing water scarcity in Bundelkhand and its adjoining regions. Watch: India-China border dispute: 5 things you need to know about current situationIsraeli ambassador Ron Malka said: “This is another example of the multifaceted partnership between Israel and India. Israel is keen to share its most advanced, innovative and cutting edge water technologies with the government of Uttar Pradesh. Water security is the top priority in our strategic water partnership with India.” During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Israel in 2017, Israel and India signed two major water agreements to increase cooperation in water conservation and state water utility reform in India. Last year, Union minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat had attended the WATEC conference in Israel to advance cooperation in the field of water between the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/israel-signs-deal-to-resolve-bundelkhand-water-crisis-has-a-3-pronged-solution/story-606PQi6jfeZFoxRFcpq4ZM.html
20-08-2020||India||Speakers’ conference: India asks international community to isolate Pakistan||India on Thursday gave a befitting reply to Pakistan at the 5th World Conference of Speakers of Parliament, and asked the international community to isolate Pakistan for sponsoring terrorism. The Indian Parliament, led by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, exercised its Right of Reply to underline that “Pakistan PM admitted there are nearly 40,000 militants on its soil. Pakistan’s aggressions against J-K in 1965, 1971, 1999 (Kargil), attack on Mumbai and Parliament, Uri, Pulwama etc. show Pakistan’s state-sponsored policy of terrorism as evident in the inaction against the likes of Hafiz Saeed, Masood Azhar and Ehsanullah Ehsan.” The Indian authorities also said that “Jammu & Kashmir has been and will remain an integral part of India. We call upon Pakistan to end cross-border terrorism. Our overtures should not be taken as a sign of weakness.” India’s strong reply comes amid Pakistan PM Imran Khan’s continued attempts to call an OIC meeting on Kashmir despite being snubbed by the Saudi kingdom. Khan is also believed to be aligning with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to form a new Islamic axis against India. At the conference, organized jointly by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), Geneva, and the Parliament of Austria with the support of the United Nations (UN), India’s reply came during the special event on ‘Countering Terrorism and violent Extremism: The perspective of victims’ today. The reply reads: “India exercises its Right of Reply to a statement by Pakistan, a country whose PM glorified dreaded terrorist “Osama Bin Laden” as a ‘martyr’ from its Parliament,” said the Indian response. Indian Parliament also highlighted that the UN Analytical Support Sanctions Monitoring Team mentions Pakistan as the leading exporter of terror with more than 6,000 nationals currently engaged in terrorism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/speakers-conference-india-asks-international-community-to-isolate-pakistan/story-p02ANW8RY4BrqJxMjKJ9hK.html

Hence, this should not be excluded from the purview of RRSK (Rashtriya Rail Sanrakshan Kosh). It should be ideally recorded officially,” the government think tank CEO said in a letter to Yadav.In a press briefing Thursday, Yadav said the Railways keeps a record of all the deaths that occur on its premises under three separate heads -- consequential accidents, trespassing and untoward incidents. “It is true that consequential accidents were indeed zero in 2019-2020 and so far this year as well,” he said.  “We keep records of deaths due to trespassing like when people come on the tracks and are run over or people standing on the footboard of trains or hanging out of trains. In the last three years, around 29,000 to 30,000 people have lost their lives due to either trespassing or untoward incidents. This data will be given to Niti Aayog,” he said. In fact, after the 2018 tragedy in Amritsar wherein 59 people were killed and over 100 injured after being run over by two passenger trains while they were watching Dussehra celebrations, the Railways said that it was a case of trespassing. Yadav also said that efforts are on to ensure that deaths due to such incidents too reduce, and “over the years they have”. After Yadav’s briefing, the Railways issued a statement saying that while more than 8 billion passengers travelled by trains last year, there were zero passenger fatalities due to accidents.“This has been achieved with a lot of efforts on the part of the Railways. While the deaths of passengers due to railway accidents has become Zero, unfortunate Casualties do occur due to trespassing and untoward incidents like falling from trains and that due to negligence or carelessness on the part of passengers/public. “These are incidents on which the Railways have little or no control. Efforts are on to sensitise the public on avoiding such situations,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-niti-s-questions-railways-says-29k-30k-died-due-to-trespassing-untoward-incidents-in-3-years/story-gjWqEPa9NJTnxhbVU3GULP.html

According to the ED, BPSL clandestinely cleared finished goods worth Rs 700 crore without payment of applicable taxes and duties and without issuance of any statutory invoice. The development comes at a time when the plea of JSW Steel seeking immunity from any ED action on erstwhile promoters of the BPSL is set to be decided by the Supreme Court in September. JSW’s bid worth Rs 19,350 crore for BPSL’s plant was approved by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NLCAT) in February this year and the agency was asked to release the assets of BPSL. ED had challenged the NCLAT order. “The BPSL had engaged in clandestine clearances of finished goods from its Odisha Plant to its plants at Kolkata and Chandigarh. Goods valued at Rs 700 crore had been cleared without payment of applicable taxes and duties and without issuance of any statutory invoice,” the ED said in the statement. ED has found that “…This practice which was resorted to by the erstwhile management of the company had continued even after initiation of CIRP (company insolvency resolution process) and some irregularities on part of Resolution Professional M K Khandelwal were also revealed.” The raids were conducted at the offices and residence of Khandelwal in Delhi and Gurugram apart from the residence of BPSL’s former director. “Incriminating documents, laptops, mobile phones, extracts and other valuables such as jewellery worth Rs 86 lakh were seized. Incriminating documents indicating receipt of cash by M K Khandelwal while discharging duties of Resolution Professional/Interim Resolution Professional have also been seized,” ED said. “Huge cash payments to various individuals outside the books of accounts indicate siphoning and generation of cash from various concerns undergoing process of CIRP under NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal),” the ED statement added. The former promoters of BPSL are under investigation for diverting Rs 4,025 crore bank funds taken as loans. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Bhushan Power, said – “Without commenting on the facts of the individual case, I think institutionally it is time to set the clear the dirty and murky waters which lie behind an actual CIRP. Excessively high fees, huge expenses and now serious allegations of embezzlement can destroy the entire concept of beneficial public interest quick insolvency and mire it in corruption.” Singal’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal refused to comment. Khandelwal could not be located by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhushan-power-steel-removed-goods-worth-rs-700-crore-says-ed-raids-resolution-professional/story-RitnOmr7hVYLesEEyAoUWM.html
20-08-2020||India||Space sector reforms not aimed at privatising ISRO: Chairman K Sivan||The recently announced space sector reforms are not aimed at privatisation of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), its Chairman and Secretary in the Department of Space, K Sivan asserted on Thursday.The space agency also stated that the draft on the proposed space activity bill is almost final and it will soon be placed before the Union Cabinet for approval. “When space sector reforms were announced by the government there were many misconceptions like it would lead to privatisation of ISRO. It is not. Again and again I’m repeating it is not the privatisation of ISRO,” Sivan said. Addressing a webinar on “Unlocking of India’s Potential in Space Sector,” he said the whole aim of reforms is enabling the private players to carry out the space activities which is otherwise being done by ISRO.“In fact, the activities of ISRO are going to increase and ISRO will be able to better utilise its resources in taking up developmental as well as capacity building activities of the government, rather than the routine production activity,” he added.The Union Cabinet on June 24 approved participation of the private sector in the entire range of space activities, including planetary exploration missions.It had said, the newly-created Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) will provide a level playing field for private companies to use Indian space infrastructure, by hand-holding industries in space activities through encouraging policies and a friendly regulatory environment.Also, the New Space India Limited (NSIL), a PSU under the Department of Space, will endeavour to re-orient space activities from a “supply driven” model to a “demand driven” model, thereby ensuring optimum utilisation of our space assets, it had said.Noting that the space sector reform introduced by the government is going to be a “real game changer”, Sivan said private sector participation in the space sector has been increasing worldwide and it is a healthy trend, as it increases diversity.In India too space sector startups are taking developmental activities in both launch vehicles as well as in satellites, he said.However, there was no mechanism available in the country to extend technology and infrastructure support to them.Also there was no regulatory mechanism to control the private sector activities, so an institutional mechanism has been created as part of reform. The webinar was attended by Principal Scientific Advisor to government of India K Vijay Raghavan, Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra, Bharti Enterprises Chairman Sunil B Mittal among others.Further observing that with the opening of the space sector, ISRO can focus on technology development and capacity building Sivan said in addition to that it will also facilitate private sector participation in major national missions through announcement of opportunity.However, the private sector will have to do their own research and development activities, business viability studies, funding as well as finding customers for their services, he said.Pointing out that import of communication satellites is now in the embargo list under ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’, the ISRO Chief said there will be a need for large number of communication satellites to be launched in the immediate future and this could be a huge opportunity for ISRO and also for the private sector.Launching a small satellite is another area where there is a huge projected demand and some startups are interacting with ISRO at an advanced stage and may launch very soon.According to ISRO officials, more than 500 industries are currently involved in activities such as production of components and more than 80 per cent of the launch vehicle and 60 per cent of the spacecraft budget is spent on industry.Scientific Secretary to ISRO, R Uma Maheshwaran said participation of the private sector in end-end space activities is definitely a strategy to expand the space economy.Noting that the private sector is much eager now, he said a lot of people are coming forward to make launch vehicles, and satellites and providing space based services.Uma Maheshwaran also said a mechanism is required regarding the indulgence of the private sector and for this, enactment of the space activity bill is a primary requisite. “It (bill) is almost in its final shape now, we have presented it to the Ministry (PMO) for inter-ministerial consultation and we feel that very soon it will be approved by the Cabinet and presented to the Parliament for making it an act. This is mandatory as India is signatory to the outer space treaty,” he added.Vijay Raghavan, noting a lack of risk capital for industry to sufficiently invest in R&D, said risk needs to be mitigated and for this the combination of talent and material resources, partnering with industry is needed.The opening of the space sector in India will have its impact globally, and also all sectors in India, he said adding that “.. this is an opportunity to increase volume and quality in extraordinary ways.” Suggesting that space may well become the new “gold rush”, Anand Mahindra said though India has an established and credible space programme, its share of the market is miniscule and he was sure that beginning now it will change with the entry of the private sector. “... it is our opportunity to level the playing field, by leveraging our competitive advantages and we have to seize it now,” he said, while admitting that industry and public sector are often “uneasy bedfellows”, but we have to make these reforms work as it is the best way forward”. Sunil Mittal stressed on the need for the policy on participation of private sector in space programme to be “light-touch” but said it should be very strong on security, foreign policy aspects and some of the guidelines need to be very clear so that industry participants know how to operate within the policy framework.

Two-three groups used to work in the area, Sajjad’s another friend, Naseeruddin alias Abu Saad, was also handling a group in the north Kashmir,” Singh said at a press conference here.Adding that the success was because of the coordinated efforts of the Army, Jammy and Kashmir Police, among others he said, “Immediately after Sajjad was gunned down, Naseeruddin alias Abu Saad was given charge of north Kashmir, and his accomplice Danish used to work closely with him. But we were successful in stopping them.”Naseeruddin Lone, along with his accomplice, was killed in an encounter with the security forces in Handwara of Kupwara district on Wednesday. Arms and ammunition in huge quantity were recovered from the two LeT terrorists.Inspector General (IG) Police, Vijay Kumar, said that the leadership structure of terrorists in Kashmir has been wrecked by the number of commanders being killed in the past few days.The DGP further said, “Infiltration has dropped by almost fifty per cent, and there has also been a big drop in the number of local youth joining terrorist groups.”He also noted another big achievement by the security forces operating in Kashmir in which they were able to bring back local terrorists and were attempting to put them back in the mainstream.“In 2020 so far, we have brought back 16 kids who had become terrorists and made them meet their families to bring them back on track,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-terrorists-killed-in-past-four-days-including-four-most-wanted-ones-j-k-dgp/story-Qz2YgQQpJvERoO0a2g52lI.html

Ever since Tharoor has become the panel head, “he is running the affairs of the committee in a thoroughly unprofessional manner and to serve his political agenda of spreading rumours and defaming my party”, Dubey claimed in the letter.“... It would be highly improper for Dr. Shashi Tharoor to continue and regulate the proceedings of the committee. I, therefore, appeal to your good self to persuade Dr. Tharoor to proceed on leave and thereafter,... choose another member of the committee to act as Chairperson,” Dubey said in the letter.Claiming that Tharoor’s acts of misdemeanours, in the capacity of the panel’s chairperson are countless, the BJP MP mentioned number of instances where the Congress leader used the parliamentary platform to further his and his party’s political agenda. Dubey also claimed that Tharoor even used the parliamentary platform to “defame” the Lok Sabha speaker to attain political mileage, the BJP MP said the Congress leader had blamed that the Speaker directed him to cancel a meeting of the committee on Information Technology when Covid-19 pandemic was it at zenith while allowing other panels to meet. “Though his allegations were, later on, proved to be entirely concocted, he was successful in using the parliamentary platform even to defame the honourable Speaker and attain some political mileage, perhaps, for getting some media attention to overcome his dwindling political fortunes,” the BJP MP alleged. Dubey and Tharoor filed breach of privilege notices against each other on Wednesday after a spat on social media over the Congress leader’s remarks on summoning Facebook India executives over reports that the social media giant went soft on some BJP leaders who had made hate speeches ahead of the general elections last year. While Dubey said Tharoor was treating the committee as an extension of Congress party, the Congress leader had alleged that the BJP MP made “disparaging remarks” on social media over his decision to summon a panel meeting to discuss the alleged “misconduct” of Facebook.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-row-bjp-mp-dubey-requests-ls-speaker-to-replace-tharoor-as-head-of-par-panel-on-it/story-yEkhnvnITcQgRrxM7EHV4M.html

Currently, we are looking for a partnership with India. We believe that they are capable of producing the Gamaleya vaccine and it is very important to say that those partnerships to produce the vaccine will enable us to cover the demand that we have,” he said.Dmitriev said Russia is looking forward to international cooperation.“We are going to do clinical trials not just in Russia but also in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, probably in Brazil and India. We are planning to produce the vaccine in more than five countries and there is a very high demand from Asia, Latin America, Italy and other parts of the world regarding the delivery of the vaccine,” he said.Also read: Russia to begin Covid-19 vaccine trials on 40,000 people next weekAlexander Gintsburg, the director of the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology and an academician at the Russian Academy of Sciences, said more than 20,000 people have taken part in the clinical trials of vaccines and drugs, based on human adenoviruses or human adenoviral vectors.“Vaccines do not contain live human adenoviruses, but human adenovirus vectors, that is, human viruses that cannot multiply in the body and are completely safe,” he said.Also read| Surface structure of Covid decoded findings may aid vaccine development: ReportThe Sputnik V vaccine consists of two shots that use different versions of adenoviruses -- virus types, some of which cause the common cold -- that the manufacturers have engineered to carry the gene for the surface protein of SARS-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19.“The approach of the Gamaleya Institute with the vaccine, using two human adenoviruses serotypes: number 5 (Ad5) and number 26 (Ad26), has a clear advantage over the one-vector approach used by other developers,” Gintsburg said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russia-looking-for-partnership-with-india-to-produce-covid-vaccine-rdif-ceo/story-UVKM9MpQy3w1sD7bqZ1SNO.html

20-08-2020||India||India nudges Beijing to walk the talk on Ladakh disengagement, China doesn’t budge||India and China were unable to bridge their differences on the disengagement and de-escalation process along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) during diplomatic talks on Thursday, with New Delhi emphasising the need to resolve “outstanding issues” speedily. People familiar with developments during the meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs dismissed an assertion in a readout from the Chinese foreign ministry that the two sides had “positively evaluated the progress” in the disengagement process. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a virtual media briefing the two sides will continue to work towards “complete disengagement” on the LAC. “In this context, they agreed to resolve the outstanding issues in an expeditious manner and in accordance with existing agreements and protocols,” he added.Also Read: India must inflict costs on China, writes Brahma ChellaneyThe WMCC meeting was co-chaired by joint secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry and Hong Liang, director general of the boundary and oceanic department of China’s foreign ministry. This was the body’s fifth virtual meeting since the Ladakh standoff along the disputed border emerged in the open in May. The people cited above, speaking on condition of anonymity, rejected the Chinese foreign ministry’s assertion that the two sides had “positively evaluated” the progress in disengagement of troops at friction points on the LAC.“That’s their assessment. It isn’t our assessment,” said one of the people. “The disengagement process is a work in progress and more needs to be done.”The people pointed to the external affairs ministry spokesperson’s comments on August 14 about “some progress” being made in the disengagement process, and that translating the principles of disengagement on the ground is a “complex process that requires re-deployment of troops by each side towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the LAC”. This, they said, continues to be India’s position.Spokesperson Srivastava characterised the discussions during the WMCC meeting as “candid and in-depth” and said the two sides “reaffirmed that in accordance with the agreements reached between the two foreign ministers and the two Special Representatives (SRs), the two sides will continue to sincerely work towards complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC in the western sector”. “The two sides were in agreement that restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas would be essential for the overall development of bilateral relations,” Srivastava added. The two sides acknowledged the need to maintain close communication through diplomatic and military channels to ensure complete disengagement, and agreed to continue ongoing engagements, including the meetings of WMCC, he said. The Chinese foreign ministry’s readout, issued in Mandarin, said the two sides reviewed the situation in the border areas, “positively evaluated the progress made in the disengagement of the frontline forces of the two countries”, and had a frank and in-depth exchange on “remaining issues on the ground”.The two sides “agreed to earnestly implement the consensus reached by the two countries’ foreign ministers and Special Representatives on border issues, continue to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels, promote further relaxation and cooling of the Sino-Indian border situation, properly handle remaining issues on the ground, and jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas,” the readout added.Experts believe India now has no other option but to prepare for deploying thousands of troops along the LAC during the winter as several rounds of talks at the military and diplomatic level haven’t led to the restoration of the status quo as it existed in April. Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the University at Albany, said: “It has been over 100 days since the first clashes at Pangong Tso and more than two months since the Galwan clash. While modest progress has been made, and it is a good sign both sides are talking, the reality is India shouldn’t expect talks will achieve much.”India’s strategy of having “more video teleconferences with various Quad countries is probably insufficient to change China’s cost-benefit calculus”, he said. “India can hope the nasty winter of eastern Ladakh might nudge China toward somewhat more disengagement, but it seems more likely Indian troops are facing additional long, cold months of forward deployments to prevent future Chinese land grabs,” Clary added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-sees-a-positive-at-border-talks-on-ladakh-friction-not-really-rebuts-india/story-L1yIaP02HG33JdYvgp00DI.html

Addressing a virtual press conference, Congress spokesperson and senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the concerns raised by those after the judgment are certainly not in any manner false or frivolous. “They cannot be dismissed off hand and deserve a lot of careful thinking because they include former judges of that very court, they include precedence and they include the basic spirit of the Supreme Court that its chest is larger than any chest in India and its shoulders being wider than any shoulder in India,” he said. The Supreme Court on Thursday granted two days to Bhushan to reconsider his “defiant statement” refusing to apologise for his contemptuous tweets against the judiciary. Bhushan told a bench, headed by Justice Arun Mishra, that he would consult his lawyers and think over the apex court’s suggestion. Bhushan’s counsel Rajeev Dhawan pointed out that his statement has been supported by Justices (retired) RM Lodha, Kurien Joseph and AP Shah. The Supreme Court on August 14 held Bhushan guilty of criminal contempt for his derogatory tweets against the judiciary, saying they cannot be said to be a fair criticism of the functioning of the judiciary made in the public interest. “The speed also, I would say, with greatest humility is very worrying and creates part of the problem,” Singhvi said. “However, I think these are all issues which I would not like to officially associate my party with because the party would require a resolution or something like that but the sentiment is very clear and I have articulated that from the podium,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/law-has-to-be-fair-and-balanced-congress-on-prashant-bhushan-contempt-case/story-vxJjjlw3BFduZBw7XwdEBN.html

20-08-2020||India||France becomes first country to open borders, consular services for Indian students||France has become the first country to open its borders to Indian students, researchers and teachers who have been invited by a French academic establishment or laboratory, and to holders of the “Talent” passport. Seven French visa processing centres in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kochi became operational from August 17 to receive select visa applications, while complying with Indian travel regulations and the safety of consular teams. Universities in France have readied themselves to receive international students, either wholly or partly on campus, said a statement from the French embassy. Addressing thousands of Indian students who have chosen to study in France, ambassador Emmanuel Lenain said: “France is returning to normalcy and I am delighted that international students will be among the first to benefit from it. The French embassy is fully mobilised to ensure that students can pursue their studies in France in the smoothest conditions possible, despite the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic.” The move “reaffirms France’s priority to academic mobility”, he said. The facility is limited to Indian students travelling to France in autumn for studies for more than three months on long-term visas, and short-term studies or internships, with accommodation in France. It is also available to professors or researchers employed or invited by a French academic institution or research laboratory who are travelling at the end of their studies or for teaching, and to those having a valid long-term visa or a “Talent” passport. These persons must possess an “International Travel Certificate to Mainland France” (Attestation de déplacement international dérogatoire), available on the website of the French interior ministry. This certificate has to be presented to the travel company before departure and to border control authorities on arrival in France.The certificate must be accompanied by an undertaking that the person does not have any symptoms of Covid-19 and has not been in contact with an infected person 14 days prior to departure. The visa applications will be processed in small batches every week to ensure adequate safety measures at the processing centres. Social distancing and other recommended protective measures are being adhered to, and mobile biometric data collection and courier services are available to limited in-person contacts at the centres. All travellers displaying any symptoms of Covid-19 on their entry in French territory will be prescribed quarantine or self-isolation. In order to prepare students, pre-departure sessions called “Bienvenue en France” are scheduled online during August 22-31. These sessions will acquaint students with administrative procedures, ways of finding accommodation, tips from alumni, and practical advice on student life in France. Around 118 Indian students are preparing to travel to France at the end of September as English language assistants for a stint in French schools. The programme offers an opportunity for French-speaking Indian students to live and work in France and gain professional exposure. The number of Indian students opting for higher studies in France has risen from 3,000 in 2014 to around 10,000 in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/france-becomes-first-country-to-open-borders-consular-services-for-indian-students/story-R8m77TeYXubiwDnzXLG8dI.html
20-08-2020||India||Kerala-Centre showdown looms over leasing Thiruvananthapuram airport to Adani||A day after the Union Cabinet approved the leasing of three airports including the one at Thiruvananthapuram to Adani Enterprises, an all-party meet called by Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday decided to explore legal options to block the move, setting the stage for another round of centre-state showdown.Though the opposition Congress stood with the state government on the issue, party leader and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor’s support to Centre’s decision left many red-faced. Tharoor, however, said his position on the issue has been consistent from the day one. “The all-party meet decided to explore all options. We will not allow this to happen. We firmly believe that without the state’s consent, nobody can take over it,” the CM said after the meeting. He also said the state assembly will pass a resolution opposing the takeover. He had also sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, deploring the move. Tharoor’s concurrence with the BJP and voices from the industry on the issue has left some Congress leaders upset. Pradesh Congress Committee chief Mullapally Ramachandran has criticised Tharoor’s move without naming him.“Congressmen can’t support the move to loot a public property by an industrialist close to PM Modi,” he said. AICC general secretary K C Venugopal also slammed the Union government’s decision calling it “a sellout”. Tharoor said private participation will usher in the much-needed development in his constituency. “My position on the airport has been consistent from the beginning itself and I stick to it. I am not a politician who says one thing to voters and something else afterwards for political convenience. The reality is that a private entity running the operations competitively is the only way the airport could flourish,” he tweeted.Also Read: 26 who helped passengers of crashed plane in Kozhikode contract Covid-19The state government has been opposing the privatization of the airport vehemently and has fought many legal battles but the courts refused to interfere calling it a policy decision. Last year, the Kerala High Court had dismissed a clutch of petitions including that of the state government and later the Supreme Court also declined to stay the decision. Last year, the government-owned Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) had participated in the open bid for the airport won by Adani Enterprises. Adani group had quoted Rs 168 per passenger fee, compared to KSIDC’s quote of Rs 135 per passenger fee followed by GMR at Rs 63.After losing the bid, the CM had written to the Prime Minister asking him not to handover the airport to a private entity citing the successful PPP model of the Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) and the Kannur airport. He said the state deserved preferential consideration over the private group taking into account its experience of running two airports and the public interest. He had also pointed out that the bid-winning firm had no experience in running airports, in an indirect reference to the Adani group’s inexperience in running airports, though it manages a number of sea ports in the country. Also Read: Onam 2020 to be limited inside homes due to Covid-19 pandemic: Kerala CMThe Airports Authority Employees Union (AAEU) has also decided to move another petition opposing the handover of the airport before the high court. “Employees were not consulted by anyone at any stage,” said AAEU convenor S Ajith Kumar. The BJP has responded by accusing the state government of attempting to whip up passion to divert attention from the raging gold smuggling case.“One of the oldest airports of the country is in bad shape. The CPI(M) and Congress want to sabotage its development,” said BJP state secretary S Suresh. Thirty kg gold was seized last month by customs from a bag addressed to an employee of the UAE consulate, casting a shadow on the government after the CM’s secretary was removed for his alleged ties with one of the main accused. “The state was consulted on every occasion. It also participated in the bid. Now the CM is crying hoarse as investigating agencies are coming close to his office in the gold smuggling case,” said minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan, criticizing, what he called the “new-found bonhomie between the Congress and CPI(M)”.Built in 1932, the airport currently operated by the Airport Authority of India (AAI) is situated on 638 acres of land allotted by the erstwhile rulers of Travancore. Later, only 40 acres were added to the airport crippling its further expansion. It is one of the few airports in the country situated in the middle of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-centre-showdown-looms-over-leasing-thiruvananthapuram-airport-to-adani/story-MRg3bv7zYExCyerKN4qFCL.html

20-08-2020||India||Mizoram govt, Assam Rifles spar over Covid spread by security personnel||Assam Rifles has accused the Mizoram government of violating the directions of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) by “restricting” the “operational movement” of its personnel, the central paramilitary force has said in a statement.The allegation came days after media reports said 15 personnel of the Assam Rifles forced their way through a check gate at Vairengte on the Mizoram-Assam border in defiance of the entry and screening protocol put in place to contain the spread of Covid-19.“The government of Mizoram denying entry has clearly violated the directions of MHA which has serious implications for national security and is a cause of grave concern,” a statement by the paramilitary said on Wednesday.The guidelines issued by the MHA have clearly made exceptions in respect of defence and central armed police forces (CAPF), it said.The Mizoram government shot back, saying the act of “wilful disregard” of safety protocol on the part of Assam Rifles had “seriously compromised” the safety of the people and negated the sincere efforts of the state government to contain the spread of Covid-19.The statement by the paramilitary force said, “The restrictions imposed by the state government on the operational movement of Assam Rifles is seriously hampering the smooth functioning of the force impacting the primary task of guarding the border.” The Assam Rifles has not caused any community spread of Covid-19 in the state and has been managing its coronavirus patients at its own quarantine centre at Zokhawsang near Aizawl, it said.The statement noted the state government had been approached several times and requested to pass suitable instructions to its officials at Vairangte entry gate and all other entry points to allow “unobstructed movement” of personnel of the force.Claiming that the personnel of the paramilitary force were not asked to undergo any medical test at Vairengte on August 18, the statement said, “Assam Rifles has always assured the state government that all its personnel entering the state will be put through the mandatory Covid-19 quarantine protocols and has never denied to undergo any medical test by state medical authorities.” Meanwhile, the state’s home department, in a letter to Brigadier Vinod S, the DIG of sector 23 of Assam Rifles, claimed on Wednesday that its troops crossed the border into the state without complying with the norms for medical screening at the check gate.It urged the Assam Rifles authorities to ensure that such acts were not repeated.The letter alleged, on Tuesday, at least 15 Assam Rifles personnel from 46 Battalion forced their way through the border gate after refusing to comply with the entry and medical screening protocol put in place by the state government.“Despite various regulations, orders, guidelines and instructions issued by the state government and repeated appeals to curtail avoidable inter-state movement of troops, the Assam Rifles has been less cooperative,” the letter said.The entry of as many as 1,124 Assam Rifles personnel was allowed from May to August 10, and 10 per cent of them tested positive for Covid-19, the letter said.Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga had earlier appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to temporarily stop inter-state movement of all paramilitary personnel in August to contain the further spread of Covid-19 after many of them were found to be infected with the virus.According to the state’s health department, at least 339 security personnel have tested positive for Covid-19 so far, accounting for 38.83 per cent of the total 873 cases.Of the 339 security personnel, 101 were from Assam Rifles, 230 from BSF and four each from the CRPF and the Army, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mizoram-govt-assam-rifles-spar-over-covid-spread-by-security-personnel/story-aG7NBhUHwEugkdzC0wEy2J.html
20-08-2020||India||Want Kulbhushan Jadhav to be represented by Indian lawyer in review plea: MEA||India wants Kulbhushan Jadhav to be represented by an Indian lawyer for filing a review petition against his death sentence in Pakistan, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said on Thursday. “We are in touch with Pakistan through diplomatic channels. We believe, for a free and fair trial in keeping with the letter and spirit of ICJ judgment in Kulbhushan Jhadav case, we have asked that Jadhav be represented by an Indian lawyer,” Srivastava said during the ministry’s weekly briefing, reported news agency ANI.“However, it is important that Pakistan needs to address the core issues; these issues involve the provision of relevant documents and providing unimpeded consular access to Jadhav,” he said.Islamabad has said only Pakistani lawyers and those entitled to practice in the country can be appointed to represent Jadhav. Earlier this month, the Islamabad high court directed the Pakistan government to inform India to appoint a lawyer for Jadhav, 50, so that he could file a review petition against his conviction. The court also directed the Pakistan government to again inform Jadhav of his rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the ICJ’s order of 2019 staying his execution and calling for a review of his conviction. The case will next come up with a larger bench of Islamabad high court again on September 3. India has accused Pakistan of coercing Jadhav not to file a review petition and of not complying with the ICJ’s verdict. Jadhav was arrested by Pakistani security agencies in Balochistan in March 2016 and charged with involvement in spying. India rejected these allegations and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/want-kulbhushan-jadhav-to-be-represented-by-indian-lawyer-in-review-plea-mea/story-8FmDP1D7pYICKaIrPRx1wM.html
20-08-2020||India||Haryana Guv seeks President’s approval, experts say job quota in private sector legally untenable||Haryana Governor Satyadeo Narain Arya’s decision to seek President’s approval for the state cabinet’s decision to reserve 75% of jobs, generated by the private sector in the state, for locals can have legal implications for other states that have announced regulations to reserve private sector jobs for state residents, say legal experts.Arya’s decision to seek President’s approval was based on Haryana’s law secretary’s view that the proposed law could be seen as a violation of two articles of the Constitution --- Article 14 that allows equality before law and Article (1)(g) that allows freedom to practice any profession or trade to all citizens.However, Haryana’s advocate general M B Mahajan said the proposed reservation in jobs for locals did not violate any Central law. “It also does not come in conflict with Article 14 of the Constitution, either,” Mahajan said.But, legal experts said Arya’s decision could have implications for other states, which have or are in the process of adopting similar reservation norms for private sector jobs to protect interests of the locals.“The ground for giving reservation has to be socio-economic backwardness. Place of birth and residence cannot be a ground. This has been clearly stated by the Supreme Court in at least 10 various judgments, if not more, since 1954. Providing reservation in any other form could be seen as contrary to the Constitutional norms,” said senior Supreme Court lawyer and Congress leader Vivek Tankha.Another senior Supreme Court lawyer Ashok Arora said reservation in private sector jobs to the locals can be provided, if the state can provide quantifiable reasons for the same to ensure equality. “The state governments will have to provide ‘reasonable’ ground for reserving jobs for locals which is quantifiable. And, this can be achieved only through a proper scientific study,” he said. The Supreme Court, through various judgments, has said that reservation to castes or classes can be provided only after a detailed study providing evidence of their socio-economic and educational backwardness. In the past, the SC had struck down other backward classes (OBC) reservation in government jobs for castes such as Jats in Haryana and Marathas in Maharashtra in absence of a detailed study.Experts say for reserving jobs for locals in the private sector, the state governments will have to show economic backwardness, which may not be easy. As per a January 2020 report by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation (MOSPI), Haryana’s per capita income was Rs 2,26,644 in 2018-19, the sixth highest in the country after Goa, Delhi, Sikkim, Chandigarh and Puducherry.Some other states, which have provided for reservation to locals in private sector jobs, such as Maharashtra (up to 80%), Andhra Pradesh (75%), Karnataka (75%) and Madhya Pradesh (70%), also rank high on per capital income. Maharashtra is ranked seventh, Andhra Pradesh 16 and Karnataka 17 on the country’s per capita income index released by MOSPI.The Andhra Pradesh Employment of Local Candidates in Industries/Factories Act, 2020, that stipulates reservation in private sector jobs is under challenge in the state high court on the ground that it violates Article 16(2) and (3) of the Constitution which prohibits discrimination in employment on the grounds of place of residence. The court’s bench of Chief Justice GK Maheswari and Justice Kanneganti Lalitha in May, 2020, asked the state government to submit a reply within four weeks on whether the law violates the Constitution. The next hearing of the case is slated for September. The court has not stayed the application of the law.Telangana has joined other states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh in insisting that the private sector provide reservations to the locals for employment. Last week, the Telangana cabinet approved a policy giving incentives such as tax concessions to industries that reserve jobs for locals in the state. “The cabinet felt that the locals should have more opportunities in the industries being set up in the state,” said an official statement.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Monday announced that all government jobs in the state would be reserved for students of the state, who have cleared class X and XII examinations from a school in the state.He said the regulations in this regard would be issued soon. The officials said that this was being done since, like many other states, MP cannot impose a language restriction to prevent outsiders from getting government jobs. Written and spoken knowledge of Marathi in Maharashtra, Tamil in Tamil Nadu, Kannada in Karnataka and Bengali in West Bengal is a must to be eligible for a government job. However, Jammu and Kashmir in its new domicile policy had made it easier for outsiders to get a job in the state for the purpose of national integration.“As Hindi is the official and spoken language in the state, we cannot impose language restriction like many other states. So, the government is working on introducing schooling from the state, as a criteria, for applying for a government job,” a state government official said.Tankha said providing 100% reservation in government jobs is a violation of SC judgment which caps reservation at 50%.But, this renewed bid of the political parties to reserve jobs for locals is seen as an attempt to attract voters before elections even though it may not be legally tenable.The promise of reservation for locals in private sector was made by the ruling party of Andhra Pradesh, YSR Congress, ruling alliance partners in Maharashtra -- Shiv Sena and Congress, Jharkhand’s ruling party, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and Jannayak Janata Party of Dushyant Chautala, which is in power with Bharatiya Janata party in Haryana, just before assembly elections in these states in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-governor-seeking-clarity-on-quota-for-locals-in-private-jobs-has-implications-for-other-states/story-fb6jF9uDOFMHD9ibV7WO8I.html
20-08-2020||India||Vice Prez Naidu pitches for adequate reservation of women in parliament and state legislatures||Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday batted for adequate reservation of women representatives in Parliament and state legislatures and asked all political parties to arrive at an early agreement on the subject matter. He made these remarks while addressing a virtual event by the Indian Association of Parliamentarians for Population and Development (IAPPD). A bill to provide reservation to women in the Lok Sabha and various state assemblies was passed by the Upper House (Rajya Sabha) but got terminated after the dissolution of the 15th Lok Sabha in 2014. Naidu added that districts with huge imbalance in sex ratios should get greater attention from the elected representatives. An official statement said the Vice President observed that such a proposal was pending for a long time and also called for moral education in schools so that children grow up and become responsible and sensitive citizens who view gender discrimination as immoral. Along with pitching for adequate reservation for women in the supreme legislative body, Naidu pushed for stricter implementation of laws to ban female foeticide and dowry and ensure free and compulsory education for the girl child. The Vice President at the virtual event, also pitched for equipping the elderly with new-age skills in order to lead fuller professionals lives and continue their contribution to nation-building. If young are the ‘demographic dividend’, seniors are ‘demographic bonus’ for the nation, he added. Naidu highlighted that the health system needs to be re-oriented in order to cater to specific needs of the elderly population through provision of medical benefits and insurance coverage.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vice-prez-naidu-pitches-for-adequate-reservation-of-women-in-parliament-and-state-legislatures/story-knnCe0KbS0Lr6zkkVcHDUP.html

In view of heavy rainfall forecast by IMD, state chief secretary A K Tripathy held a video conference with senior officials, including collectors to review the situation arising out of heavy downpours.Jena said after the review meeting that five districts received more than 100 mm rainfall, while ten others reported more than 50 mm.The two who were washed away on Wednesday evening have been identified after their bodies were fished out of the river on Thursday by fire service personnel, officer in-charge of Moroda police station, Madhusudan Dutta said.Jena said low-lying areas and roads in different parts of the state were submerged due to the torrential rains.Reports of damage to mud and thatched houses, standing crops were received from some areas.Assessment of the loss due to the rain is on, he said.Cuttack recorded 117.2 mm rainfall, Jajpur 111.8 mm, Koraput 100.8 mm and Kendrapada 100.2 mm in the 24 hours ending at 8.30 AM on Thursday, Jena said.Salepur block in Cuttack district recorded the highest rainfall of 300 mm followed by Nischintakoili at 297.5 mm and Nabarangpur which saw 243 mm rainfall, he said.Revenue and Disaster Management Minister Sudam Marndi who took stock of the situation, said the situation is under control and there is no fear of flood though the water level of several rivers in the state is rising.Jena said the water level of Hati river in Kalahandi district is rising and the local tehsildar and block development officer are keeping a close watch on the situation.Road communication between Dharmagarh and Junagarh in Kalahandi has snapped as water was flowing over the highway, he said.The water level of Indravati and Vaskel rivers in Nabarangpur district has risen, but there is no flood situation at present, the SRC said.The water level of Baitarani river is at 17.56 metres as against the danger mark of 17.83 metres at Akhuapada in Bhadrak district, an official said adding several low-lying areas in the district have been submerged due to heavy rainfall.In Puri district, the road link between Tinikuda and Balikera was disrupted as a temporary bridge over Bhargabi river was swept away by floodwaters.The water level of Jalaka river at Mathani in Balasore district is flowing at 6.6 metres, above the danger mark of 5.5 metres, but the situation is under control, he said.In Kandhamal district, road communication between Phulbani and Dakapala was disrupted due to overflowing of Salunki river and some houses were damaged at Nuasahi in Baliguda block, Jena said.Water-logging was also reported from several low-lying areas in Kendrapara, Dhenkanal, Nabarangpur, Koraput and Boudh districts, the SRC said. The Meteorological Centre here has forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall in some places of Koraput, Malkangiri, Nabarangpur, Nuapada, Bolangir, Bargarh, Sonepur, Angul, Sambalpur, Deogarh, Sundargarh and Keonjhar till Friday.The Met centre has also forecast the formation of another low pressure area over Bay of Bengal around August 23.Marndi said all district collectors, ODRAF and fire services have been put on alert in view of the forecast of a fresh low pressure area.The district collectors have been asked to conduct a thorough assessment of the damage caused by the rainfall and submit detailed reports, he said.Fishermen have been advised not to venture into the sea along and off Odisha coast till Friday as squally weather with surface wind up to 55 kmph speed may prevail during the period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-rains-in-odisha-two-men-washed-away/story-4XG8eZdWQSVYVWsUeBuDUP.html
20-08-2020||India||Seven active Chinese military air bases under close watch of Indian agencies||Even as the tensions on China border continue over territorial issues, Indian agencies are keeping a close eye on the activities of the People’s Liberation Army’s Air Force (PLAAF) spread all along the Line of Actual Control with India opposite Ladakh in the north to Arunachal Pradesh in the Northeast.“We are keeping a close watch on the Hotan, Gar Gunsa, Kashghar, Hopping, Dkonka Dzong, Linzhi and Pangat airbases of the PLAAF in the Xinjiang and Tibet region and all of them have been highly active in the recent times,” government sources told ANI.The Chinese PLAAF has upgraded a number of these bases in recent times including the construction of hardened shelters, the extension of runway lengths and deployment of additional manpower to carry out more operations, they said.Sources said the Linzhi airbase opposite the Northeastern states is mainly a helicopter base and the Chinese have also built a network of helipads there to enhance their surveillance activities in those areas.The PLAAF has been deploying their fighter aircraft including their Chinese version of the Sukhoi-30 and indigenous J-series fighters opposite the Ladakh sector and other areas along with their strategic bombers which have been under constant monitoring of the Indian agencies through satellites and other means.The Indian side has also ramped up its preparedness in the view of the heightened activity by the Chinese forces on their side of the LAC and has deployed its fleet of Sukhoi-30MKIs, MiG-29s and Mirage-2000s at the forward air bases to tackle any misadventure.In the initial phase of the tension with China in the April-May timeframe, the Indian forces had seen the deployment of Su-30s and MiG-29s in the forward air bases and they had played an important role in thwarting an airspace violation bid by the Chinese aircraft in the Eastern Ladakh sector.The Indian Air Force has an edge over the Chinese in the Ladakh region as their fighters have to fly and take off from very high altitude bases while the Indian fleet can take off from plains and reach the mountainous region in almost no time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seven-active-chinese-military-air-bases-under-close-watch-of-indian-agencies/story-6Cpne426wMOyqfGBtuWaPK.html
20-08-2020||India||Using cloned cheques, gang swindles Rs 40 lakh from UP govt; 1 arrested||A member of a cheque cloning gang making fraudulent withdrawals from the bank accounts of government and non-government organisations was arrested in Lucknow’s Vibhuti Khand area on Wednesday night, police officials of the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (UP STF) said on Thursday.The gang was operational in different cities of the state, as well as other states, the officials added.Inspector general (IG) of police, UP STF, Amitabh Yash, said a gang member identified as Jaunpur resident Arvind Tewari was arrested but three key members Shadab Anwar Sheikh, Ashraf Alam Khan and Manish Maurya, as well their associates, were still out of police reach.He said the gang withdrew nearly Rs 40 lakh from the bank account of Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) by cloning four cheques in July. The chief manager of Bank of Baroda’s Vibhuti Khand branch, where UPEIDA has its account, lodged an FIR with the Vibhuti Khand police station on August 8 after detecting the fraudulent withdrawal of the amount, Yash said.Another STF official said the gang similarly cloned cheques of the bank accounts of Dr Shakuntala Mishra National Rehabilitation University and Uttar Pradesh State Ayush Society but failed to get them cleared. He said the gang was operational for the past few years and it was suspected to have withdrawn money from the bank accounts of some government and non-government organisations by using the same method. The STF official said the gang exploited loopholes in the cheque truncation system (CTS) or the image based clearing system of cheques implemented by Reserve Bank of India from August 1, 2013.“After implementation of this system, cheques are no longer sent for clearance. Only their digital images are sent. This system was implemented to cut down the time required in cheque clearance. It also helps banks in maintaining the data of cheques cleared through the centralised image archival system,” he said.The official said the fraudsters used the sent images of cloned cheques, which could not be detected digitally as they carried correct details of the bank, account holders, account number, cheque number and the balance in the account in question.“The gang used to procure cheque books of various banks through their sources within the banking system after paying them some money. The gang used to prepare the cloned cheques with the help of printers and laptops and fill them in with details of account holders that they already had procured with help of insiders,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/using-cloned-cheques-gang-swindles-rs-40-lakh-from-up-govt-1-arrested/story-8XZCoxCNW6i8rk9Bx9Oy0K.html
20-08-2020||India||Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM-S exits Grand Alliance ahead of Bihar assembly polls||In a setback to the Grand Alliance before the Bihar assembly polls, former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi-led Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) (HAM-S) has announced that it will leave the alliance. The party, which is all set to join the NDA, will take a call on the issue in a couple of days. “The party’s executive committee has authorized Manjhi ji to take a call on the future course of action,” HAM-S spokesperson Danish Rizwan said. Sources in the party said that the HAM-S may either merge with the JD(U) or enter into an alliance with the party for the Bihar Assembly election. “Politics is full of probabilities and possibilities,” Rizwan added. Manjhi, who was once critical of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, of late has been heaping praise on different decisions taken by the state government. The party had contested the Lok Sabha elections as part of the Grand Alliance, but had issued an ultimatum for the formation of a coordination committee in the alliance by June 25, so that seat sharing talks could begin. Manjhi, however, during the last couple of months had been exploring options of an alliance with different parties including Owaisi led-AIMIM. Earlier, Manjhi had fallen out with Nitish Kumar after he was made to quit the CM’s post in early 2015. He walked out of the NDA after a poor show in the 2015 Assembly polls. HAM-S has one member each in the Bihar Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council. Sources in the party said that HAM-S becoming a part of the NDA is all but a formality. “The party has laid no pre-conditions on seats,” said a senior party leader, who wished not to be quoted. NDA leaders feel that if at all Manjhi joins the alliance, the JD(U) will use it to silence the LJP, which of late has been embarrassing the government by raising different issues. “If somebody shows trust in the NDA’s leadership and policy, we do not have any problem with other parties joining,” BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jitan-ram-manjhi-led-ham-s-exits-grand-alliance-ahead-of-bihar-assembly-polls/story-bpSf73W79DRHV3yUJoCiZO.html

In the last 24 hours, 9,18,470 people were tested, according to the Union health ministry.“A record number of 9,18,470 Covid-19 tests conducted in a single day in the last 24 hours. Tests Per Million (TPM) continue to rise, standing at 23,668 today. India’s total recoveries reach nearly 21 lakh as the recovery rate rises to nearly 74 per cent,” the health ministry stated, adding that increased testing across the country has helped bring down the positivity rate.The government aims to run 10 lakh tests a day in line with the objective of early identification and isolation of Covid-19 positive cases. The government’s strategy is to bring down the case fatality rate (CFR) through aggressive testing and efficient clinical treatment.A continuous increase in average daily recoveries has led to India’s recovery rate -- the patients who have recovered as a proportion of those who tested positive -- touching 73.18 per cent, and the case fatality rate coming down to 1.92 per cent, shows health ministry data. About 30 states have CFR, deaths from the disease as a proportion of the case tally, below the national average.India has 977 labs in the government sector and 517 private labs, taking the total number of labs to 1,494 labs today.A record number of tests were conducted on a day when the country recorded its highest ever single-day spike with nearly 70,000 virus infections recorded on Thursday.

Delhi received nearly 80% of the season’s rainfall in 11 days, Urban Affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri said and expressed confidence that the government would soon be able to solve the monsoon woes of the people of the city.“Delhi received 80% of the season’s rainfall in 11 days. I urge all our partners—the Delhi government, urban local bodies and others to learn from experiences year after year. I’m confident we can solve problems of the common man,” Puri said on continuous water-logging in Delhi and adjoining Gurugram.The rainfall also reduced the rain deficiency in the capital -- from 13 per cent on Monday to 11 per cent on Wednesday.The Safdarjung Observatory has recorded 147.4 mm rainfall against the normal of 165.2 mm in August so far. Overall, it has recorded 466 mm rainfall, six per cent more than the normal of 441.3 mm since June 1 when the monsoon season officially begins. On an average, the city logs 11.3 mm rainfall from 8:30 am on August 19 to 8:30 am on August 20 every year. The Palam weather station gauged 70.9 mm precipitation during the period, more than six times the normal rainfall for this time of the year. Earlier, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned of thunderstorms along with heavy rains in Delhi and neighbouring areas on Thursday too. The downpour may lead to “major traffic disruption” due to heavy water logging and there is also an “increased chance” of road accidents, the IMD has cautioned.Water-logging was particularly severe in Gurugram, where roads were completely inundated, harassing commuters who remained stuck for hours on water-logged roads. The rains also led to power outages in many parts of the city.Civic agencies in the national capital reported incidents of trees being uprooted in a few areas due to heavy rain. A boundary wall of a school in South Delhi’s Saket also collapsed, damaging several vehicles parked alongside it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-80-of-season-s-rain-in-11-days-hardeep-singh-puri-says-delhi-s-monsoon-woes-to-be-solved-soon/story-LHfWcLZwhMoXBk5R19oAyK.html
20-08-2020||India||Bihar education clerk killed for detecting irregularities in teachers recruitment, three nabbed||Bihar police on Thursday claimed that Gopalganj-based education clerk Ajai Rai was murdered last month by people involved in fraudulent appointments to teachers’ posts since he had unearthed the fraud. The police claimed breakthrough in the case with the arrest of three suspected criminals including two sharp shooters from Uttar Pradesh.Police said that two motorcycle borne armed criminals gunned down Ajay at Lakshwar village under Thave police station area in Gopalganj on July 3 when he was on his way to his office. Police had recovered two empty cartridges from the spot.Those arrested have been identified as Zulfikar-Ali-Bhutto (a resident of Gopalganj), Mohammad Wasir Ansari and Mohammad Shahbaz Alam (both from Deoria district in UP). Police say the killers were hired for Rs 3 lakh by an “education mafia” to eliminate Ajay, who was actively involved in an investigation into recruitment of teachers using fake qualification certificates.Police said that Zulfikar, a dismissed government teacher, ran a private school and his wife was also a school teacher.Station house officer of the Thave police station, Vishal Anand, said Zulfikar was recruited as a teacher in 2005 and was subsequently dismissed in 2017 after he was caught with a consignment of banned liquor. He was also involved in the murder of one Umesh Bhagat and in a liquor smuggling case which is registered in Sahjanwa police station of Gorakhpur district in UP.Gopalganj SP Manoj Tiwari said all the three accused were arrested from Khairtia village under the limits of Mirganj police station. They confessed to their involvement in Ajay’s murder. Wasir and Shahbaz revealed that they were hired by Zulfikar and paid Rs 3 lakh for the contract killing.Investigations revealed that Ajay was all set to submit a report including evidence against teachers hired fraudulently to the vigilance investigation bureau (VIB) before he was murdered.Tiwari said Zulfikar was also involved selling fake TET certificates along with his nephew.“Raids are on to nab those who played a crucial role behind Ajay’s murder”, the senior police officer added.The VIB is investigating large-scale fraudulent appointments of school teachers done using forged documents. The bureau has registered 337 FIRs involving 903 teachers across the state, of which, services of 639 teachers have been terminated by the department of education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-education-clerk-killed-for-detecting-irregularities-in-teacher-recruitment-three-nabbed/story-RCjGCpndArXiYWiKLh7WJM.html

At the same time, he said, he was sure the Maharashtra government will cooperate with the agency, respecting the apex court’s decision.“I hope the investigation will not be carried on, as was done with Dr Narendra Dabholkar’s murder also under investigation by the CBI, which commenced in 2014 and remains unresolved,” Pawar said in a series of tweets on Thursday.Also Read: Swara Bhasker on CBI taking over Sushant Singh Rajput’s case: ‘Not fair to suggest Mumbai Police were not doing a good job’Pawar was pointing out to the case of Dabholkar, an anti-superstition crusader, who was shot dead from a close range in broad daylight by unknown gunmen on August 20 ,2013.

The case, which is yet to be solved, is said to be linked to other three murders, those of rationalist and Communist leader Govind Pansare, Kannada scholar M M Kalburgi and journalist and activist Gauri Lankesh.“I am sure the Maharashtra Govt will respect the judgement of the Supreme Court to hand over Sushant Singh Rajput’s case to the CBI and fully cooperate in the investigation process,” Pawar further said.He had publicly ticked off his grand-nephew Parth Pawar over demanding CBI investigation in the case. He, however, had also said that there was no reason to oppose the CBI investigation. “Maharashtra and Mumbai police are capable and I have 100% trust in them. If someone still wants a probe by CBI or any other agency, then there is no reason to oppose it,” he had said, immediately after ridiculing his grand-nephew on the issue.Also Read: ‘Conspiracy to malign Maharashtra govt’: Shiv Sena after SC hands Sushant Singh Rajput case to CBIThe Supreme Court on Wednesday decided to transfer Rajput’s case to the CBI.

20-08-2020||India||Chhattisgarh Congress to construct party offices in 22 districts of the state||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday joined a ceremony, or bhumi pujan, via video conferencing to mark the beginning of the construction of the party’s offices in 22 of Chhattisgarh’s 28 districts. Other Congress leaders like PL Punia, Chandan Yadav and chief minister Bhupesh Baghel were also present at the bhumi pujan that coincided with late former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s birth anniversary.The party’s offices will be renovated or expanded in the remaining six districts with donations from party workers and leaders, Congress functionaries said. All of them will be known as Rajiv Bhawans. “We are hoping that on August 20 next year, the birth anniversary of Rajiv Gandhiji, the buildings will be inaugurated. The approximate cost of one structure is around 1.5 crore which will be collected from party workers of concerned districts,” said a party leader on condition of anonymity.State Congress treasurer Ramgopal Agarwal said the state government has allotted land for some of these party offices as per the law. He added some party leaders have donated land in some districts. “The money for the constructions will be collected from the party workers across the state.”Another Congress leader said the design of the offices will be the same in all districts and the costs could vary.Congress spokesman Shailesh Nitin Trivedi said party workers were collecting the money for the constructions at the booth and district level. “In around a dozen of districts, we have land donated by the leaders or purchased with party funds.”The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has questioned the process of land allotment for the offices and demanded an inquiry. “How come the Congress managed to get government land in a dozen places in such a short time? Have they misused the government officials ? At what rate the land has been allotted? The Congress should answer these questions and an inquiry should be done,” said BJP leader Sacchinand Upasane.He said in the last 15 years, the BJP managed to build party offices in 20 places. “At some places, we are still fighting legal battles... how come these allotments are done so easily?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-congress-to-construct-party-offices-in-22-districts-of-the-state/story-M1gCruTqj9wj5WlkhG2uBL.html

20-08-2020||India||Congress to raise China, Facebook, Covid-19 handling in upcoming Parliament session||Parliament’s monsoon session, which is expected to commence from September 10, is likely to be stormy as the Congress plans to raise issues like the border standoff with China in Ladakh and Facebook’s alleged nexus with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), party functionaries aware of the matter said. The Congress is also likely to target the government over the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the economic crisis it has aggravated, job losses, and agrarian distress.A Congress functionary said the party would demand a statement from Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the border row, especially after his remarks at the June 19 all-party meeting that there have been no intrusions by Chinese forces into Indian territory in Ladakh.The Congress attacked Modi for refraining from naming China in his Independence Day speech, saying the government should tell the people how it proposes to push back the Chinese forces occupying Indian territory.Military talks on reducing tensions along the disputed border in Ladakh have hit a roadblock with India adopting a tougher line in its efforts to restore status quo ante. The tensions escalated in June when 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash with Chinese troops.Also Read: In absence of Parliament session, social activists start consultation on key policy issuesThe functionary said they will also demand a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into the Wall Street Journal report last week that claimed Facebook’s Indian staff ignored its rules in handling hate speech by BJP politicians. The Congress has alleged an “unholy nexus” between Facebook and the BJP.The Congress wrote to Facebook’s founder Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday saying the social media company may be “a willing participant in thwarting the rights and values” India’s founding leaders had sacrificed their lives for. It called for an investigation into the report.The functionary said the Congress will also take on the government over its “mishandling” of the Covid-19 pandemic. “When Rahul Gandhi flagged the issue as early as February, he was ridiculed by the BJP. See, where we stand now. We have become the third country in the world to cross over two million Covid-19 cases. We also saw an ill-conceived lockdown that resulted in a huge economic crisis and massive job losses,” he said on condition of anonymity. “The government has to tell us why and how it failed in containing the pandemic.”The functionary said the party will also raise the issues of job losses, agrarian distress, and the economic crisis. “We will also seek a discussion on the PM Cares Fund in the wake of the Prime Minister’s Office denying information [on it under the]...RTI [Right to Information Act]...We have been demanding transparency in the fund as it does not belong to any individual but the country.”The Centre set up the fund on March 28 as a public charitable trust with the primary objective of dealing with any kind of emergency or distress situation such as the Covid-19 pandemic. It is unclear how much money it has raised.The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a plea seeking the transfer of money collected for the fund to the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF). A three-judge bench held the situation because of the Covid-19 and the requirement of financial resources to deal with the pandemic have necessitated the establishment of the fund and the court cannot object to it. The Congress criticised the order. It has said the fund is not transparent and questioned the need for a PM Cares fund when NDRF exists.The Congress will also raise the issue of the sale of 32 Public Sector Undertakings and handing over railways and airports to private parties. The functionary said the party will talk to other like-minded opposition parties to present a united front in Parliament on all critical issues confronting the country. “We will meet soon to firm up our Parliament strategy.”The monsoon session, which usually starts in mid-July, has been deferred due to the pandemic, which led to a sweeping federal lockdown from March 25. It is expected to be short. Unprecedented logistics and infrastructure arrangements will be in place during the session. The arrangements will include ultraviolet germicidal irradiation in air-conditioning systems to kill or inactivate microorganisms, 10 display screens for live proceedings, earmarked seats for top leaders, and special communication cables linking both Houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-to-raise-china-facebook-covid-19-handling-in-upcoming-parliament-session/story-yIgQkRhJJZsUuoTlUL3qrL.html

20-08-2020||India||Delhi restaurants, hotels allowed to serve liquor; bars stay closed||The Delhi government on Thursday asked its excise department to permit hotels and restaurants to serve liquor, a move the hospitality industry said could give a boost to the sector ailing due to the impact of the coronavirus disease.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia directed excise officials to furnish “necessary permission” so that liquor could be served at restaurants as part of dine-in services and in hotel rooms. He said the decision was taken keeping “revenue implications” in mind.However, government officials said the directive alone did not mean that hotels and restaurants will be allowed to serve liquor from Friday. They said the move may still require the approval of lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, who is the chairperson of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) and has overturned the government’s decisions in the past.“Considering the revenue implications, the excise department issued necessary permission for service of liquor in the restaurants and clubs by licensees at the table and in the hotel rooms,” read the Delhi government order dated August 20 and signed by Sisodia.“Bars will remain closed under the provisions of unlock guidelines of the ministry of home affairs. However, several state governments, including Assam, Punjab, Rajasthan, etc. have permitted service of liquor by licence holders under the Excise Rule in restaurants and clubs and in hotel rooms,” it said.The Union home ministry allowed the reopening of hotels and restaurants from June 8 as part of its plan to resume businesses and activities that were restricted across the country since the end of March.Bars and pubs, however, are still not allowed to operate anywhere in the country, including in the national capital, as per the latest “Unlock 3” guidelines applicable till August.While Delhi allowed restaurants to open from June 8 in line with the central directive, it allowed hotels to resume operations on Wednesday. The sale of liquor from retail shops in the city began in May.An excise official, who did not want to be named, confirmed receiving the directions from Sisodia, who is also the excise minister. “We are working on it and will place a proposal after examining all the rules and how other states have implemented it. The file will be sent to the deputy CM for approval,” he said.However, another excise official said the proposal might go to SDMA for a final approval. “If approved, the order may be issued,” he said.When asked whether the proposal will be sent to the Baijal or SDMA, the chief minister’s office said: “The matter falls within the ambit of the unlock guidelines and the Delhi government can take a direct decision on it.” The LG’s office declined to comment on the matter.There have been instances of Baijal and the government differing on a subject. On July 30, the Delhi government announced the opening of hotels and weekly markets, but Baijal overturned the decision after it was sent to him for approval. The government sent him a second proposal to that effect on August 6. After that, Baijal convened an SDMA meeting on Wednesday and the move was finally green-lighted.Prakul Kumar, secretary general of National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), said: “We are yet to get the orders from the excise department... Just food is not enough; liquor is an important ingredient in the overall dining-out experience.”“The bar space in the restaurant will remain closed, but liquor will be served at the tables. This way we can ensure social distancing norms. But we have to wait for the excise department order.”In a letter dated August 16, NRAI sought permission from the Delhi excise department to serve liquor at restaurants.Restaurant owners said the sale of liquor at restaurants will help them cut losses even as they cited social-distancing guidelines that ask them to operate with 50% occupancy.Manpreet Singh, owner of Zen restaurant in Connaught Place and the treasurer of NRAI, welcomed the state government’s decision. “This is a great news for the restaurant industry. This order is timely, will help restaurant owners recover losses and allow people to have a good time. We are waiting for the excise commissioner’s order in this regard,” he said.Kanwal Wali, secretary of the India International Centre (IIC), said: “We will continue not to serve liquor to our members and guests until something is communicated to us from the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serving-liquor-allowed-in-delhi-restaurants-hotels/story-PJLuR93KEXhTJMIgZTVcuN.html

The public did not get ration which was their right and the problem took the form of tragedy,” Gandhi had said in a tweet in Hindi.A huge row broke out between the government and the Congress party after a report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) last week alleged that senior Facebook executives had opposed applying hate speech rules to posts by certain BJP leaders.The BJP and the Congress engaged in a bitter war of words over the issue.“We cannot allow any manipulation of our hard-earned democracy through bias, fake news and hate speech. As exposed by WSJ, Facebook’s involvement in peddling fake and hate news needs to be questioned by all Indians,” Gandhi tweeted on Tuesday.Hitting back at the Congress, Union Information Technology Minister and senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said people whose political base has “shrunk like anything” seek to dominate discourse on these platforms, and asserted that everybody, regardless of his ideology, has the right to air views.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-again-attacks-govt-claims-india-won-t-be-able-to-give-jobs-to-youth/story-2sBexK1k3L2vJmopN58b3L.html

Previous mentions were limited to “sons, daughters, married, unmarried and widow”. It will become law once the legislature passes it. The bill is likely to be tabled in the state legislature on Friday, he said.In March last year, the officer said, the state law commission, in a proposal submitted to the state government, had raised the demand for a law acknowledging the inheritance rights of the ‘third gender’. Justice AN Mittal, chairman of the state law commission, had drawn the attention of the state government toward the inheritance laws that left out the transgender.After the amendment, the third gender will have succession and physical rights to the property. The amendments have been made in the section 4 (10), 108 (2), 109 and 110 of the UP Revenue Code (Amendment) Act, 2020, to give the transgender succession and physical rights to the property, the Revenue Department officer said.The rights to inherit the ancestral property will not only protect the third genders from social ostracism but will also give them equal rights in the society, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/transgenders-get-right-to-inherit-agricultural-land-in-uttar-pradesh/story-ZerkW7LxEA1qOGoctYJZ0J.html

20-08-2020||India||Covid-19 highlighted importance of diversification and resilience of supply chains, says Jaishankar||The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of diversification and resilience of supply chains as well as the relevance of the concept of strategic autonomy, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Thursday. The pandemic also underscored the need for broader rebalancing and a more equitable world view, which for India means the urgent need to strengthen national capacities through the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) initiative, he told a roundtable of the ASEAN-India Network of Think Tanks (AINTT). The Covid-19 crisis has shown up the lack of multilateralism at a time when it “was most in demand”, Jaishankar said in his address to the virtual event. “If we saw little leadership, it was not just due to the admittedly anachronistic nature of key international organisations. Equally, it reflected the intensely competitive nature of current international politics,” he said. Going beyond organisations and structures, this was “even more evident in the individual behaviour of many states”. He added, “Therefore, the big issue that confronts the thinking world is not simply the state of the economy, the damage to societies or the challenges to governance. It is actually a debate on the future directions of global affairs and what kind of world order – or disorder – we are going to live in.” As a consequence of all this, “the commodity that is perhaps most valued in international relations today is that of trust”, and national security is being redefined to include economic security while concerns have also arisen about technology security, he said. In an apparent reference to China, he said “the actions of nations during times of crisis determine how the world really perceives them, and they did bring up many of the risks inherent in the current global economy”. He added, “Consequently, concerns about supply chains are sought to be mitigated at the very least through greater emphasis on their diversification and resilience.” The concept of strategic autonomy, which was once fashionable in a unipolar world, has assumed relevance again in terms of global supply chains, Jaishankar noted. The Covid-19 crisis has led to an unprecedented challenge and a great deal of uncertainty and the true extent of its destruction remains unclear. “We cannot pretend that this is just another happening, only bigger. On the contrary, the impact of the Coronavirus has been beyond our collective imagination,” he said. “Current estimates put the cumulative loss in the range of $5.8-8.8 trillion or approximately 6.5-9.7% of the global GDP. The contraction of the world economy being predicted will surely be the largest since the Great Depression,” he added. The relationship between India and Asean was founded on the shared interest in globalisation and the pandemic has brought out the indivisible aspect of human existence that underpins globalisation, Jaishankar said. “Whether it is climate change, terrorism or indeed pandemics, these are not challenges where those affected have a choice. The limitations of purely national responses or sometimes living in denial have become evident,” he said. Jaishankar said Asean and India can together help shape Asia and the world, and need to debate issues such as the Indo-Pacific. “As global relationships alter, we too need to take stock...As we come out of this pandemic, let us be clear on one fact. The world will never be the same again. That means new thinking, fresh ideas, more imagination and greater openness,” he added. AINTT was established to provide policy inputs to governments on future cooperation between India and Asean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-highlighted-importance-of-diversification-and-resilience-of-supply-chains-says-jaishankar/story-V2apQhseaCgaBPJ2p09EuN.html

Rajput, 34, was dead at his apartment in Bandra in Mumbai on June 14. Subsequently, Mumbai Police, however, did not register an FIR in the case and was investigating the matter as an ‘accidental death’.It expressed surprise over the apex court’s order even when it found no wrongdoing in the Mumbai Police’s investigation. “While handing over the probe to the CBI, the apex court said, “records of the case produced before this court do not prima facie suggest any wrongdoing by the Mumbai Police”. Then it is surprising that the reins of the case were given to the CBI,” the Saamana editorial remarked.Also read: Rhea Chakraborty doesn’t have stature to comment on Bihar CM, she should fight the legal battle - Bihar DGPThe Mumbai Police’s probe in the case was in the final stages when it was stopped and handed over to the CBI on the recommendation of the Bihar government, the editorial said. “Getting the CBI to probe the Sushant Singh Rajput case in this manner is an attack on the federal structure given by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar... Today, the Indian Constitution will be shedding tears if it is observed that quarantining a Bihar Police official in Mumbai gives rise to suspicion due to which the case is handed over,” it added.It furthered that it is an “illusion” that only the Bihar Police or the CBI can unearth the truth in the case. “Several criminal cases in Bihar were investigated by the CBI. How many real culprits did the CBI arrest so far? Sushant’s case was politicised only to malign the Mumbai Police and the Maharashtra government,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conspiracy-to-malign-maharashtra-govt-shiv-sena-after-sc-hands-sushant-singh-rajput-case-to-cbi/story-ZurQGZMLnPwZK77LsgTxEK.html

20-08-2020||India||Banks sanctioned ₹1.5 lakh crore easy loans to small enterprises||Commercial banks have sanctioned ₹1.5 lakh crore and disbursed two-third of the amount among small enterprises and individual professionals under the ₹3 lakh crore emergency working loan facility to help them tide over the crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, an official statement said on Thursday.“Under the 100% Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) backed by a Government of India guarantee, banks from public and private sectors have sanctioned loans worth over ₹1.5 lakh crore as of 18th August, 2020, of which more than ₹1 lakh crore has already been disbursed,” the finance ministry statement said.The Union Cabinet on May 20 approved ECLGS, which can be levered up to ₹3 lakh crore, for about five months ending October 31. The scheme provides for an easy additional working capital loan at a concessional rate of interest to an existing borrower who is not a defaulter.ECLGS is one of the key components of the ₹20 lakh crore economic stimulus package under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-Reliant India Initiative) launched in mid-May, which offered additional working capital finance of 20% of the outstanding credit as of February 29 in the form of a term loan to units with up to ₹25 crore outstanding and revenue of up to ₹100 crore.The government may also consider extending the October 31 deadline to avail the emergency working loan facility, a finance ministry official said requesting anonymity. The finance ministry had already extended the scope of the provision by enhancing eligibility criteria to include larger units and individual professionals such as doctors and chartered accountants.The government expects a ₹1 lakh crore loan offtake by newly eligible individual professionals. Some headroom may still remain, which could prompt the government to extend the deadline, the official cited above said.According to the finance ministry statement, under the ECLGS, public sector banks (PSBs) have sanctioned loans worth ₹76,044.44 crore, out of which ₹56,483.41 crore has already been disbursed. Private sector banks have so far sanctioned ₹74,715.02 crore loan out of which ₹45,762.36 crore has already been disbursed, it said.“The top lenders under the scheme are State Bank of India (SBI), Canara Bank, Punjab National Bank (PNB), Bank of India, Union Bank of India and HDFC Bank Ltd,” it said.The National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd, which issued the operational guidelines of ECLGS on June 2, said the interest rate under the scheme is capped at 9.25% per annum for banks and financial institutions. For non-banking finance companies, the interest rate should not exceed 14% per annum. NCGTC is a wholly-owned company of the Union government formed in March 2014 to act as a trustee for multiple credit guarantee funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/banks-sanctioned-1-5-lakh-crore-easy-loans-to-small-enterprises/story-bRK7OyKTJ5BYJD6LhkN3kN.html

There is no mandate under Supreme Court rules that the same bench should hear on sentencing,” said Dushyant Dave who represented Bhushan in the case.Justice Arun Mishra, who is heading the three-judge bench and is set to retire from Supreme Court on September 2, responded saying it will be judicial impropriety for another bench to hear on sentence.“We assure you that we will not do anything that will take away your right to review,” said justice Mishra.Justice BR Gavai said that Rajeev Dhavan, also appearing for Bhushan, had informed the court on August 17 that review was ready and will be filed. “Why is it not being filed,” asked the judge.Dave said there is no mandate that it should be filed within 24 hours and the time limit to file review is 30 days.“If your lordships want me to file review in 24 hours, then the Supreme Court rules should be amended accordingly,” he argued.Dave also said that the court should not hold counsel responsible for statements made in other matters.“I beseech your lordships not to do that,” said Dave.Before the hearing, Bhushan quoted Mahatma Gandhi in his statement. “I do not ask for mercy. I do not appeal for magnanimity. I am here to cheerfully submit to any punishment that court may impose,” he said.Justice Mishra conceded that contempt should be sparingly used.“We appreciate all your efforts in filing good public interest cases. We welcome all that. But there is a Lakshman Rekha for everything. You are part of the system. You forget it. Why do you cross it?”The bench also said that it will give 2-3 days to Bhushan to reconsider his “defiant statement”, refusing to apologise for his contemptuous tweets. The lawyer said he will consult his lawyers and think over the apex court’s suggestion.After rejecting Bhushan’s application for deferment, the court proceeded to commence its hearing on sentencing. Senior counsel Rajeev Dhavan is making arguments on behalf of Bhushan on the sentencing aspect.The Supreme Court had, in its judgment on August 14, held Prashant Bhushan guilty of criminal contempt of court over his tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-is-a-lakshman-rekha-supreme-court-to-prashant-bhushan-in-contempt-case-hearing/story-esrmowJL5gVaOtXNLkcyrL.html
20-08-2020||India||Yes Bank fraud case: HC grants bail to Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan||The Bombay high court on Thursday granted bail to Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan of Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL) in connection with the Yes Bank fraud, saying the enforcement directorate (ED) filed a charge sheet against them a day after the stipulated period of 60 days for doing so.The Wadhawan brothers will not be able to come out of the prison immediately as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is investigating them in the same case. ED is separately probing other pending cases against them.ED initiated proceedings against the Wadhawans on the basis of a case registered by CBI on March 7 against Yes Bank promoter Rana Kapoor, and his family members. They have been booked for conspiracy, cheating and also under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.Yes Bank is alleged to have invested ₹3,700 crore in short term non-convertible debenture of DHFL between April and June 2018. Kapoor allegedly received ₹600 crore as kickbacks from DHFL in terms of loan advanced to two firms, DOIT Urban Ventures (India) Private Limited and Morgan Credits Private Limited. While Kapoor’s three daughters hold 100℅ stakes in DOIT, Morgan Credits is controlled by his wife.Also Read: Decoding the YES Bank crisis | HT EditorialJustice Bharati Dangre granted bail to the Wadhawan brothers in lieu of ₹1 lakh bond each, and on the condition that they will surrender their passports to the investigators. The court observed that an accused cannot be kept in custody even for a day after they have the right to default bail.Justice Dangre said there is a period prescribed for filing of the charge sheet. The right to default bail is for the accused if an investigating agency fails to file the charge sheet within the period prescribed by Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh urged the court to stay the bail order at least for two weeks. He said what the high court has ruled was a pure question of law and since different courts have taken different views of the point of default bail, ED would like to test the view held by the high court before the Supreme Court.Justice Dangre refused to accept the request. The judge said the settled legal position is that once the right of default bail is due, the accused cannot be kept in custody thereafter even for a day.The apex court has recently held that no court can extend this period and therefore after the custody period of 60 days was over, the Wadhawan brothers were required to be set free immediately, the judge said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yes-bank-fraud-case-hc-grants-bail-to-kapil-and-dheeraj-wadhawan/story-Jaf1geVvbm4DKxrTSbZNkI.html

These volunteers, in the age group of 28-35, will also create awareness in their areas on the various precautions to be taken.”Also read: Sero survey shows 29% population in Delhi has Covid-19 antibodies nowThe state government is wary of a spike in coronavirus cases if people crowd places during Ganeshotsav. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has also asked authorities to be “extra cautious” during the festival. Thackeray held a meeting with district officials on Tuesday and directed them to ensure that overcrowding is avoided during the festival.On Wednesday, Maharashtra recorded its highest single-day spike with 13,165 cases of Covid-19 taking the tally to 628,642.The state also recorded 346 deaths after which the toll stands at 21,003 till date.

Earlier this week, state health minister Rajesh Tope said that a downward trend could be seen after mid-September.“Maharashtra is in the middle of a peak of Covid-19 cases. However, it’s difficult to predict how long it will last. The pandemic situation is under control in Malegaon, Mumbai’s Dharavi slums, and Aurangabad. In most places, the spread appears to have plateaued. Now, a downward trend is expected after the middle of September,” Tope told media on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-pandemic-mumbai-s-ganesh-pandals-gear-up-for-festival/story-d0XZWgoltpOjRE9nSN7KtN.html

20-08-2020||India||British man running Odisha shelter home arrested for sexually abusing minor||The Odisha police have arrested a 68-year-old British citizen running an orphanage in the state’s western district of Jharsuguda on charges of sexually abusing a minor boy in his shelter home.Police officials in Jharsuguda said John Patrick Bridge - who ran a child shelter home called Faith Outreach in the Cox Colony area of the town, where he provided education to the tribal students - was arrested following a complaint by a minor tribal boy about Bridge sexually abusing him.In his complaint, the victim alleged that when he had gone with Bridge to his native place in Rayagada district for Christmas last year, the latter had fondled his thigh and private parts while returning in an SUV. “After a complaint was filed at Jharsuguda police station under section 341 of the IPC (Punishment for wrongful restraint), 10 POCSO Act (aggravated sexual assault ) and section 3(i) (r), 2 (va) of SC/ST (POA) Act, the accused was arrested. Further investigations are on,” said Rahul PR, Jharsuguda SP.Sources said the FIR against Bridge was lodged following an inquiry undertaken by Indian Embassy in New Zealand about misuse of funds given to Faith Outreach by a New Zealand-based funding agency. The issues of sexual abuse cropped up during the funds misuse probe following which police officials asked the victims to lodge complaints.Bridge, along with his wife Delphine, started Faith Outreach 25 years ago in Jharsuguda to provide education to the tribal students. There is a Baby Care Center, which provides a home and care for abandoned babies as well as a children’s home that provides clothing, education, medical care and daily food to over 400 poor children. The organisation also has a training centre that prepares volunteers to work as social workers in the local communities.The shelter home has been shut down since March this year following the onset of Covid pandemic. Officials of Faith Outreach did not comment over the arrest of Bridge. This is the second such incident of abuse of minor children in Odisha in the last two years. In December 2018, Faiz Rehman, a pastor who ran Good News India Dream Centre, a child shelter home in Dhenkanal district, was arrested by police after allegations by the inmates that he physically and sexually tortured them. The minor girls in the shelter home had alleged that Rehman hugged, kissed and made them hold his sexual organs and whenever they raised any objection or protested, he threatened them to throw them out from the centre.Rehman, who is in his 50s, studied theology in the United States and is now in a Dhenkanal jail since December. His bail applications were rejected by the Orissa High Court twice - in February and August - last year. Police submitted chargesheet in the case in January 28 last year before a designated POCSO court and trial in the case has already started.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/british-man-running-odisha-shelter-home-arrested-for-sexually-abusing-minor/story-ZAOVAa3y6IV96P3Z2u1fNO.html
20-08-2020||India||Swachh Survekshan 2020: Indore ranked cleanest city for the fourth consecutive year||Madhya Pradesh’s Indore has been ranked the cleanest city for the fourth consecutive year under the Swachh Survekshan 2020, the centre’s annual survey on cleanliness under the Swachh Bharat Mission, announced on Thursday.Surat in Gujarat and Navi Mumbai in Maharashtra were ranked second and third, respectively. In the category of population of less than 1 lakh, Maharashtra’s Karad bagged the first position, followed by Saswad and Lonavala.Chhattisgarh was ranked the cleanest state of India in the ‘under 100 Urban Local Bodies’ category while Jharkhand was adjudged the leanest state of India in the ‘above 100 Urban Local Bodies’ category. The announcement of this year’s results was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the ministry of housing and urban affairs said. The survey, which covered 4,242 cities and saw the participation of 1.87 crore citizens, was completed in 28 days. “When the Swachh Bharat Mission- Urban (SBM-U) was launched in 2014, it was with the objective of making urban India 100% open defecation free (ODF) along with 100% scientific solid waste management. With no concept of ODF in urban areas and solid waste processing standing at a mere 18%, it was clear that an accelerated approach was necessary if the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s dream of a Swachh India was to be achieved within the timeframe of five years,” Union housing minister Hardeep Puri said during a virtual press conference on Thursday. Also Read: Swachh Survekshan Awards 2020: List of winning cities“A framework was therefore needed to bring about rigour in the progress in monitoring and a spirit of healthy competition among states and cities to improve their performance in key cleanliness parameters. This underlying thought led to the conceptualisation and subsequent implementation of the Swachh Survekshan (SS), a competitive framework to encourage cities to improve the status of urban sanitation while encouraging large-scale citizen participation,” he added. In 2019, Indore was awarded the cleanest city in the country in the Swachh Survekshan 2019 (SS 2019) awards, while Bhopal was declared the cleanest capital. Ujjain bagged the award for being the cleanest city in the population category of 3 lakh to 10 lakh. Indore had retained the top spot in the survey for three consecutive years.Every year, cities and towns across India are awarded with the title of ‘Swachh Cities’ based on their cleanliness and sanitation drives as a part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that was launched in 2014.The ministry of housing and urban affairs, which is the nodal agency for the Swachh Bharat Mission, conducted its first survey ‘Swachh Survekshan-2016’ survey to rank 73 cities (Urban Local Bodies), in January 2016, under the ambit of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban). In order to expand the coverage of cities, the ministry conducted its second survey ‘Swachh Survekshan-2017’ in January-February 2017, to rank 434 cities. In ‘Swachh Survekshan 2018’, the scale of survey and intensity of participation increased with 4,203 cities. For the 2019 Swachh Survekshan, the ministry covered 4,237 cities.“The mainstreaming of informal waste workers, provision of social security schemes and safety gear to all sanitation workers, dignity, recognition and welfare of sanitation workers and their families was accorded due importance,” Puri said. He added that the survey team visited over 58,000 residential and over 20,000 commercial areas covering over 64,000 wards—all in 28 days.Last month, the ministry launched the sixth edition of the survey, Swachh Survekshan 2021. The indicators for the survey will focus on parameters pertaining to wastewater treatment and reuse along with faecal sludge. The issues of legacy waste management and remediation of landfills have been brought to the fore in the sixth edition of the Survekshan. The ministry has also added a new category called the ‘Prerak DAUUR Samman’ which has five additional sub-categories—Divya (Platinum), Anupam (Gold), Ujjwal (Silver), Udit (Bronze), Aarohi (Aspiring). Besides the present criteria of evaluating cities on ‘population category’, this new category will categorise cities based on six select indicator-wise performance criteria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swachh-survekshan-2020-indore-ranked-cleanest-city-for-the-fourth-consecutive-year/story-ZM6E4T3z7h4o5SMrqNRSIK.html
20-08-2020||India||29% of Delhi has antibodies for Covid-19: Second sero-survey||The second serological survey conducted in Delhi between August 1 and 7 has found that 29.1% of the city’s population has developed antibodies against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), state health minister Satyendar Jain said on Thursday. The survey results also showed the prevalence of antibodies among women was more (32.2%) compared to men (28.3%).The findings of the second survey show that the prevalence of antibodies among the people has increased by over 6 percentage points when compared to the first survey held between June 27 and July 10. As many as 22.86% of people were earlier found to have developed antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19. In the first survey, samples were collected from 21,387 people, whereas, in the second round, 15,000 samples were collected. Jain said the third round of the survey will begin from September 1 and would go on for a similar duration as earlier.According to the second survey, prevalence of antibodies among those aged less than 18 was 34.7%, and 28.5% for those between 18-50. For those above 50, it was 31.2%.Government officials said the latest findings that those aged under 18 were found to have the maximum antibodies compared to other age groups would play a crucial role in the Delhi government’s decisions on opening schools and colleges. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, in his Independence Day speech on August 15, said that the government will not open schools until it is fully convinced about the city’s Covid-19 situation.Giving the district-wise break-up, the health minister said the southeast district has seen the biggest increase in people developing antibodies. The lowest increase was seen in northeast Delhi, which once had the highest number of Covid-19 cases.Developing antibodies means a person contracted Covid-19, recovered, and subsequently developed them against the disease. “Antibodies are found in high numbers anywhere between 3 and 8 months since the recovery of a Covid-19 patient. In the process, the person also develops T-cells because of which the chances of contracting Covid-19 again become extremely low,” Jain said.The report showed the southeast district has seen a maximum increase in the prevalence of antibodies among people when compared with the findings of the first and the second surveys. It was earlier 22.12% and this time it was found to be 33.2%. This is followed by the south district--from 18.61% to 27.2%. But, after the southeast district, the areas with the highest prevalence of antibodies among people are north district (31.6%), followed by central district (31.4%).In the southwest district, 16.3% of the people have been found to have developed antibodies, which is the lowest of all the 11 districts in Delhi. The second-lowest was the New Delhi district (24.6%).A day after the high court directed the Delhi government to do a comparative analysis of the two serological surveys conducted in Delhi so far, the health minister on Thursday said that the government would do the same.When asked about a possible second wave, Jain said, “We had expected that in the second sero survey the seroprevalence would increase considerably. But it has increased by around 6-7% since July. So, Delhi is heading towards herd immunity, but experts say that should be at least 40%. We cannot rule out a second wave because only yesterday India saw the highest ever spike in daily fresh Covid-19 cases.”Jain said Delhi has a population of around 20 million and the findings of the latest survey suggest that around 5.9 million have contracted the Sars-Cov-2 virus and recovered from the disease. “It is relieving to know that around 29% of the city’s population has recovered after being infected by the coronavirus. On the other hand, 71% of people in Delhi have not developed antibodies, which means that they are still vulnerable,” he said. “The people of Delhi are being very careful in taking precautions against Covid-19. So, this is a very positive development. It shows that the Covid-19 infection numbers are no longer rising exponentially in Delhi.”Jain said there was a time when the cases in Delhi were increasing by 4,000 daily and the positivity ratio was 30%. “It is also reassuring to see that the positivity rate in Delhi has reduced to nearly 7%, which is much lower than the national average. The situation in Delhi is improving.” Charoo Hans, a former head of the microbiology department at Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, said if 71% of people are still vulnerable, it is quite a high number. “It suggests that the government should continue with its efforts on aggressive testing, contact tracing, surveillance, isolation, and providing good treatment. It also suggests that people should continue ensuring strict compliance with social distancing, wearing masks, washing their hands frequently, and following respiratory etiquettes. There is no room for any complacency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/29-of-delhi-has-antibodies-for-covid-19-second-sero-survey/story-JE4rKi7lMDYaOgAacWoCVK.html

20-08-2020||India||Supreme Court refuses Prashant Bhushan’s plea to defer hearing on his sentence in contempt case||The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to hear lawyer Prashant Bhushan petition to defer the hearing on his sentence The apex court said that it will not hear the petition till Bhushan’s review petition against conviction for criminal contempt is filed and decided.The three-judge bench of justices Arun Mishra, BR Gavai and Krishna Murari said that the judgement is complete only after the sentence. It gave assurance to Bhushan that no punishment will be acted upon till his review against the order convicting him in the case is decided.Bhushan had appealed to the Supreme Court to defer hearing on his punishment in a contempt of court case till the time his review petition against the August 14 conviction order is taken up.The court had taken suo moto notice of two tweets posted by Bhushan on June 27 and 29 where he had accused the present Chief Justice of India (CJI) of closing down courts and past CJIs of destroying democracy.The top court had on August 14 held Bhushan guilty of criminal contempt for his derogatory tweets, saying they cannot be said to be a fair criticism of the functioning of the judiciary made in the public interest.In its judgment, the bench had said, “The Indian judiciary is not only one of the pillars on which the Indian democracy stands but is the central pillar. An attempt to shake the very foundation of constitutional democracy has to be dealt with an iron hand.”Under the Contempt of Court Act, an act of criminal contempt of court can attract a punishment of six months imprisonment or Rs 2,000 fine or both. Bhushan pointed out in his application that in criminal contempt proceedings, the Supreme Court functions like a trial court and is also the last court. There is no appeal to a higher forum once the top court sentences a person for contempt.Bhushan requested the court to accept his request for deferment in view of the underlying public policy with respect to safeguarding liberty of a citizen under Article 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-refuses-prashant-bhushan-s-plea-to-defer-hearing-on-his-sentence-in-contempt-case/story-QNp3mcEfLh8aWbAijYRQaP.html
20-08-2020||India||Indore’s fourth consecutive win, tops Swachh Survekshan 2020||The government on Thursday announced the results of annual survey of cleanliness, Swachh Survekshan 2020 and Indore once again retained the top spot as the cleanest city of India.The city has bagged the spot fourth time in a row. Gujarat’s Surat on second spot and Maharashtra’s Navi Mumbai on third.Union Housing Minister Hardeep Singh Puri“ said, I visited Indore a few years ago, along with a member of a Japanese delegation. When we reached the city, I saw he Japanese going to various places in Indore. I asked him ‘what are you doing?’ He said ‘I was trying to find filth, but couldn’t’. I don’t think there could be any bigger testimony to the achievement of the city.” He told this to Shivraj Singh Chouhan after Indore won the award.Congratulating the people of Indore, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the city has hit a four this time and surely will hit a six in the coming future.This is the fifth edition of the survey that was introduced by PM Modi in January 2016.The Minister interacted with select beneficiaries, swachhagrahis (Clean India Warriors), and Safai Karmis (Sanitation Workers) under the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U) from different parts of the country through video conference.Swachh Survekshan 2020 covered 4,242 cities, 62 cantonment boards and 92 Ganga towns. This survey was carried out in 28 days.Mysuru had won the award for the cleanest city of India in the first edition of the survey, while Indore has retained the top position for three consecutive years (2017,2018, 2019). In a first, the Swachh Survekshan programme in 2019 was a completely digital survey completed in a record time. Swachh Survekshan is meant to monitor the performance of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which was launched on October 2, 2014, the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. It aims to make India open-defecation free by 2019.The survey was introduced by the government with the objective of generating large-scale participation in Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.

20-08-2020||India||Centre trying to break up PDP: Omar Abdullah||Omar Abdullah, former Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) chief minister, has claimed that the Narendra Modi government is currently focussed on breaking up the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and because of which its chief Mehbooba Mufti continues to be in detention, according to a recently released book. Mehbooba has been detained under the National Security Act (NSA), 1980, following the scrapping of Article 370, which granted special powers to J&K, on August 5, 2019. In an interview with US-based authors, Pradeep Chibber and Harsh Shah, for their book, India Tomorrow: Conversations with the Next generation of Political Leaders, Abdullah also did not rule out “some amount of cooperation” with once arch-rival Mehboob’s party PDP in the larger interests of Kashmir. Also read: Agree with Rahul that non-Gandhi should be Congress president, Priyanka in new book“At the moment, it appears as if the entire effort of New Delhi is focused on breaking up the PDP. Because of this, a new political formation call the Apni Party is largely made up of people from the PDP. This may explain why Mehbooba Mufti has been kept in detention longer than I have because they (the Modi government) haven’t met with the same success in breaking away people from the National Conference (NC) as they have with the PDP,” he told the authors. Abdullah (50) was released from detention on March 24 after seven months. Also read: Centre withdraws 10,000 soldiers from Kashmir to send a message“We’ll wait and see how that plays out. But obviously some amount of cooperation, some amount of working together with the PDP in the larger interest of general Kashmir cannot be ruled out,” the former Union minister added. After the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) withdrew support to the PDP in June 2018, the then Governor Satya Pal Malik had placed J&K under Governor’s rule and kept the assembly in suspended animation. However, in November, the NC and the Congress had offered their support to keep Mehbooba in power, but Malik ordered to dissolve the state assembly after the People’s Conference (PC) led by Sajjad Lone staked a counterclaim, saying it had the support of 25 BJP legislators and “more than 18” others. In her letter to the Governor, Mehbooba had claimed the support of 56 legislators in the 87-member assembly. The PDP had 28 members in the assembly, the NC (15), and the Congress (12). The bloc also had the support of an independent lawmaker. However, Malik later claimed that he had not received the communication via facsimile from Mehbooba, as it was a holiday. Asked if he was disappointed with the responses of his party’s old allies such as the Congress to the abrogation of Article 370, Abdullah said that there should have been at least a token resistance because the state’s special status was the legacy of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. “I understand that you don’t want to oppose the revocation, but at least own it. But more than the revocation of 370, I think the thing that disappointed me more was the silence at J&K being humiliated the way it was converted into a union territory (UT). In all the years since independence, this was the first time a state has been downgraded. Otherwise, UTs have always been upgraded to states,” he said. Abdullah expressed disappointment with Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) for not opposing the move to convert J&K into a UT. “My father left his own election to campaign for N. Chandrababu Naidu, and he was one of the first people to jump straight off with the BJP and say, we support you on everything. These are betrayals that I will not forget easily,” he said. The former CM said the general population in Kashmir is angry about what happened on August 5 but didn’t react the way they did in 2008, 2010, and 2016 because there was a far larger presence of security forces this time. “Militancy is something you can control. What you can’t do is force the people to feel more Indian than they feel. You can’t force a sense of isolation, bitterness, anger, or a sense of separatism, out of people. And I dare say that in spite of the BJP and their voices in the media patting themselves on the back that the events of August 5 will end separatist sentiment in J&K, I think it will have no such impact. If anything, those who are sitting on the fence are probably feeling more isolated and more separatist than they were before August 5, 2019,” he said. Abdullah also claimed that after 2014 there has been no engagement with the people of J&K. The NC leader reiterated that he is unlikely to participate in any electoral politics in J&K till it is a UT. “My party won’t boycott elections. I’m talking purely about myself. I don’t see myself as a member of the assembly of the UT of J&K. I’ve been CM of one of the most empowered assemblies of this country. I’m not going to be CM of a UT, where, perhaps, I can’t even decide which peon I want to work in my office. That’s not for me,” he said. Asked about personal regrets in his political career, Abdullah said there were two major incidents, which he wished had been handled differently when he was the J&K CM. He recounted the allegation of rape and murder of two women in Shopian in 2009 and the 2010 summer of discontentment in which over a hundred people had died. “That continues to haunt me and always will. Besides, my failure was in not being able to convince the Indian government that hanging Afzal Guru is not going to win them any votes in the general election and, in fact, would push J&K back to the fringes. I wasn’t able to convince them, and that is something I will always regret,” he said. The book features 20 prominent young politicians from different political parties such as Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sachin Pilot, Smriti Irani, Akhilesh Yadav, Asaduddin Owaisi, Aaditya Thackeray, Devendra Fadnavis, Milind Deora, Varun Gandhi, Supriya Sule, and Rajyavardhan Rathore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-trying-to-break-up-pdp-omar-abdullah/story-jJ6MzNBheOFQjJsISwjL9M.html
20-08-2020||India||‘Preserve Ustad Bismillah Khan’s house as heritage’: Akhilesh Yadav||Days before the fourteenth death anniversary of shehnai maestro and Bharat Ratna Ustad Bismillah Khan, the demolition of the room of his daily ‘riyaz’ (practice) has drawn strong reactions from fans, musicians and political leaders. As per reports, some of Ustad’s family members wish to build a commercial complex at the site. Samajwadi Party chief and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav called for the conservation of the room. He tweeted on Wednesday saying that the government should protect and preserve the place where Ustad Bismillah Khan used to perform ‘riyaz’ every day. Also read: PM to announce results of Swachh Survekshan 2020 at 11am“Saving it from going into the hands of bhupatis (builders), the government should conserve the place as a memorial where Bharat Ratna Ustad Bismillah Khan used to do ‘riyaz’ as worship. The people who do not preserve cultural heritage are forgotten not only by history but also the present,” Yadav tweeted.    His tweet came after the roof of a room in Ustad’s house, situated in Hadha Sarai area of Varanasi, was demolished. Ustad Bismillah Khan’s awards, citations and shehnai were kept in the room. Ustad’s grandson Afaq Haider said Khan’s other grandson Chittain Hussain was planning to reconstruct the house for commercial purpose. He wanted to build shops on the ground floor. Ustad’s sons Kazim Hussain and Nazim Hussain were against the construction of shops by demolishing the house. Haider said that the house should be preserved as heritage. Chittain Hussain is the son of Ustad’s eldest son Mehtab Hussain. Chittain, who is reconstructing the house, said that the house was in the name of Mehtab Hussain. As it was dilapidated, the citations and awards received by the Ustad from all over the world were getting damaged. Therefore, he planned new construction. Shops would be constructed on the ground floor and in the upper portion a room would be built as a memorial in which all citations, awards and other things belonging to the maestro would be preserved, he said. Noted vocalist Padma Shri Rajeshwar Acharya also said that Ustad’s heritage should be preserved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/preserve-ustad-bismillah-khan-s-house-as-heritage-akhilesh-yadav/story-n5FuJOxhEUKIEnmFUe4WUL.html
20-08-2020||India||A month after clearing it, Maharashtra seeks answers on seawall project||The Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority has sought clarification from the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) on the need to construct seawalls along coastal areas at Panje village in Uran and Elephanta Island (Gharapuri), home to tourist destination Elephanta caves, in the Mumbai harbour after environmentalists alleged it was an impractical venture. The proposed seawalls are meant to protect the coast and prevent erosion.The move comes almost a month after the authority had cleared the proposal on July 7 and recommended it to the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), while listing six conditions to be complied with before commencing construction. The JNPT had proposed a 3.2-km wall from Shetbunder to Rajbunder jetty at Elephanta island and a 270-metre wall, less than 300 m from Panje village, along the shoreline. Additionally, a 45-m boat landing jetty and 20-m approach trestle has been planned at Nhava (Uran). The construction of the walls was proposed to protect the coast from rising seas and prevent erosion, said JNPT. But four complaints by environmental groups - Vanashakti, Shree Ekvira Aai Pratishthan (SEAP), NatConnect Foundation, and a consortium of Uran fishermen - over the past week alleged it was being done to make land available for reclamation and future construction.“The JNPT’s plan is to obstruct free flow of natural tidal water to mangrove areas, leading to flooding and impacting traditional fishing activities,” said Dilip Koli, Uran fisherman. The MCZMA issued a letter to JNPT’s chairman (port, planning and development) on Wednesday to provide a detailed report on points raised by complainants. HT has reviewed the letter sent to the JNPT.“Complainants have asked us to revoke permissions issued by us. We have asked the JNPT to file a compliance report on conditions laid out, and verify whether these allegations are true,” said a senior MCZMA official.On March 3, 2017, the Union environment ministry had granted the JNPT environmental clearance (EC) for deepening and widening of Mumbai’s existing harbour channel and JNPT’s port channel (Phase II) project. One of the conditions under the EC was to hold a public hearing. “The request for seawalls was made during the public hearing conducted by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board in presence of the Raigad district collector for the EC based on requests from concerned gram panchayats. There is no mangroves destruction and diversion due to proposed construction. The seawalls are essential to protect the coast and prevent erosion. These projects were proposed under Corporate Environmental Responsibility (CER),” said the JNPT in a statement to HT.The JNPT also has no-objection certificates from Panje, Gharapuri and Nhava gram panchayats.The CER does not mean funding an environment violation, said Stalin D, Director, Vanashakti. “There are vested interests who want to engage in landfilling of all wetlands and coastal regulation zone (CRZ) areas. This reclamation mafia is pushing destructive agendas and the JNPT is providing cover for them directly or indirectly. The MCZMA has completely washed off its hands from CRZ conservation,” he said.Panje village has close to 450 homes with 1,684 residents. It is situated atop a hill overlooking the sea to the north, mangroves to the west and south, and open flat land where cricket is played towards the east. Karishma Haresh Bhoir, sarpanch of the Panje gram panchayat, said they had requested the seawall construction. “Excess tide water during heavy rain is making its way to our village. Homes are being flooded, especially at the bottom of the hill. We need this wall to protect us,” she said.However, Panje resident Manish Bhoir denied the sarpanch’s claim. “They are lying. Our village cannot flood because it is elevated on a hill,” he said, adding, “this is a ploy to conveniently block water channels and dry out surrounding areas where industrial and housing projects have been planned.”Other complainants had similar views. “Panje has already been divided into sectors 16 to 28 as a part of the Dronagiri development plan. The seawall will facilitate this plan and gobble up the wetland. It is a sponge to absorb rainwater but their burial is the reason why the Mumbai region witnesses annual floods,” said BN Kumar, director, NatConnect Foundation.SEAP’s complaint alleged that the Mumbai harbour had already lost 875 hectares of mangroves, wetlands and small water bodies through land reclamation on JNPT areas. “We request the state to study the extent of ecological damage and loss of livelihood across this region, and then consider project approvals,” said Nandkumar Pawar, head, SEAP.WHAT’S AT STAKE: MANGROVE FORESTSIn November 2019, the MCZMA had instructed the state mangrove cell to inspect whether mangroves were being destroyed for these projects. After site inspection, the cell had said no mangrove destruction was involved but all three projects fell within the 50-m buffer zone of mangrove forests. The seawall at Panje is being constructed across 270m in CRZ 1A (requires highest protection) and at Elephanta island across 185 m at CRZ1A. The HC in September 2018 had ordered, “Regardless of the ownership of the land having mangroves and the area of the land, all constructions within 50 m of all sides of the mangroves shall be forthwith stopped. The area of 50m shall be kept free from construction except compound wall/fencing for its protection.” While environmentalists alleged that the wall, which did not have any culverts proposed, would block all high tide water even as tide water regulation (holding pond and barrages) was already being undertaken by the City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd, JNPT said no there was no mangrove destruction proposed at the site.COASTAL AUTHORITY’S 6 CONDITIONS THAT JNPT MUST COMPLY WITH- JNPT to ensure no construction allowed in mangroves- JNPT to obtain permission from Bombay high court since part of the walls within 50-m mangrove buffer area- Natural course of creek areas should not be hampered- No reclamation of coastal water bodies is allowed- All other permissions from different statutory authorities be obtained- Proposed construction to be done strictly as per Coastal Regulation Zone 2011 norms, guidelines and clarifications issued by the Union environment ministry from time to time(Source: MCZMA)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-month-after-clearing-it-maharashtra-seeks-answers-on-seawall-project/story-a4uAMJsFFROo7aX8ygFftM.html

20-08-2020||India||Cadre merger: Railways’ technical and non-technical arms lock horns over new recruitment||A war of words has erupted between Indian Railways’ technical and non-technical arms over the proposed recruitment mechanism being drafted following the nod to merge eight major national carrier’s cadres into a single unified service — the Indian Railways Management Service (IRMS). In a letter, which HT has reviewed, written to railway minister Piyush Goyal last week, officers from Indian Railways Service of Engineers (IRSE) suggested that only those from the technical arm should be allowed to supervise railways operations. “Low-ranking civil services candidates, who will enter after several attempts and at an old age to IRMS” can come through a separate examination, the letter suggested. “Indian Railways is a technology-driven organisation and the role of technology has only increased and it will continue because of the government’s impetus on modernisation. The nature of railway operations necessitates that it continues to be managed by the highly competent technical supervision for the maintenance of increasingly complex systems ... Alternatively, UPSC (Union Public Service Commission) may conduct a separate examination for IRMS, on the lines of the Indian Forest Services (IFS) examination, where candidates can be tested for their core competence ... a separate examination would ensure that only those candidates enter service, who have consciously opted for the IRMS. This will bring in willing officers rather than low-ranking civil service candidates, who will enter after several attempts and at an old age to IRMS,” the letter said while taking a dig at the railways’ non-technical arms. Responding to the content of the letter, the Indian Railways’ civil service cadre, Indian Railways Traffic Services (IRTS), tweeted: “We deplore uncivil remark of Railway Engineering Services Associations in the letter reported in media. Best and brightest are recruited through the prestigious CSE (civil services examination). Officers have routinely quit railway engineering services to join IRTS even at a loss of two-three of seniority. We are all for reforms.” Earlier, HT had reported on August 6 that the Union Ministry of Railways is considering a uniform promotion for all services until Higher Administrative Grade (HAG) based on best performing service in the grade for Senior Administrative Grade (SAG)/ HAG and future recruitment of IRMS through a CSE, while technical specialists via RDSO (Research Designs & Standards Organisation – the national transporter’s R&D wing). Minister Goyal and railway board chairman VK Yadav in early August had held a meeting with railway unions and representatives from some of the railway services. In the meeting, representatives of several services had raised concerns over the employees’ career progression and promotions. According to officials present in the meeting, Yadav had communicated that seniority would not be that significant for deciding key positions and some elements of merit would also be introduced. “Career growth will be linked with the organisation’s growth,“ he had told the officials. He had also stated that there would no change in organisational structure, work culture, and work profile for the senior railway management. At present, three of the existing railway services are recruited through the CSE, while the rest five are technical services, where the hiring is held through an engineering services examination (ESE). The railways has also hired McKinsey, a multi-national consultancy firm, to finalise the modalities of the cadre merger. The modalities and unification of the services will be worked out by the ministry in consultation with the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) that was slated to be completed within a year. The proposed organisational reforms approved by the Union Cabinet last year were aimed at a restructuring of the mammoth organisation that employs around 1.3 million people.The rail operations carried 2.3 million passengers daily before the nationwide coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced lockdown restrictions were enforced from March 25 to contain the spread of the viral outbreak. The government had said the restructuring move was aimed at ending a legacy marked by inefficiency in work, infighting over control of assets and resources, and inordinate delays in decision-making.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cadre-merger-railways-technical-and-non-technical-arms-lock-horns-over-new-recruitment/story-Bk21uHb9Lzp2qGEbnLmK2N.html

20-08-2020||India||SC to hear arguments today on sentencing Prashant Bhushan in contempt of court case||The Supreme Court will later on Thursday hear Prashant Bhushan before sentencing him days after the activist lawyer was held guilty of criminal contempt of court on August 14. According to the Contempt of Courts Act, the offence carries a punishment of up to six months in prison or a fine up to Rs 2,000 or both.A three-judge bench of justice Arun Mishra is expected to commence the hearing after 11 am.Bhushan, on Wednesday, moved the Supreme Court seeking deferment of the proceedings till a review petition is filed and considered.The court on August 14 said Bhushan’s tweets dated June 27 and June 29, criticising Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde and raising questions about the conduct of former CJIs and the court, were based on distorted facts. It added the tweets have the effect of destabilising the foundation of the Indian judiciary.“The Indian judiciary is not only one of pillars on which the Indian democracy stands but is the central pillar. An attempt to shake the very foundation of constitutional democracy has to be dealt with an iron hand,” the three-judge bench said.In his defence to the court in an affidavit filed on August 2, Bhushan said: “I am entitled to form, hold, & express (opinion) under Article 19(1)(a)”.Also read: ‘Supreme Court remained a mute spectator when Delhi burnt’: Prashant Bhushan refuses to apologiseSome supported the court’s actions, pointing to Bhushan’s support for such actions in 2017 when the court took Calcutta high court judge justice CS Karnan to task for making allegations against Supreme Court judges. Others said the court was being a tad touchy in seeing comments against judges as those against the court.In its judgment of August 14, the court said the allegations levelled in the tweets against the court and CJI are malicious in nature and have the tendency to scandalize the court and such conduct was not expected from Bhushan, who is a lawyer of 30 years standing at the Bar.The court observed that the Indian judiciary is considered by the citizens as the last resort when they fail to get justice elsewhere. It added an attack on the Supreme Court will hamper not just the confidence that the public has in it but will also shake the confidence that judges of other courts in the country have in the Supreme Court.The court took cognizance of the tweets after a petition was filed by advocate Mehek Maheshwari.Bhushan’s first tweet, reproduced in the court order, said: “When historians in the future look back at the last six years to see how democracy has been destroyed in India even without a formal Emergency, they will particularly mark the role of the SC in this destruction, and more particularly the role of the last four CJIs.”The second referred to the Bobde and was also cited in the order. It said: “The CJI rides a Rs 50-lakh motorcycle belonging to a BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader at Raj Bhavan, Nagpur, without wearing a mask or helmet, at a time when he keeps the SC on lockdown mode denying citizens their fundamental right to access justice!”Bhushan refused to apologise for his tweets, contending they are protected by the freedom of speech guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution. He cited the speeches on dissent made by Supreme Court judges DY Chandrachud on February 15 and Deepak Gupta on February 24 to buttress his case.In defence of his perception that the Supreme Court aided in the destruction of democracy, Bhushan referred to the press conference held by four judges – justices Jasti Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan Lokur and Kurian Joseph -- of the Supreme Court in January 2018 against the manner in which cases in Supreme Court were being assigned to selected benches.Regarding the tweet of June 27, the apex court held that tweet is directed against the Supreme Court and gave an impression that the apex court and its four CJIs had a major role in the destruction of democracy in the last six years.“There is no doubt that the tweet tends to shake the public confidence in the institution of judiciary. The tweet undermines the dignity and authority of the institution of the Supreme Court of India and the CJI,” the court said.Regarding the June 29 tweet, the court said that it was intended to give the impression that the CJI kept the Supreme Court shut denying fundamental rights to citizens even though the court was functioning through video conferencing.Another suo motu contempt petition is pending before the same bench against Bhushan for calling past chief justices corrupt in a 2009 interview to Tehelka magazine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-arguments-today-on-sentencing-prashant-bhushan-in-contempt-of-court-case/story-pWxZHQ3DOgGD8VqTxWdnmI.html

PM Modi, who was originally supposed to announce the results, could not attend the event.A total of 129 awards will be given by the minister to top performing cities and states in a virtual programme called ‘Swachh Mahotsav’. Here is all you need to know about Swachh Survekshan:• Swachh Survekshan was launched by PM Modi in 2016. Mysuru was chosen as the cleanest city in India in that edition of the survey.• Swachh Survekshan is meant to monitor the performance of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which was launched on October 2, 2014, the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. It aims to make India open-defecation free by 2019.• The extensive sanitation survey is commissioned by the Ministry of Urban Development and carried out annually by Quality Council of India. The survey was introduced by the government with the objective of generating large-scale participation in Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. It was also aimed at inculcating a spirit of healthy competition among cities towards becoming India’s cleanest cities.• Swachh Survekshan 2020 covered 4,242 cities, 62 cantonment boards and 92 Ganga towns. This survey was carried out in 28 days.• Minister Hardeep Singh Puri will launch Swachh Survekshan 2020 results dashboard and interact with select beneficiaries, swachhagrahis and sanitary workers under the Swachh Bharat Mission- Urban programme on Thursday.• Last year’s position holder for cleanest city in India, Indore, has emerged victorious for two years before that - in 2017 and 2018.• Fourth edition of the survey in 2019 covered 4,237 cities. It was the first-of-its-kind completely digital survey completed in a record time of 28 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swachh-survekshan-2020-all-you-need-to-know-about-india-s-cleanliness-survey/story-1mwqHdsPZ22jbSGw2pPONJ.html
20-08-2020||India||Is cloud seeding worth the effort? Scientists to release data||The Union Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) would soon release a white paper on whether cloud seeding is a viable technology to trigger rainfall, M Rajeevan, secretary, MoES, said during a lecture organised by the Indian Meteorological Society on Wednesday.The drought-prone states such as Karnataka and Maharashtra had tried cloud seeding with large investments in the past. Delhi, too, had toyed with the concept in 2018 to deal with deadly November smog, but never got around to get it implemented. Delhi-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) has concluded its two-year experiment on cloud seeding and has drafted a report. A team of IITM scientists conducted airborne experiments with two aircraft missions over Solapur in Maharashtra. “There is not much evidence on whether cloud seeding works. The literature is not conclusive. So, based on our experiments, we will release a white paper on how useful or successful is cloud seeding, how it should be done, and the commercial viability of the intervention,” said Rajeevan.MoES is also setting up an atmospheric research test-bed programme, “a highly focussed observational and analytical research effort”, to study atmospheric processes, particularly clouds and convection; land-atmosphere interactions; aerosol and radiation for developing and testing weather and climate models. This will also help understand monsoon dynamics in the core monsoon zone, including parts of eastern and central India.Apart from an overall improvement in forecast reliability which has made significant progress in the past three years, according to Rajeevan, IMD’s monsoon mission coupled forecast model has ensured that the authorities are able to make a short-range prediction of rain and associated weather for five days now instead of three days, when the initiative was launched in 2012.The first phase of the monsoon mission was completed in 2017. IMD and other teams from the MoES are now working on the second phase of the monsoon mission, where the focus will be on extreme weather events and development of applications for various sectors such as renewable energy (solar and wind energy projects require accurate forecast); agriculture and hydrology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-cloud-seeding-worth-the-effort-scientists-to-release-data/story-BcCX5MiPmvd8n342Hya3fI.html
20-08-2020||India||IMD’s monsoon heavy rain forecast accuracy has improved to 70% in three years||All four measures of weather forecast accuracy used to predict monsoon by India Meteorological Department (IMD) have shown a marked improvement over the past three years, while the probability of detection (POD) to forecast heavy rainfall has made significant progress, said M Rajeevan, secretary, Union Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) at an Indian Meteorological Society lecture on Wednesday. POD accuracy went up from 45% from 2002-16 to 70% in 2017-19, the MoES secretary cited to buttress the IMD’s feat. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration describes POD to be the number of hits in forecast divided by the total number of events observed. Similarly, the false alarm rate (FAR) has reduced from 42% to 32% over the corresponding period for heavy rain episodes during monsoon season. Apart from an overall improvement in forecast reliability, IMD’s monsoon mission coupled forecast model has ensured that the authorities are able to make a short-range prediction of rain and associated weather for five days at present instead of three days, when the initiative was launched in 2012. “We can forecast with the same accuracy, but for five days now, as far as the short-range forecast for monsoon season is concerned,” Rajeevan said during the virtual lecture, which was attended by scientists from across the country amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. Also read: Is cloud seeding worth the effort? Scientists to release dataThe first phase of the monsoon mission was completed in 2017. IMD and other teams from the MoES are working on the second phase of the monsoon mission that is focusing on extreme weather events and development of applications for various sectors such as renewable energy (solar and wind energy projects require accurate forecast); agriculture and hydrology.MoES is working on topical issues and emerging problems of the future. For example, Rajeevan said IMD has already developed a percentile-based forecast of extreme weather. The 90th and 95th percentile forecast of rain (10% chance that rain will be higher than that) and wind provide a five-day lead time for a forecast. Similarly, IMD is coming out with 550 new automatic weather stations for agromet services and state-of-the-art sensors for soil moisture and soil temperature detection. “These can help us understand landslides and help immensely with forecasts,” he added.IMD has recently started impact-based forecasts. “I remember the 2013 Uttarakhand floods. We did forecast very heavy rain. But what does it mean for the common man? What action should he take when he has heavy or extremely heavy rain warning? The impact-based warning takes into account all these factors,” added Rajeevan.The MoES secretary, however, conceded that though the 25 June lightning events in Bihar were predicted by the IMD and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) authorities, several people still died because of the natural disaster. Independent experts, who spoke off the record, maintained that more long-term data is needed to measure improvements in making accurate predictions. “These three years are not sufficient enough to judge improvement in forecast skill. There is a method called hindcast verification. Where you run the current model for earlier years and generate the skill score ...,” said a climate scientist on condition of anonymity.But climate change is increasingly making a prediction of extreme rain and seasonal forecasts a difficult proposition. In an article, co-authored by Rajeevan, published in Nature journal in 2015, titled: “Rethinking Indian monsoon rainfall prediction in the context of recent global warming,” the authors had said: “Despite enormous progress having been made in predicting ISMR (Indian summer monsoon rainfall) since 1886, the operational forecasts during recent decades (1989–2012) have little skill. Here we show, with both dynamical and physical–empirical models, that this recent failure is largely due to the models’ inability to capture new predictability sources emerging during recent global warming.”Rajeevan responded to HT’s query on the challenges in seasonal predictions due to climate change. “Some extreme rain events pull up or down the average leading to deviation from the seasonal forecast. We have seen it happening,” the MoES secretary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-s-monsoon-heavy-rain-forecast-accuracy-has-improved-to-70-in-three-years/story-lmezP8Al8byS2HdvGZi6LK.html
20-08-2020||India||Royal Aeronautical Society fellow asks for court of inquiry into Kozhikode crash||Captain Amit Singh, an international aviation safety expert and a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society (FRAeS) in London, wrote to civil aviation minister Hardip Singh Puri on Tuesday, demanding a court of inquiry into the August 8 Air India Express plane accident at the Karipur international airport, Kozhikode. He alleged that evidence from the crash spot appeared to be tampered with and therefore needed an open investigation. Singh, a former chief of safety at AirAsia, said that his plea follows videos captured by the local media after the accident, showing three unidentified persons near the cockpit of the aircraft after the crash. Singh attached screen grabs of the video in his mail to the minister. When asked about the letter, an Air India Express spokesperson said, “We cannot comment as the accident is under investigation.” The plane overshot the runway while attempting to land at the table top airport; there were four cabin crew members and two pilots aboard, besides the passengers. While the two pilots lost their lives, all four cabin crew were rescued. A total of 18 people died in the crash. Also read: Air India plane overshoots Karipur’s table top runway, drops into gorge; 20 deadSingh pointed out that no personnel except those extricating bodies were authorised to do anything else, and also alleged that this (the alleged act of the three unidentified men) is tampering with evidence. An email sent to the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) did not yield any response.Singh’s letter read, ‘As seen in the photograph, a person (A) dressed in military fatigues positioned outside the aircraft cockpit is seen pointing out to something inside the cockpit. There is apparently another person (B) inside the cockpit who hands over a what appears to be a document, to person A. Person A is then seen handing over the presumed document, which is apparently stained to a third person(C).’Referring to the screen grabs, Singh alleged that the destruction of evidence was evident from the video of the person inside the cockpit ostensibly rummaging through the documents and cavities, apparently searching for something in particular. “The current team of experts from AAIB and its experts are fully competent to investigate the accident,” said a spokesperson from the ministry of civil aviation. Singh stated that the AAIB procedures manual 2012, under point 4, details the procedure for securing evidence on site. “It states that the Officer incharge of the aerodromes closest to the site of the accident should assist in coordination with local police authorities and will take immediately all reasonable measures to protect the evidence until the arrival of the officer of AAIB or any other authorized person. It also states that the assistance of civil authorities, particularly that of local police is also necessary to ensure that vital evidence is not lost [sic],” wrote Singh. He also said the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) states few tasks that should be accomplished without delay; these include securing the occurrence site, aircraft, wreckage, and other equipment involved to ensure their preservation, including protection against further damage and the deterioration or disappearance of essential evidence due to theft, displacement or improper handling of the wreckage.“In the absence of a judicial and an open inquiry, I do not see any reason as to how an investigation would be fair and reasonable. Therefore I request you to immediately constitute a Court of Inquiry under the Rule 12 of Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules 2017,” concluded the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/royal-aeronautical-society-fellow-asks-for-court-of-inquiry-into-kozhikode-crash/story-dcz9E1dhwZBm5havvHVdVO.html

Savin Bansal, district magistrate for Nainital district said, “We all know how big a problem traffic congestion is for Nainital town, especially during the peak tourist season when thousands of cars enter the city in a single day. To solve this problem, we had written to the Centre seeking permission to use the land of Metropole Hotel, which is an enemy property. The Central government approved our proposal in November last year and an amount of Rs 42 lakhs has been released recently for the project from the district plan.” Bansal said Central government has given in-principle approval up to March 2021, however, formal approval for using the land as a parking facility needs to be taken every year from the Office of the Custodian of Enemy Property for India. Also read: Uttarakhand logs highest single-day jump of Covid fatalities; state tally over 13,000According to the letter of the Central government sent to Nainital DM in November last year, the ownership of the property will remain with the Custodian of Enemy Property for India under union home ministry. Ninety percent of the income from the parking lot will be deposited in the account of the Custodian of Enemy Property (the account will be opened by the district administration), and rest 10 percent will be spent on the maintenance of the parking lot, the letter states. The district magistrate further informed that the Metropole parking lot will be developed as a hi-tech parking area, equipped with the facility of zoom-in-zoom-out barrier, CCTV cameras, beautification of the parking lot, systematic evacuation and entrance as well as separate toilets for women and men. The district magistrate added that the beautification work, like the construction of a boundary wall, restrooms, small eateries, will start for the convenience of the public. The property is situated in the Nainital town itself and after proper development, it will have a capacity of parking around 250-300 cars, informed the district magistrate. The amount has been sanctioned from the district plan to the public works department for levelling the land, construction of proper drainage, setting up a wire fencing and construction of security wall in the Metropole campus. Being a major tourist spot in Uttarakhand, the hill town of Nainital welcomes around 15,000-20,000 tourists during the peak summer season, leading to the repeated choking of the road approaching the small Himalayan hill station, where open land is hardly available. In May 2019, three to four-kilometre-long traffic jams were witnessed on the roads towards Nainital, especially on weekends and holidays. The authorities were finding it difficult to manage the traffic even as they regularly stopped the vehicles on the outskirts of Nainital on three approach roads - Kaladungi, Bhowali and Haldwani- when parking of around 2,000 vehicles inside Nainital got full. In 2018, the district police had put ‘Nainital Houseful’ flexi-banners on the approach roads to Nainital given the unprecedented tourist influx.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parking-worth-42-lakh-to-come-up-on-enemy-property-in-nainital-after-centre-s-permission/story-jRUdSZonj5upoBskDLdaZP.html

The management of the Sikh holy site usually opens its portals for the pilgrims in May but this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the opening was delayed, the officials stated. Swati S Bhadauria, district magistrate of Chamoli district under whose jurisdiction the holy site falls, said, “The decision to open the portals was taken after a discussion with the members of Hemkund Sahib Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee.” “Due to the pandemic, all pilgrims coming from outside the state need to get a Covid-19 test done with a negative test report within 72 hours of their journey before entering the state. Similarly, they also need to get the e-pass from the government website for the same,” said Bhadauria.

He was also made to shave his head. The victim was admitted in a hospital in Mahidpur and her condition was stated to be stable, the police said. The accused, Vijay Bherulal, is a habitual offender and is facing two more sexual harassment cases. He came out on bail from jail a few weeks ago. He was arrested again by Mahidpur police after this rape charge against him under section 376 (rape) of IPC and relevant sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO) and produced before the court on Wednesday, said Mangilal Chauhan, town inspector, Mahidpur.

Bherulal lured the girl with a chocolate and asked her brother to go back home. The man took the girl to an agriculture field and raped her. Some villagers working in the field had seen him going with the girl. As he was already facing two sexual harassment cases some villagers doubted his intention. They looked for him and later caught him red-handed in the agriculture field.” The villagers thrashed him and later, some youth of the village stripped him and shaved his head. He was made to wear a garland of shoes and paraded in the whole village before handing over to the police, said Chauhan. Ujjain additional superintendent of police Rupesh Dwivedi said, “People can’t be allowed to take law in their hands. We are investigating the matter and further action will be taken against villagers after investigation.” (With inputs from Anand Nigam)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rape-accused-stripped-thrashed-by-villagers-in-madhya-pradesh/story-N2MdUa7gser1J4xNeWSTcK.html

Some, attached to the Time Bank, are devoting their time to visiting old and infirm people at their homes in different villages in close coordination with respective gram pradhans to inquire about their health and needs at a time when many are finding themselves alone and helpless during the pandemic,” said Firoz Alam Khan, an academic resource person with the state’s basic education department, who is the district scout master of Prayagraj. “There are scouts and guides in almost 665 government-run primary and upper primary schools, besides 185 secondary schools and 30 degree colleges of the district. In these institutions, around 35,000 students are a part of this movement, which is managed by 240 warranted scout masters and 1,400 more scout masters and guide captains. It is these volunteers who are managing and operating these unique banks,” he said. A part of this mission is Reeta Sharma, a teacher at a government-run primary school at Bighiya in Soraon, who is also a guide captain and in charge of the Time Bank in her area. “These are unprecedented tough times. Through these banks, we are just trying to help those who are most vulnerable,” she explained. Several needy people are benefiting through these banks that started functioning from May 25. Around 250 bars of soaps have been distributed in the slums of Baihrana and Fakirganj besides 150 sanitary pads and 900 facemasks, as well as essential cereals for a month to around two dozen people. “To run these banks, a collection centre has been set up at the government primary school in Allenganj where all the items are collected and deposited for distribution through these banks,” Reeta said. District secretary of Bharat Scout and Guide Association Yogesh Chandra Tripathi said, “Different scout and guide masters are leading this mission in their respective areas. So, we have primary school teachers like Akhilesh Kumar in Bahariya, Ram Gopal in Manda, and Satyendra Kumar in Meja heading the Time Bank in their areas, while a teacher at the Upper Primary Government School in Jugnideeh, Holagarh’s Brijesh Yadav and Dhunupur’s Manoj Maurya are managing the same in their areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unique-banks-in-prayagraj-lend-helping-hand-to-needy-during-pandemic/story-D3vbTOYXZ7h4W8ZNlceGcP.html
20-08-2020||India||Record 9 lakh Covid tests conducted in a day: Health ministry||India on Wednesday tested a record 9 lakh swab samples for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), as the total number of people who have been tested to date is over 30.25 million, or 3,26,42,782. Pune’s National Institute of Virology, under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), had conducted the first Covid-19 test in the country on January 23, while the first case of the viral outbreak in India was detected on January 30. “India scales a new peak in daily testing. More than 9 lakh Covid-19 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours. The positivity rate has come down to below 8%. The daily testing capacity is likely to reach 10 lakhs soon. The tests per million has also seen a sharp rise,” said a statement from the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW) Fewer Covid-19 patients have required ventilator support because of each detection of the viral outbreak cases through aggressive testing, contact tracing, and clinical treatment management strategies. The latest ministry data showed 0.28% of Covid-19 patients are on ventilator support, 1.92% are undergoing treatment in intensive care units (ICUs) and 2.62% are on oxygen therapy. “It is only by aggressive testing that Covid-19 cases can be identified, their contacts tracked and isolated as well as prompt treatment can be ensured through timely medical care. The sustained level of high testing has played a key role in India’s increasing rate of recovery, widening gap between the recovered and active cases, and also progressively declining case fatality rate (CFR),” the statement added. Covid-19 recoveries reported on a single day have touched 60,000, and have also surpassed the number of new cases reported during the 24-hour reporting cycle. While the country’s testing capacity is recording a constant rise, it is the positivity of about 8% that experts feel is a cause for concern. Because of increased testing, the positivity rate of Covid-19 recorded a jump from about 4% in April to about 9% in August. However, since August 1 the positivity rate has hovered between 8.81 and 8.93%, which should have declined after prolonged aggressive testing. “The positivity rate, which has by and large been constant since August 1, signifies that Covid-19 cases are still being reported, and the transmission cycle has not yet been broken. The virus is still very much in circulation. The positivity rate of 5% or below for a prolonged period of time is what should be aimed at in a bid to rein in the spread of the contagion,” said Dr. Lalit Kant, former head, epidemiology and communicable diseases division, ICMR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/record-9-lakh-covid-tests-conducted-in-a-day-health-ministry/story-vllsFcuxnd9mKY9WchDT3J.html
20-08-2020||India||3-day session of Uttar Pradesh assembly gets underway today||The three-day monsoon session of the Uttar Pradesh assembly gets underway today under the shadow of Covid-19 at a time when the opposition has sought a debate on the pandemic and the law and order situation in the state. The session will be held amid unprecedented security and special seating arrangements - a first for the UP assembly. The deadly virus has already claimed the lives of two ministers Kamal Rani Varun and Chetan Chauhan in the state. The state’s tally of Covid-19 infection cases stood at 1,67,510 as of Wednesday and the death toll was 2,638. A Covid-19 test has been made mandatory for members of both the Houses. With Covid protocol in place, the mask on the face of the MLAs will serve as an entry ticket to the House even after they have cleared Covid-19 test, arrangements for which had been made near their residences and at the Vidhan Bhawan premises. Principal secretary, legislative assembly, Pradeep Dubey said, the security staff can check the identity card of the MLA before allowing entry in case of a doubt. After paying homage to Kamal Rani Varun and Chetan Chauhan, former Madhya Pradesh governor Lalji Tandon and two sitting members Virendra Singh Sirohi and Paras Nath Yadav, the state assembly will be adjourned for the day on Thursday. When the assembly sits again on Friday, the opposition is set to raise the demand for a debate on Covid-19. An indication in this regard came soon after leaders of major political parties attended an all-party meeting convened by speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit on Wednesday to seek their cooperation for smooth conduct of the business of the House. “Yes, we will raise the demand for a debate on the Covid-19 and the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh,” said leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary on the phone. Chaudhary is under home quarantine and will stay away from the House on medical advice. Samajwadi Party leader Narendra Verma attended the all-party meeting on his behalf. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, minister for parliamentary affairs Suresh Khanna, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Lalji Verma, Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhana Mishra ‘Mona’, Apna Dal (Sone Lal) leader Neel Ratan Patel and Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) leader Om Praksh Rajbhar attended the meeting. Asked about their stance, BSP’s Lalji Verma and Congress’s Aradhana Mishra ‘Mona’ said their parties too would demand a debate on Covid-19 and law and order situation. Other issues likely to be raised include the problems of farmers and the flood fury, they said. CM Adityanath said the monsoon session has been convened during the pandemic to meet the constitutional responsibility of holding sittings of the House within six months. He also said the session would provide an occasion for a debate on Covid-19. A debate on Covid-19 in the House would send a new message to the world, he added. The state government also proposes to get bills passed to replace 17 ordinances promulgated after the last session. The government is likely to present the first supplementary demand for grants for 2020-2021 during the session. Earlier, Dikshit said the UP legislature was the first in the country to hold its session during the pandemic. He said legislatures in other states, like Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, had held their meetings for a motion of confidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-day-session-of-uttar-pradesh-assembly-gets-underway-today/story-0Zm1nFaQpYlWpb8VdzpTXL.html

The neighbours had complained of a foul smell coming from the house at Behala in south-west Kolkata, the police said.Police and neighbours said that the incident was an eerie rerun of what the family members did twice, a year ago.In February, when Debasis Chatterjee, 47, died, the old couple and their daughter didn’t inform the police about their son’s death. The police recovered the partially decomposed body of their son.Later, in July 2019, Chaya Chatterjee, 82, Rabindranath Chatterjee’s wife, died. The old man and his daughter didn’t inform the police and were staying with it until the police recovered the body.Also read: Bengal government panel to probe ‘corruption’ in Covid-19 procurement“On Wednesday morning we recovered the body of 86-year-old Rabindranath Chatterjee.

The neighbours informed us as they were getting a foul smell from the house,” said a senior officer of the local police station.The police said that while the woman, Nilanjana Chatterjee, was mentally challenged, her father was bed-ridden for more than a year. The police have sent the woman to a hospital.“This was not the first time that the family had lived with the corpses of their kin until the bodies started decomposing. So when the neighbours got a rotting smell from the house they were sure that something has happened and immediately informed the police,” said Sandip Malakar, a local resident.While the son, Debasis Chatterjee, used to work as a security guard and a courier boy for some time, he was unemployed during the time of his death. The family used to run on Rabindranath Chatterjee’s retirement benefits.“It is a very unfortunate incident. We have seen the family members dying one by one. The woman, Nilanjana Chatterjee, was mentally challenged and didn’t understand that her mother had died,” said Uttam Saha, another resident.Last year, the local police had contributed some money to the family to help them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-lived-with-father-s-dead-body-for-2-days-rerun-of-what-family-had-done-earlier/story-9U3LNamxwbOYiFkeDhr1qM.html
20-08-2020||India||I-T crackdown against people holding multiple PANs after March 31||Over 180 million permanent account numbers (PANs) could become defunct unless linked with Aadhaar numbers by the March 31 deadline, as the income-tax (I-T) department, which is equipped with artificial intelligence (AI), is all set to nab tax evaders conducting high-value transactions by using multiple PANs, two officials said, requesting anonymity. The government may also expand the list of high-value transactions to track expenditure patterns of those unscrupulous people, who spend large sums on luxuries but underreport their income and evade tax, they said. The I-T law provides for a statement of financial transaction (SFT), earlier known as an Annual Information Return (AIR), to track prescribed high-value transactions undertaken by taxpayers. The department gets such expenditure details through banks, financial institutions, mutual funds, credit card companies, and other entities. “It is surprising that in a population of 130 crores only 1.5 crores contribute to the I-T kitty. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also pointed this out recently. Available data suggest that there is an urgent need to expand the tax base,” one of the officials said. PM Modi had unveiled India’s first charter of taxpayers’ rights and duties on August 13 and had appealed to the public to introspect that only 15 million people in a population of 1.3 billion pay I-T. The official quoted above said there are 509.5 million (50.95 crore) PAN cardholders in the country as on June, but only 64.8 million (6.48 crore) of them file income-tax returns (ITR), and only 15 million actually pay I-T. “Around 4.98 crore (49.8 million) people file ITR. But they either show zero tax liability or claim the full amount of tax paid through ITR,” he added. A second official said some unscrupulous people use multiple PAN cards to hide their high-value transactions and manage to keep themselves out of the tax net. “As a result, only 32.71 crore (327.1 million) PANs are linked with Aadhaar. More than one-third PANs could be under the scanner unless linked with Aadhaar before the March 31 deadline,” he said. Naveen Wadhwa, deputy general manager at Taxmann, a tax consultancy, said: “ If PAN is not yet linked with Aadhaar, there is a possibility to obtain multiple PANs. However, once a PAN is linked with an Aadhaar, it will not be possible to obtain multiple PANs.” PAN and Aadhaar linkage will help tax officials to keep a tab on such tax evaders, who do not show any taxable income, but splurge money on luxurious items such as buying a vehicle, investing in real estate, travelling overseas and buying jewellery, the officials said. The government may expand the list of such high-value transactions that I-T department tracks. According to the second official, the list may include payment of education fee above Rs 1 lakh annually, consumption of electricity above Rs 1 lakh per annum, domestic air travel in the business class, purchase of jewellery or white goods above Rs 1 lakh, payment of property tax above Rs 20,000 per annum, life insurance premium above Rs 50,000 and health insurance premium above Rs 20,000. However, these details will be collected from the third party only and honest taxpayers would not be required to provide expenditure details in their ITRs, the official said. “The proposed move is to bring tax evaders into the tax net and not to harass honest taxpayers, as they are not required to file details of high-value transactions in their ITRs,” he said. Citing an example of a person paying Rs 5 lakh per annum school fee, including donations, without paying any tax, he said, “By claiming that his income is not taxable he is trying to dodge the I-T system. Similarly, a person, who has made purchases of luxury items or spent sizeable amount for hotel bills, is a potential taxpayer and should file h/her ITR.” “No doubt, the third-party reporting of high-value transactions made by such non-filers would allow the department to nudge such persons to file their returns and pay their due tax,” he added. Kapil Rana, chartered accountant and founder of HostBooks Ltd, a cloud-based accounting platform, said, “There is a possibility and proven cases, where multiple PAN numbers have been acquired fraudulently and used to evade tax.” “PAN-Aadhaar linkage will eliminate the possibility of holding multiple PAN by an assessee. It will eliminate wilful tax evaders. Aadhaar is designed in such a way that duplicate cards cannot be issued. Besides, PAN-Aadhaar linkage will eliminate fake or multiple PANs held by the same person in various fraudulent ways.” Wadhwa said the proposed move of the government to expand the list of expenditure would not cause any incontinence to honest taxpayers. “Through SFT the I-T department gets the information of high-value transactions and expenditures, which can be used to verify whether the income of the person is in sync with the quantum of such transactions and expenditure,” he said. However, the government zeroes in on only those cases that manifest a larger gap between the returned income and expenditures, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-t-crackdown-against-people-holding-multiple-pans-after-march-31/story-BwKGpwWzowfth9cPu6ZKlJ.html
20-08-2020||India||Tribal woman delivers under a tree in Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra||A 27-year-old tribal woman in labour was forced to deliver her baby amid rains under a tree in the forest of Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli with the help of an accredited social health activist (ASHA) worker last week. The woman was on her way to the hospital. According to reports, Bharti Dorpeti (27), a Madia tribal from village Zarewada of Etapalli taluka, was nine-month pregnant. An ASHA worker from the village intimated Gatta Primary Health Centre, located some 10 kilometres from her village. The Primary Health Centres (PHC) officials including a contractual health worker Soni Durge, ASHA helper Savita Alam and a driver took an ambulance and left for Zarewada to bring the pregnant woman.However, their vehicle could not reach the village due to incessant rains and a flooded Gilanguda nullah. A truck was already stuck there due to floods. Meanwhile, relatives of Bharti had already left for the hospital carrying the woman on a cot as there was no mode of transport available at that time. They somehow reached up to the nullah. Soni and Savita were waiting on the other side of the nullah. As it was impossible for them to drive the ambulance to the other side, the women health employees somehow crossed the nullah and reached the place.Also read: Ulhasnagar NGO promotes red-mud Ganesh idols made by tribal artistsDurge saved Bharti by providing timely medical help there. Soni and her team protected her from the rains with someone holding an umbrella. Bharti soon gave birth to a baby girl. Both the baby and the mother were then taken to the hospital wading through the flooded nullah. The mother and her baby are reported safe. The delivery could be done safely and lives of both the baby and the mother were saved due to the timely decision of the ASHA worker, reports said.Durge, who had been working in the remote and highly sensitive Maoist-affected area for the last six years, said, tribal women avoid visiting the PHC until they experience labour pains. Bharati had experienced labour pains on August 12 and informed Savita, the village ASHA worker, who in turn, sent her husband on his bike to alert Soni.“As it was raining heavily and the entire locality was flooded, I set off immediately with my delivery kit and emergency medicine and left the village in an ambulance,” Soni said.This is not the only story of sufferings and difficulties faced by the tribals in these remote villages. Many such incidents have taken place in the area in the past too. Few days ago, a pregnant woman from Turemarka village in Bhamragarh taluka had to walk for more than 23 kilometres to Laheri hospital for her delivery as no vehicle could reach her house. Another woman from Gundenur village in Bhamragarh taluka in south Gadchiroli died for the want of timely medical treatment before she could be taken to the hospital on a cot by her relatives.The community health worker scheme of ASHA was instituted by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh-led government as part of the National Rural Health Mission. One of the key components of the National Rural Health Mission is to provide every village in the country with a trained woman community health worker.Selected from the village itself and accountable to it, the ASHA workers are trained to work as an interface between the community and the public health system. The district of Gadchiroli lacks proper healthcare and the ASHA scheme has brought a ray of hope for the tribals, particularly women and children. The unusual story of Bharati’s delivery is one such example of the success story of ASHA.Meanwhile, flood situation in Gadchiroli district continued to remain grim as heavy rains lashed many parts of the district, particularly south Gadchiroli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tribal-woman-delivers-under-a-tree-in-gadchiroli-district-of-maharashtra/story-xEcIVAGy9AdyJJo5rainjI.html
20-08-2020||India||Prashant Bhushan asks Supreme Court to defer hearing on his sentence in contempt case||Lawyer Prashant Bhushan has appealed to the Supreme Court to defer hearing on his punishment in a contempt of court case till the time his review petition against the August 14 conviction order is taken up.The apex court had taken suo moto notice of two tweets posted by Bhushan on June 27 and 29 where he had accused the present Chief Justice of India (CJI) of closing down courts and past CJIs of destroying democracy.The application comes on the eve of the hearing fixed for his sentencing by a bench of Justices Arun Mishra, BR Gavai and Krishna Murari.The application by Bhushan said, “The applicant intends to file a review against the order of August 14 after studying the order, in detail, and seeking appropriate legal counsel as the ramification of the said order is of grave constitutional significance, in particular on the right to free speech.” He has 30 days to file a review under Order 47 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013.“In view of the same, the hearing on sentence as fixed on August 20, be deferred till the consideration of the review by this Court,” Bhushan prayed.In the event the court still proceeds to conduct the hearing, Bhushan made an alternate prayer. He said, “If this court proceeds with the hearing on sentence and imposes any sentence, the same may be directed to be stayed till the remedy of review is exhausted by the applicant.” In its judgment passed on August 14, the bench had held, “The Indian judiciary is not only one of the pillars on which the Indian democracy stands but is the central pillar. An attempt to shake the very foundation of constitutional democracy has to be dealt with an iron hand.” The Court found Bhushan’s tweets criticising the judiciary to be distorted on facts and “malicious attacks” having potential to shake public confidence in the judicial system.Under the Contempt of Court Act, an act of criminal contempt of court can attract a punishment of six months imprisonment or Rs 2,000 fine or both. Bhushan pointed out in his application that in criminal contempt proceedings, the Supreme Court functions like a trial court and is also the last court. There is no appeal to a higher forum once the top court sentences a person for contempt.Bhushan requested the court to accept his request for deferment in view of the underlying public policy with respect to safeguarding liberty of a citizen under Article 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prashant-bhushan-asks-supreme-court-to-defer-hearing-on-his-sentence-in-contempt-case/story-WM3XywlcwPDUUEg4h8JjBK.html

20-08-2020||India||India-China WMCC meet today: 5 things to know||The Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on India-China border affairs will hold a meeting on Thursday, when the military dialogue between senior commanders from the two sides has hit a roadblock due to Beijing’s reluctance to restore status quo ante in some key friction areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. The military commanders set the timeframe and method of disengagement, while the WMCC monitors the process. The outcome of the WMCC meeting is likely to determine, when the senior commanders could meet next. Here are five things you need to know about the India-China border dispute in the Ladakh sector: * Five rounds of top-level military talks have failed to break the deadlock following serious differences between India and China that flared up after transgressions by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) this summer. The Indian Army has taken the hard line with the PLA, as it seeks to restore the status quo ante of early April in eastern Ladakh. * The sizeable Chinese troop presence at friction points, particularly Pangong lake and Depsang plains, remains an area of key concern for the Indian Army. Beijing is yet to deliver on understandings regarding disengagement reached during the July 5 phone conversation between the Special Representatives on the border issue and meetings of corps commanders. * The Finger Area—a set of eight cliffs jutting out of Sirijap range overlooking Pangong lake—has emerged as the hardest part of the disengagement process. Disengagement has progressed somewhat smoothly at friction points in Galwan Valley and Hot Springs, but its pace remains sluggish in Gogra area. * There is growing consensus among Indian officials and China experts that military talks are unlikely to deliver further results, and the resolution of the issue will require political and diplomatic intervention. The Indian military has made preparations for a long haul in the Ladakh sector. * De-escalation along the disputed border can only begin after complete disengagement between the two armies on the LAC. The ground situation remains unchanged in the Ladakh sector, where both armies have deployed almost 100,000 soldiers and weaponry in both their forward and depth areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-wmcc-meet-today-5-things-to-know/story-Va0f5vlkg8yXGExhIJwVIL.html

Since people want to be a part of the construction process, they can do so by donating copper, Rai said. Using only stones, it will be built in such a manner that decay due to air, sun and water will not happen and temple will last for at least 1,000 years, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-stones-to-be-used-for-building-ram-temple-will-stand-for-1-000-years-trust-official/story-vfMZPTsHC18VfKsXUhkmLJ.html
20-08-2020||India||Top court allows CBI probe in Sushant Singh Rajput’s death||The Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that the ongoing probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the case filed against actor Rhea Chakraborty and her family for allegedly abetting the suicide of Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput is lawful, allowing the federal agency to continue its investigation and rejecting a plea by Chakraborty to transfer the case to the Maharashtra Police.A single-judge bench of justice Hrishikesh Roy invoked powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to hold that a fair, competent and impartial investigation is required considering the fact that there are competing claims and acrimonious allegations of political interference by the Maharashtra and Bihar governments.Also read: Sushant Singh Rajput case: 5 factors behind SC order for CBI probe“In such situation, there is reasonable apprehension of truth being a casualty and justice becoming a victim. To ensure public confidence in the investigation and to do complete justice in the matter, this court considers it appropriate to invoke the powers conferred by Article 142 of the Constitution. The ongoing investigation by the CBI is held to be lawful,” the court said. Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to pass orders for doing complete justice in cases before it.Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai apartment on June 14 in what police said appeared to be an open-and-shut case of suicide. The post-mortem report ruled out any foul play. After a two-week quiet, a political controversy erupted over the death, as a Bihar Police team constituted to probe the case on a complaint by the actor’s family alleged it got no cooperation from its Mumbai counterpart. Also read| Just a conspiracy to defame Aaditya Thackeray: Sena on Sushant Singh Rajput probeThe jurisdictional turf war spilled into the legal arena as the Supreme Court was approached to decide if CBI could investigate the matter. The issue became deeply acrimonious and divisive at multiple levels — between the Rajput and Chakraborty families, between the actors’ respective sets of fans, between the governments of the two states in question, and between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its former ally Shiv Sena — and left the entertainment industry split vertically. The case opened up a raging debate in and about the industry, devolving into a war of words and allegations between two camps largely made up of “insiders” (with generational links to Bollywood) and “outsiders” (first-generation actors and filmmakers). Chakraborty and her supporters alleged that the Bihar government was trying to hijack the emotive issue for political capital ahead of the upcoming state assembly elections.Chakraborty’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde said in a statement to the media after Wednesday’s ruling that the court referred to the fact that his client called for a CBI probe. Chakraborty, in her written arguments submitted before the Supreme Court, had said she was not opposed to a CBI probe provided it was ordered by the Supreme Court and not the Bihar government.“The Supreme Court, after examining the facts and circumstances of the case and the report of the Mumbai Police, has observed that it will be the desired justice as Rhea herself called for a CBI investigation. It also observed that due to the allegations made by the two states [Bihar and Maharashtra] of political interference against each other, it would be in the interest of justice to hand over the case to the CBI,” Maneshinde said.He said Chakraborty will cooperate with the CBI investigation as she has with the Mumbai Police and the Enforcement Directorate. “Rhea maintains that the truth will remain the same whichever agency investigates the case,” Maneshinde said.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar termed Wednesday’s verdict as a “victory of justice”. State police chief Gupteshwar Pandey expressed satisfaction on the order and triggered a controversy when he made a derogatory reference to Chakraborty while talking to the media. Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad weighed in on the matter as he tweeted, “Justice triumphs! The soul of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput will surely now rest in peace with the assurance of a fair investigation by CBI on the FIR filed in Patna by Bihar Police whose request for transfer of case to CBI has been validated by the Supreme Court.”Rajput’s father, who is living with his daughter in Faridabad, was not available for comments but his family issued a statement thanking everybody for their support. “We are particularly thankful to chief minister Nitish Kumar for setting the wheel of justice in motion,” the statement said. “Today’s development has reaffirmed our faith in India as a robust democracy,” it added.The family’s lawyer, Vikash Singh, said it was a “historic” verdict. State opposition leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, Rajput’s cousin and BJP MLA Neeraj Kumar Bablu, Bihar minister Sanjay Jha, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader Chirag Paswan, former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP Manoj Jha, BJP spokesperson Shahnawaj Hussain, senior Congress leader Tariq Anwar, and Parth Pawar, grandson of NCP leader Sharad Pawar, were among political leaders who welcomed the verdict.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said the order was “not a loss”. “Until we read a copy of the order, we cannot react to it. Once the order is received, either the advocate general or the state DGP [director general of police] will talk about it. Raising questions on the ability of the Mumbai Police was a conspiracy. According to me, the Mumbai Police carried out the probe effectively. Now that the SC has given its judgment in the matter, someone who is not in the government should not speak on it,” said Raut.Actor-producer Kangana Ranaut, who has been leading a campaign against industry “insiders” for allegedly driving Rajput to suicide, congratulated all “SSR warriors” (after the late actor’s initials) after the Supreme Court verdict.The highest court upheld the validity of the Bihar Police FIR registered on the basis of a complaint by Rajput’s father and directed Mumbai Police to pass on all evidence collected during its investigation to CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-court-allows-cbi-probe-in-sushant-singh-rajput-s-death/story-Mfvx6T8IOaRKNARmNo1MIP.html
20-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On Tuesday, India saw 65,141 new cases of the coronavirus disease. There were 60,433 recoveries. There has been a lot of focus on daily recoveries exceeding daily new cases — after it happened once over the past week (on August 17) — along with commentary of how this could mean things are getting better. This isn’t the first time the number of daily recoveries exceeded the number of new cases (it has happened a few times over the past two months), but it is definitely not a sign of a turnaround — at least, not yet. The seven-day average of daily new cases in the 15 Indian states and the Capital that accounted for the most new cases on Tuesday (92%) was 57,698, marginally higher than the 14-day average of 56,873, clearly indicating that the number of new cases has stayed at the same level.This is a good time to revisit the status of the pandemic across these 16 places. There is no significant trend, up or down, between the seven-day and 14-day averages in 13 states and Delhi; in some, the number has increased marginally, and in others, it has decreased marginally. The other two, Odisha and Karnataka, have seen the most significant increases. But in isolation, this data doesn’t tell us anything.Also read: Rapid test reliance may slow Covid-19 fightWhich is why it is important to look at the positivity rate: the proportion of those testing positive to those tested. The average positivity rate for the past seven days was the highest in Maharashtra (18.9%), Andhra Pradesh (16.7%) and Karnataka (14.7%). These are worrying numbers in any context — a 7-12% range is considered acceptable (and safe) in a state that has begun testing adequately, and a 3-8% range in a state that has been testing adequately for some time. All three states have been testing more than the national average (which still doesn’t mean they are testing adequately).Maharashtra has thus far tested 26,750 people per million of its population; Andhra Pradesh 56,713, and Karnataka 32,435. The national average is 23,815. Clearly, these are India’s primary Covid-19 hot spots at this point. Overall, till Tuesday night, Maharashtra has seen 615,477 cases, Andhra 306,261 cases, and Karnataka 240,948. They rank 1, 3, and 4 in the country in terms of number of cases (Tamil Nadu is 2), and account for 42% of all Covid cases recorded thus far in the country.Also read: Covid-19 vaccine may need ‘emergency authorisation’Between the week ended Tuesday, and the previous week, Maharashtra’s positivity rate actually saw an increase by 2.7 percentage points. This can be directly attributed to its lower testing over the past week — on average, around 8,500 fewer tests were conducted in the week ended Tuesday compared to the previous week. The same reason helped Odisha — by conducting roughly 28,000 tests a day more than it did in the previous week, the state was able to lower its positivity rate from 9.4% to 5%. Bihar, too, reduced its positivity rate by 1.9 percentage points on the strength of higher testing, as did West Bengal (by 1.7 percentage points).How much testing is adequate? This is a moving target, and this writer’s own assessment has evolved with a deeper understanding of how the pandemic plays out across regions. There are two stages to this. One, states with a population in excess of 50 million should be testing at least 4-5% of its population; between 20 million and 50 million, 5-7%; and below 20 million, 7-10%. Two, states that meet the adequacy criteria listed above and continue to see rising positivity rates should keep increasing testing till these start plateauing (or dropping).Click here for complete coronavirus coverageBased on this, only four of the 15 states and Delhi — Delhi itself, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu — are testing adequately. Of the four, only Delhi and Assam are both testing adequately and have a safe positivity rate. Tamil Nadu has been testing adequately, but it is clearly on a long plateau of cases. And Andhra Pradesh actually needs to test even more till its positivity rate declines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-i6DfUWlMEKqluXEWvZmfHO.html

According to diplomats based in Dhaka and New Delhi, the Bangladesh PM emphasized the importance of completing bilateral infrastructure and connectivity projects in time. In this context, it has been decided that a high level project monitoring committee headed by the Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka and the Bangladesh Foreign Secretary will be set up immediately.The people cited in the first instance added that the two countries have also decided that the meeting of the Joint Consultative Commission at the level of Foreign Ministers will be scheduled soon so that all bilateral projects are brought to speed.In the year when Bangladesh is celebrating 100 years of Sheikh Mujibur Rehman aka Bangabandhu and 50 years of India-Bangladesh bilateral relations, Shringla, during his 90 minute meeting with PM Hasina told her that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken about strengthening relations with the neighbours in his Independence Day speech. That India remains top on Bangladesh PM’s agenda was evident from the fact that FS Shringla was the first foreign visitor that she met since the outbreak of coronavirus four months ago, the people cited above said, adding that the meeting was characterised by warmth. FS Shringla briefed the leader of Bangladesh about the work happening on a Covid-19 vaccine in India and promised her (in response to a question) that because India manufactures 60% of the world’s vaccines, it will ensure that Dhaka’s requirements are addressed, the people said. The visiting FS also discussed the prospect of starting an air bubble between New Delhi and Dhaka so that medical, technical and business professionals are allowed to travel by air in the coming days. FS Shringla also spoke to the Bangladesh Army Chief and General Secretary of Awami League party as well as senior ministers through video conference, the people added. PM Hasina also raised the Rohingya issue with FS Shringla and requested that India facilitate the return of the displaced refugees to Myanmar. The people said, she was very clear that Bangladesh will not allow its territory to be used either by terrorists or insurgents. The two sides also discussed the security scenario in the region as well as forces opposing the growth of India-Bangladesh bilateral ties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sheikh-hasina-pushes-for-infra-projects-at-fs-shringla-meet-then-makes-a-promise/story-mUDpO58D6yDbOGvtZdkiSK.html
20-08-2020||India||Pakistan on lookout for new voice to lead Hurriyat||Pakistan is looking hard to find a new separatist voice to lead the Hurriyat Conference, multiple government and security officials familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The separatist body, first formed in 1993, has played an important part in Kashmir but has been largely defunct since the state’s special status was changed last year on August 5. “The deep state in Pakistan is looking for younger leaders and has been trying to persuade those who have been a part of militant organizations, including the more battle-hardened groups like the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba,’’ a home ministry official said. There has been no direction from the Hurriyat leaders to the general masses -- diktats were common before that -- in the past year. In a surprise move, 91-year-old SAS Geelani who was the separatist group’s “chairman for life” resigned from the faction of the Hurriyat he headed. The parallel body, headed by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq has been silent for nearly a year. “Pakistan is looking for fresh faces to take charge and channelize the anger and resentment over the government’s decision to strip the state of its special status, once guaranteed under Article 370,” said another official, adding that “the changes in the domicile law has also led to a lot of disquiet.” On August 5 last year, the Rajya Sabha passed laws and resolutions effectively abrogating Article 370 and splitting Jammu & Kashmir into two Union territories. The Lok Sabha passed these the following day. In March this year, the government enacted an executive order where it expanded the definition of domicile to include non-locals who have been living in Jammu & Kashmir for 15 years and the children of Central government employees who have worked in the region for 10 years. The Hurriyat was at the forefront of several agitations in the past and both Geelani and the faction led by the Mirwaiz were instrumental in issuing protest calendars. Most separatist leaders were placed under house arrest ahead of the Centre’s move to bifurcate the state into two Union Territories and have not been able to organise protests. The Hurriyat Conference led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq broke its silence after almost a year, when in July, it held a meeting and called for the Kashmir problem to be resolved through dialogue between India, Pakistan and the people of J&K. The meeting was held a few days after Geelani resigned and accused his colleagues of inaction and corruption. Soon after the meeting, a statement was issued in which the Mirwaiz faction vowed to work towards “the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir conflict.” In his resignation letter, Geelani accused his colleagues of having failed to evolve a strategy to counter the reading down of Article 370. Many in the Hurriyat are also being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). “Pakistan is now trying its best to create a new team,” said the first official quoted above. Pakistan has provided a base to several terror groups operating in Kashmir and India has maintained that its neighbour exports terror and foments trouble in the Valley. To mark the first anniversary of the reading down of Article 370, Pakistani Prime Minister released a new, “political map” in which it identified Kashmir as a “disputed territory.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-on-lookout-for-new-voice-to-lead-hurriyat/story-cRaOXNgEhV5oJ73fdtkNVM.html

20-08-2020||India||Cabinet nod to increase in sugarcane price||The Cabinet on Wednesday approved the fair and remunerative price (FRP) of sugarcane, the price at which millers buy from farmers, for 2020-21), increasing the minimum by Rs10 to Rs 285 per quintal. The sugarcane sale season will start in October 2020. The FRP, which is provided for by the Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966, is the minimum price that sugar mills have to pay to sugarcane farmers. Sugarcane producing states such as Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana fix their own sugarcane price called ‘state advisory prices’ (SAPs), which are usually higher than the Centre’s FRP. According to government estimates, the country’s total sugar production is pegged to be 28-29 million tonne in the current year ending next month, compared to 33.1 million tonnes during 2018-19 due to a sharp fall in cane acreage in Maharashtra and Karnataka. The FRP of Rs 285 per quintal applied for a basic recovery rate of 10%, which is the amount of sugar recovered from a given quantity of cane. A premium of Rs 2.85 per quintal for every 0.1% increase above 10% in the recovery has been allowed. However, there will a reduction in FRP by Rs 2.85 per quintal for every 0.1 percentage point decrease in recovery in respect of those mills whose recovery is below 10% but above 9.5%. However, for mills having recovery 9.5 % or below, the FRP is fixed at Rs 270.75 per quintal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-nod-to-increase-in-sugarcane-price/story-bHbn91PZlSRGxCuwdTj4cL.html

At present, the number of active Covid-19 cases are less than 25% of the total number of the viral infections reported since January 30. “When we talk about the viral caseload of a particular country, it is always the active cases that are counted. It is never the total number of positive cases,” said Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, MoH&FW.

20-08-2020||India||Facebook employees raise questions in open letter||Facebook and its top lobbying executive in India, Ankhi Das, are facing questions internally from employees over how political content is regulated in its biggest market, according to sources with direct knowledge and internal posts seen by Reuters.The world’s largest social network is battling a public-relations and political crisis in India after the Wall Street Journal reported that Das opposed applying the company’s hate-speech rules to a politician from PM Narendra Modi’s party who had in posts called Muslims traitors.In the United States and around the world, Facebook employees are raising questions about whether adequate procedures and content regulation practices were being followed by the India team, sources familiar with discussions told Reuters.An open letter written to Facebook’s leadership by 11 employees on one internal platform, and seen by Reuters, demands company leaders acknowledge and denounce “anti-Muslim bigotry” and ensure more policy consistency. The letter also demanded that Facebook’s “policy team in India (and elsewhere) includes diverse representation.”“It is hard not to feel frustrated and saddened by the incidents reported ... We know we’re not alone in this. Employees across the company are expressing similar sentiment,” said the letter. “The Muslim community at Facebook would like to hear from Facebook leadership on our asks.”Facebook and Das did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Facebook has been under fire in recent years for its lax approach to fake news content, state-backed disinformation campaigns and violent content spread via its platforms.The WSJ article said Das had told staff that applying hate-speech rules to politicians close to Modi’s ruling BJP “would damage the company’s business prospects in the country.”Following the report, in response to Reuters queries on the matter, Facebook said it prohibits hate speech that incites violence and enforces policies without regard to political position or party affiliation.“While we know there is more to do, we’re making progress on enforcement and conduct regular audits,” said the company, which has more than 300 million users in India.One of the sources said Facebook’s India leadership will have to answer tough questions on what really happened, “There will be scrutiny on what really went down.”After the article, Facebook India head Ajit Mohan defended Das, whose title is Director, Public Policy, India, South & Central Asia, and the company’s policies in an internal community post, also seen by Reuters. The WSJ “article does not reflect the person I know or the extraordinarily complex issues we face everyday that benefits from Ankhi and the Public Policy team’s expertise,” Mohan wrote. Mohan also wrote the company is “confident that the article’s claim that political affiliations influence decision making in India is inaccurate and without merit.”A spokesman for the WSJ did not respond to a request for comment.Congress has called for a parliamentary probe into Facebook, while BJP lawmakers in turn have accused Facebook of censoring nationalist voices.Das hasn’t commented on the controversy, but her sister Rashmi, who has publicly acknowledged her own ties to a student wing close to the BJP, told the India Today TV on Tuesday, “we sisters are made of very stern stuff.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-employees-raise-questions-in-open-letter/story-XXSm11sQQg8US7HDSt2Z9L.html
20-08-2020||India||US, Brazil, India push Covid-19 cases past 22 million-mark||The total number of coronavirus infections globally has crossed 22 million, with the US, Brazil and India accounting for more than half the total. The number of fatalities from Covid-19 has gone past 782,000.The UK, which has recorded the highest death toll in Europe, is looking at testing people for the disease at airports. But Britain is unlikely to follow France in ordering people to wear face coverings at work because its test and trace scheme shows most people are catching the virus in house-to-house transmission, health secretary Matt Hancock said on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a study by experts at the University of Oxford and Manchester found that a “pressure cooker” environment in British homes during lockdown has seen a “significant” rise in children and adolescents attacking parents in already volatile households. Elsewhere, Iran surpassed 20,000 confirmed deaths from the disease on Wednesday, the health ministry said.

20-08-2020||India||When UK planted anti-Soviet propaganda in Indian media||‘Animal Farm’, George Orwell’s acclaimed political satire, has been widely read across the globe, but less known is how a UK department set up to counter Soviet propaganda turned it into cartoon strips and planted them in newspapers in India and elsewhere in the early 1950s.Published on August 17, 1945, the book reflects events linked to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union. It describes a gang of animals who take over their farm, overthrowing the cruel Farmer Jones, only to end up in an even more brutal state of slavery under the new regime.Declassified files at the National Archives show that the Information Research Department (IRD) in the Foreign Office bought strip cartoon rights of the book in 1950, intending to use it as part of the cut-and-thrust of the then Cold War.“(This) work has been translated into many languages, and has proved to be not only a best seller, but also a most effective propaganda weapon, because of its skilful combination of simplicity, subtlety and humour”, says a December 1950 circular of IRD. The files include detailed correspondence between Lt. Col. Leslie Sheridan of the IRD, Don Freeman, an artist who provided the ‘roughs’ of the drawings, and the cartoonist Norman Pett, who produced the final versions of the cartoons. Mark Dunton, records specialist at National Archives, writes that by April 1951, with the cartoon strips completed, the IRD contacted its network of information officers across the world, from Asmara (Eritrea) to Tokyo, encouraging them to do all they could to secure publication in a newspaper in their territory.“This endeavour met with a good measure of success, judging from reports in FO 1110/392 (file)”, he writes.A report in the file quotes one Joan Sanders as stating that a prominent newspaper (not Hindustan Times) published from New Delhi “are publishing three strips weekly. Excellent reproduction”, based on a telegram from New Delhi of April 28, 1951.The IRD’s plan, according to the files, was to tell the ‘Animal Farm’ story “in approximately 78 cartoons, each cartoon containing three or four panels. Thus, if the feature were run by a daily paper, it would take about 13 weeks to tell the whole story”.Arrangements were also made for local adaptations and translations in various countries. The Foreign Office informed the British embassy in Cairo in August 1951: “We could have the cartoons drawn in London and sent to you in the hope that you could get a local artist to convert oak trees into palm trees, bowler hats into fezzes, skirts into sarongs, etc”.The files report that the cartoon strips were well received in Asmara ‘giving food for thought and discussion to the local population’, and it had led to increased sales of the ‘El Heraldo’ newspaper in Caracas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-uk-planted-anti-soviet-propaganda-in-indian-media/story-7541FjhOv4vGyLs27quPUI.html
20-08-2020||India||‘Creativity needs to be acknowledged’||For actor, writer, director Shashie Vermaa it’s the support of parents that can work wonders for youngsters who have strong creative inclination. “Creativity needs to be acknowledged. Sadly, in our country very few parents support and understand creativity. For many acting, theatre, TV and films can never be a long-term career option. Though I hail from a small town like Sitamarhi, Bihar but thankfully I had supportive parents who encouraged me to pursue acting. This is one of the strong reason why I was able to take up a path less opted in those times,” he said.Seen in films like ‘Shorgul’, ‘Bala’ and OTT series ‘Panchayat’, Shashie started acting while he was in school. “I remember participating in plays as a kid and that helped me to develop a flair for acting. When I reached Delhi University it gave me a prefect platform for polishing whatever little talent I had at that time. I did two-year diploma from Sri Ram Centre of Performing Arts along with my college degree. I was very active in all theatre activities happening in universities and learnt a lot about acting, process of film making and started assisting documentary makers before reaching Mumbai,” he said over the phone.Talking about getting his first TV show he said, “I used to assist in ad and corporate films before taking up the job of AD and then second unit director in shows like ‘Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki’ and ‘Re Mama Re.’ In between acting happened by chance. My batchmates were going for auditions so I tagged along thinking maybe I get some behind-the-camera job. They auditioned for roles in the hit daily ‘CID’ and when things didn’t work out for them we left. It was then one of my friends said ‘Tumhe kya karna yahan, chalo ya direction ke liye baat kar lo.’ Just to prove that I too can act I went back and auditioned. Such is destiny that I got that role.” Shashie was the creative director and co-writer for Jimmy Sheirgill starrer ‘Shorgul’ that was extensively shot in Lucknow. “During the shoot an actor didn’t turn up for a role which eventually I did and that’s how acting in films took off. The role of ‘Mama’ went well with the audience and so more acting projects followed. Then I shot for a lot of commercials before I got ‘Bala’ where I played a hair transplant doctor,” he said.He will be seen playing a significant role in an upcoming web series. “I’m essaying a role of an ACP (cop) in the series ‘Flesh’ that is a thriller based on human and child trafficking. Also, I am all set to direct actor Pankaj Tripathi for a feature film tentatively titled ‘Vidhya Kasam.’ It was scheduled to be shot in mid-April (2020) in Jharkhand but due to the ongoing corona crisis we will now resume shoot after a couple of months,” he shared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/creativity-needs-to-be-acknowledged/story-9UXoC3O3muTNBggXVH1PFJ.html
20-08-2020||India||India building new road to Ladakh for troop movement without observation from enemy: Report||In an effort to rush troops and tanks to the Pakistan and China front in Ladakh without being observed by the enemy, India is working on making a new road from Manali to Leh, which will provide the third link between the high altitude mountainous Union Territory (UT) and the rest of the country.India is also working on providing alternative connectivity to the strategically important Sub-Sector North including the Daulat Beg Oldi and other areas there for the last three years and work has already started from the world’s highest motorable road Khardung La pass.“Agencies are working to provide alternative connectivity from Manali to Leh through Nimu-Padam-Darcha axis which will help in saving a lot of time in comparison with the existing routes passing through Zojila pass from Srinagar and the other route from Manali to Leh through Sarchu,” government sources told ANI.The road will save almost three to four hours journey time while travelling from Manali to Leh and will also not leave any scope for the Pakistanis or other adversaries to monitor the movement of the Indian Army while deploying troops and heavy weaponry like tanks and artillery guns to the Ladakh area from other locations, they said.The route mainly used for transportation of goods and men is the one from Zojila, which passes through Drass-Kargil axis to Leh. The same route was targeted heavily by the Pakistanis during the Kargil war in 1999 and was subjected to frequent bombarding and shelling by their troops from positions in high altitude mountains alongside the road.Sources said the work has already started on this project and the new road will connect Manali with Leh near Nimu where Prime Minister Narendra Modi had recently visited during the ongoing conflict with China.Likewise, to provide alternatives to the strategic Durbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi road, India is working on further developing the old summer route on which caravans used to reach eastern Ladakh areas from the western side.The new road will travel from Leh towards Khardungla and then move through glaciers including the Sasoma-Saser La-Shyok and Daulat Beg Oldi axis.Senior sources said that the 14 Corps was given the responsibility of finding an alternative to the DSDBO road and check the road coming from near the Siachen camp towards the DBO area, and one unit was sent through there on a trial basis.The Army unit travelled from Sasoma to Saser La in vehicles and the rest of the area on foot, on the route which is full of bones of double-humped camels which were used to ferry cargo, through the very rough Shyok river during the summers. The new route was earlier used by the Army also to maintain the Sub Sector North.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-building-new-road-to-ladakh-for-facilitating-troop-movement-without-observation-from-enemy/story-rNUYZMmw2DqL7yWsOmdvSL.html
20-08-2020||India||Visva Bharati officials skip state meet, Padma Shri awardee doctor’s bust vandalized in Birbhum||Two days after vandalism forced its closure, Bengal’s Visva Bharati University on Wednesday stayed away from a meeting called by the Birbhum district administration while students, local residents and traders opposed to the vice-chancellor’s decision to cordon off the fair ground took part in it Though there was no tension on and off campus on Wednesday, vandalism returned to Tagore’s Santiniketan when some miscreants sprayed black paint on a bust of the Central university’s former executive council member Dr Sushovan Bandopadhyay who publicly supported vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakraborty. Famous for treating patients for a fee of just one rupee, an act that earned him the name ‘Ek takar daktar’ (one rupee doctor), Bandopadhyay was honoured with the Padma Shri by the Centre earlier this year. The bust was placed near his home in Santiniketan by local people. Bandopadhyay was not available for comment but the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) central leadership, which strongly condemned Monday’s vandalism and involvement of local Trinamool Congress leaders, reacted sharply. “This is the fate of ‘Ek Takar Daktar’ or ‘One Rupee Doctor’ at the hands of TMC hoodlums in Santiniketan. The bust of Padma Shri awardee Dr Sushovan Bandopadhyay has been smeared with ink by the same goons who vandalized Rabindranath Tagore’s Visva Bharati campus…” tweeted Amit Malviya, head of the BJP’s national informational and technology cell. The tweet was shared by the state BJP. In Kolkata, BJP’s youth wing workers led by state president and Lok Sabha member Saumitra Khan staged a demonstration and courted arrest. In its police complaint lodged on Monday night, the university, which later demanded a CBI probe, named Naresh Bauri, a resident of Bolpur and TMC MLA from the district’s Dubrajpur constituency. Other than Bauri, three other TMC leaders were also named as accused. On Wednesday, Visva Bharati authorities called off the proposed 12-hour fast it wanted to hold in protest against Monday’s vandalism. The university issued a statement saying its officials can attend a meeting convened by the administration if it is held on campus. The statement also said that the university wants to guard the fair ground with a four-feet-high fence and a three-feet-high grill above it “in consonance with the aesthetics of the campus and with ecological concerns”. “The purpose of the Poush Mela ground fence is to halt the entry of miscreants who come to the mela ground to engage in defiant and dangerous activities,” said the statement which added that after dark the ground becomes a haven for drug addicts, alcoholics and sex workers. Mamata Banerjee on Monday disapproved of the wall and said, “I do not want any construction that destroys the beauty of Visva Bharati. When Rabindranath Tagore built Visva Bharati he wanted students to be in the heart of nature and study in the open. He did not want wood and cement structures.” In a tweet, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said on Wednesday night that the vice-chancellor informed that his personal security guard provided by the state had been withdrawn from duty. “VC Visva Bharati has intimated “my personal body guard, given by state government has suddenly been withdrawn. On 17/08, four body guards, stationed in VC office, were withdrawn. I find it inappropriate. Urged @MamataOfficial to take appropriate steps and provide security,” tweeted Dhankhar. In a statement issued on Tuesday night, the university alleged that the police did not take any steps to stop the vandalism although information was sent to the district magistrate, superintendent of police, the state chief secretary, home secretary and personal secretary to the chief minister. The statement said that the teachers and staff were feeling unsafe and anticipated threats to their lives. The district police started a suo motu case on Monday afternoon after the chief minister intervened. Eight people were arrested for the vandalism. They were produced before the Suri court on Tuesday afternoon and sent to police custody. District police officers in their complaint said that the Visva Bharati authorities stated that the crowd went on a rampage when construction workers were in the process of setting up a fence. The complaint said that guarding the open ground was necessary to protect the environment as ordered by the National Green Tribunal in 2017. The traders have also lodged a police complaint against the vice-chancellor. Visva Bharati has said the allegations are false and they must be withdrawn to make the staff members feel safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/visva-bharati-officials-skip-state-meet-padma-shri-awardee-doctor-s-bust-vandalized-in-birbhum/story-pNuB3LfKJk1W3A24g8GZqO.html
20-08-2020||India||One of 3 students finds online classes difficult: NCERT survey||More than one in every three students find online classes difficult or burdensome, with most students facing problems in understanding mathematical concepts, a survey by the National Council for Education Research and Training (NCERT) has found.Poor internet connectivity, disruption in electric supply and non-availability of devices, such as laptops and mobile phones, are among the major hindrances hampering online learning, as per the survey, which is the most comprehensive such study by the Centre. It also showed that mobile phones are the primary means through which students are accessing online classes.The NCERT surveyed students and teachers of the education ministry-run Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs), Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (NVS) and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) schools to understand the effectiveness of online learning measures.According to the NCERT’s survey of KVs, comprising 9,000 responses, 6% of the students found online classes burdensome, while 24% found them difficult. The rest termed the classes satisfactory or joyful.Among teachers and principals, 1% found the classes burdensome, over 10% difficult, while a majority found them satisfactory. Nearly 30% of over 6,000 parents surveyed felt the online mode burdensome or difficult, while the rest gave a positive response.Among the JNVs too, 28% of the over 4,000 students surveyed found the classes either burdensome or difficult, while the rest said responded with satisfactory or joyful.Among the 4,800-odd CBSE school students surveyed, 12% found online classes burdensome while 26% found them difficult. Nearly 35% of the 3,939 parents too felt the online mode was either a burden or difficult, while the others gave a positive result. The major problems that came to fore were poor internet, difficulty in accessing content on phones, lack of knowledge in using devices for learning, untrained teachers and erratic power supply. Approximately 27% of the students mentioned the non-availability of smartphones and laptops, as per the survey.After maths, science was the most difficult to grasp online, while around 17% of the students had difficulty in learning languages.The survey, part of Education ministry’s Student Learning Enhancement Guidelines, recommended that students not having gadgets can be paired with others in their neighbourhood. Printed study materials may be provided at their homes through postal services or by the teachers. The government should provide electronic or technological gadgets to the students who do not possess the amenities for online classes. It has also recommended community mobile banks where people can donate old but functional mobile phones. Help may be taken from governments, charity organisations, companies under CSR and alumni for obtaining smartphones. Mobile classes may be conducted for such students.Most states are planning to create a system to ensure that textbooks are delivered to students so that their learning is not obstructed due to the pandemic, the report said.It also suggested that states undertake a school-wise and student-wise survey to map the digital devices accessibility for each child.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-of-3-students-finds-online-classes-trying-ncert-survey/story-d0ZhS6OWChY2EcL1gUVNCM.html
20-08-2020||India||11 days account for 80% of Delhi’s monsoon rainfall this year||Between 8:30am and 5:30pm on Wednesday, Delhi’s five weather stations -- Safdarjung (32mm), Palam (49mm), Lodhi Road (25mm), Ridge (43mm) and Ayanagar (66mm); received an average of 43 mm of rain. The rainfall was the highest in this monsoon season at the Ayanagar station. Safdarjung (68mm), Palam (81mm)and Lodhi road (72mm) recorded the maximum rainfall on July 23, while Ridge (86mm) experienced its highest rainfall so far on July 21. Wednesday’s rain, apart from causing traffic jams around the city, and water logging in many parts, is likely to skew an interesting trend a bit more: An HT analysis of the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) gridded dataset up to August 18 shows that Delhi received 80% of its total monsoon rain till Tuesday in just 11 days. The gridded database works with a one day time lag. So, rainfall after 8:30am on August 19 will reflect in the data only on August 20. This is in keeping with a trend that has become evident even at the national level -- an uneven distribution of the monsoon rainfall, with lots of rain falling on a few days. Also read: Drained of all hope, NCR cities left to sink or swimKeeping August 19 aside, just four days -- August 13, July 19, July 5 and July 23 -- account for almost half of the monsoon rain this year in the capital. And 19.4% of Delhi’s total monsoon rainfall (till Tuesday) happened on August 13. Once rainfall numbers for August 19 become available, the rainfall distribution might become even more skewed. This data will be available only on Thursday.The station-wise data cannot be compared with the data in this analysis because the gridded data set calculates average rainfall for Delhi in its entirety, spread over two grids of 0.25 degrees longitude and latitude each, and is not a simple average of the rainfall at individual stations.Also read: Why Noida handles rain better than GurugramSee Chart 1: Share on total monsoon rainfall this year in descending order IMD counts the period from June 1 to September 30 as the monsoon season. This year, 50 days since June 1 have seen rains in Delhi. Due to these recent spells of rain, Delhi’s cumulative rainfall deficit is now within the normal range, according to IMD’s rainfall statistics for August 18. The cumulative monsoon rainfall deficit in Delhi on August 18 was 14%. A departure from the longer period average of -19% to 19% is considered normal. See Chart 2: Delhi’s rainfall deficit An analysis of IMD’s gridded rainfall data set shows cumulative rainfall deficit in Delhi has been moving towards the normal range as the monsoon season has progressed. Delhi is approximated by two grids in the gridded data set. A grid is a box bound by two latitudes and longitudes 0.25 degrees apart. The cumulative rainfall deficit was largely in the 30% to 50% range from mid-June to the end of July. In August, the deficit has stayed more in the 20% to 30% range. This will come down after Wednesday’s rainfall statistics are published. To be sure, before June 15, Delhi was less rain deficient than it is now. However, there was a long gap after the early monsoon rains and rainfall picking up again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-days-account-for-80-of-delhi-s-monsoon-rainfall-this-year/story-7J8PREKz57eGgR9JdRmvMK.html
20-08-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccine may need ‘emergency authorisation’||Indian authorities told lawmakers on Wednesday that they are keeping open the option of an “emergency authorization” of vaccines that are undergoing clinical trials for use. At a marathon meeting of the parliament’s home affairs panel, top officials from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) also informed MPs that phase 3 trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine—widely considered as the global front runner—will start from this weekend with about 1,700 volunteers across 17 locations in India. Director General of ICMR, Dr Balaram Bhargava, told the panel that phase 3 trials normally require at least 6 to 9 months. “But looking at the immediacy, the government can always go for emergency authorisation,” an official aware of the discussions quoted Bhargava as saying. Earlier, the Serum Institute of India -- which has partnered with AstraZeneca for production and trials, hinted about a shorter timeline and seeking emergency use authorisation. The panel also discussed the psychological stress arising out of the long-drawn battle against Covid, especially among children. AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria told the panel that the institute will soon come up with a protocol for hospitals and other institutions on the issue.

While informal discussions on the vaccine administration started last month, the panel first met on Monday to discuss a procurement deal for a Covid-19 vaccine, asking officials of five pharma firms, including three that have candidates in clinical trials, to present a road map within three days of how soon they can produce large quantities and what pricing they expect if their shot is approved. Explainer: World Health Organization’s struggle for a global Covid-19 vaccine planIndian authorities are waiting for disclosure of health and efficacy data of the Russian vaccine, which became the first to be approved anywhere in the world, although scientists have flagged concerns over the lack of scientific data. For now, officials are looking at the AstraZeneca candidate as well as the one by United States’s Moderna, which at present have the largest number of people in clinical trials.

20-08-2020||India||Rapid test reliance may slow Covid-19 fight||Testing for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi has become heavily reliant on antigen tests, which experts say are not as reliable as RT-PCR tests and end up skewing crucial data that could hamper the city’s fight to contain the virus. At least seven of every 10 tests conducted is an antigen test.A high dependence on antigen tests, which throw up more false negatives (they identify infected people as uninfected), leads to two major problems – under-detection of cases, and tilting data metrics such as positivity rate and case distribution.  There has been a slow rise in daily cases in Delhi over the past three weeks -- from a weekly average of 997 daily in late July to a current weekly average of 1091 daily cases. And while the positivity rate is well off its June peaks of 30%-plus, it has risen from around 5.7% in late July to around 6.6% now. On Wednesday, Delhi registered 1,398 cases. To be sure, the situation in the Capital is far better than it was -- and also among the best in the country (especially in a large urban area). Also read: Covid-19 vaccine may need ‘emergency authorisation’Across the country, Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests, considered by experts and authorities as the “gold-standard” for tests, remain the preferred method of testing accounting for nearly 60% of samples tested in the 15-day period between August 2 and August 15, according to an HT analysis.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The biggest advantage of antigen tests is that they provide results within the hour and are relatively cheap. These kits are designed to detect antigens (substances in human bodies that stimulate an immune response) and can be performed in mobile stations and don’t necessarily need labs. But the downside is that they have a far higher chance of returning false negatives , and thus can let cases slide under the radar. When time is a constraint , and test results are needed almost in real-time, there is nothing as good as an antigen test although rapid molecular tests such as RT-PCR ones are being developed. The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most definitive test available. It is used for the detection of nucleic acid from Sars-CoV2 and is based on PCR, a process that duplicates and amplifies genetic fragments of the virus, so that these become easily detectable. The downside is that the process, from sample collection to results, for these can generally take 24-48 hours and needs dedicated machines. Add the logistical delays and tests could take three to four days. In the US, in some states, they were taking 8-12 days. Also read: Oxford Covid-19 vaccine could be the first to be available to Indians: 5 key developmentsDelhi’s big turnaround, in early July, was achieved on the back of a sharp increase in testing, and rapid antigen tests played a role in that. The tests were justified then because causes were rising exponentially, especially in containment zones, and there was a need to test people quickly, and isolate them. Delhi also did the smart thing of asking people with mild infections to stay at home instead of admitting themselves to hospitals -- and using up valuable hospital bed inventory.The Delhi government insists that it has relied on antigen tests only to increase testing in the Capital due to limitations on scaling-up of RT-PCR tests. Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, in an interview to HT on July 1 said: “This is the benefit of rapid testing — you can do it at a large scale. You cannot scale up RT-PCR to that level.” Delhi started scaling up the tests mid-June. In the first week of June, Delhi was testing 5,500 samples a day, nearly all RT-PCR. By early August, this number had jumped to nearly 20,000, but with a far larger scale of antigen testing.Explainer: World Health Organization’s struggle for a global Covid-19 vaccine planWhile this strategy was important for the Capital at the time when cases were rising and containment zones increasing, moving away from it is equally important in order to get a true understanding of the spread of the virus in the city and identifying the best way to eradicate it.On July 28, Delhi high court questioned the state government over its decision to heavily employ antigen tests to ramp up its testing. The HC said that the Delhi government was only conducting only 6,000 RT-PCR tests daily when it has the capacity to carry out 11,000.For the 15-day period between August 2 and August 17, HT analysed testing data from the 13 states, which (officially or unofficially) released antigen breakup of testing numbers, in order to analyse the growing role of rapid tests in the country. In Delhi, 70.2% of all tests conducted were antigen-based tests. Odisha was the only state that had a higher proportion of antigen tests: 75%. More worrying than this percentage was that the average number of RT-PCR tests conducted in this period has remained at around 5,000 in Delhi despite the 11,000 capacity. At its peak, Delhi conducted 9,619 RT-PCR tests on June 29, but instead of scaling that up, it has scaled down. “The tests in Delhi are being conducted strictly as per ICMR guidelines. The RT-PCR tests are demand-based and readily available at all flu clinics, labs and in all hospitals. Anyone who has corona-like symptoms can visit any of these centres and easily get an RT-PCR test done. Not a single instance has been reported where a person who wants to get an RT-PCR test done has been unable to do so. Earlier, when the cases were high more people were visiting these centers to get themselves tested. Now since the number of cases has significantly dipped in Delhi the number of RT-PCR tests has also fallen down accordingly,” the chief minister’s office said in a statement on Wednesday.“In the case of antigen tests, the government is going to the people with antigen kits for testing them. The government has created testing facilities within localities, schools, dispensaries etc. where it is encouraging people to get the rapid test done. The ICMR protocol mandates rapid tests to be done within smaller localities. This is a uniform protocol followed not only by Delhi but also by all the states. And like in the case of RT-PCR tests, the absolute number of antigen tests have also declined since the number of Covid cases has significantly dipped in Delhi. The ICMR guidelines also mandates that if anyone tests negative for antigen testing but is showing symptoms, the person should go through an RT-PCR test. This is strictly being followed in 100% cases,” the statement added.Concerns about relying heavily on antigen tests have been flagged by experts. “Due to the fact that antigen tests have a relatively higher chance of false negatives, it is crucial that repeat RT-PCR tests are done. This is something I don’t suspect is being done regularly, especially if we look at the proportion of antigen tests in some states,” cautioned Dr T Jacob John, former professor of virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.His reference is to what experts globally as well as ICMR recommend -- following up antigen tests with RT-PCR ones. This newspaper suggested another alternative in a column -- two antigen tests, using the same or different kits, conducted on two samples from subjects simultaneously, with those whose test results showed a discrepancy being asked to go for a RT-PCR test. Interestingly, some other heavy testing states on this list such as Tamil Nadu that have a near-zero reliance on antigen tests. As of Tuesday, Delhi (1,337,374 total tests) remains one of the regions with the highest testing rates with over 67,000 samples tested per million population, against the national average of 23,800. Tamil Nadu not only has a higher total number of tests (3,845,803) but is also close on tests per million — over 50,000. Not one of these tests is antigen. Another state, Rajasthan, has also used only RT-PCR tests. It has conducted over 25,000 tests per million of its population. According to ICMR’s June 14 “Advisory on Use of Rapid Antigen Detection Test for Covid-19”, the sensitivity (or the ability to detect true positives) of antigen tests ranged from 50.6% to 84%. This means that as many as half of the “negatives” given by antigen tests may be incorrect. This is why US’s drug regulator FDA says that antigen tests “cannot definitively rule out active coronavirus infection. Antigen tests are more likely to miss an active coronavirus infection”. Experts caution that heavy reliance on antigen tests can end up heavily skewing crucial Covid-19 data points such as positivity rate. “If we see a drop in case numbers today, we will not know for sure if that is because the epidemic is plateauing, or just because we are now using antigen testing. I’m not saying that this is the case; I’m worried that we may not know if it that was really happening. We won’t know what the real situation is,” said Dr Satyajit Rath, retired scientist, National Institute of Immunology.This means that in the case of heavy antigen-testing regions like Delhi, despite the absolute number of tests increasing, due to the relatively high chance of false negatives with antigen tests there may be cases that are being missed. As a result, there is a chance that the impression that the region appears to be testing widely and has cases under control may end up being incorrect.“To muddy these waters even further, the RT-PCR versus antigen testing numbers and proportions are not uniform within a state as well. In a state, it’s not as if all districts are using a same proportion of antigen tests. And because not only are all districts unequally hit, they are being tested differently, we can’t even compare the numbers from two districts because we don’t know how skewed the numbers are because of the varying proportions of antigen and RT-PCR tests,” Rath added.“In an ideal situation, all antigen-negative results would be rechecked with RT-PCR tests. But if that is the ideal situation, most samples would go back for RT-PCR tests. Then why are we using antigen tests to begin with?” Rath asked.ICMR’s guidelines says symptomatic people whose antigen tests turn up negative should be tested using RT-PCR, but it isn’t clear if that is happening. But there’s a bigger problem: many of those infected are asymptomatic.(With inputs from Sweta Goswami)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapid-test-reliance-may-slow-covid-fight/story-zlYJnYBVbI9zXa7R97WjgK.html

20-08-2020||India||Loan recovery agents hijack bus with 34 on board||The curious case of the bus that disappeared (or was hijacked) played out across Uttar Pradesh for around seven hours on Wednesday before ending safely around noon — the bus was found; no passengers were injured in the drama, and even the driver and the conductor were fine — but with many unanswered questions. The bus was owned by Kalpana Travel agency, which, in turn, was owned by Ashok Arora, a resident of Gwalior, who, as it turns out, died on Monday due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Which leads to the first question: Did his death have anything to do with what happened to the bus?The bus, with 34 passengers left Gurugram for Panna in Madhya Pradesh at 3.20 pm on Tuesday. It entered Uttar Pradesh late in the evening.  And then it gets confusing.At around 10.30 pm, between Mathura and Agra, the bus was stopped, according to one account. Superintendent of police (West), Agra Rural, Ravi Kumar said that two vehicles blocked the bus; the driver, conductor and cleaner were deboarded, and a person from one of the cars that stopped the bus started driving the bus, with the passengers still on board towards Agra. A passenger, Dharmendra Chaturvedi, gave a slightly different version. According to him, he were asked by the conductor to alight and board a different bus at Agra. He mentioned that there seemed to be an altercation but added that this seemed to involve only the conductor and the driver and some other people (who had not been on the bus) and that the passengers were not involved. The driver of the bus , Ramesh Kumar, a resident of Dabra town in Gwalior district, gave a very different version: “About nine people were following the bus in two SUVs. When the bus reached Etawah toll plaza at about 2.30 am those in the SUVs intercepted the bus and told us that they were from a finance company. They gave ~300 each to me and the conductor of the bus and asked us to get down. They drove away in the bus .” He added that he “later came to know” that the passengers were asked to deboard at Mauranipur in Jhansi district (Uttar Pradesh).All of which leads to the second and third questions: what time did the incident happen? And were the passengers on the bus or off it when it was hijacked? As for the driver, conductor and clear, according to SP Ravi Kumar, they were bundled in a car, driven through the night across various parts of Agra and finally dropped off at “Kuberpur in Agra rural”. He added that the “ accused returned the mobile phones and cash with conductor and driver” but not the ticket takings. The driver and helper of bus finally reached Malpura police station at about 5.30 am on Wednesday and narrated the story to the police. It wasn’t immediately clear why they did not use their mobile phones to make a call. The police swung into action when the news broke; the chief minister of the state, Yogi Adityanath, himself is believed to have taken an interest because the crime was initially seen as a hijacking — and it wasn’t clear that the pasengers were safe. The police of many districts went into high alert. They found the bus abandoned around noon near a dhaba in Etawah, just around 120 km from Agra. The initial theory of the police was that this could be a case of repossession gone wrong involving a finance company . That’s the message that was relayed to Madhya Pradesh Police too. “Chhatarpur Police got information from Agra Police that a bus had been hijacked near a toll plaza between Agra and Mathura by a finance company. Passengers were made to board another bus and then the first bus which belongs to one Kalpana Travels was forcibly taken somewhere else,” said superintendent of police, Chhatarpur, Sachin Sharma.But when they checked with the finance company, it denied all knowledge of the incident, according to the superintendent of police in Gwalior, Amit Sanghi. Meanwhile, the UP Police caught a lucky break when the family of Ashok Arora identified one of the hijackers from CCTV footage at the toll plaza. His name was Pradeep Gupta. A moneylender, Gupta is believed to have had some dispute with Arora (it wasn’t clear whether he had loaned Arora money). “Required legal action will be taken after initial investigations; the name of Pradeep Gupta has surfaced for being involved in the hijacking. Police is searching for him,” added Kumar. But what of the passengers? According to Dharmendra Chaturvedi, they shifted buses at Agra (when the incident happened), then Gwalior, then Jhansi, and finally reached their destination. He mentioned that at each location, they were directed to get onto a different bus. It wasn’t immediately clear who organised the remaining part of their journey, or whether their ticket money was refunded to them and they were asked to find their way home. Chhatarpur SP Sharma added that all the passengers were safe (and were screened for Covid-19 on arrival).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/loan-recovery-agents-hijack-bus-with-34-on-board/story-Ngh25Y5Gp01GRkXba1VG5O.html
20-08-2020||India||Drained of all hope, NCR cities left to sink or swim||Roads turned into lakes, homes were flooded, walls fell, and a sea of traffic was marooned in several parts of the national capital region (NCR) on Wednesday after heavy rains exposed, yet again, the fragile state of the civic infrastructure and the lack of preparedness for a season that exposes such flaws every year.The flooding was particularly severe in Gurugram, where underpasses in some of the city’s most upscale neighbourhoods resembled a river, forcing at least two motorists to escape from their drowning cars and swim to safety, and rafts to be deployed. In Delhi, traffic backed up for several kilometres on arterial stretches on the Ring Road – especially at Ashram, Dhaula Kuan and near AIIMS – while access roads to the airport accumulated waist-deep waters. In several parts of the town, the water logging disabled cars and buses that exacerbated the jams.“Portions of roads were completely submerged in water, which slowed down vehicular movement on arterial stretches. Our officials were stationed to direct traffic, but in many areas, the situation was quite bad,” said a senior Delhi traffic police official, asking not to be named. The flooding also affected people who were at home. In residential colonies such as Krishna Nagar, Amar Colony, Model Town, Prem Nagar in Kirari, Sant Nagar and Laxmi Vihar in Burari, water entered the ground floor of several homes.“It doesn’t look like we are living in the Capital. Every year we have to experience this pain of water logging. It’s been raining since morning and the streets of colonies are completely submerged in water. It’s because of choked drains and sewer lines. Agencies keep blaming each other but it’s the public that suffers,” said BS Vohra, a resident of Krishna Nagar and the president, East Delhi RWAs Joint Front.Civic bodies reported uprooted trees in a several areas and seven cars were damaged after the boundary wall of a school in the Saket’s J block collapsed. The Minto Road under-bridge, which has become a symbol of the Delhi’s vulnerability to rain, however, had unexpectedly little water.The trigger for the chaos was 43mm of rain (average across five stations) that poured on Delhi between 8.30am and 5.30pm. Gurugram recorded 118mm of rain, close to 20% of the precipitation seen on an average in an entire year. Rainfall recorded below 15mm is considered light, 15-64.5mm is moderate and above 64.5mm is heavy.Weather officials said the rains are being caused by two low pressure bands over northwest and central India: the first is the monsoon trough, and the second due to cyclonic circulations over Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. “A low pressure area has formed and the monsoon trough is also near its normal position. A lot of rain is expected over central and NW India because of these two conditions,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD.Moderate to heavy rain is likely in NCR on Thursday. Central India may get similar conditions for 3-4 days. For Delhi, Wednesday’s rain is likely to make up for the 14% cumulative rainfall deficit this season.The national capital, however, fared better than its neighbour. In addition to the Golf Course Road underpasses (they are a network of three), four others – two each in Cyber City and along the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway – were flooded and had to be closed for traffic.In an interview to HT during the monsoon in 2019, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said Gurugram’s monsoon flooding problem had “been taken care of”. “All underpasses have been completed. The drainage system has been upgraded in areas that were waterlogged last time and led to Gurugram being branded as ‘Gurujam’. To further mitigate the problem, we will be building check dams in the surrounding Aravalli hills and create artificial lakes. That will not only stop the rush of rainwater to Gurugram but also recharge the groundwater. The plan is to develop some of the lakes as tourist gardens,” he saidMunicipal Corporation of Gurugram chief engineer Raman Sharma said the level of rainwater at Najafgarh drain was “extremely high”, and, as a result, a large portion of Gurugram’s main drain -- the Badshahpur drain -- flowed back on to the roads, leaving the city without any storm water outlet.“The volume of rain was much higher than usual as a result of which there was severe waterlogging across the city. We initiated combating measures as soon as rains started and in most parts of the city, and by 6pm, barring low-lying areas, rainwater was cleared. More than 150 GMDA (Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority) and MCG officials are still on-ground and efforts are ongoing for clearing rainwater from remaining areas by midnight,” said Sharma.One person, who misjudged the amount of water as he drove into the underpass along the Golf Course Road in his Hyundai hatchback, said he got out as the vehicle began drowning. “When I reached the middle of the underpass, I found myself submerged in water. The engine stopped, the brakes stopped working and I feared the automatic system might get stuck, so I immediately rushed out of the car and had to swim to cross the stretch,” said Amit Kumar, a resident of MG Road. “We started drainage operations around 11am. The underpasses at IFFCO Chowk, Cyberhub, Genpact Chowk were cleared by 4pm while the underpass at Rajiv Chowk was cleared by 5pm. The underpass at Bristol Chowk we are aiming to clear by 7pm. At the underpass in DLF Phase 1, the level of rainwater is extremely high. More than 5 crore kilolitres of rainwater has accumulated and it may take us till tomorrow to clear it,” said Satyawan Samriwal, the assistant divisional fire official in Gurugram.With Covid-19 having forced most office-goers, particularly in the IT hub of Gurugram, to work from home, people said the chaos wrought by the rains may have led to scenes similar to what is now known as the Guru-jam of 2016. Heavy rain drowned several main intersections and arterial roads at the time, stranding commuters for as long as 20 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drained-of-all-hope-ncr-cities-left-to-sink-or-swim/story-1WCm9UvwDgfAEYSPUVEodM.html
20-08-2020||India||Minister, 3 legislators test Covid-19 positive ahead of monsoon session||With the state legislature’s monsoon session set to begin today under the shadow of Covid-19, a minister and three legislators tested positive for the coronavirus disease on Wednesday.The minister of state for medium and small-scale Industries Chaudhary Udaybhan Singh tested positive for Covid-19 during the mandatory ahead of the Vidhan Sabha session.Chief medical officer of Lucknow, Dr RP Singh, said, “The minister has been admitted to Rajdhani Covid Hospital at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, where a team of doctors is taking care of him.”Members of legislative assembly (MLA) Tejpal Nagar and Sanju Devi, and an MLC, Parvez Ali, also tested positive according to Vidhan Sabha officials.The latest development comes in the backdrop of major opposition parties demanding a debate on the pandemic, besides the law and order situation, during the monsoon session.“Yes, a discussion on Covid-19 and the law and order situation is the need of the hour. The state government did not concede our demand for a debate on the issue when the first few cases of Covid-19 were reported. It has convened the House to serve its own interest and get some bills passed. We will raise these issues as the situation has worsened,” said the leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary, following an all-party meeting convened by speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit on Wednesday to seek their cooperation for smooth proceedings.Chaudhary did not attend the all-party meeting and will keep away from the session. Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Narendra Verma represented him at the meeting.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath and minister for parliamentary affairs, Suresh Khanna, represented the government at the meeting. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Lalji Verma, Congress leader Aradhana Mishra, Apna Dal (Sone Lal) leader Neel Ratan Patel and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) leader Om Prakash Rajbhar attended the meeting.Verma and Mishra echoed similar sentiments, saying that their parties would demand a debate on Covid-19 and the law and order situation, besides raising the problems of farmers and the flood fury.The chief minister said the monsoon session, which was convened during the pandemic to meet the constitutional responsibility of holding House sittings within six months of the last, would provide an occasion for debate.During the three-day session, the state government also proposes to get bills passed to replace 17 ordinances promulgated after the last session, besides a few others. The state government is likely to present the first supplementary demand of grants for 2020-2021 during the session. On the first day, the House will be adjourned after paying homage to former Madhya Pradesh governor Lalji Tandon, two ministers Kamla Rani Varun and Chetan Chauhan, along with its two sitting members Virendra Singh Sirohi and Paras Nath Yadav.Earlier, Dikshit said members in the 60 plus age group or women, who may not be able to attend the session, would not be considered absent and requested leaders to convey this message to their members. He said the UP legislature was the first legislature in the country to hold its session during the pandemic, as those in other states, such as Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, had held meetings for a motion of confidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/minister-3-legislators-test-covid-positive-ahead-of-monsoon-session/story-9mCsOFkUQj09WvUfun8EWN.html
20-08-2020||India||Facebook row intensifies as Tharoor, BJP’s Dubey move breach of privilege notice against each other||The row in the parliamentary panel on Information and Technology over seeking an explanation from Facebook intensified on Wednesday with Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and BJP MP Nishikant Dubey moving breach of privilege notices against each other. The chairperson of the panel, the Congress’ Shashi Tharoor on Wednesday wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla that the”disparaging remarks” made by Dubey were a ”breach of his privilege as an MP”. “To claim that the Chairman has acted in excess of his authority to convene a meeting on a pre-approved agenda, and has proceeded without seeking the necessary approvals, is tantamount to contempt of the due procedure followed by the House,” Tharoor wrote in his letter. Dubey, meanwhile, shot off his own letter, arguing that Tharoor is in a “serious breach of privilege“ and was using the parliamentary committee platform to tarnish the BJP’s image. He accused Tharoor of sensationalizing a small incident, referring to a Wall Street Journal report that said that Facebook’s top lobbyist in India prevented the company from taking action for hate speech against a member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. The report has created a controversy, with the Congress and the BJP trading allegations -- each claiming that Facebook is a tool of the other. Interestingly, Dubey has also sought a privilege motion against Rahul Gandhi. “By levelling… unsubstantiated allegations against all the Members of Parliament, Lok Sabha, who belong to BJP, he (Gandhi) has also lowered the dignity of all such Members of Parliament and infringed upon their Parliamentary Privileges… ,: he wrote. The letters to the speaker, seen by Hindustan Times, come on the heels of a split in the IT Parliamentary panel over asking Facebook to explain reports of alleged bias . A member of the IT Panel, Dubey took to Twitter on August 17 to claim Tharoor, as chairperson of the Standing Committee “ does not have the authority to do anything without discussion of the agenda with its members”. “He (Tharoor) can not think that the Parliament is an extension of the Congress party,” Dubey told Hindustan Times. “We cannot discuss a subject just because Rahul Gandhi has tweeted about it.” According to Parliamentary rules, “if any individual or authority violates or disregards any of the privileges, powers and immunities of the House or members or committees thereof, he may be punished for “breach of privilege” or “contempt of the House”. The House has the power to determine as to what constitutes breach of privilege and contempt. The penal jurisdiction of the House in this regard covers its members as well as strangers and every act of violation of privileges, whether committed in the immediate presence of the House or outside of it.” Moreover, a person found guilty of breach of privilege or contempt of the House “may be punished either by imprisonment, or by admonition (warning), or reprimand. Two other punishments may also be awarded to the members for contempt, namely, ‘suspension’ and ‘expulsion’ from the House”. But according to former Lok Sabha secretary-general PDT Achary, neither Tharoor, nor Dubey have grounds for breach of privilege. “Neither of the two MPs have a case,” Achary told Hindustan Times. Achary added that the procedure is that after a case of breach of privilege comes to light, the Speaker decides whether or not to forward it to the Privileges Committee. “If the Speaker forwards it, then there is a prima facie case but in this instance, I doubt the Speaker will send these forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-row-intensifies-as-tharoor-bjp-s-dubey-move-breach-of-privilege-notice-against-each-othe/story-rhmmwt2KpxXAISBre50PDN.html

20-08-2020||India||NGT orders 46.11 sq km to be notified as private forest in Goa||The Goa Foundation had filed a petition in the National Green Tribunal alleging that the state was dragging its feet on demarcating private forests in the state according to the directives of the Supreme Court.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Goa government to finally notify an area of 46.11 square kilometres as ‘private forest’, bringing to close a more than two-decade old issue in which various committees were set up seeking to include or exclude plots as private forests in Goa. In an order issued on a petition filed by the Goa Foundation, the NGT bench of Justice Sheo Kumar Singh and Satyawan Singh Garbyal, expert member, directed that the “41.20 sq km area demarcated by Forest Department and 4.91 sq km identified by the Sharma Committee totalling 46.11 sq km be confirmed and accepted as private forest.”“The Chief Secretary of State Government of Goa is directed to notify the same and make suitable entries in the Revenue records in accordance with rules immediately as soon as possible,” the NGT said. Privately held lands that have a tree canopy/crown density of 0.4 and above, are spread across 5 ha or more and are contiguous with or near to existing protected forests and have more than 75% of the trees of forest species are to be earmarked as private forests, read the order.The issue dates back to January 1997 when the Goa government set up the Sawant Committee comprising forest officials and other experts, pursuant to the directions of the Supreme Court which had directed that private lands that met the criteria of forests be declared as such and be protected. The apex court had directed each state government constitute an expert committee to Identify areas which are “forests”, irrespective of whether they are so notified, recognised or classified under any law, and irrespective of the ownership of the land of such forest; identify areas which were earlier forest but stand degraded, denuded or cleared; and Identify areas covered by plantation trees belonging to the government and those belonging to private persons.”Goa’s Sawant committee submitted its report in 1999. However, next year, the state government, allegedly under pressure from “certain lobbies and vested interests”, set up the Karapurkar committee, a decision which was challenged in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court restrained the Karapurkar Committee or any other person or agency from interfering with the Sawant Committee’s report, but could add to the area if it thought fit. A total of 67 sq km was identified by both these committees. However noting that the total 67 square km of land so identified was an “approximation” carried out without “actual ground verification to determine the extent of private forests”, the Goa bench of Bombay High Court directed the state government to demarcate the non-forest areas from forest areas on the basis of Sawant and Karapurkar Committee reports.The Goa Forest Department then carried out the exercise of demarcation after ground verification and after five years, the final report of demarcation was submitted to the High Court in 2008. As per this demarcation report, the actual surveyed and demarcated private forest area came out to be 41.20 sq km. This report, too, was challenged in the High Court which prompted the state government to set up another committee known as the Sharma Review committee which filed its report recently.The Sharma committee found that an additional area of 4.91 sq km has been found to be qualifying all three private forest criteria. “Therefore out of total 67.12 sq km referred area by Sawant and Karapurkar Committee, the Review Committee has identified an area of 46.11 sq km as private forest of Goa,” the report stated. The NGT directed that this 46.11 sq km be finally recognized and notified as private forests in Goa. A report of yet another committee set up by the Goa government called the D’Souza committee was rejected by the NGT. “On perusal of a report of the various Committees i.e, Sawant Committee, Karapurkar Committee, Private Forest Review Committee and Joint Secretary (Revenue) Committee and after the submissions made by the parties at both sides we are of the considered opinion that total of 46.11 sq kms i.e., (41.20 sq km of the forest area demarcated by the Forest Department out of 67.12 sq km identified by Sawant Committee and Karapurkar Committee + 4.91 sq km private forest area identified by the Review Committee) is the private forest area in the State of Goa,” the NGT ruled. The Goa Foundation had filed a petition in the National Green Tribunal alleging that the state was dragging its feet on demarcating private forests in the state according to the directives of the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ngt-orders-46-11-sq-km-to-be-notified-as-private-forest-in-goa/story-JajZyriCQunMJ0lj2seRGI.html
20-08-2020||India||Bengal police raids MP Arjun Singh’s home; BJP calls it vendetta||The West Bengal police on Wednesday afternoon searched the residence of Arjun Singh, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Lok Sabha member from Barrackpore in North 24 Parganas district, in connection with an old case of financial irregularity. A police officer who is part of the investigation and did not want to be named said, “The search was held in connection with alleged financial irregularities to the tune of Rs 11 crore involving the Bhatpara municipality and a local cooperative bank.” Singh was chairman of the Bhatpara municipality from 2010 to 2019. He left the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and joined the BJP in March 2019. He also headed a local cooperative bank’s board. Singh, who was present at home, said, “This is not the first time the police came to raid my house. In the past they did not have any order from court and were not allowed to enter. Today they came with a court order. I am not surprised because it is well known that I am a target of the TMC.” “The Barrackpore police have so far named me in 93 cases. For Mamata Banerjee, I was clean and pure as long as I was in the TMC. Now, that I am in the BJP, I am involved in all sorts of crimes,” said Singh. Recognised as a heavyweight leader, Singh was a four-time legislator of the TMC from Bhatpara before he joined the BJP and defeated TMC’s sitting Barrackpore MP Dinesh Trivedi in 2019. The election was marked by violence which continues intermittently in the region. Singh’s son and brother-in-law are also sitting legislators of the BJP. Also Read: Covid centre built by Congress, CPI (M) in Bengal; BJP has a question for TMCSingh alleged that the police team broke into the house of one of his relatives before coming to his home. “That house is located around 500 metres away from mine. It is under a lock and a key for six months as the family is now in another state. I told the officers that we will move court for this as they did not have any written order to search the premises.” Barrackpore police commissioner Manoj Verma could not be contacted. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh condemned the incident and said Singh was being singled out. “The TMC is being vindictive. The sole job of the Barrackpore police is to target and implicate Arjun Singh,” said Ghosh. On July 17, a police team went to Singh’s home at Bhatpara in search of one of his nephews but was denied entry by Central paramilitary force personnel in charge of Singh’s security as the police officers did not have a search warrant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-police-searches-bjp-mp-arjun-singh-s-house-bjp-calls-it-vendetta/story-xGZyOuP4hLfAoQZ3xfhnYK.html

The bus was later traced near Jhansi. All passengers are safe and have been provided with an alternate bus for their destination, Panna in Madhya Pradesh.“The private bus began its journey on Tuesday evening for Panna in Madhya Pradesh. There were 34 passengers in the bus of whom 13 had to get down at Chhatarpur in Madhya Pradesh while the remaining were to travel to Panna in Madhya Pradesh,” stated SP (West) Agra, rural, Ravi Kumar.Also read: 15-year-old girl found dead in Uttar Pradesh town“The bus had just crossed Mathura when it was stopped by car-borne miscreants on the Southern Bye Pass of Agra. They took the bus in control after forcing the driver, along with the conductor and the helper, to get down,” informed SP Ravi Kumar.“The driver, the conductor and the helper were told to get into the waiting car which moved around Agra. They were later dropped at Kuberpur. The staff of the finance company returned the personal mobile and cash that the conductor and driver were carrying. However, they took the ticket money collected by them from the passengers to return them. All three were also provided food and were not harassed by the staff of the finance company,” he said. Nonetheless, the incident created panic.Driver of the Panna-bound private bus, Ramesh Kumar, said, “About nine people were following the bus in two SUVs. When the bus reached near Etawah toll plaza at about 2.30 am, those in the SUVs intercepted the bus and told us that they were from a finance company.

They later drove the bus away.” Kumar, a resident of Dabra town in Gwalior district, added, “I later came to know that those who took the bus with them asked the passengers to get down from the bus at Mauranipur in Jhansi district (Uttar Pradesh).” Superintendent of Police, Gwalior Amit Sanghi said, “We have inquired with the private finance company whose name was mentioned by the alleged hijackers but the company said none of its employees was involved in the entire episode and that they were not aware of the incident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bus-carrying-34-passengers-allegedly-hijacked-by-finance-company-in-agra/story-zvBZSgEzPootIsLM7xI2eI.html
20-08-2020||Editorials||What Delhi sero survey means | HT Editorial||Delhi’s second serological survey, which was conducted between August 1 and 7 and sampled 15,000 people, found that 29.1% of the city’s residents have developed antibodies against Covid-19. Extrapolating the findings to Delhi’s population would mean that around 5.8 million people in the city have been infected with Sars-CoV-2 at some point. This is a 6.2 percentage point increase from the first sero survey conducted around a month ago, which showed 22.86% people had developed antibodies. This proportion of infected has been extremely varied in the different sero surveys conducted across the country so far. Much of this variation may be because of sample sizes and sampling region within these cities. In Pune (sample size: 1,664), officials found that 51% of people had the antibodies earlier this week. In Mumbai (sample size: 6,936), this number was 40% at the end of July. In Ahmedabad (sample size: 30,054), 17.61% people exhibited seroprevalence at the end of July. Here is the good news. One, the findings show deaths have been lower than feared. As on August 7 (the last day of the sampling), Delhi had 4,082 deaths due to Covid-19. If this is pitted against the estimated 5.8 million infected, the infection fatality rate is 0.07%. Two, herd immunity is around the corner. Scientists say herd immunity occurs when a large proportion of the population contracts an infectious disease and build natural immunity to it. Once a certain percentage becomes immune, the disease starts running out of people to infect, and so the chain of transmission slows down, or halts entirely. With the vaccine still far off, herd immunity offers hope even though scientists remain divided on where this herd immunity threshold exactly lies.Now, the not-so-good news — testing has been woefully inadequate. By the government’s own numbers, there were 142,723 confirmed cases on the day the sero survey ended. But if 5.8 million people had been infected by August 7, then the testing strategy managed to only identify less than 2.5% of those infected. This means that it missed over 5.6 million infections, most of whom were probably asymptomatic. So, while the results show that Delhi is inching closer to herd immunity (and getting there faster than thought), it should also serve as a wake-up call to not let down one’s guard, particularly on the testing front.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/what-delhi-sero-survey-means/story-6yjWZOqf97RUH3g0kAB6sO.html
20-08-2020||Editorials||Unless India invests in green infra, the future of cities is dark and grey | HT Editorial||The National Capital Region, including Delhi and neighbouring districts of Uttar Pradesh, was flooded on Wednesday after a spell of unrelenting and intense rainfall. The millennium city of Gururgram (Haryana) and the National Capital of Delhi were the worst-affected. Entire stretches of roads and underpasses were flooded; homes were inundated; and commuters were caught in traffic snarls that took hours to untangle. The appalling state of affairs showed, yet again, the result of poorly thought-out urban planning and design, weak urban storm water infrastructures, and lack of monsoon preparedness (desilting and unclogging of drains).As episodes of short duration-but intense rainfall increase due to the climate crisis, urban flooding incidents will rise. A 2018 study by the Indian Institute of Technology (Gandhinagar) show that cities face an additional challenge: The urban heat island effect (when a city experiences much warmer temperatures than rural areas due to built up areas), which is modifying the rainfall pattern in these areas. To tackle these challenges, city governments have to rethink the development paradigm. Instead of investing only in inflexible grey infrastructure (drains, pumps, and outfalls), they must invest heavily in flexible green infrastructure (lakes, floodplains or parks, forests), which absorb stormwater, reduce runoff volume and speed, thus, reducing flood risk. Preliminary findings of an ongoing research by WRI-India indicate that 35% (428 sq.km) of new development within 20 km of the city centre (2000-15) in the nation’s 10 top cities — Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Surat — has been on low-lying and high recharge potential zones. Unsurprisingly, these cities have seen multiple flood events in the last five years.India’s cities are its political, economic, and cultural nerve centres. They cannot afford to break down every monsoon; each flood episode leads to losses of lives and livelihood and erodes huge investments. To improve resilience, planners must prioritise water-sensitive urban design and planning, prepare drainage master plans, identify high-risk areas, and invest in green infrastructure. Otherwise, the future of India’s cities, as NCR showed on Wednesday, is dark and bleak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/unless-india-invests-in-green-infra-the-future-of-cities-is-dark-and-grey/story-94ZbpO2B5OOj729awNmwHO.html
20-08-2020||Editorials||Bihar will set a new election paradigm | HT Editorial||The Election Commission (EC) is set to come up with guidelines to hold elections for the Bihar assembly soon. This will be the first major election since the pandemic hit India — there have been polls to Rajya Sabha and legislative council seats, but this involved a limited number of voters. The EC is, according to a report in this newspaper on Wednesday, planning to allow physical rallies, but with limited public presence; permit online filing of nomination forms; allow limited door-to-door campaigning; and reduce the number of people in each polling booth and counting hall. All these measures are legitimate in the context of the pandemic. The EC has done well to have extensive deliberations with all stakeholders, and its guidelines will, in all likelihood, also apply to elections next year in states such as West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and Assam. The real challenge is reconciling two diametrically opposite objectives. The first is ensuring a free-and-fair political contest, where political leaders can relay their messages and voters cannot only access these messages but also convey their concerns and grievances. This, by its very definition, is a mass-based activity. The second is the need to prevent any mass-based activity to keep the spread of the infection under control, and maintain social distancing and follow safety protocols. The fact that Bihar is under-equipped in terms of health infrastructure and has seen disturbing Covid-19 trends makes this even more urgent. The EC has to find a middle way, reconciling principles of safety as well as equal access and democratic rights. But the responsibility lies equally with both political leaders and citizens to participate in polls with great responsibility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/bihar-will-set-a-new-election-paradigm/story-P7OB3x0twKEEuLWYcnTqhL.html
