24-08-2020||News||A tale of the failure of the media, police forces||Sixty-five days after the death of Bollywood star, Sushant Singh Rajput, the Supreme Court on August 19 removed the uncertainty over the outcome of inquiries into the case. Maharashtra and Bihar, which were pitted against each other, were waiting for the verdict with bated breath. Rajput’s family was aggrieved with the Mumbai Police over the slack pace of the probe, while his former partner Rhea Chakraborty and her kin considered the charges levelled against her as fabricated and politically-motivated. The constant barrage of statements from various politicians only added to the confusion. The Supreme Court used its plenary powers to order the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe to ensure justice, in view of the vitiated atmosphere surrounding his death.Indeed, Sushant’s death has raised some uncomfortable issues for India’s democracy. It has also exposed the distortions that exist in every institution, particularly the media, which has flouted every editorial and journalistic norm in its reportage, and police and investigative agencies, which have allowed the politicisation of what should have been a straightforward investigation. For one, there has been a debate on the issue of jurisdiction. Maharashtra laid claim to it because the incident took place in Mumbai, while Bihar argued that the consequences of the incident ensuing in Patna entitled its police to file the first information report (FIR).The Supreme Court decided that the Patna police had the right to register the FIR and investigate, on the basis that criminal breach of trust could take place both in Patna and Mumbai. The decision will have repercussions for the future. FIRs will be filed across the country, in places far from that of the occurrence of crimes, forcing courts to settle the jurisdiction issue.There are issues pertaining to the FIR lodged by Rajput’s father, particularly the silence right after the incident in a statement to Mumbai Police. But this is not to absolve the Mumbai Police. The Mumbai Police system, which is of 1864 vintage, failed to strike the balance between a rigorous, impartial investigation while remaining attuned to the growing attention to the case. Rajput’s death touched a chord in many people. Further, there was huge empathy for Rajput within Bollywood and outside, due to his film contracts allegedly being terminated. And of course, there was the Bihar election and the fact that his death rapidly assumed political overtones in a state starved of film icons. This is not to endorse the popular mood, nor is it to suggest that police investigation should be guided by the popular mood. But an awareness of the wider ecosystem is important because of its implications on a particular case. That is where Mumbai Police faltered. With resentment building up, the case could have been handed over to the crime branch, and an officer from Bihar in the Maharashtra cadre inducted into the team to liaise with Rajput’s family. Regular briefings should have been conducted to allay misgivings, just as it was done in the Sheena Bora case. The police commissioner’s briefing was held in Sushant’s case, but it was a case of too little too late. And the treatment of a Bihar Indian Police Service officer on duty in Mumbai took away whatever support Mumbai Police had in the matter, arousing suspicion and distrust.Some disturbing signals emerge from this case. The first is that of police leadership ceding space to political masters on a purely professional matter of jurisdiction. The Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, intervened to get the FIR filed. The police chiefs of the two states could have resolved this matter among themselves. If the Mumbai Police had responded favourably, the Bihar Police may have forwarded the zero FIR to Mumbai for investigation. The absence of police coordination allowed politicians to air their views on matters which should have been strictly within the police’s domain. Second, television channels played a deeply irresponsible role, undermining the mental health dimension in the case, violating the right to privacy of many individuals, acting as the prosecutor and judge and holding people guilty, besmirching reputations — either because they were motivated by political considerations or commercial considerations or both. Third, new-age policing involves bigger responsibilities for the police. In the Right to Information era, where transparency and accountability are the hallmark of a democracy, people need to be kept informed. And the people’s police must be accountable only to the law. In this case, while one set of police officers was too voluble, another was too reticent. What the public wants in such cases is information based on facts at regular intervals.Last, a case of suicide, irrespective of who it involves,should have triggered a countrywide debate on mental health — and the need to understand the nature of the health challenge, have empathy for those who suffer from it and remove the stigma associated with it, and create a supportive environment for its treatment. India’s public discourse, and institutions mandated to handle such sensitive matters, have fallen short. Sushant Singh Rajput deserves dignity and peace in death, not acrimonious debates or shrill campaigns of calumny and division.Yashovardhan Azad is a former IPS officer and Central Information CommissionerThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/a-tale-of-the-failure-of-the-media-police-forces/story-JZsdNaXpvJmtK3qfaqcBSK.html
24-08-2020||News||Why the international community and UN must embrace Taiwan||In 2020, the world has been hit by an unprecedented public health crisis, with the effects of Covid-19 being felt across every aspect of people’s lives. This year also marks the 75th anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the United Nations (UN). Now more than ever, the global community must make a concerted effort to forge the better and more sustainable future called for by UN and its member-states. Taiwan is ready, willing and able to be a part of these efforts.With less than 500 confirmed cases and seven deaths, Taiwan has defied predictions and successfully contained the pandemic. This has all come in no small part due to Taiwan’s quick response measures, including the establishment of a Central Epidemic Command Centre, the implementation of stringent border controls and quarantine procedures, and transparent information-sharing. And after making sure we had enough supplies to look after our people, we started providing medical equipment and supplies to other countries in serious need. By the end of June, Taiwan had donated 51 million surgical masks, 1.16 million N95 masks, 600,000 isolation gowns, 35,000 forehead thermometers, and other medical material to more than 80 countries, including India, the United States (US), Taiwan’s diplomatic allies, and various European nations. We have also joined forces with like-minded democracies to explore the development of rapid test kits, medicines, and vaccines. Working together for the greater good is how the world will defeat Covid-19.In the Declaration on the Commemoration of the 75th anniversary of UN, governments and heads of States acknowledged that only by working together in solidarity can we end the pandemic and effectively tackle its consequences. They thus pledged to make UN more inclusive and to leave no one behind as the world looks to recover from the pandemic. Similarly, in July, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that networked, inclusive, and effective multilateralism would aid global efforts to promote recovery and the continued implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We could not agree more. However, this vision seems lacking when Taiwan — one of the world’s model democracies and a success story in containing the current pandemic — continues to be barred from taking part in and exchanging experiences and information with UN system. Not having Taiwan’s input in UN is a loss to the global community, and will hamper member-states’ efforts to regain normalcy and implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in full and on time.Even as the pandemic has made the international community aware of Taiwan’s unjust and discriminatory exclusion from the World Health Organization and the UN system, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) continues to press UN to use an erroneous interpretation of the 1971 UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 (XXVI) as the legal basis for blocking Taiwan. The fact is that this resolution does not address the issue of Taiwan’s representation in UN, nor does it state that Taiwan is part of PRC. In fact, Taiwan is not, nor has it ever been, a part of the PRC. Our president and legislature are directly elected by the people of Taiwan. Moreover, border controls instituted during the pandemic offer further evidence to counter PRC’s false claims. UN must recognise that only Taiwan’s democratically-elected government can represent its 23.5 million people; PRC has no right to speak on Taiwan’s behalf.Unfortunately, the 23.5 million people of Taiwan are denied any access to UN premises. Taiwanese journalists and media outlets are also denied accreditation to cover UN meetings. This discriminatory policy stems from the wrongful claims of and pressure from an authoritarian state, and contravenes the principle of universality and equality upon which UN was founded.The UN Charter begins with “We the peoples of the United Nations determined . . . to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights . . . [and] the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small”. The ideal of upholding human rights and fundamental freedoms for all laid out in this text must not remain empty words. As it looks ahead to the next 75 years, it is never too late for the UN to welcome Taiwan’s participation.Dr Jaushieh Joseph Wu is Minister of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China (Taiwan)The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/why-the-international-community-and-un-must-embrace-taiwan/story-FNjLd4WuQph5eYoBMSkRZL.html
24-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram civic bodies to ramp up measures to prevent waterlogging; traffic management plan on the cards||In a meeting held among the officials of Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), the district administration, and the traffic police on Monday several important decisions pertaining to the monsoon preparedness of the city were taken.Officials who took part in the meeting via video conference decided that waterlogging prevention measures would be taken in at least 19 spots across the city, including 11 new spots. Further, a traffic management plan for the monsoon and a long-term drainage regulatory plan will also be prepared, said officials, who took part in the meeting.The meeting comes in the wake of waterlogging the city witnessed after heavy showers on August 19 and 20. Last Friday, a flood control committee was formed comprising officials of GMDA, MCG, private developer DLF, and Haryana Shahri Vikas Prahikaran (HSVP) to ascertain the reasons that led to the waterlogging and submit both short-term and long-term solutions for the same.As per VS Kundu, CEO, GMDA, during a review of last week’s rains, which left seven underpasses and most parts of the city inundated, it was found that eight out of the 35 vulnerable spots, which are prone to waterlogging, had a heavy accumulation of water. Eleven new spots, which were not designated by the civic authorities as being vulnerable to flooding, also had a heavy accumulation of water.“An in-depth review was undertaken regarding last week’s waterlogging. However, the review was done only at an administrative level. For an examination of the technical aspects, we have already formed a flood control committee, comprising various engineers, who are looking into the matter. Prior to the monsoon, 35 critical waterlogging spots were identified, out of which we were able to prevent waterlogging in 27 spots. At eight spots, rainwater accumulated for more than three hours — the maximum amount of time we set for clearing water from a particular stretch,” said Kundu.Kundu said that at the eight points that witnessed intense flooding — places such as IFFCO Chowk, Hero Honda Chowk, Narsinghpur-Khandsa stretch — dewatering and pumping measures were found to be insufficient.“ Upon further review, we found that there were 11 new spots across the city that had no prior history of waterlogging. Nonetheless, these spots were found to be heavily inundated last week. As such, we have directed all organisations concerned to strengthen the counter-waterlogging measures as one more month of monsoon is still left. We are anticipating one or two more intense spells of rains in the coming month,” he said.As per officials privy to the matter, the 11 new points include residential areas like sectors 39, 28, 15 Part-2, 31, 10A, Sushant Lok-1, and South City-1.Kundu said that flaws in terms of implementation of counter-waterlogging measures at all these 19 points have been identified while concerned officers have been directed to rectify them.As per MCG officials who attended the meeting, both MCG and GMDA have been directed to clear and desilt the drains at all these 19 points and place motor pumps to divert rainwater to the nearest outlet if no proper drainage system is found at a particular place.MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said pumps with higher capacity have been arranged on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway near Narsinghpur which will allow “rainwater to be drained in a less amount of time.” Singh further suggested that officials can be deployed across various underpasses in the city to ensure that minimal rainwater is accumulated in such structures.Another major decision taken during the meeting was to prepare a traffic management plan for the monsoon season in order to regulate the traffic movement more efficiently.“We will be coming out with a traffic management plan soon. We are aware of the stretches which tend to get congested during heavy rains and the plan will address the best possible solutions to ensure that traffic can be easily managed. Both the GMDA and traffic police will be jointly developing this,” said Kundu.During the meeting, traffic police officials also said that they will be asking RWAs to keep all their society, condominium, township gates open during heavy rains so that traffic can be diverted through these routes.“During the heavy showers last week, we requested the RWAs to open their gates so that traffic can be diverted. We shall follow this practice in the future as well. As part of the traffic management plan, we will be mapping the gates of all residential areas across the city so that we have a database ready for diverting traffic from main roads if there is severe waterlogging. We will have a draft ready within 10 days and will share it with the concerned public bodies for their perusal,” said Chander Mohan, deputy commissioner of police, traffic.Mohan added that during the meeting a suggestion for providing additional cranes to the traffic police was also discussed.Kundu further said a decision was taken to form a long-term regulatory plan for the city which will mark out points where “development should not obstruct the natural passageway of the drainage” in any way.“We had earlier prepared a comprehensive drainage plan from the point of view of flood prevention but we realised that is this alone will be not sufficient for long-term solutions. There are a lot of undeveloped areas in the city that will be developed in the future. The surface run-off will increase from there and this will lead to more problems. Therefore, we have decided to go for a long-term drainage plan which will also provide a regulatory framework for the development of the area,” said Kundu.Kundu said the issue needs approval from both the GMDA and the state government as well since it will have “regulatory connotations for development.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-civic-bodies-to-ramp-up-measures-to-prevent-waterlogging-traffic-management-plan-on-the-cards/story-LNIBQEOwRWWFpsh64wPRNK.html

24-08-2020||Chandigarh||Virus shifting path towards northern Haryana||Gradually changing paths, the coronavirus seems to be shifting its spread from the national capital region (NCR) abutting New Delhi to the northern districts of Haryana. Data for the last week showed that the number of new infections reported from districts bordering the national capital seems to be stabilising, but the virus is spreading fast in the northern districts. On August 23, five northern districts had reported 36% of the new cases as compared to 31% from the five NCR districts. Similarly on August 24, 34% new infections were reported from five northern districts as against 31% from five NCR districts. Seven northern districts had contributed 51% of the new infections reported on August 22 while four NCR districts threw up 24% fresh cases. Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora, said the NCR districts have stabilised now and are reporting much lesser number of cases (about 20-30%). “The spurt in northern districts is understandable keeping in view the free movement of men and material. However, our assessment is that this spike trend will also stabilise in about two weeks,” he added. As per the health department statistics, 7,233 new infections were reported last week (August 17-23) as compared to 5,518 cases logged between August 10 and August 16. Number of critical value districts on a riseWith the virus moving northward, the number of districts attaining critical values as per the Union health ministry parameters have started increasing. Eighteen districts, most of which are from northern part of the state, have now more than 15 active cases per lakh population, a critical value. These are Ambala, Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Faridabad, Fatehabad, Gurugram, Hisar, Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Mahendergarh, Panchkula, Panipat, Rewari, Rohtak, Sirsa, Sonepat and Yamunanagar. Similarly, 15 districts, mostly from north, now have more than 200 active cases, another critical value parameter. These are Ambala, Faridabad, Gurugram, Hisar, Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Mahendergarh, Panchkula, Panipat, Rewari, Rohtak, Sirsa, Sonepat and Yamunanagar. Ambala, Faridabad, Gurugram, Mahendergarh, Panipat and Rewari have a sample positivity rate (confirmation rate) of above 6%, a critical value. Only Jind has a sample positivity rate of less than 2%, a desirable value. The state, however, seems to be doing well on the case fatality rate parameters with 10 districts — Ambala, Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Fatehabad, Hisar, Kaithal, Mahendergarh, Palwal, Panchkula and Rewari — having less than 1% fatality rate, a desirable value. The doubling rate calculated over a seven-day period is more than 28 days in 12 districts, a desirable value as per the health ministry. Only Yamunanagar district with a doubling rate of less than 14 days has got tagged with the critical value.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/virus-shifting-path-towards-northern-haryana/story-2Tmg7gsTxngyIRu61bW7TI.html

24-08-2020||City||Vision 2030: Skill development activities after school hours in Delhi schools||New Delhi: The Delhi government plans to introduce skill development activities for its students after school hours as a part of its effort to improve vocational studies and increase enrolment in higher education. The project is a part of the directorate of education’s “Vision 2030” plan, which aims to achieve multiple targets such as creating more schools of excellence, teaching foreign languages, and having connected classrooms in government schools before 2030.“After school hours, there should be a provision of vocational and skill development activities. Students to be given a choice of participation in the activities as per their interest. Activities pertaining to art/craft, library, and vocational skills to be provided in such time slot,” read a document, providing details on the project.“In each cluster, one school to be designated for afternoon activities for skill development of students so as to facilitate the students in getting admission/enrolment in higher education,” the order said.Signed by the deputy director of education (administration), Ramchandra Shingare, the order said the project is tentatively slated to begin by December 1. The department’s vocational branch has been told to decide on the scheme by the end of this month. Separate provisions will be made in the budget for the payment of honorarium to staff and teachers allotted for this purpose. Heads of schools have been asked to finalise estimates and do the procurement by November 15.Schools have also been asked to form clubs for different activities. “Introduction of sports, visual and performing arts, tuition classes for preparation of competitive exams during after school hours can be done. There can be various clubs for sports, music, and computer learning, etc., on the line of eco-clubs existing in the schools,” the order stated. Heads of schools have been told to decide on the clubs by September 30.Deputy director of education (vocational) Pramod Katiyar has been appointed as the nodal officer for the project. “We already have eco-clubs in our schools. Similar clubs will be formed for students based upon their interests. The vocational subjects in the scheme will be decided on the basis of subjects already available in the school or based on the requirement of local communities,” he said.Awadhesh Kumar Jha, head of school at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector-8, said the scheme will help students build opportunities for themselves. “In my school, we wanted to encourage traditional skills in food from other states and set up stalls in the locality. This might encourage them to think bigger. It is something we had been trying in the school before the pandemic struck. Getting children from marginalised backgrounds access to music or sports skills will help them find more opportunities. However, finding teachers or experts during the Covid-19 pandemic might prove to be a little difficult.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vision-2030-skill-development-activities-after-school-hours-in-delhi-schools/story-5ux7YCB7p0I3bx86SddKcM.html

Officials said they have prepared a fresh proposal seeking more doctors and staff besides equipment and medicines to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.In an earlier direction on August 13, the mission director (Uttar Pradesh) of the National Health Mission had allowed hiring of specialists by district officials on contractual basis till December 31, meant for duties in L2 and L3 category Covid hospitals. Based on this, the district health department had selected seven candidates so far for Covid-19 duties but only three joined. “The three include two ayurveda doctors on a salary of Rs 32,000 per month and one MBBS doctor who would get Rs 50,000 per month. Others have not joined so far and we are facing a shortage of resources as we have 70 doctors available against the sanctioned 88. Hiring of specialists on the other hand will continue but we need them urgently to meet the demands of the work which due to the prevailing Covid situation,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “The sanctioned strength of 88 is meant to be deployed at community health centres, primary health centres, dispensaries, district jail and police units, besides those deployed at the UP Sadan and health posts, among others,” he added.Officials said shortage of manpower was hampering the work of about 1,000 deliveries per month which are taken up at four community health centres, and also causing issues for about 2,500 patients who attend daily OPDs at community health centres (CHCs), primary health centres and dispensaries. Such centres work under the office of the CMO while the three district hospitals – MMG Hospital, Sanjay Nagar Hospital and Women’s Hospital – have their own staff and resources.Dr Gupta added that of the present strength of 70 doctors available under the supervision of the CMO, 26 are deployed for active Covid-19 duties related to surveillance, quarantine centres, Covid hospitals, control room, sampling centres and even contact tracing of Covid-19 patients. “So, we have prepared a proposal for requirement of 22 doctors, five physicians, 10 anaesthetists, six ICU technicians and 12 ICU nurses, besides 24 support staff, and another set of 50 staff which will be deployed for disinfection duties in wake of monsoon season when communicable diseases also crop up. The proposal also includes equipment such as high flow nasal cannula units (five), one unit meant for plasma therapy, 19 Bipap units along with high value medicines like Remdesivir, etc,” Dr Gupta added.The proposal will be put up before a district committee, which is headed by the district magistrate, and will comprise of five other members including the chief development officer, the CMO, district panchayati raj officer, municipal commissioner and chief treasury officer. “The proposal will be discussed in a meeting which is scheduled later this week and further decision will be taken up. It is expected that we will take a decision over the proposal within a week,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.The committee was formed on directions of the state government when different districts were allowed Rs 5 crore and Rs 3 crore as per government order dated August 1. Ghaziabad falls under the category of districts having a population of more than 25 lakh, and is to get Rs 5 crore contingency funds. The order directed that the funds may be used for hiring manpower on a contractual basis and can also be used for purchase of consumables besides hiring vehicles for travel of staff for Covid duties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/facing-shortage-ghaziabad-prepares-proposal-seeking-manpower-equipment-to-deal-with-covid/story-xReJtLzaIj7X1OGeGccVeM.html
24-08-2020||City||Covid-19 curve is stabilising in district, say Ghaziabad officials||Ghaziabad The Covid-19 curve in Ghaziabad is stabilizing as the district has seen no major spike in positive cases since mid-July, officials from the district administration said on Monday. “The weekly trend since mid-July is almost consistent with no major rise in the number of cases. So, it can be said as a controlled scenario of new cases coming in. This is happening with our daily testing in range of 2,500-3,000 and the deployment of optimum resources for door-to-door surveys and other activities,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “Since mid of July, we are observing that weekly cases have ranged between 500-800 as against 650-1,000 between last week of June and mid-July,” Gupta said.The officials said that they are also observing the trend in Delhi, Noida and other neighbouring districts as the movement of people to other districts also affects the number of cases. On Sunday, Delhi recorded 1,450 new cases which is the highest single-day jump in over a month. “We are keenly observing trends in Delhi as many residents go there for work. Our present strength of resources will remain deployed and more can be added in coming weeks. The district has not seen a major spike for the past one-and-a-half months. We will also be implementing the five-zone classification strategy soon to keep check on spread of infection,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Last week, the administration had formed five categories of zones across the district with different strategy assigned to each zone in order to control the spread of infection. According to official figures of the health department, the period from June 24 to August 24 has about nine weeks. During the period, maximum cases, 1,008, arrived in the week of July 8-14 and thereafter the trend of fresh cases is on decline on a weekly basis. As an exception, the week of August 12-18 had 811 cases. “The cases started to peak in June and the trend continued till mid of July. Thereafter, the weekly cases are stable till date. So, it is expected that we may see a decline soon,” the CMO said. Echoing similar views, experts said that a plateau has been reached in the district’s Covid-19 pandemic.“We have observed that there is no major spike in number of cases this month. The severity of infection is also not like in the months of June and July. The situation is in the form of plateau and it is likely that we see a declining trend in coming days,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad.

24-08-2020||City||Three held for friend’s murder, two more on the run||Three men were arrested by the Beta 2 police on Monday for allegedly murdering their friend on the night of August 22. Police said two more suspects were on the run at the moment.The victim, identified as Milan Haldhar (35), was found dead on the morning of August 23 near a community centre under Beta 2 police jurisdiction. “His head had been bashed in with a brick and injuries on other parts of the body suggested that the man had been attacked with vengence, suggestinga possible personal motive behind the murder. Milan worked as a daily wage earner and is a native of Assam,” said Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 3. The arrested suspects were identified as Kishanveer, Arun and Pappu — all natives of Bulandshahr.Police officials said that the victim was apparently involved in relationship with both Kishanveer’s wife and mother-in-law and was a frequent visitor to his house.“Because of this, Kishanveer and Milan had a scuffle on August 22, which later turned to blows. With the intervention of other people, the situation was brought under control then. Later, they met for drinks at night along with four other people,” said Pandey.He said that while consuming liquor at night, the duo had another argument which later escalated, leading to Milan being attacked and assaulted repeatedly with a brick by the others. The suspects later left him to die and fled the spot.Based on the complaint of Milan’s landlord, a case was registered at the Beta 2 police station under sections 302 (punishment for murder) and 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.The suspects were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail. A search is on for the other two suspects who are absconding at the moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-held-for-friend-s-murder-two-more-on-the-run/story-VZ5l9SZsvAqtDAou1FVKRM.html

A medical examination of the teenager has been conducted and reports are awaited, the police said, adding that the suspects are at large after the incident.According to police officials, the incident came to fore Sunday evening. The police said the family was initially hesitant to lodge a complaint. However, after intervention of the police who got to know about the incident through locals of the area, the boy’s father filed a complaint with the Dankaur police station. “The two suspects are in their early twenties. They live in the same village next to the boy’s family and were known to him. It seems that they persuaded the boy to go along with them to nearby woods on their motorcycle,” said Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 3.He said the boy was allegedly sodomised and threatened with dire consequences by the suspects if he tells anyone. The boy later informed his family, the police said. “In the official complaint filed by the father, he has alleged that the boy was under duress at gunpoint during the whole incident while the suspects took turns molesting him,” said Pandey. The police, however, said that they are yet to verify whether the incident took place at gunpoint or not.A case was registered under Section 377 (unnatural offences) of the Indian Penal Code against the two youths as well as relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. “The boy was sent for the medical examination on Sunday and we are awaiting the findings. Meanwhile, a search is on for the two suspects who are at large,” said the additional DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-men-booked-for-sexually-assaulting-teen-boy-at-gunpoint/story-dTaaMFlsRotbjLXRZkLBjP.html

24-08-2020||City||Man, friend held for attempting to kill murder convict who killed his uncle 27 years ago||New Delhi: A 19-year-old man has been arrested with his associate for allegedly attempting to kill a 50-year-old man, who had “brutally killed” his uncle in the presence of police and public in north Delhi 27 years ago, police said on Monday. The man, identified as Kunal Soni, is a professional wrestler and had participated in a few junior wrestling championships, the police said.Soni was born nearly eight years after his uncle’s murder. The accused, Pawan (single name), was caught from the crime scene and convicted for life by a Delhi court in 1998. He had come out of jail on parole in March this year. Soni and his associate Naveen alias Aniket, 22, allegedly fired at Pawan to take revenge for his uncle’s murder and for the “constant bullying” he and his family members had been facing from him ever since he was released on parole, deputy commissioner of police (north) Monika Bhardwaj said. On Sunday, DCP Bhardwaj said Pawan was along with his friends – Sompal and Laxman – was at Gali Church Wali in Sadar Bazar. Around 5.30 pm, two bike-borne men arrived and fired at Pawan. The bullet grazed his neck and hit Laxman in his abdomen. The attackers fled the crime scene, leaving behind the two injured men, who were admitted to a nearby hospital. The two got medical attention and their condition is out of danger, the police said.“We registered a case of attempt to murder and common intention on Pawan’s complaint and teams were formed to identify and nab the attackers. Since Pawan had been an accused in three murder cases, one attempt to murder and many other bodily offences, it was difficult to ascertain which rival was involved in the attack,” said Bhardwaj.During the probe, the investigating teams activated their human intelligence network and it helped them zero in on Kunal Soni, whose uncle was murdered by Pawan in 1993. Soni was missing from his home. However, his hideouts were raided and he was caught on Monday along with a countrymade pistol from north Delhi. His interrogation led to the arrest of his associate, Naveen, said a police officer, associated with the case. “Soni told us Pawan had been bullying him and his family members since he came out on parole. He had heard about his uncle’s murder by Pawan over a rivalry. Soni’s uncle had assaulted Pawan in 1990. Pawan took revenge three years later by killing him in front of some policemen, who had to shoot him to disarm him,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-friend-held-for-attempting-to-kill-murder-convict-who-killed-his-uncle-27-years-ago/story-zDroVVzhxPe2BfMWtz1aUN.html

24-08-2020||Noida||Pollution control board collects sewer samples from 21 high-rises in Noida to check for effluents||The Uttar Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has collected samples of sewage generated from at least 21 residential societies in the city to check whether they were treating effluents as per norms or not.According to the UPPCB officials, samples from high-rises in sectors 74,75,76,77 and 137 were collected till Monday. UPPCB’s initiative comes in wake of the inspection conducted by Noida authority earlier this month which found that at least 27 high-rises in the city did not have sewage treatment plants (STPs), as mandated, and were discharging effluents directly into drains. In the first week of August, the Noida authority had inspected 33 high-rises of which only six were found having fully-functional STPs.“When we were collecting the samples, we found that some high-rises which did not have an STP at all and were releasing wastewater into the drains. Once the reports are out, we will confirm from the Noida authority if such high-rises have been permitted to operate without an STP under any special provisions and if the authority is treating the wastewater of such high-rises at their terminal,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer, UPPCB, Noida. The pollution control board expects the results to be out by Saturday or early next week.“As per the standards set to ensure that the wastewater is not contaminated, the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) should not be more than 30mg/l and oil and grease need to be minimal among other parameters,” Kumar saidKumar added that if the wastewater released from the high-rises into the drains, treated and untreated, do not meet the standards set by the Central Pollution Control Board, then the concerned high-rises will be sent a notice and will be penalised accordingly.According to the rules laid down by the Noida authority, all high-rises in the city must treat the sewage generated within their premises through STPs. The treated water should be used for horticulture and washing purposes within the residential societies, and only leftover treated wastewater should be released into the drains.UPPCB officials said since a few high-rises surveyed by their teams are now being managed by state-owned NBCC Ltd, they will seek a clarification from Noida authority about who to send the notices if the effluents from such high-rises fail to meet the minimum standards. The pollution board pointed out that one such high-rise, currently being managed by NBCC did not had an STP at all. “We will approach the Noida authority about such cases as we don’t know if we should impose a penalty on NBCC or the builders,” Kumar said.“We will conduct more surprise inspections soon as many high-rises were found not following the norms in the last check. This leads to water pollution as the discharged effluents make their way to rivers. Through its six STPs. the Noida authority treats wastewater discharged by individual households only. It’s because the drains are designed in such a way that they can only cater to small households and not the high-rises with four or five thousand families,” said Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty (OSD), health, Noida authority.The estimated sewage generation in Noida is around 210 million litres a day (MLD). According to officials, the city has the capacity to treat 230 MLD of the sewage through its six STPs. However, the untreated sewer from high-rises often reaches up to Yamuna and Hindon rivers through flood drains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/pollution-control-board-collects-sewer-samples-from-21-high-rises-in-noida-to-check-for-effluents/story-JKliXzdgOQ8NDd4AkzBaON.html
24-08-2020||Chandigarh||Baltana floods caught local authorities by surprise, Chandigarh admn blamed for ‘lapse’||Mohali: Zirakpur municipal council (MC) authorities were caught completely by surprise as flash floods hit Baltana on Sunday when floodgates of the Sukhna Lake were opened after its water levels breached the danger mark; even as an unidentified body of a man in his thirties was found in Sukhna choe (rivulet) in the area. They said floodwaters had entered many areas in the town by the time they got to know about it. Not being told about the release of the water from Sukhna was a “serious lapse on the part of the Chandigarh administration,” they added.Even as cats and dog carcasses surfaced in the flood waters, police were informed about an unclothed body of a man spotted in the choe near the police post. After people living nearby failed to identify the body, it was kept at the Dera Bassi Civil Hospital. Other police stations have been informed, said Kulwant Singh, in-charge, Baltana police post.‘First experience of flood-like situation’“We had no idea that the UT administration would release the water and came to know about it only when the entire area was flooded.We have experienced a flood-like situation for the first time,” said Sandeep Tewari, the MC’s executive officer.“It is a serious lapse on the part of the Chandigarh administration, which released the water without any intimation. Neither the deputy commissioner of Mohali nor Patiala were aware of it. The water has receded now, but they might release it again,” said Raman Bains, executive officer of the Irrigation department. Chandigarh chief engineer Mukesh Anand had stated on Sunday that before opening the floodgates around 3am, “we had alerted the district administrations in Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula”. Sukhna breached the danger mark after check dams released water higher up in the Shivalik hills following heavy rain early on Sunday, following which most rivulets, also known as choes, in the area, were flooded.The worst affected areas were located around Sukhna choe, including the Baltana police post, marriage palaces, Municipal Park, milk dairies and the cremation ground. Police personnel also had to demolish part of a wall for the floodwaters to flow out into an adjacent rivulet. Many slum dwellers hit by the floods have moved their belongings to safer places.“We were born and brought up here, but we have experience such flooding for the first time,” said Balwant Singh, a local resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/baltana-floods-caught-local-authorities-by-surprise-chandigarh-admn-blamed-for-lapse/story-hgARtvu5fjvykGISxUJjIJ.html

During questioning, the woman said she planned her own kidnapping as she was married off against her wishes,” he added.Sombir Singh of Bhiwani’s Dang Kalan village said he got married with Mamta of Rohtak’s Mokhra village on Monday.“The incident took place when I along with Mamta, her brother and five others were returning to my home from her native village. A young man signalled us to stop near Kalanaur in Rohtak. When we stopped the car, suddenly five to six men arrived there, snatched our car at gunpoint and fled with my wife. She was kidnapped by Sahil Kumar and Mohit of her village along with their friends,” Sombir added.A senior cop pleading anonymity said the newlywed visited her aunt’s house in a Sonepat village along with her abductors. “When her aunt scolded her for staging the kidnapping, she and her abductors fled from there too. The accused then dropped her near Mohana police station in Sonepat, where she narrated the incident to cops,” the officer added.Kalanaur SHO Sohan Lal said they have registered a case of kidnapping against the accused and started investigation.This is the second such case where a woman planned her own kidnapping with the help of her lover.

The grim reality, shares Kaur, is that there are countless students who are unable to access online classes as they don’t have smartphones or laptops as their families are unable to afford them. Significantly, there are gender based inequalities when it comes to girls having access to electronic gadgets. So far, Prernaforyouand.us have collected and handed over 12 different gadgets to Kaur, which are now being sent to the first few girls studying in classes 5 to 10 who are very excited about using their own laptops. Three girls from one family without even a smartphone now have a branded laptop. They are very eager to join online classes.After the pandemic, Prernaforyouand.us hope to focus on women and personal hygiene, importance of sanitary napkins, their distribution and hygienic disposal . The group is planning to approach panchayats of various villages to encourage them to educate girls and also reach out to as many girls as possible and work in areas related to their academics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/school-students-collect-gadgets-to-help-rural-girls-study-online/story-1qO8pIm1AiTSmHZvpbY30N.html
24-08-2020||City||3 years to Dera mayhem: Nobody did it; 33 acquitted, none guilty||Panchkula On this day (August 25) three years ago in 2017, Panchkula burnt. The biggest riots of the state left 36 dead and 423 injured, as mobs of followers of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim went on a rampage after a CBI special court found him guilty of raping two women disciples. Police record shows that 29 buildings, government and private, were damaged. The dera followers burnt 74 vehicles including two fire brigades, three Outstation Broadcasting (OB) vans of news channels, one school bus and damaged 57 vehicles, including one ambulance. Panchkula Police also seized five pistols/revolvers, four rifles, including an AK 47, two guns, one Mauser and 58 vehicles. Yet for all this mayhem and destruction, no one has been convicted. Aditya Insaan, a former spokesperson of the dera, fled the spot just before mob turned violent. He continues to carry a police reward of Rs 5 lakh on his head and was declared a Proclaimed Offender (PO) on May 21 this year. 177 FIRs LODGEDPanchkula Police registered 177 FIRs against 2,318 accused; of this, 20 FIRs were clubbed on court direction. “There are 2,318 accused, with some common in many cases. In total, 1,145 persons have been arrested and are facing trial,” said a police official. The police could not trace five cases, and the remaining 152 cases were in district court, Panchkula. “To date, none has been convicted,” according to police data. At least 33 accused in eight cases have been acquitted.EIGHT CASES HAVE FALLEN FLATNine Special Investigation Teams (SITs) were formed to investigate violence cases, yet cases are falling flat in court. The first case fell flat in the court on April 30, 2018, was related to FIR 415 of 2017, registered in Sector 5. Six persons, accused of rioting and snatching at Hafed Chowk, were acquitted. They had been arrested on the complaint of a Mohali-based photo journalist, whose video camera and tripod was snatched. The court acquitted them as the ‘prosecution lacked evidence’.This year, the 8th dera violence case (FIR 363) fell flat as an additional district and sessions judge acquitted 10 dera followers, accused of attempt to murder, riot and damaging public property. The three eyewitness that the prosecution presented failed to identify the accused, and said that a mob set the fire tender ablaze. Here, a fireman was injured after dera followers attacked the fire tender. In a 19-page judgment, the judge held that the prosecution was not able to establish its case beyond reasonable doubt. The order read that the identity of the accused persons was not established in the present case.A person was acquitted of criminal intimidation on June 4, 2018. Six were acquitted in FIR 362 of 2017 on July 30, 2018. Five were acquitted on November 15, 2018, of snatching. On May 9, 2019, five persons were acquitted. The most important is FIR number 345 of 2017, registered in Sector 5. It names 40 accused, including Insaan, whose role is considered crucial in planning and execution of riots, and three other accused. When questioned on the lack of conviction and the falling flat of eight cases, Panchkula police commissioner Saurabh Singh said, “Many main cases are pending in court and are under trial. In many cases of violence, there is no specific evidence collected from the spot. We are studying why cases are ending up in acquittal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-years-to-dera-mayhem-nobody-did-it-33-acquitted-none-guilty/story-jtGLaHtPzvh8CUE00ByF8M.html

Rahul ji had earlier said that he does not want to continue as party chief.“In light of these things, we had given our suggestions (in the letter). Those who have read the full contents of the letter know that we have praised Sonia Gandhi and her leadership,” Bhattal told PTI.She said that despite the tragedies Sonia Gandhi faced on the personal front -- losing her mother-in-law Indira Gandhi and husband Rajiv Gandhi -- “she moved on and effectively guided the Congress and formed government at the Centre twice”.“Soniaji’s leadership is acceptable to all, but we had said that a working group be formed under her which will be directly answerable to her. This was our demand, there is nothing wrong, it was not dissent, it was a suggestion letter, we gave good points to make the party strong,” said the senior Congress leader.On the other hand, when asked about the letter during an informal chat, Hooda replied, “I won’t make any comment on the party’s internal matters.” He, however, said the Congress needs to be strengthened.The Congress Working Committee on Monday urged Sonia Gandhi to continue as its interim chief till an AICC session can be convened and authorised her to effect necessary organisational changes to deal with the challenges facing the party.At an over seven-hour long meeting, which took place in the backdrop of more than 20 party leaders seeking an immediate organisational overhaul and a collective leadership, Gandhi is said to have offered to quit but was requested by the party’s top decision-making panel with over 50 members to stay on.Bhattal said, “We had suggested that a working group should be formed under her and an AICC session should be summoned. We always accepted Sonia ji’s leadership and never were any question marks raised. We have been well-wishers of the Nehru-Gandhi family, which made sacrifices for the nation’s sake.” She said that Sonia Gandhi ran things quite smoothly being at the helm.“But she had herself said last year that she will be there for one year. It is good that she will continue now,” Bhattal said.Bhattal said assembly elections are due in Punjab in over a year, polls in other states are going to take place in coming months and the suggestions they gave was to strength party for the elections also.Asked why then there has been criticism to their letter, Bhattal replied: “Sometimes, things get misinterpreted in the media. We all want that Congress should be further strengthened. It is a grand old party which first fought for the country’s freedom and then ran the country for all these years. To speak for strengthening the party, I think there is nothing wrong in that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/letter-not-dissent-but-good-suggestions-given-in-cong-s-interests-ex-punjab-cm-bhattal/story-nhP19awoMUXAOe44Ngdj1N.html

24-08-2020||Chandigarh||Despite trader protests, odd-even rule extended in 12 city markets till September 3||Seeing no let-up in Covid-19 cases, the UT administration on Monday extended the odd-even rule in 12 congested markets of the city up to September 3.This, when traders have been protesting the restrictions, including the weekend lockdown that was imposed on August 22.It was on August 8 that the odd-even system for opening shops was reintroduced in 10 congested markets, besides the internal market of Sector 8 that houses various eateries. Later, the order was extended to the electronics market of Sector 18, too.The other 10 markets are Patel Market in Sector 15, Palika Bazaar and Sadar Market in Sector 19, Azad Market and Palace Market in Sector 20, Booth Market in Sector 21, Shastri Market in Sector 22, Janta Market in Sector 27, Krishna Market in Sector 41 and the market area near the PNB Bank/Bihari Garment, Burail Chowk. Meanwhile, the basements of seven shops in the Sector-22 mobile market will also continue to remain closed while the scooter market of Sector 43 will not open on Sundays.SEC-8 EATERIES WRITE TO ADVISERThe eateries of Sector 8 have written to UT adviser Manoj Parida asking that the odd-even rule be discontinued so that staying open for only 2-3 days a week did not cause a severe loss of business for them. Tarandeep Singh, proprietor of Burgrill, said, “How will we pay rent if we can only open two days a week? The administration has singled out the eateries of Sector 8 while they’re open in other sectors.”Local area councillor Maheshinder Singh Sidhu said, “The Sector 8 market is a popular stop on the ‘gedi route’, but if the shops aren’t allowed to open, people won’t come, or if they do, will crowd at the shops that are open.”MOBILE MARKET TRADERS WANT OPEN SHOPSTraders in the mobile market of Sector 22B said that even during the pandemic, the administrative policies were hurting them. Sumit Kumar who runs one of the shops here said, “The policies have cost me over ₹1 lakh rupees already and I still need to pay all my bills and rent. The sabzi mandi is organised right opposite our market and we can see the vendors there with their masks pulled down flouting social distancing norms. Why should we be singled out?”Chandigarh Beopar Mandal that had organised a protest on Saturday against the weekend restrictions had announced they will approach the UT administration to repeal the decision. “It is unfeasible for markets to open for just two to three times a week, and non-essential businesses will die. We will ask UT officials to reconsider their decision,” said CBM chairman Charanjiv Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/despite-trader-protests-odd-even-rule-extended-in-12-city-markets-till-september-3/story-tDyAEequ3tYHFhRWefggEK.html

24-08-2020||Chandigarh||87 suicides so far, Chandigarh goes past last year’s toll||Eighty-seven people took their lives in Chandigarh this year, with 64 suicides reported since March 22, when restrictions were imposed for the first time in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.At 17, the highest number of suicides were recorded in June, even as the Centre had started easing curbs that month.A total of 63 persons had ended their lives in the corresponding period (January 1 to August 24) last year, when the total toll had gone up to 86.A senior police official who wished to remain anonymous, said, investigations pointed towards stress acting as a trigger. Loss of earnings and jobs and domestic disputes during the pandemic, too, affected the victims. As no suicide notes were recovered in a large number of cases police had to depend on statements from families who attributed the reason to depression.“It is the moment when you choose death over life and if you survive you get on with life. But you need immense support from the family and positivity to start living again,” said a Hallomajra resident who attempted suicide in May this year. The 39-year-old dhaba owner from Zirakpur was left penniless after business folded up during the lockdown. An alert neighbour saved his life.Look out for symptoms, reach out “Feelings of hopelessness or persistent sadness or death wishes are also symptoms for which we need to visit a doctor. Offer support, say you are there for the person, families need to be with such a person for 24 hours,” said Dr Bhupinderjit (Simmi) Waraich, a mental health and behavioural sciences consultant. Dr Roshan Lal, professor, department of psychology, Panjab University, said, “empathy” for a suicidal person from family and friends was required. Loneliness, uncertainty, loss of financial security, business losses were key triggers this year, so helplines had to be popularised, said Dr Manoj K Bajaj, honorary general secretary, Indian Association of Clinical Psychologists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/87-suicides-so-far-chandigarh-goes-past-last-year-s-toll/story-JWf07R8By8UdxM7bjUtnyO.html

However, the House withdrew the motion later in the day after the BJP legislator expressed regret over his behaviour. The House was adjourned sine die in the evening after passing 13 Bills. Rathore had argued with the Speaker complaining that Opposition members were not allowed enough time to speak on the Bills. BJP members had also trooped into the Well of the House, shouting slogans. Amid the din, the House was briefly adjourned four times. During the discussion on the Rajasthan Rehabilitation of Beggars or Indigents (Amendment) Bill, 2020, the Speaker asked BJP MLA Madan Dilawar to confine himself to the Bill, saying it was not a general debate. When BJP MLA Kiran Maheshwari was also asked to stick to the Bill, Rathore intervened, asking the Speaker to let the members speak. The Speaker then asked Opposition members to return to their seats. When Rathore challenged the Chair, the Speaker asked Parliamentary Affair Minister Shanti Dhariwal to move a proposal for his removal from the House. Opposition members continued their protest and squatted in the Well of the House even after the Congress-dominated House passed the motion. The Speaker then suggested that Rathore should leave the House for two minutes and he will ask the ruling party to move another proposal to bring him back. But the BJP MLAs continued with the protest. Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria said the MLAs had no intention of violating the Speaker’s ruling, but they had not been given any time to examine the five Bills introduced by the government on Monday. “No member has studied them, how can they be discussed?” he said. The Opposition then staged a walk out. While the opposition members were not present in the House, Speaker C P Joshi said the Question Hour had to be cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. He said other state assemblies too had followed the same practice during the pandemic. Joshi said another session can be called when the situation improves. He added it was distressing that the Opposition did not take part in the discussions. On the Speaker’s directions, the parliamentary affairs minister moved another proposal withdrawing the earlier resolution against Rathore. This too was passed by voice vote. Earlier, the opposition boycotted the Business Advisory Committee meeting over the government decision to bring new Bills. The government had introduced eight Bills on Friday and added five more on Monday. All were passed on Monday. After passing the Bills, the House was adjourned sine die. The House had three sittings during the brief session. Its main agenda was the confidence vote brought by the Ashok Gehlot government after the patch-up with Congress dissidents led by Sachin Pilot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/uproar-in-rajasthan-assembly-deputy-leader-of-opposition-asked-to-leave-house/story-XOF8CbD3aoTB5GNY3IvOBM.html

However, the ex-communication verdict against Langah by the Akal Takht remained intact.Thereafter, the Akal Takht had declared two persons, including a Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee member, ‘’tankhaiya’’ (guilty of religious misconduct) for having “association” with Langah.Langah had pleaded for clemency in March also.He was booked by Punjab police in 2017 under IPC sections, including 376 (rape), 384 (extortion) and 420 (cheating). However, later the complainant claimed in the court that she complained under pressure, leading to Langah’s acquittal in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/akal-takht-rejects-langah-s-fresh-clemency-appeal/story-fjEsalE6xfYUxkxIuOGCCJ.html

The officials said that the peth area houses Kasba Ganpati, the first Manacha (most revered) Ganpati and one of the city’s prominent Ganpati mandals, and many residents thronged the area during the Ganesh festival that began on Saturday. The Kasba Ganpati mandal president and volunteers have appealed to devotees to opt for online darshan this year. Shrikant Shete, president, Kasba Ganpati mandal said, “Before the beginning of the 10-day festival, we have been telling residents that there will be no aartis, felicitations and other religious ceremonies at the mandap. Only daily puja of Ganpati will be done by our guruji and volunteers have been appointed for darshan. We are following the rules and regulations given by PMC and police department as public safety is top priority.”“We all need to take safety precautions, maintain social distancing and avoid spread of the virus. Hence, as per the instructions from the police department, the area around Kasba Ganpati temple and its mandal has been closed down during the Ganpati festival after positive cases were reported in the past two days,” said Avinash Sakpal, PMC deputy commissioner (zone 5) under whose jurisdiction the area falls. The administration has stopped the sale of non-essentials in the area and only allowed pedestrian movement. A temporary police post has been set up in front of the Kasba Ganpati temple to allow residents to have a brief darshan of the deity and leave the place and avoid crowd. Jagannath Kalaskar, senior inspector at Faraskhana police station said, “Safety of public is important and so the area surrounding the Kasba Ganpati mandal has been sealed.

24-08-2020||Chandigarh||Confusion prevails as shops in Ludhiana open using odd-even formula||Confusion prevailed in Ludhiana markets on Monday on the first day shops opened using odd-even criteria . Even-numbered shops opened in Chaura Bazar, Shahpur road and adjoining area, while odd number shops opened in Model Town, Pink Plaza market and Field ganj among others.The shopkeepers rued losses due to low footfall in the markets as fear has gripped the residents amid rising Covid-19 cases in the city. President of Model Town market association, Amarjit Singh, said, “The new directions issued by the state government and administration are taking a toll on businesses at large. It has created confusion among shopkeepers and public. Footfall has also decreased in the market as fear has gripped the residents. We had opened odd-number shops on Monday after discussing it with the station house officer of Model Town, but few other markets opened even number shops. Also, shops that open on Tuesday and Thursday will have only two working days in a week and the others would have three as markets remain closed on Saturdays and Sundays. This will make it very difficult for businesses to survive.” Harkesh Mittal, president of Ludhiana Consumer Product Distributors Association, said, “To end the confusion, there should be one system for the entire city. Some markets are opting for left-hand side and right-hand side criteria to open shops, which will confuse the public and result in harassment for both public and the shopkeepers. The police on Monday also made few essential shops owners in Tibba road shut down their establishments, despite them being allowed to remain open for the entire week.” The market associations at Ghumar Mandi and Mall road adopted left and right hand side criteria rather than choosing the odd-even method being opted by majority markets of the city. President of Ghumar mandi market association, Pawan Batra, said, “We have decided to open one side of the market on one day. This will create less confusion among residents and shopkeepers. If we face any problems, changes will be made in the coming days.” General secretary of the Punjab Cloth Merchants’ Association, Sonu Nilibar, said they have also decided to open shops on Mall road on left and right hand side basis. Mixed response from residents The residents gave mixed responses to the odd-even formula introduced by the administration. While few residents said this will reduce rush in the markets, the others said that it will create confusion and result in harassment. A resident of Model Town area, Karandeep Singh, said, “Rather than introducing odd-even formula, the administration should fix particular days for opening specific shops.”Sarafa Bazar shopkeepers protest against restrictionsRaising hue and cry over the odd-even criteria to open the shops, the members of Swarnkar Sangh in Sarafa Bazar submitted a memorandum with the deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma’s office on Monday. President of the Sangh, Gopal Bhandari, said, “We have demanded that odd-even criteria should be abolished and every shop should be allowed to open on a particular day. If required, the government can reduce the working days to three in every week, but no shop should be stopped from opening on those particular days.” All shops open near Mata Rani chowkWhile shops were opened with odd-even criteria in other parts of the city, all the shops remained open on the road starting from Mata Rani chowk to municipal corporation’s Zone A office. Shopkeepers in Pink plaza market also alleged that Akalgarh market association had flouted the norms and all the shops were open on Monday. Following the complaint, police had visited the market.Despite repeated attempts, police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal could not be reached for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/confusion-prevails-as-shops-in-ludhiana-open-using-odd-even-formula/story-jAj0CahZAUbk9gffFlEnHM.html

During a live interaction with students during a virtual session on ‘staying positive during a crisis’ , the spiritual leader said, “Our Prime Minister’s call for a self-reliant India is a visionary thought. The youth should turn this dream into a reality by turning this crisis into an opportunity through innovation. They should undertake research and bring out ideas that can shape the world and make India the powerhouse for development.” Around 45,000 students and faculty from all over India participated in the session, which was jointy convened by the Art of Living Foundation and the university.

This is essential for everyone during the pandemic”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/drug-free-campus-sri-sri-ravi-shankar-launches-national-campaign-at-chandigarh-university/story-Uolskp4v9xynb7ImnmHadJ.html
24-08-2020||City||Takht calls for social boycott of preacher Dhadrianwale||MRITSAR The Akal Takht on Monday directed the Sikh community to boycott noted Sikh preacher Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale unless he seeks clemency for his ‘objectionable’ remarks. After a meeting of Sikh clergymen, Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said, “As per the report submitted by the sub-committee constituted to probe the statements made by Bhai Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale, he has made unfair statements on the Sikh principles and did not turn up for clarification. As per the decision taken by Panj Singh Sahiban, Sikh sangat across the world is directed to not attend his congregation, listen him or share his videos on social media until he apologises for his remarks.” “If anyone organises his congregation and any untoward incident happens there, he will be responsible for it. If Dhadrianwale does not stop making the objectionable remarks, stringent action will be taken against him,” he said. Same verdict was pronounced for Dhadrianwale’s aide and UK-based Sikh preacher Harinder Singh, head of Nirvair Khalsa Jatha. Harinder Singh had made objectionable remarks on Guru Nanak and was banned in the gurdwaras across the UK. On the unauthorised printing of Guru Granth Sahib’s saroop in Canada, the Sikh clergy directed Ripudaman Singh Malik and his aide Balwant Singh Pandher who had printed the saroops to send their clarification in a month. Also, both have been asked to hand over the saroops they have printed to Gurdwara Guru Nanak, where they will be checked for errors or alterations. ‘Arrests for ardas not fair’ On the arrest of youths for performing ardas of Khalistan at Takht Damdama Sahib and Akal Takht on the call of a US-based secessionist group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), the Sikh clergy said, “Arresting Sikh youths for performing ardas in gurdwaras is not fair.” “Performing ardas is the religious duty of every Sikh. A Sikh always vows to the concept of Raj Karega Khalsa (Khalsa will rule) through ardas. However, performing it or getting it performed for money is not Sikhism. The Sikh youths should be conscious of the provocative statements,” said Giani Harpreet Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/takht-calls-for-social-boycott-of-preacher-dhadrianwale/story-1y8hX57IFvT9rLdlXgPWyH.html

They include four men — 65-year-old from Baltana, 56-year-old from Dera Bassi, 34-year-old from Sector 68 and 30-year-old from Mataur — besides a Mauli Baidwan woman, aged 70. Also, with 106 patients being discharged on Monday, the number of those cured reached 1,515.No elective surgeries in L3 hospitalsDeputy commissioner Girish Dayalan on Monday ordered that no elective surgeries, such as joint replacements, cataract extractions and ligament repairs, are to be undertaken in Level 3 hospitals (that provide tertiary healthcare services by advanced specialists) in the next fortnight. “Rapid surge in Covid-19 cases mandates escalating bed strength in tertiary care hospitals, so it has been decided that surgeries that don’t require an immediate medical procedure can be scheduled to be performed later,” he said. The administration has also added 200 beds at the Covid Care Centre in Gian Sagar Hospital and is setting up two more testing centres at Nayagaon and Sohana in order to ease the pressure on the civil hospital.Pvt hospitals to provide home careAlso, private hospitals in the district would extend medical care to Covid-19 patients in home isolation, said Dayalan. A large number of patients have mild or no symptoms, and do not require hospitalisation, said the DC, adding that “rolling out home care packages will help reduce avoidable overcrowding at hospitals”.While Fortis and Max Healthcare have offered to extend home care packages to patients with mild symptoms, other hospitals are also exploring the possibility, he said. Patients will get to talk to the doctors on video chat, and nurses and paramedics would also be available for video consultation to ensure constant monitoring. The patients will also be provided with medicine and medical care kits that will help to detect if their condition deteriorates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-s-covid-toll-climbs-to-57-as-five-more-succumb-37-deaths-in-15-days/story-bvvE7CthUSe4940UsgPACO.html
24-08-2020||Delhi||‘What Delhi did yesterday, US does today’: Kejriwal on Trump’s plasma therapy announcement||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal used the announcement by US President Donald Trump of using the plasma therapy against Covid-19, saying what Delhi did yesterday, America does today.“They used to say, back in the day - what America does today, India would do tomorrow. Delhi has changed it. Now - what Delhi did yesterday, America does today. Congratulations Delhiites for achieving this for our country,” Kejriwal tweeted. They used to say, back in the day - what America does today, India would do tomorrow. Delhi has changed it. Now - what Delhi did yesterday, America does today. Congratulations Delhiites for achieving this for our country. https://t.co/ub18gZm7kPHe also attached an update from news agency ANI about Trump making the announcement to use plasma therapy.Trump had on Sunday hailed FDA authorisation of a coronavirus treatment that uses blood plasma from recovered patients, a day after accusing the agency of impeding the rollout of vaccines and therapeutics for political reasons.“This is what I’ve been looking to do for a long time,” Trump said at a White House news conference. “Today I’m pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives.”The FDA, explaining its decision, cited early evidence suggesting blood plasma can decrease mortality and improve the health of patients when administered in the first three days of their hospitalization.The agency also said it determined this was a safe approach in an analysis of 20,000 patients who received the treatment. So far, 70,000 patients have been treated using blood plasma, the FDA said.Kejriwal had launched Delhi’s first plasma bank last month at state-run Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) for treatment of Covid-19 patients.Under plasma therapy, antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from Covid-19 are taken and transfused into a coronavirus infected patient to boost the immune system to fight the infection.More than 700 Covid-19 patients in the national capital have been administered convalescent plasma therapy till now. The youngest to have received plasma from the government bank was 18-years-old and the oldest was 94-years-old. The gender-wise breakup of the data shows that among the recipients 522 were males and 188 females.The total number of coronavirus positive cases stand at 1,61,466 in the national capital. As many as 1,450 new Covid-19 cases and 16 deaths were reported in Delhi on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/what-delhi-did-yesterday-us-does-today-kejriwal-on-trump-s-plasma-therapy-announcement/story-xX7Ea04aXPyPsXSNNhqSQL.html

24-08-2020||Mumbai||Explain how LoC is issued without criminal proceedings: HC||The Bombay high court on Monday questioned the Bank of Baroda (BoB) and the Bureau of Immigration (BI) to explain on what grounds they could restrain a woman from travelling to the USA after it was informed that the woman was stopped from flying at CSIA on the basis of a lookout circular (LOC) issued against her. When the court sought to know about the criminal case against the woman, the BI submitted that they had issued the LoC based on information by BoB that the woman was a defaulter, however, there was no complaint registered against her. The court sought to know whether anyone could be restrained from travelling abroad without any criminal case and directed both the BI and BoB to file their reply justifying their action. A division bench of justice S J Kathawalla and justice Madhav Jamdar while hearing the petition of a woman of Indian origin who took up US citizenship in 2017 along with her family was informed by advocate Ashok Kumar Singh that the woman had been travelling to India regularly after shifting to the US to meet her aged mother. Earlier in 2020 when she was boarding a flight to the US, she was stopped by the BI officials and informed that there was an LoC against her name and hence she could not board the flight. Singh submitted that his client’s husband and father-in-law had taken a loan from BoB in 2012 for their factory in Gujarat. However as the business had run into losses they completed the securitization process with the bank by handing over the plant, machinery and plot of land before shifting to the US. He added that however there was some pending claim of the bank which was being heard by the Debt Recovery Tribunal at Ahmedabad. Singh added that his client was only the guarantor of the loan and hence the action of restraining her from travelling in the absence of any criminal proceedings against her was not valid. The counsel for the BI submitted that as BoB had informed them that the woman was a defaulter and should not be allowed to leave the country hence they had issued an LoC and restrained her from flying. After hearing the submissions the court wanted to know on what grounds the BI or the BoB restrain the woman from leaving the country without any criminal proceedings being initiated against her. As none appeared for BoB, the court directed it to explain the same and also directed BI to inform it of the procedure for issuing LoC and posted the matter for hearing on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/explain-how-loc-is-issued-without-criminal-proceedings-hc/story-ZqjlMLBE8iSC0yV5f0pi6M.html
24-08-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana gurdwara panel chief quits as parallel jathedar of Takht Damdama Sahib||The newly elected president of the Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (ad hoc), or HSGMC, Baljit Singh Daduwal said on Monday that he was quitting as the ‘parallel’ jathedar of Takht Damdama Sahib.The radical Sikh preacher made the announcement after paying obeisance at Talwandi Sabo in Bathinda.Daduwal informed Hindustan Times over the phone that the HSGMC would seek help from the Centre and the governments of Haryana and Punjab to fight the case in Supreme Court on taking over management of about 55 historic gurdwaras in Haryana. A delegation will soon meet union home minister Amit Shah and the Haryana and Punjab chief ministers, he said. “I have decided to focus on... socio-religious affairs while heading the HSGMC. Now it is up to the Sarbat Khalsa (congregation) to hand over the service of the Takht Damdama Sahib to another individual accepted by the panthic bodies,” Daduwal added.“Our activities will not be limited to propagate Sikhism, but the Haryana panel will work against drugs and to provide education and training at institutes for competitive examinations. Activities of HSGMC will be extended beyond Haryana,” he said.The 45-year-old Sikh from the Damdami Taksal seminary, once headed by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, was among people appointed as ‘parallel’ jathedars by the Sarbat Khalsa held by Sikh radicals in Amritsar in November 2015, where the “removal” of those appointed by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) was also announced.A vocal opponent of Akali patriarch Parkash Singh Badal, Daduwal was one of the first campaigners to protest against the incidents of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib and firing on Sikh protesters in Faridkot district in 2015. “No panthic organisation or individual asked me to step down as jathedar but it is my personal decision. After being elected as the first president of HSGMC on August 13, I had made my mind to work for the independent Sikh Haryana gurdwara panel that was formed after a long struggle,” he added.HSGMC has control over five historic shrines in Haryana.About 55 other prominent shrines in Haryana are still being managed by the SGPC though a petition had been filed in the apex court against the decision of the former Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress government for formation of an independent panel to manage Sikh shrines.As of now there’s status quo on the management of Haryana gurdwaras.“Sikhs of Haryana fought a religious battle against the SGPC that was under the control of Parkash Singh Badal and his family. We are now an elected body representing panth and will pursue the legal battle for independence of shrines,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-gurdwara-panel-chief-quits-as-parallel-jathedar-of-takht-damdama-sahib/story-lGQM9YyDqeE9Sl2TVNigfO.html

24-08-2020||Mumbai||Asian palm civet trapped inside Mulund home, rescued||A male Asian palm civet was found trapped inside a residential house in Mulund in the intervening night of Sunday and Monday. The civet was found taking shelter inside an empty house in Panchsheel Nagar, Mulund amid heavy showers.Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus) is a small viverrid (small to medium sized mammals) native to South and Southeast Asia and is protected under Schedule II of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 in India. They are fast-paced animals, extremely shy and wary of humans and other animals.Animal rescue group Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW) was informed about the civet’s presence by locals. “Since the house was empty as the family was away, a neighbour spotted the civet making an attempt to find its way out of the house when it stopped raining. However, he noticed that the civet was unable to help itself out of the house and reported it to us on the helpline,” said Pawan Sharma, president, RAWW.A five-member rescue team, led by Joaquim Naik, and members of the state forest department reached the spot and found the civet hiding in a small empty water tub at one corner of the house. “It was safely rescued by our team in coordination with the forest department by early morning on Monday,” said Sharma. He added that the civet was medically examined by veterinarian Dr Rina Dev and would be kept under observation until released back into the wild, once the forest department declares it fit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/asian-palm-civet-trapped-inside-mulund-home-rescued/story-NWAJzsqEZgmkfxE2vbPL2H.html
24-08-2020||City||Uttarakhand BJP re-inducts MLA who was expelled after gun-toting dance video||A year after the BJP expelled Pranav Singh ‘Champion’ , its MLA form Khanpur in Uttarakhand from the party’s primary membership following a viral video of the lawmaker dancing with guns, he was taken back into the fold on Monday.The re-induction took place at a function at state BJP president Bansidhar Bhagat’s residence here.Champion was re-inducted into the party after Bhagat had summoned him and three other BJP MLAs mired in controversy, to present their side before the party leadership. The other three MLAs include Dwarahat MLA Mahesh Negi, who was recently accused of rape by a woman, Jhabreda MLA Deshraj Karnwal and Lohaghat MLA Pooran Singh Fartyal, who were both served show cause notices for indiscipline earlier. Champion, who had come to attend the function with his wife and other family members, was welcomed back into the party by Bhagat. In July last year, he was expelled from the party’s primary membership for six years after a video featuring him dancing with guns and alcohol in an indecent manner surfaced. He was also heard using abusive words for Uttarakhand state and its residents in the video. Welcoming him back into the party, Bhagat said, “There were talks in the party since last one year to take him back. On that line, we spoke to him during the party’s core committee meeting on Sunday and told him that he would be taken back if he promises to work as per the party constitution and not indulge in any controversy. He agreed to both and apologised.” “We then decided to revoke his suspension and take him back. It was our duty to make him realise his mistake which he did. Also, it was taken into consideration that in the last one year during his suspension, he remained in discipline without any controversy,” said Bhagat. Expressing his gratitude to Bhagat and the party leadership for taking him back, Champion said, “I have apologised wholeheartedly to the party president. I have realised my mistake and promised that I will always abide by the party constitution and remain in discipline away from any controversy.” “The party is like my mother and I will always be ready to serve it.” At Monday’s meeting, Bhagat also spoke about ‘forgiving’ MLA Deshraj Karnwal for his indiscipline. Karnwal was served a show-cause notice for misbehaving with party workers in his constituency. An audio clip had gone viral in which he was purportedly heard using inappropriate words against a party worker while speaking to him. “We have also spoken to Karnwal on the incident to which he too apologised and assured that such an incident will never be repeated. The leadership then decided to forgive him,” said Bhagat with Karnwal standing alongside him during the function. Karnwal who claimed that the audio clip circulated was doctored, said, “I have always worked for the development of the party and will continue to do so. I have apologised to the party leadership and will always be disciplined.” Lawmakers Negi and Fartyal did not show up for the meeting.“Negi said that he didn’t get any information about the summon from the party but got to know only through newspaper reports on Sunday. Hence, he couldn’t reach on time. He will reach here by the evening,” Bhagat said.On the rape allegations against him, Bhagat said, “The allegations are serious as they have pointed towards his character. However, police are probing the whole matter including his wife’s complaint against the woman for trying to blackmail and extort Rs 5 crore from him.” “If after the investigation, Negi is found guilty, the party will take strict action against him as discipline is everything in our organisation,” said Bhagat. On Fartyal he said, he couldn’t be contacted as his phone was switched off. “If he doesn’t reach today, then he will be asked to come some other day.” Fartyal was also served show cause notice after he protested against the government’s move of awarding the contract of Tanakpur-Jauljibi road construction in his constituency to a contractor who was earlier blacklisted. The Uttarakhand unit of the Congress termed the development as the end of ‘ethical values in BJP.’ Pritam Singh, party state president said, “BJP says that Champion has apologised and hence he has been taken back. We want to know, what new qualities has he acquired that he has been taken back after one year of his expulsion?” “He had abused the state and its people in the video which all watched. If despite that, he has been taken back, then we think ethical values have lost place in BJP,” he said. Singh also attacked the BJP for not taking any action against Negi so far. “The allegations against him are serious. The woman has been demanding a DNA test to prove her claims but no action has been taken by the government so far. The CM said that Negi is ready for it but it will be as per law. I want to ask, CM is also the home minister, then what is stopping him from directing a DNA test for him?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uttarakhand-bjp-re-inducts-mla-who-was-expelled-after-gun-toting-dance-video/story-vL8oaNfMhzkCAqBpMAIsGL.html

24-08-2020||City||J&K reports decline in hospitalisation, experts say complacency may cause surge in Covid-19 cases||Restrictions have finally been lifted from Kashmir valley and the number of Covid-related hospitalisations have come down. However, with residents disregarding standard operating procedures (SoPs) such as wearing masks and observing social distancing, experts say their complacency may lead to a surge in cases in the near future. Doctors say there has been a decline in the number of Covid-19 patients being hospitalised in the region over the last 10 days. Primarily, because most patients with mild symptoms are undergoing treatment at home. Only those in a critical condition are being hospitalised, which has reduced the demand for oxygen cylinders. Only a fortnight ago, there was rampant chaos in health institutions with no beds available. “Up until a fortnight, I would examine around 15 to 20 patients with bilateral pneumonia. However, now I see five to six patients a day, which is a good sign,” said a senior consultant at Government Medical College (GMC), Srinagar. Government Medical College and Hospital, Baramulla, medical superintendent Dr Masood said, “The situation has stabilised. People are no longer panicking and patients are getting adequate attention. “Though fatalities are also taking place. It is true that fewer people are being hospitalised. The government’s decision of allowing Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms to recuperate at home has also reduced the burden on hospitals. “At present, there are 50 beds available for Covid-19 patients.” ‘DO NOT TAKE VIRUS LIGHTLY’GMC, Srinagar, social preventive medicine head Dr Salim Khan said only patients with moderate to severe symptoms are being admitted to hospitals. He said the number of cases being reported had come down after the lockdown. “People must follow SoP’s, which is integral to bring down Covid-19 cases. We should not take this disease lightly and must follow protocols.”At Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), one of the leading hospitals in Kashmir, the patient influx has come down. “There are fewer Covid-19 patients at the hospital. Earlier, we had 276 patients, now only 140 patients remain,” says medical superintendent, SKIMS, Dr Farooq Jan said. He, however, said the reason why fewer people were reporting to the hospital must be studied. “Getting less patients is a good sign, but we must not lower our guard,” he cautioned. Doctors have warned that people should not be complacent until a vaccine comes up. “Many people are not wearing masks and following social distancing. Some people are arranging marriage ceremonies and family functions, which could prove detrimental in the coming days,” said Dr Amjid of GMC, Srinagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-reports-decline-in-hospitalisation-experts-say-complacency-may-cause-surge-in-covid-19-cases/story-8umocDYPC0eeMCUtAXK1DM.html

Instead of providing relief to the people during the pandemic, central and state governments are busy in spreading communalism and providing benefits to big corporate houses by selling banks, airports, railways and government-owned companies, he alleged.CPI (M) has also urged the people of the state to participate in these protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-cpi-m-to-hold-state-wide-protests-against-govt-tomorrow/story-pbtJfXEDvpo5hoRLbUBa1J.html

24-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi to have an integrated hospital management system in a year: Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that all hospitals, polyclinics and mohalla clinics of the state government will be integrated onto a common online system, possibly a mobile phone application, within a year.Kejriwal made the announcement after virtually launching a mobile app and an online outpatient department (OPD) appointment system for Shri Dada Dev Matri Avum Shishu Chikitsalaya on Monday. The chief minister also said the bed capacity of the hospital will be increased from 106 beds to 281 beds. “The Delhi government is bringing together all hospitals in Delhi through a ‘hospital management information system’ (HMIS), including mohalla clinics, polyclinics, multi-speciality and super-speciality hospitals. This is a very ambitious project and will be completed within one year. I have shown the app to many people and the app has various features. We will integrate all those features with our HMIS to improve the system’s efficiency,” Kejriwal said.Talking about the mobile app and online OPD services launched at the Dada Dev Hospital, Kejriwal said the facility conducts around 10,000 deliveries annually, making it an important facility. “If two-three women are being treated on a single bed, this is not right, especially in Delhi, which is the national capital. This issue will be solved with the expansion of the hospital,” he said. Shri Dada Dev Matri Avum Shishu Chikitsalaya is a 106-bedded hospital located in south-west Delhi’s Dabri to provide mother and child healthcare services. The hospital has a campus of 10,470 square metres, including hostel and staff accommodation facilities, according to the Delhi government’s website.This is the first hospital established by the Delhi government to provide mother and child healthcare services in an ‘integrated way’, the government said. The app launched on Monday is aimed at benefitting pregnant women, who can book their appointments from the comfort of their homes. They will have to reach the doctors’ rooms just half an hour before their appointment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-to-have-an-integrated-hospital-management-system-in-a-year-kejriwal/story-NSmjEVZJrTcaLKeJaQu49L.html

The pilgrimage to Mata Vaishno Devi Temple resumed on August 16, nearly five months after it was suspended due to the pandemic on March 18.The shrine board is abiding with all central health norms to contain the spread of virus. Only 2,000 people are allowed to visit the shrine per day. Shrine board CEO Ramesh Kumar said, “It was already decided that pilgrims from outside J&K will not be allowed without a valid Covid-19 negative report but we noticed that few yatris were not following the guidelines. Therefore, they were not allowed to undertake the pilgrimage.” “We have reiterated our guidelines again for the wider dissemination of people living outside the UT. We would like to inform them again that pilgrims from outside J&K must come with valid Covid-19 negative report not older than 48 hours when they reach Katra so as to avoid any hardships. Those without it shall not be allowed under any circumstances.” For local pilgrims, rapid antigen tests are being conducted at the Katra base camp before allowing them to undertake the yatra. On August 21, two pilgrims from Bihar had tested positive at Katra. Kumar said, “They had not entered the track and were not in Ban Ganga. They were in a colony,” he added. Last week, lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha, who is also the chairman of the shrine board, had paid obeisance at the sanctum sanctorum and prayed for peace, progress and prosperity in Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vaishno-devi-yatra-covid-19-negative-report-not-older-than-48-hrs-mandatory-for-pilgrims/story-pe9r4qe3CwCBQVHlQstH1J.html

Some drew flowers or Ganpati to mark the occasion, while others focused on the theme of Covid-19.“Since it is a festive season, many patients at the centre might be missing their families. To keep them engaged and give them positive vibes, we decided to hold a drawing competition for the patients. Most of them participated and showcased their talent,” said Chavan.

Lalu was recently shifted to RIMS director’s bungalow from a paying ward to avoid Covid-19 infection. The paying ward has been converted as designated Covid-19 centre at RIMS.“RJD has supported Hemant Soren government, and hence Soren Government is giving him a red carpet treatment as a return gift violating all rules and jail manuals. This is not right,” said Jharkhand BJP spokesperson Pratul Shah Deo.“We doubt that the bungalow is gradually becoming the election office of RJD. Lalu Yadav has been convicted by the court, but Hemant Soren government is making a mockery out of this. This should stop immediately. Furthermore, we demand district administration and jail IG all that entry and exit point should be brought under CCTV surveillance to keep off the people who are meeting with Lalu Prasad Yadav,” he added.However, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) termed BJP allegations baseless and misleading. JMM General Secretary Vinod Pandey said, “BJP’s main motive is to defame the government in any manners. This is why BJP takes every issue in that direction. They forget their responsibility towards the people of Jharkhand. Everyone knows under what circumstances Lalu Yadav was shifted to the bungalow. He was a prisoner then and even now.”In Bihar Assembly election JMM will contest in alliance with RJD and Congress. Seat sharing is yet to be decided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/jharkhand-bjp-accuses-state-govt-of-giving-special-treatment-to-lalu-prasad-yadav/story-xY2uqC4jHi1D6pGOkbNxVJ.html

Sonepat superintendent of police Jashandeep Randhawa said that the bodies of the couple, who belonged to the same village in the district, were found in a canal in Jhajjar on Sunday. “The bodies were handed over to their families and were cremated on Sunday evening. The man’s parents have accused the woman’s family of killing them and throwing the bodies in the canal,” the SP said. The man’s mother told the police on Saturday that her son had eloped with an 18-year-old woman of the village on August 10. She said that the woman’s parents caught them from Jind’s Safidon a week ago and killed them. The couple fled their homes on August 10 as their parents were opposed to the match. They got married at a temple in Rohtak and left for Jind. A case of murder was registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bodies-of-sonepat-couple-who-ran-away-from-home-recovered-from-canal-in-haryana-s-jhajjar/story-GhrJNPnJ8rfHjmxLSUV8qI.html

24-08-2020||Chandigarh||McLeodganj’s iconic Nowrojee General Store to shut shop after 160 years||Dharamshala: Located in the heart of McLeodganj town and barely a kilometre from Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama’s abode, the iconic Nowrojee & Sons General Merchants will shut shop next month after a 160-year run. The Parsi family that owns one of the oldest shops in Himachal Pradesh from the British era has sold the property and is in the process of winding up the business. Though the store-cum-residence has seen six generations of the Nowrojee family at the helm, Nauzer Nowrojee was the most popular and was a friend of the Dalai Lama, for more than 60 years before his death in 2002. “It’s been a tough decision but sometimes you have to let go of things,” says Nauzer’s younger son and Delhi-based owner Parvez Nowrojee, who is retired from a private company and was running the shop with the help of caretaker since 2010. Nauzer’s elder son Kurush Nowrojee owns a tea business in West Bengal. At present, Parvez and Kurush are in McLeodganj to collect their belongings and wrap up business. DOWN MEMORY LANE Nowrojees manufactured aerated drinks and mineral water and sold wine, grocery brands, bakery products, tobacco, toiletries, and even arms and ammunition. Its closure is a heartbreaking moment for local residents. “This store is witness to many a historic event and how the towns of Dharamshala and McLeodganj evolved,” says Prem Sagar, 58, who runs a book shop and tour and travel business opposite the store. “It’s is sad moment for people like me who were emotionally attached to the store. But change is the law of nature and this is how history is created,” he said. Another resident Kul Prakash Sharma, 50, said: “We will miss this store that is synonymous with McLeodganj. I have a collection of labels and stickers from this shop. They will now become souvenirs. I’ve heard the wooden structure will be gone soon.” OLD WORLD CHARM INTACT Nowadays, the shop sells newspapers, magazines and confectionary besides exhibiting relics from a bygone era. Housed in the wooden structure are antiques, including a Petromax 835 Special, which is a Germany-made hanging wick lamp. There are cases of imported cigarette brands such as Passing Show, Craven A, and Number Ten Virginia. Advertising posters from the British era, Blue Bird toffees and old wine and beer bottles are also available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mcleodganj-s-iconic-nowrojee-general-store-to-shut-shop-after-160-years/story-SDT8WUWQ0plLiC8Sv0pbmM.html
24-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt’s camps for registration of construction workers off to a slow start||The Delhi government’s special camps to help construction workers register for a state-run welfare fund kicked off to a slow start on Monday even as several assembly constituencies were yet to start the drive. The camps that began from 10am on Monday will continue till September 12. Day one saw a lot of family members turn up at the centres on behalf of the construction workers. The office of labour minister Gopal Rai told HT that the government will focus on areas such as Burari, Karawal Nagar, Badarpur, Najafgarh, Matiala, Babarpur and so on as most construction workers stay there. The special drive comes after the Delhi High Court (HC) on May 2 directed the Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board, which is under the aegis of the labour department of the Delhi government, to take steps to renew the membership of all the workers, in a bid to cushion their lockdown-induced loss of earnings. The court had observed that over 500,000 construction workers in Delhi, who fell off the safety net under the watch of the city’s welfare board, cannot be deprived of benefits just because they were unable to renew their annual registration.Also Read: Delhi govt’s welfare fund for construction workers: All you need to knowAt 12pm in Matiala’s Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya (SKV), a dozen people gathered around the counter. After an hour, only three of the 12 were found eligible. “There was one paan seller, others were mostly street vendors and hawkers. We explained to them that this drive is only for construction workers and to be eligible one would need a certificate from the construction company or builder where the person is employed,” said Gulab Singh, the MLA from Matiala constituency. Sudesh Rai, a worker who was registered at the Matiala camp, said he works in a housing project of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA). “Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) workers brought here me. Now I am told I can avail of nearly 18 different assistance schemes including Rs 51,000 for the wedding of my daughter and Rs 2 lakh to my family if I die on duty,” he said. Construction workers, including plumbers and electricians employed in the construction sector, painters, tile workers and security guards aged between 18 and 60, are eligible for registration under the scheme. They must possess a photo identity card, a bank account number, a residential proof for Delhi and other documents to prove that they have worked in the construction sector for at least 90 days in the 12 months prior to the registration, said an official in charge of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led government’s initiative.In Najafgarh, a camp in another Delhi government school saw several women stand in line, most of whom were related to the concerned applicant. The camps will function five days a week—from Monday to Friday between 10 am and 4 pm. “A tent has been set up for people to sit comfortably and wait for their turn, keeping in mind social distancing norms. A facility for drinking water has also been made available at the centre. Due to Covid-19, a lot of workers are yet to return from their home states, because of which the numbers continue to be low. Such camps will have to be set up at regular intervals to help  more construction workers register,” said Kailash Gahlot, the state transport minister and MLA from Najafgarh. When asked about the number of people who have been registered so far, the labour minister’s office said, “It has just been over three hours since these camps opened. We have not yet compiled the number of people who have turned up across the 70 assembly constituencies. But the aim is to spread the word to as many people as possible so that in the next few days, the number of applicants increases. The main role in this is that of the MLAs.”But the story was very different in the constituencies with legislators from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Karawal Nagar MLA and senior BJP leader Mohan Singh Bisht said no such camp was set up in his constituency as on Monday. “I have not been informed about this drive by the Delhi government. There has been absolutely no communication. We shall continue doing whatever is possible at our own level,” he said. In Badarpur, another area with a large number of construction workers, the scenario seemed bleak. Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, the area MLA and leader of opposition in the Delhi assembly, said he got to know about the government’s initiative through the full-page newspaper advertisements on Monday. “The advertisement mentions most of the schools through acronyms only. How will a humble worker understand the location of the camp? In Karawal Nagar, the camp’s location has been given as GGSSx-1. There are 18 schools in my constituencies and so I sent my workers to each school in order to find out where the camp has been set up. But we could not find any till now,” Bidhuri said. He suggested that the government send an official communication to him as the leader of opposition so that all the BJP MLAs are informed about the drive and necessary steps are taken.Every state has a welfare board which runs an array of beneficial schemes, funded by the cess collected from projects under the Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Cess Act, 1996.In Delhi, the board started disbursing Rs 5,000 a month during the nationwide lockdown—which has been imposed since the end of March in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and triggered a mass job loss in the realty sector—to the bank accounts of the enrolled workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/camps-for-construction-workers-open-in-delhi/story-l6QjPYMcEdjRDwz2VTGDdP.html

The water level recorded at Delhi’s Old Yamuna Bridge was 204.38 metres, close to the warning level of 204.50 metres. This was after 5,883 cusecs water was released from the Hathni Kund Barrage in the Yamuna at 8 am, said officials of the Delhi government’s Irrigation and Flood Control (I&FC) department. According to officials, more water is released from the Hathni Kund Barrage during the monsoon, when there is heavy rainfall in the hilly regions and the capacity of the dam is reached. The first danger mark is when the water level rises to 205.33 metres. “There is light rainfall in Delhi as well. So far, we don’t expect the water level to rise further today,” said Sanjeev Kumar, SDM (Preet Vihar) and officer-in-charge, Flood Control. He added that preparations are already underway in case people living around the Yamuna need to be evacuated. “We have already identified locations for pitching tents. Also, since social distancing is the norm during the Covid-19 pandemic, we have also identified some schools where people can be moved in with enough space to maintain physical distancing,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-yamuna-water-level-close-to-warning-level/story-TNM0ImDqohmY8zIxI3ME6O.html

Earlier they had been extended till August 31.The court, however, said, “Needless to clarify that in case the extension of interim order causes any hardship of an extreme nature to a party to such proceeding, they would be at liberty to seek appropriate relief, as may be advised.” The court also said that 2,900 prisoners have so far been released on interim bail and the idea is to ensure that the released prisoners do not return. “The idea is to ensure that the released prisoners do not return to prison as asymptomatic patients of Covid-19, especially when the prisons are overcrowded,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-extends-all-interim-orders-till-october-31/story-LZgMn5VtnkqnKSg5VmHKsM.html
24-08-2020||Patna||Stage set for 6 new VCs, 8 P-VCs before Bihar poll notification||The Raj Bhavan is now racing against time to appoint vice-chancellors (VC) and pro vice-chancellors in Bihar’s state universities. Several of the present VCs and Pro VCs have been holding additional charges for the past few months.In Bihar, of the 12 state universities, the post of VC is vacant in six and that of pro-VC in eight. According to sources, the process of filling up these posts is in the advanced stages and could be notified by the end of the month, following mandatory consultation—there has to be a meaningful consultation between the governor and the chief minister, as per the direction of the Supreme Court—on the panel of names submitted by the search committee for each university.The apex court had, in an unprecedented move in 2013, quashed the appointment of all the VCs and P-VCs appointed during the tenure of former Bihar governor Devanand Konwar and called for a transparent mechanism involving “meaningful and effective” consultation between the Chancellor and the state government.“The Chief Minister may be invited to Raj Bhavan next week. Due to elections, the government may also like to have its social combination right, as at present there is only one VC from Bihar in state varsities, while the rest are from neighbouring UP,” said an official.In some state universities, confidential reports about some candidates in the panel have also been sought by the Raj Bhavan, raising hopes for aspirants from Bihar.The notification for the posts of VC and pro-VC was issued in March itself, and after that the last date for submitting applications online was extended twice up to May 15 due to the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the last few weeks, the process gathered momentum and the search committees screened candidates online. According to sources in the Raj Bhavan, the interaction of prospective candidates with the search committee is complete for most of the universities.The universities where the post of VC is vacant are Patna University, BN Mandal University (Madhepura), KSD Sanskrit University, Lalit Narayan Mithila University (both Darbhanga), Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University and JP University (Chapra).On May 8, Raj Bhavan had directed all the acting VCs not to take any policy decisions, viz. matters related to appointment and promotion, conversing senate, syndicate or academic council meetings and decisions with financial implications without prior approval of the Chancellor. They were asked to carry out only day-to-day routine work.In BN Mandal University (Madhepura), dean, faculty of humanities, and head, department of philosophy, Gyanranjan Dwivedi, has been performing the duties of the VC by the order of Raj Bhavan since May 26 after the term of AK Roy as VC ended.BRABU VC Prof Hanuman Prasad Pandey holds the additional charge of Jai Prakash University (Chapra) since March 20. Before him, Magadh University VC professor Rajendra Prasad held the additional charge of JPU VC from January 24 to March 20. Purnea University VC Rajesh Singh has been holding the additional charge of Lalit Narayan Mithila University since March 20. In addition, he also holds the charge of KSDSU.Nalanda Open University VC HN Prasad holds the additional charge for Patna University, while Bihar Agriculture University VC Ajoy Kumar Singh holds the additional charge of TMBU.In 2017 also, when the appointment process was delayed, the chancellor had to make ad hoc arrangement in eight universities by giving charge to the senior-most professors when the terms of the respective VCs ended.“Due to the delayed start of the process for the appointment of VCs, the appointment of VCs and P-VCs invariably gets delayed. This time, the lockdown has also contributed to this. Ideally, the process should start 3-4 months before the date os vacancy arises,” said DM Diwakar, former director of AN Sinha Institute of Social Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/stage-set-for-6-new-vcs-8-p-vcs-before-bihar-poll-notification/story-Xt3yAkyGPbgr7IGaIBh8jJ.html
24-08-2020||Lifestyle||Finally, you can check-in to a hotel in Delhi||After months of being shut, hotels in the Capital are all set to welcome guests with safety protocols in place. The move comes after the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) gave a go-ahead to the hotel industry to restart operations. Hotels have been advised to undertake precautionary measures such as social distancing at buffet, disposable menus, payments via e-wallets, thorough sanitisation and cleaning of washrooms, crowd management, etc. The DDMA order states, “Hotels will be permitted to operate throughout the National Capital Territory of Delhi in all areas, except the containment zones, subject to strict compliance of standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on June 4, 2020, and other instructions and guidelines of Government of India and Government of NCT of Delhi from time to time.” Hoteliers and staff management hail the move and state that this will bring a shift towards better digital facilities and features, lend a hand to support the livelihood of workforce disturbed due to the pandemic, and will additionally brace up the hospitality sector.Read: Delhi hotels asked to anti-Covid-19 measures like e-wallets, disposable menusWelcoming the move of the government for reopening of hotels in Delhi, Jyotsna Suri, chairperson and managing director, The LaliT Suri Hospitality Group believes that the decision will enable the revival of the industry and help sustain the livelihood of many employees affected by the lockdown. She says, “We look forward to resuming operations as per new norms and with strict hygiene and sanitisation protocols.”“We are excited to welcome back our guests with reopening of our rooms, restaurants and salon as per government norms. The most important element of welcoming back guests is doing it safely, and we are going beyond cleaning to advance care across our entire hotel for our guests. Our measures are not limited to just cleanliness, social distancing, temperature checks, PPE for colleagues but also less contact, more care with enhanced digital amenities and features along with exceptional food and beverage experiences that are a crucial part of the excitement of travel,” says Julian Ayers, general manager, Hyatt Regency Delhi.

Prateek Verma, who works at a hotel in Delhi says, “We will be coming back to business after a long gap. The new necessary measures mean that the staff will be trained accordingly. It is a sigh of relief but there’s a long way to go!”The re-opening of hotels will also prove to be a boon for tourism sector. In an official statement, union tourism minister Prahlad Singh Patel, said, “Opening of the two biggest segments of the tourism industry viz hotels and restaurants in the country’s capital is positive move that will help push domestic travel and give much relief to the industry which has been reading itself with all health and safety protocols”.Denizens too rejoice as they believe one enjoy a staycation or a workation.

Another resident, Ankit Kumar, an advertising professional adds, “This is such a great news! Travelling seems to be a little off the charts right now and considering the workload, so it can be a good option to check-in at a hotel and have a workation.”Interact with author/ Sanchita_kalra.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/finally-you-can-check-in-to-a-hotel-in-delhi/story-k94t62BZ3cDorsTjBpKZGI.html
24-08-2020||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh HC grants anticipatory bail to man, says if husband goes to jail, marriage will end||Madhya Pradesh high court’s principal bench at Jabalpur has granted an anticipatory bail to a man facing charges of cruelty and dowry demands by his wife, with the observation that if he goes to jail, the marriage would surely come to an end. Also read: Odisha woman strangles infant daughter, attempts suicideAs per the court’s Friday order, the man from Dindori district faces a First Information Report (FIR) lodged by his wife with Shahpura police station on June 19, 2020, under sections 294 (Obscene acts and songs), 498-A (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act. In her FIR, the woman alleged that her husband abused her, demanded a gold chain of 5 tola and was asking for s plot of land, which is in the name of her father, to be transferred to him. The woman also alleged that the accused locked her in a room,refused her medical aid, harassed her for sex and also subjected her to unnatural sex. The man pleaded in the court that his wife lodged the FIR against him in retaliation to a complaint he had lodged with Karanjiya police station in the district on June 8, 2020, that his in-laws were not allowing her to return to him after taking her away. While granting an anticipatory bail to the petitioner, the court observed, “Looking at the facts and circumstances of the case, I find that the allegations are trivial and can happen in any marital home. Marriages would always experience some friction or the other. There are no signs of injuries on the body of the complainant...This court is also of the opinion that if the applicant goes to jail, the marriage would almost surely come to an end as thereafter there would be hardly any chances of compromise. However, as the allegations reveal that they are trivial in nature, a window of compromise or settlement is always kept open.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-hc-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-man-says-if-husband-goes-to-jail-marriage-will-end/story-NI5hDKGktk2RbverGD8I5J.html
24-08-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Four BJP MLAs mired in controversies to meet state president today||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s four MLAs, including Dwarahat MLA Mahesh Negi who has been accused of rape and Khanpur MLA Kunwar Pranav Singh ‘Champion’ who was expelled from the party for six years for indiscipline, will be meeting state unit president Banshidhar Bhagat on Monday. The four MLAs—Champion, Negi, Jhabreda MLA Deshraj Karnwal and Lohaghat MLA Pooran Singh Fartyal—were summoned by Bhagat on Saturday to present their side of the controversies they are involved in. Among the four, Champion was expelled from the party’s primary membership last July after a video featuring him dancing with guns and liquor went viral. He was contacted by the party headquarters on Sunday and is likely to be taken back today. “I was contacted by the party leadership over the phone on Sunday and was told that the party is thinking of revoking my expulsion and taking me back. But I shouldn’t behave in an undisciplined manner and abide by the party constitution,” Champion said, adding, “I agreed to all that unequivocally.” He said, “After my expulsion, during the last year, I was not embroiled in any controversy and worked for the party like a normal worker. I will be thankful to the leadership of they take me back.” Champion also came into light for his rivalry with fellow MLA Karnwal, who has also summoned by Bhagat. A few party workers accused from his constituency accused him of misbehaviour, after which the party headquarters served him a show-cause notice months ago. “The party leadership contacted me on Sunday. I apologised and said I have always worked as per the party constitution. I also said that an audio clip in which I was purportedly heard speaking inappropriately with a worker was doctored. I have already submitted a complaint regarding that to the police,” said Karnwal. Of the remaining two MLAs, Dwarahat’s Negi was accused of raping a married woman and fathering a child a few days ago. The woman has been demanding a DNA test to prove her allegations. Though Negi has refuted the allegations, the controversy has damaged the image of the party and he has been summoned by Bhagat. Lohaghat MLA Fartyal was given a show-cause notice by the party a few months ago for indiscipline and anti-party activities after he opposed a contract given by state government to a blacklisted contractor for the construction of Tanakpur-Jauljibi road under his constituency. Both Fartyal and Negi couldn’t be contacted for comments despite several attempts. When asked about the development, Devendra Bhasin, the party’s state vice-president, said, “All the four are marred by controversy for which they were summoned. Discipline is very important in our party organisation. However, any decision will be taken by party president Bhagat only.” The Congress, meanwhile, has termed the development and possible revocation of Champion’s expulsion as a ‘degradation of ethical values’. Garima Dasauni, the Congress state spokesperson, said, “It does not surprise us that Champion could be taken back as ethical values in the state BJP are already going down. In the viral video, he was seen dancing obscenely and abusing Uttarakhand and it’s people. Despite that, if he is taken back, then there is nothing left to say.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-four-bjp-mlas-mired-in-controversies-to-meet-state-president-today/story-liq2NzyOePnw9kBSWkcfLO.html
24-08-2020||Patna||PM-initiated 500-bed Covid care hospital in Patna opens to public||The 500-bed makeshift Covid Care Hospital at Bihta in Patna, funded under the PM CARES (Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency situations), was opened to public on Monday afternoon. Union minister of state for home affairs, Nityanand Rai, inaugurated the hospital in presence of Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey. “PM-CARES Fund Trust has decided to allocate funds for fight against COVID-19 by way of establishment of 500-bed COVID-19 makeshift hospitals at Patna and Muzaffarpur, Bihar, by DRDO. This will go a long way in improving COVID care in Bihar,” PMO India tweeted. Earlier, in mid-July, a Central team had cautioned the state on hospital infrastructure and suggested setting up temporary field hospitals, taking into consideration the case growth trajectory for at least the next two months. “A similar hospital at Muzaffarpur is expected to be ready by August 30,” said Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Pratyaya Amrit. The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), which was entrusted with the project, has provided hospital infrastructure, which includes 125 ICU (intensive care unit) beds with ventilators, monitors; and 375 normal beds. Centralised piped oxygen supply will be available for each bed. The director-general, Armed Forces Medical Services Doctors, will provide doctors and other support staff, stated a press release issued by DRDO. It will also handle medical documentation and medico-legal issues, the communique added. “The state government has provided nurses, free uninterrupted water and power supply, air conditioners in 25 rooms with soft furnishing, security arrangements and fire tenders with crew,” said Amrit. The hospital will be equipped with CCTV surveillance system. DRDO has also made pharmacy, medical pathology laboratory, catering, laundry and ambulance services available. All services will be free, the communique said. The DRDO will also take care of the computerised hospital management system, providing personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and sanitiser, housekeeping services, consumable items, furniture and soft furnishing, such as bed sheets, pillows, pillow covers, blankets, towels, etc. It will also provide maintenance staff for specialised services like electrical works, air conditioning, operating diesel generator sets, etc., the communique added. The PM had directed the Ministry of Home Affairs to establish 500-bed hospitals at Patna and Muzaffarpur, considering the gravity of the Covid-19 situation in Bihar. The MHA approached the DRDO to make one each in Patna and Muzaffarpur along the same lines as the 1,000-bed Sardar Vallabhai Patel makeshift Covid hospital in Delhi. As on Monday, Bihar reported a total 1,23,383 Covid-19 cases with 627 deaths. Patna alone reported 19,112 cases and 124 deaths, the highest in Bihar. Muzaffarpur came next with 5,298 cases and 25 deaths. The Central team had also advised the state to increase the number of all health personnel on the front-lines, ensure infection prevention practices and proper roster system for patient management, besides making available sufficient logistics and a regular supply of oxygen in all Covid-19 hospitals. On July 23, Bihar health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh had said that of the 40,000 beds designated for district Covid care centres (for mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic Covid-19 patients), 20,000 beds had been readied. The department was then in the process of arranging for 4,000 additional beds in dedicated Covid health centres in districts for patients with mild-to-moderate cases, besides increasing 3,500 beds (against an existing 2,500 approx. then) for the third level at medical college hospitals, which are for severe and critical cases. The health department Monday did not share an update on the availability of beds for Covid patients and the occupancy .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/pm-initiated-500-bed-covid-care-hospital-in-patna-to-open-today/story-pEu2aoMPllsFVCZx7cHGEO.html

The monsoon trough (line of low pressure) is active and situated south of its normal position (from Ganganagar to Bay of Bengal). A low pressure area has formed over North Bay of Bengal on Monday. Low pressure areas are the main rain bearing system during the monsoon, which bring a lot of rain to the core monsoon region (parts of central and east India). Due to this, rainfall is likely to increase over east and central India once again.Also Read: Yamuna water rises close to warning levelHeavy to very heavy rain is very likely over Odisha from August 24 to 26, with extremely heavy rainfall in parts of the state on August 25; over Gangetic West Bengal during August 25 and 26 and Jharkhand during August 26 and 27.Due to the convergence of lower level easterlies from Bay of Bengal and south-westerlies from Arabian Sea, rainfall activity is also likely to increase over northwest India from August 25: Jammu & Kashmir, Gilgit, Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh are likely to record heavy rain from August 25 to 28 and Uttarakhand is likely to record heavy to very heavy rain from August 25 to 28.Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh are likely to record widespread and heavy rain on August 26 and 27.Overall, the monsoon rain over the country since June 1 has been 7% in excess, with 6% in excess over east and northeast India; 14% deficient over northwest India; 13% in excess over central India and 26% in excess over the south Peninsula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/light-rain-likely-in-delhi/story-50glsXzX3UmItgqk53shHO.html

24-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to ramp up testing with more antigen tests||After exhausting over 70% of the rapid antigen kits to test for Covid-19, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is now procuring 50, 000 more kits by September. This is to ramp up their testing in the city from next week. So far, the BMC has conducted over 72,000 antigen tests (of the one lakh kits procured in the first week of July).The BMC conducted these tests majorly on frontline workers, shopkeepers, vendors and high-risk contacts. Rapid antigen kits deliver test results within 15-20 minutes, but are less sensitive compared to RT-PCR tests. If a symptomatic patient tests negative through rapid antigen test, s(he) must be tested through RT-PCR.BMC has issued an expression of interest for the procurement of the next instalment of antigen kits. Suresh Kakani, the additional municipal commissioner, said, “We are conducting antigen tests at a much larger scale since the start. For now, we have issued a requirement of 50,000 kits and will procure more in the future.”As of August 22, BMC has conducted over 72,000 tests via the rapid antigen method across the city, of which nearly 4, 000 have resulted in a positive. Considering the good response, as BMC is able to detect infected patients in a shorter span, it has scaled up its testing capacity. Of the total Covid-19 tests conducted daily, more than 50% are via the rapid antigen method.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-ramp-up-testing-with-more-antigen-tests/story-THjJYS0WWn3t3LTSKKosJM.html

The medical university’s Covid-19 task force will also strictly implement the standard operating procedures (SOPs) on the campus such as imposition of fines on violators. Over 200 people from KGMU have tested Covid-19 positive to date, including resident doctors and nurses. “There are about 9,000 staff members, including contractual workforce. We will conduct Covid-19 test on all the staff. We are drawing up a list and a schedule for the exercise,” said Dr Sudhir Singh, spokesperson, KGMU. “Fines and punitive action, as advised by the state (Uttar Pradesh) administration, will be used effectively to enforce wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing norms,” KGMU authorities said in a press note after a meeting of the task force. The V-C has directed the committee members to implement the guidelines at the earliest. Public address (PA) system will be installed at help desks to make patients and attendants aware of the viral outbreak. The task force has also decided to put up barricades at vantage points to prevent overcrowding on the campus of the medical university, use volunteers and interns to make patients and attendants aware about the pandemic, ensure 24x7 monitoring of all waiting areas and effective use of closed-circuit TVs (CCTVs) to keep a tab on the crowd. Communication with patients and attendants will also be made more effective. KGMU’s administrative staff underwent Covid-19 test on Friday after V-C Puri was found to be infected.

24-08-2020||Lucknow||Admn allows tazias at home, azadari with riders after talks with Shia cleric||The Lucknow district administration and Shia clerics have reached a consensus on letting the faithful keep tazias (a replica of the coffin of Imam Hussain carried during Muharram procession to mourn the martyrdom of the grandson of Prophet Mohammad) at home and observe azadari while distancing socially, but the issue of taking out processions remains unresolved. Azadari is the name of the practice followed during the month of Muharram (according to the Islamic calendar)—mourning the martyrdom of Imam Hussain at the Battle of Karbala about 1,340 years ago. Shia clerics have already moved court for permission to hold the Muharram processions. District magistrate Abhishek Prakash said, “The administration has allowed the Shia community members to keep tazias in their homes and observe azadari during Muharram, but with certain restrictions of social distancing.” Prominent Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad had staged a dharna on Saturday evening to protest against restrictions imposed in view of the coronavirus disease pandemic. Following this, the state government directed the district administration to initiate talks with the Shia cleric. District magistrate Abhishek Prakash, along with home secretary SK Bhagat, held a dialogue with Maulana Jawad . “The government has sought a list of Shia clerics in every district, along with their phone numbers, from me. I will provide it. In every district, the Shia clerics will hold a meeting with the district’s civil and police officials in order to coordinate the Muharram activities with them. Everyone knows that tazias and azadari are an integral part of observing Muharram, and Shias cannot compromise on these rituals,” he said. “We had sought permission for majlis (sermons) in all our Imambaras with a gathering of around 1,000 people. Our Imambaras are quite big and we can follow social distancing norms there. But after high-level talks with the state government, they allowed only seven Imambaras in the state capital to hold 60 minutes of majlis with only 20 attendees. Everyone else can watch online,” the Shia cleric added. The district administration also agreed not to harass those who keep tazias at home and perform azadari, said Maulana Jawad. He said, “Lucknow has a sizable Shia population of over three lakh, which takes out a few processions during Muharram. But due to the pandemic this time, no procession has been allowed. We have gone to court over this and expect a decision in a day or two.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/admn-allows-tazias-at-home-azadari-with-riders-after-talks-with-shia-cleric/story-DrptWesYboAXDtisRWaxAM.html

24-08-2020||Delhi||1,450 fresh infections in Capital: Are cases on the up once more?||Delhi on Sunday recorded 1,450 new cases of Covid-19, the highest single-day jump in over a month, amid concerns that infections could be on the rise in the Capital, which became the first major hot spot in the country to largely control the outbreak last month.With the new-case trajectory at a month’s high, clinicians and public health experts said violations of recommended protection protocols such as social distancing and wearing masks in public places, and further relaxation of movement could be reasons behind the rise in cases.On Thursday, the results of Delhi’s second serological survey found that 29.1% of the city’s population may have developed antibodies against Covid-19. Epidemiologists say that this means over 70% of Delhi’s population remains susceptible to infections and the Capital cannot afford to lower its guard.Sunday’s new cases took the total positive cases recorded till date to 161,466. With 16 fresh deaths, the death toll climbed to 4,300. More than 145,000 people have recovered from the disease, the Delhi government said in its health bulletin.“Delhi has done quite well in terms of testing, surveillance, containment measures, contact tracing, and scaling up health infrastructure that led to the drop in overall numbers, but people’s lack of caution is preventing a further drop in cases. There’s laxity in people’s behaviour as far as adopting preventive measures is concerned, which is extremely important along with surveillance and other epidemiological measures, to bring down the rate of infection,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.In the last week, 1,269 new cases have been reported every day on an average. This is the highest this number has touched since July 22, when it was 1,333 – when cases were dropping from the peak so far (see chart).“There is still at least 1.38 crore population that’s susceptible going by Delhi’s sero survey results, and there is direct correlation between vulnerable population and rate of infection. The disease transmission is still there, so cases will not stop being reported completely. No matter how much you increase testing, it is just a supportive measures, what will work eventually is non-pharmacological measures such as physical distancing, cough etiquette, wearing mask/face covers, etc. There is a need to be careful for at least four-five months,” said Dr Sujeet K Singh, director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). NCDC had supported the Delhi government in conducting the first sero-survey around late June and early July.Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain told HT: “The numbers have witnessed fluctuations but it is not sufficient to conclude that there is a change in trend. As of now, the situation of Covid-19 in Delhi is under control. The number of cases recorded every day should not be seen in isolation. One should also consider the increasing recovery rate, reducing positivity rate and decreasing rate of deaths.” Testing, meanwhile, appears to have dropped from its peak levels. Delhi conducted 21,660 daily tests on average for the week ending July 10, the city’s highest recorded rate of testing till date. Since then, this number has dropped to 17,494 in the past week — down by about 15%.Experts have also raised questions about Delhi’s heavy reliance on antigen tests, which they say are not as reliable as gold-standard RT-PCR tests. Over the past month, around seven of every 10 tests conducted in Delhi have been an antigen test (on Sunday, 66% of the total tests were antigen). A high dependence on antigen tests, which throw up more false negatives, can lead to under-detection of cases and tilting crucial data metrics such as positivity rate and case distribution, experts said.With daily tests hitting a plateau, the average positivity rate — the fraction of tests that return positive — has started inching up as well. The number, which had dropped from a peak of 31.4% in mid-June to 5.7% at the end of July, was at 6.8% in the past week. “Unlike how it was in the beginning of the pandemic, our health care infrastructure is comfortably placed to handle the current patient load. We have enough ICU beds, and ventilators, as the number of critically ill patients is low. As I see it, the rate of rise has decreased and the recoveries have gone up,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, critical care department, Medanta Hospital, Gurugram. Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, clinical director, Max Healthcare, said: “The numbers aren’t as bad as they were a couple of months ago.

24-08-2020||Mumbai||Recovered Covid-19 patients’ test results come positive for months||While over 1.09 lakh Covid-19 patients have recovered and been discharged from various city hospitals, hundreds of others require hospitalisation for one month to four months as they continue to remain positive despite recovery, said Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials.According to BMC, in many cases, patients having other health ailments have been hospitalised for over a month to four months until now. These patients are those who recover clinically but test positive despite the recovery. BMC has attributed this prolonged positivity to the viral load of infection in the body that remains despite the patient recovering clinically. Such patients are not discharged until they test negative, considering they have other health ailments, which might complicate their condition.For instance, BMC’s SevenHills Hospital in Andheri, that is a dedicated Covid-19 hospital, has handled nearly 8,000 serious and complicated cases, according to officials. Of this, nearly 15% required hospitalization for over a month.Also read: Goa designer comes up with ‘multi-mask’ for complete protection against Covid-19A discharge after 20-22 days of treatment is normal for discharging a patient from SevenHills Hospital.Dr Balkrishna Adsul, the dean of SevenHills Hospital said, “We have been treating patients, who have comorbidities like kidney ailment or any other chronic disease. Till now, we have treated over 8,000 such patients, and around 15% have required over one month of hospitalisation. These are not youngsters but those who are aged above 60 years of age. They are kept in the hospital for a long period because they tested positive despite recovering and showing no symptoms. We are not discharging such patients until they test negative.” He added that there are multiple reasons behind not discharging patients who have been cured clinically but continue to test positive.“One of the many reasons is that there are several patients who have the fear and want to stay admitted in hospital considering they are positive. Another reason is that several patients have other health issues, and their constant monitoring becomes very important due to this. We have one patient who is admitted since April considering he tests positive despite recovering. We have kept him in hospital since he requires frequent dialysis. Lastly, there is also fear or apprehension in the minds of patients and their families to not take them home when they test positive,” said Adsul.As of Sunday, 1,10,059 patients have been recovered and discharged after Covid-19 treatment in Mumbai. The city’s recovery rate is 80.7%. On Sunday, Mumbai recorded 991 fresh cases and 34 new deaths, taking the city’s case tally to 1,36,353 and toll to 7,422. There are 18,567 active cases in Mumbai having fatality rate of 5.44%. One hot spot that has shown signs of drastic improvement – Dharavi – recorded six new cases on Sunday, bringing the area’s case count to 2,711 of which 2,367 have been discharged.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner said, “We are asking hospitals to not discharge certain patients who have serious health issues and test positive despite recovering. We do not want a situation wherein such a patient, despite being positive, goes home after which he or she develops complications. In the past, we had such a situation reporting from a private hospital, and post this we are keeping such patients in the hospital under observation. We cannot take risks when a patient is already having other health ailments by discharging them.Meanwhile, Madhav Sathe, former professor of microbiology at Nair Hospital, said, “The reason why patients test positive in the test using the RT-PCR method despite recovering, is because this method goes into detail. The reason for testing positive for a long period is probably because of a dead virus present in the body. Such a condition is observed in patients having other health ailments considering the clearance of virus from the body of such patients takes time.”Sathe added, “At times it would be safe to discharge such patients if they have cured clinically, but again it depends from case to case. Also, now we have many vacant beds, which even helps the administration as they can give each patient more time and care.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/recovered-but-covid-patients-test-results-come-positive-for-months/story-TVGjI8uJTTXG5G9Oy2oKnM.html
24-08-2020||Mumbai||BMC to start screening of suspected Covid-19 patients with voice samples, AI from Wednesday||Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will start screening suspected Covid-19 patients through artificial intelligence (AI), using their voice samples from Wednesday. On the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi, the civic body signed the memorandum of understanding (MOU) with an Israel-based startup company, Vocalis Health, for the first-of-its-kind initiative in Mumbai.Vocalis Health is collecting voice samples of people across the globe as an initiative to develop a diagnostic tool to identify Covid-19 infected people. Even though the concept is new, several countries like the US and Israel are using it. People can submit their voice samples for analysis on the company’s official website.From Wednesday, the pan-worldwide study will be initiated in Mumbai at the NESCO jumbo Covid centre, Goregaon. Over 2,000 individuals suspected of having Covid-19 or high-risk contacts of infected patients will be tested with their voice samples.“We signed the MOU on Saturday and the study will start from Wednesday under the supervision of Dr RN Cooper Municipal General Hospital,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. “It will take two to three months to conclude the study,” he said.The gold standard test for diagnosis of the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). But it takes over eight hours to provide the result. Though rapid antigen tests give test results within 30 minutes, as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), its false negativity rate is higher. With the ongoing unlocking of the national lockdown, the civic body needs more economical alternatives to rapidly and accurately diagnose cases of Covid-19. Thus, BMC has decided to start voice analysis to detect the virus within 30 seconds.Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of Nair Dental Hospital and in-charge of NESCO, explained the process. When the symptoms of Covid-19 manifest, the person starts having breathing problems that affect the amount of air exhaled. Then the air interacts with inflamed muscles on its journey to production voices or speeches. These interactions impact the voice modulations — measurable qualities that form the basis of their biomarkers. Depending on its variations, an individual can be detected with Covid-19.“There is one voice application that can be installed on mobiles or smart laptops. The suspected patient will be asked to count a few numbers in front of the device like a breath-analyser. The voice samples will automatically get synced with the main server of the provider. Then, through artificial intelligence, the result will be procured within 30 seconds,” she said.The application will analyse voices of three types of people — suspected, confirmed and negative with Covid-19. Depending on their vocal biomarkers (VB), they will be diagnosed. For example, if a person’s VB is below the standard point — 0.5, he/she will be considered as negative. But if anyone records VB above it, he/she will be suspected with Covid-19 and an RT-PCR test will be conducted for confirmation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-start-screening-of-suspected-covid-19-patients-with-voice-samples-ai-from-wednesday/story-Rqp5v3ezrwBBcbstjJng7J.html
24-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government issues fresh guidelines for Covid testing||The Maharashtra government on Friday has issued fresh protocol for Covid-19 testing in the state. It has directed to conduction of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) tests on foreign travelers arriving in the state, people having symptoms but with negative antigen test reports and high-risk contacts of Covid-19 patients. It has further directed medical facilities to conduct antigen tests on patients in need of immediate treatment and TrueNAT tests for those requiring emergency operations, pregnant women and persons brought dead to hospitals.Following fresh guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and considering the rapid rise in cases, the state health department has formulated its new protocol for Covid testing.“We have determined a new algorithm for conducting Covid-19 tests and have divided people into three groups. Now, antigen tests should be conducted on patients needing emergency treatment so that it can be started within half an hour,” says the order issued by Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, state health department on August 21.Earlier, the state had allowed facilities to conduct antigen tests on patients with severe symptoms, comorbidities and pregnant women.“RT-PCR tests should be conducted on all travellers coming from foreign countries; those having symptoms but their antigen test report is negative, and all close contacts and high-risk contacts of a Covid-19 positive patient,” the order states.It has directed local authorities not to conduct tests on people travelling to villages if they do not show Covid symptoms.The state government has further directed local authorities to conduct one test per patient, following ICMR guidelines, as it has come to light that some patients are being tested multiple times. “This not only puts strain on the existing infrastructure but also bring additional burden on the state exchequer,” the order states.“TrueNAT tests should be conducted before emergency surgeries, for pregnant women and persons brought dead to hospitals. In case TrueNAT is not available, then the antigen test can be conducted on them,” it reads.Patients admitted to mental hospitals should be quarantined for a week, following which antigen tests should be conducted. Based on the test report, the patient should be moved to an isolation ward or Covid ward. Similarly, new jail inmates should be quarantined for a week before getting tested. Based on the test report they should be moved to an isolation ward or Covid ward, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-issues-fresh-guidelines-for-covid-testing/story-N4VxIWWv4BRJRKTYnqhY3K.html

24-08-2020||Chandigarh||Covid shadow: Shops selling school uniforms hit hard in Chandigarh||With uncertainty around reopening of schools that were closed in March owing to the pandemic, city stores that had already stocked up on summer uniforms have now become obsolete.Kingsway, a store that had been providing uniforms for various private schools since 1973, had to close their Sector 22 shop this month. Owner Gurdeep Singh Narula said, “We had taken the shop on rent and had to vacate it this month. The timing of the lockdown was the worst since we had already purchased summer uniforms in bulk, but were unable to sell even a single pair.”Kingsway’s Phase-7 store in Mohali is still open, however, Narula has had to tap into other markets like innerwear and casual wear. They have been able to sell patkas to go with uniforms, but the rest of the stock remains unsold.‘BANKS NOT GIVING US LOANS’Proprietor of Shiksha School Uniforms in Sector 40, Abhishek Aggarwal, said, “We aren’t able to meet even 1% of the sales that we would make otherwise. There is no point in opening the shop daily, so we only open a few days a week. We are venturing into the stationery line, but a capital investment is needed to start a new business and banks are refusing to give us loans when they find out we are in the uniform business.”“If there is some clarity on when schools will open it will help us plan better,” Aggarwal added.‘WON’T BE STOCKING WINTER UNIFORMS’Some of the smaller uniform retailers in Sadar Bazaar in Sector 19 have been the worst hit as sales here are at an all-time low. Proprietor of Puja Garments, Rakesh Mohan, said, “Normally, we would earn ₹30,000 to ₹40,000 in April, but this year the stock lies untouched. It is likely that schools will reopen at the end of summer, so most people won’t buy uniforms. Due to this, we plan not to stock up for winters. Instead of uniforms, we will sell other clothes.”President of Sector-19 market Narinder Singh said the market that mostly houses garment sellers has recorded no sales, and most sellers, like Mohan, will not stock uniforms till next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-shadow-shops-selling-school-uniforms-hit-hard-in-chandigarh/story-HNZP1g9PsdSywfP0CCJVeO.html

24-08-2020||City||Five held for cheating in written exam for hiring of PTIs in Haryana||The fresh written exam to hire physical training instructors (PTIs) in Haryana, against the posts advertised in 2006, was conducted on Sunday strict police vigil and social distancing measures.The fresh exam was necessitated after the Supreme Court set aside the recruitments of 1, 983 PTIs, made in 2010 when the Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress government was in power, citing discrepancies in the hiring process.Officials said that the exam went off peacefully at all 95 centres, across the five districts of Karnal, Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Panipat and Hisar, said officials.Later in the evening, a spokesperson of the Haryana police said that five persons from Hisar were arrested on charges of attempting to cheat in exam.The accused have been identified as Mandeep, a resident of village Danoda Kalan, Vikram, of Khanda Khedi, Bhupendra of Narnaund, Sunita of Patel Nagar, Hisar and Yudhveer of Badchappar. As per information, Mandeep had planned to provide answer key to an examinee in the examination centre and was arrested following a complaint by the centre supervisor while the other four had joined the Government Senior Secondary School, Jahajpur, Hisar as examinees.‘TERMINATED PTIs BOYCOTT EXAMS’As per officials, as many as 9,273 candidates had been issued the admit cards for the exam. However, the number of candidates who appeared for the exam was much lower as most PTIs, who had been terminated, had decided to boycott the exams. Around 200 of the 1,983 terminated PTIs appeared in the exam, as per sources.EXAM WAS TOUGH, SAY CANDIDATESThe candidates, most of whom were above the age of 40, claimed that the exam was tough as most questions were not related to this job. “Most questions were not related to sports or the job of physical training but related to Science and English,” said a candidate. The candidates also complained that only 75 minutes were given to solve 100 questions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fresh-written-exam-for-hiring-of-ptis-in-haryana-goes-off-peacefully/story-0DLBlLqBjJay1qGtf09HII.html
24-08-2020||Mumbai||Curve flattened, but 4 pockets in Dharavi still under BMC watch||Four most densely populated slum pockets inside Dharavi – Matunga Labour Camp, Kumbharwada, Kala Killa and Koliwada – continue to be on the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) watchlist, even though Dharavi flattened the Covid curve in mid-June. For the past few days, daily covid-19 cases in Dharavi are emerging in single digits, with a few exceptions. On Saturday, five new cases were detected in Dharavi, and on Friday, three new cases were detected. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G/North ward with jurisdiction over Dharavi, said, “BMC is watching these four slum pockets because they are very densely populated. We have very few cases from random areas now. Mostly migrated labour who have returned, or medical staff are turning positive now. But these four localities could spiral out of control very easily, so our interventions continue.” These four slum pockets are among 13 high-risk zones that were identified by the civic body for focused interventions in April and May, when the number of cases in Dharavi peaked. Interventions in these high-risk zones included door-to-door surveys and screening of maximum number of residents to identify those at high risk if exposed to the virus (such as people with co-morbidity, senior citizens, and those with low oxygen saturation in their bodies), and early detection of positive patients to isolate them from the community. In August so far, Dharavi’s average doubling rate has touched 406 days, as opposed to 300 days in July, 108 days in June, 43 days in May, and 18 days in April. The average growth rate of cases in Dharavi is 0.24%, as opposed to 0.39% in July, 0.83% in June, and 4.3% in May, and 12% in April. Until August 19, a total of 116 new cases have been reported in Dharavi in August, in comparison to 358 in July. Its peak was in May, when a total of 1,216 cases were reported, which dropped to 480 cases in June. The recovery rate in Dharavi is 87%, higher than Mumbai’s recovery rate of 80.79%. On Thursday, Dharavi saw a sudden spike in its trend of single digit cases, when 17 new cases were reported in a single day. Dighavkar said, “A few nurses from Dharavi working at KEM and Sion hospital tested positive, and the hospital organised tests for their family members, some of whom tested positive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/curve-flattened-but-4-pockets-in-dharavi-still-under-bmc-watch/story-75yFOhVv6ygoA7BabJjLMO.html

24-08-2020||Mumbai||Graduates get 3-D avatars at IIT-Bombay convocation||In a unique experience, three-dimensional (3D) avatars of graduating students of the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B), received their degrees in a virtual convocation, replete with graduates taking a virtual tour of campus and meeting friends, on Sunday.“You are the first batch of graduates among those who had faced extreme hardship due to the pandemic. But despair no more, dear students, you are now proud graduates of IIT-Bombay,” said Subhasis Chaudhuri, director of the institute, urging them to fulfil their true potential. Over 2,400 graduates from undergraduate, post-graduate and doctoral programmes graduated from the institute this year. Of these, around 1,255 are likely to have used the ‘IIT Bombay Convocation 2020’ mobile application to take part in the ceremony from the comfort of their homes using a mobile application that the institute specially designed for the purpose. Apart from the ceremony, graduates could use the application to take a virtual tour of the campus and hang out with friends at their favourite joints. Once downloaded, the application does not require internet connectivity to run. For those who couldn’t use the app, the ceremony was telecast live on the social media channels of the institute as well as DD Sahyadri. It took the effort of 20 experts, most from the IDC School of Design, to plan, design and create this platform and mobile application. “It took more than 5,000 person hours to build the whole thing,” said P Sunthar, co-convenor of the Convocation Committee.“I will definitely miss the feel and the atmosphere of the convocation in the institute I’ve been part of for four years. At the same time, I was excited to have been able to take part in the virtual convocation,” said a graduating student, on the condition of anonymity.Chaudhuri told HT that the institute has received global praise for the virtual convocation ceremony. “[I am] glad that everyone liked the ceremony. We have received a lot of kudos from abroad as nobody has ever seen such a ceremony,” he said. The virtual avatars of students walked up to the stage to receive their degrees from 3-D avatars of the director and chief guest Duncan Haldane, a 2016 Nobel Laureate in Physics.“You are probably just as surprised as me over the profound changes that have taken place in academic life during the last four months, and the changed world,” said Haldane in his message. “There is a lesson for everyone involved in research. Even if you are involved in a very goal-driven project, try to find some small share of your time to investigate unexpected curiosities that sometimes show up along the way,” he advised the graduating students.Stephen A Schwarzman, chairperson and chief executive officer of global investment firm Blackstone, who delivered the commencement speech, said, “IIT engineers are defining the global technology landscape and the newest alumni will be the next generation of future global leaders who will advance that mission. You, IIT Bombay graduates, must seize the opportunity to be leaders of impact who are a force for change — and for good — in this world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/graduates-get-3-d-avatars-at-iit-bombay-convocation/story-qGPPM1mDyYmRmommrn6zRI.html
24-08-2020||Mumbai||State gives nod to expand Junnar rescue centre||The Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre (MLRC) in Junnar will soon be able to increase the capacity of its captive leopard enclosures from 39 to 50 as the state government has issued a clearance to expand the rescue centre. The state irrigation department has issued an in-principle approval to hand over 15 hectares (ha) of land that it owns for MLRC’s expansion, said forest officers. “We are of the opinion that we do not need more area than 10ha. The cost of the land comes around ₹10 lakh per ha,” said JR Gowda, deputy conservator of forest, Junnar. Currently, MLRC is spread across 4ha and has 33 leopards across its 39 enclosures. However, the demarcation of the exact boundary for extension of the centre is yet to be assessed, said Gowda. “With help from the land records department, we will get exact figures and submit a proposal to the state for final approval for 10-ha expansion,” he said. A senior state government official said, “Based on MLRC’s requirement and their updated proposal, more approvals will be issued. The centre did a splendid job in giving care to leopards and can become an eco-tourism hub.” Apart from housing more rescued or trapped leopards (involved in conflict), MLRC has planned tourism-related activities across the additional 10ha, including aviary cages, rescue facilities and cages for sambar deer, jackals and other herbivores, as well as a secluded area where veterinary practices can be enhanced. “With permission from the Central Zoo Authority (CZA), we would like to build a mini zoo for the public. We also intend to expand the size of the cages to a minimum of 250 square metre as per CZA guidelines,” said Gowda. Currently, MLRC has five enclosures allotted as quarantine cages for leopards displaying any symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-gives-nod-to-expand-junnar-rescue-centre/story-tc3x6yO0bGEaZXZKx0h8DL.html
24-08-2020||Mumbai||Maha Covid toll past 22K; tally is 682,383||Maharashtra on Sunday recorded 10,441 new Covid-19 cases in the state, taking its tally to 682,383. The state crossed 22,000 fatalities with 258 deaths on Sunday, pushing the toll to 22,253.Of the fatalities recorded on Sunday, 213 were from the previous 48 hours and 23 were from last week. The remaining 22 deaths were from the period before last week. The case fatality rate (CFR) in the state stood at 3.26%. With 8,157 people discharged on Sunday, the tally of the people recovered improved to 488,271. The state now has 171,542 active cases.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Sunday that the next 10 days were crucial for the state’s battle against coronavirus. The state is anticipating a rise in cases with the increased movement of people during festivals, including Ganeshotsav and Muharram. Speaking via video conferencing during the commissioning of an 800-bed dedicated Covid hospital in Pune, Thackeray said the state is preparing health infrastructure in the state to fight in case there is a second wave.“The next phase is quite important for the state. The next eight-10 days are going to be crucial as Ganpati festival is on, Paryushan of the Jain community is going on, Muharram is also in a few days. Along with these festivals, there is monsoon, which brings diseases,” he said. State health department officials said that with opening up of restrictions in the state, they have seen an increase in cases, and the trend is expected to continue.The CM said though the situation in Mumbai is getting “under control” he cautioned the authorities against getting negligent to prevent a second wave of attack. Mumbai recorded 991 new infections on Sunday, taking the city’s tally to 136,353. It also recorded 34 fatalities, taking its toll to 7,422. Thackeray said that the administration should not remain lax as globally there is a second wave of Covid-19.“A dedicated Covid facility is being commissioned in Pune, and two more will be added in this week. People ask me do we require so many facilities? We cannot remain careless. Absolutely not. Today, the situation is in Mumbai the situation is in control, but I am not letting rest. We are continuing with the tracing, tracking, testing, etc. Globally it is seen that after a wave, a second wave [of Covid] comes. We are striving so that no second wave comes, but if it comes, then what will we do? Earlier, we had a shortage of PPE kits, N95 masks, and ventilators,” the CM said in the speech at the event.There have been demands from various quarters, including from leaders within the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi, to allow gymnasiums and religious places to open up. But so far the state has not taken a call. The Ministry of Home Affairs has asked state governments to allow unrestricted movement of people and goods between states. The state, however, is yet to take a call in it.The CM on Sunday indicated that the call to provide further relaxations will be taken cautiously to prevent another wave of transmission across the city and state. Thackeray said that the state is treading cautiously in opening up lockdown restrictions to “prevent a second wave”. He said, “When we say we want to resume our lives normally, then crowding is inevitable. We are opening things gradually, but while doing so we are also ensuring that a second wave does not start.”The CM added that the state government is increasing testing facilities in the state and decreasing the turnaround time to get faster control over the situation. He added that the state is also looking at ways to further reduce the rates of RT-PCR tests.He added that along with ramping up health infrastructure to fight the Covid battle, public awareness campaigns will pay off more to keep the virus at bay. He said that till a vaccine is invented, masks, sanitisers and social distancing is the only remedy available for the people of the state.“Union health minister Harsh Vardhan has said that vaccine would be possible by December only. So, we will have to remain cautious for the next four months. For now, our medicine or vaccine are masks, sanitisers, and social distancing. If we follow this, the spread of the virus will reduce drastically, this has been proven across the world…Therefore, these facilities, doctors, medicines, etc will be required, but along with that, awareness campaigns will be required to educate people. Once we get habituated to precautions, then we will not fall prey to coronavirus.”Meanwhile, Pune city and its adjoining areas continued to record a chunk of the fresh cases on Sunday with Pune city adding 1,288 new cases, while Pune rural added 569 new cases, and Pimpri-Chinchwad recorded 679 cases. The district crossed 1.50 lakh confirmed cases on Sunday, and currently has 44,717 active cases.

24-08-2020||Mumbai||Geriatric care for leopards at rescue centre in Pune||Twelve-year-old male leopard Ganesh is suffering from complete loss of sight owing to cataract in his right eye. He suffered an injury when he was trapped in a conflict situation. A team of veterinarians created olfactory enrichments that encourage him to rely more on other senses instead of sight. Ganesh now uses his sense of smell and instincts to navigate within his enclosure and is an active leopard. Leopards enter the latter phase of their lives from the age of 12, when they start encountering more dental problems, issues relating to joints and a marked change in their overall behaviour and personality. At the Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre (MLRC) in Junnar, Pune district, 20 of the 33 leopards — mostly rescued after serious injuries related to conflicts — are elderly. The four-hectare rescue centre is jointly run by the Maharashtra forest department and animal rescue group Wildlife SOS. It is home to the most number of rescued and orphaned leopards in the state. The specialised geriatric care offered at the centre for senior leopards has helped prevent infection, maintain core strength and improve immunity. Another male leopard, 20-year-old Samrat, is not as active as he once was — sharpening his claws against tree barks, climbing trees and enthusiastically rolling in the mud. Now, he lives a slow-paced life. Under the geriatric care routine, MLRC staff substituted most of the structural enrichments (objects in a captive enclosure to develop a suitable habitat) with food enrichments. “This motivates the leopards to remain active and fit,” said Dr Nikhil Bangar, wildlife veterinary officer, Wildlife SOS. Specialised immunoboosters, multivitamins and calcium supplements are provided to help control the onset of joint problems that may cause severe discomfort, allowing more strength to the bones of the wild cats, said Dr Bangar, adding, “Multivitamin syrups help prevent ectoparasitic infection (infestations on the skin) that may put their lives at risk.” While leopards in captivity live longer, forest officers said, some animals generally go through a lot of emotional distress (in captivity) resulting in them being overweight, inactive, facing health problems and even leading to self-mutilation. “Our intention is to ensure that their lives are not like a jail sentence. Some of these leopards have been hand-reared in captivity since the time they were orphaned as cubs, while others drawn in from conflict are not safe to be released again. The focus has been to improve existing facilities, provide more space, protect and increase their lifespan,” said JR Gowda, deputy conservator of forest, Junnar. Following the Covid-19 pandemic, a veterinary officer and his assistant carry out daily temperature checks twice for each animal. “Fortunately, no untoward incidents have been reported,” said Gowda. Leopards, , especially males, are mostly solitary. They are not generally seen getting along with other males. “This is not the case in Junnar where we have Ganesh and Vitthal (another male leopard who lost his right-hind paw in a snare trap) who are often seen playing together for hours. We observe their movements and ensure there is no discomfort while working on enrichments suited to their comfort,” said Dr Bangar. Animal enrichment involves providing mental and physical stimulation to captive animals through a variety of methods (food-based, olfactory, structural, social etc.) enabling them to exhibit their natural behaviour. “Enrichments are important as they give leopards the opportunity to tap into their instincts the way they would in the wild, and encourage them to use their motor and cognitive skills,” said Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder, Wildlife SOS. Wildlife biologist Vidya Athreya said MLRC has come a long way to ensure holistic welfare of leopards. “From trapping leopards and keeping them in small cages to ensuring better infrastructure and implementing innovative behavioural enrichment models, Junnar stands as a case study for any captive animal unit in India. It also highlights the competence when a forest department and an animal welfare group collaborate,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/geriatric-care-for-leopards-at-rescue-centre-in-pune/story-lOSDrUj369Y4rPT8n7FM2O.html
24-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai sees 31,255 immersions, drop from over 46K last year||Amid Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) advisory asking citizens to immerse Ganpati idols at their homes in buckets or drums, the city saw 31,255 immersions on Sunday, day 1 of immersions during Ganeshotsav.Of the 31,255 idols immersed until 9pm, 621 were from pandals and 30,634 idols from homes, according to BMC. Every year, more than 35,000 idols are immersed on the end of the a day-and-a-half of festivities. Last year, more than 46,000 idols were immersed on Day 1. In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the state had asked citizens and mandals to keep celebrations low-key and issued several guidelines to ensure social distancing norms are maintained. “Devotees who are celebrating Ganesh festival in their homes are advised to carry out immersion of the Ganesh idols at their homes in a bucket or a drum as their first preference,” the advisory, issued on Sunday morning, stated. BMC said citizens can carry out immersions at 70 natural and 170 artificial ponds across the city by maintaining social distancing and hygiene norms. A list of the ponds is uploaded on the BMC website (http://stopcoronavirus.mcgm.gov.in/ganesh-visarjan-locations). However, only those citizens residing within the 2-km radius of the 70 natural water bodies mentioned in the list are allowed to immerse idols there. Citizens are not permitted to step inside the water under any circumstances but have to hand over the idols to BMC to immerse the idols, the advisory further stated.The civic body also banned processions for immersion rituals. Further, BMC also asked devotees to perform the rituals at their homes and prohibited rituals at immersion spots. Citizens were asked to wear masks, carry sanitisers and follow social distancing norms.BMC also directed the pandals and homes in containment zones to either defer the immersions till the next year or make arrangements using buckets or drums for the process within the sealed area.“Ganeshotsav mandals as well as citizens situated in containment zones shall immerse their Ganesh idols by creating necessary arrangement in the mandap/pandal and their homes itself. Alternatively, they can defer the immersion of the idols to next year. Devotees who are staying in sealed buildings shall mandatorily immerse their Ganesh idols in their homes itself (in bucket/ small drums) or postpone the immersion to the next year,” the advisory stated.This year, the civic body also arranged for mobile immersion spots by installing water tanks in trucks. Information on mobile immersion spots was also provided on the civic body’s website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-31-255-immersions-drop-from-over-46k-last-year/story-tiMWi9TWcBMsfwhjURYNOP.html
24-08-2020||Chandigarh||Overnight rain wreaks havoc in Chandigarh’s periphery||Following heavy overnight rainfall in Chandigarh, floodgates of Sukhna Lake had to be opened as its water level crossed the danger mark of 1,163 feet in wee hours of Sunday.The gushing water made a breach in the Sukhna Choe, which carries water released by the lake, and overflowed its banks to flood nearby areas in Mohali’s Zirakpur. Baltana in Zirakpur experienced flood-like situation for the first time in its history with the police post, marriage palaces, municipal park and cremation ground submerged.Meanwhile, water discharged from check dams over the seasonal rivulet Patiala Ki Rao flooded low-lying areas in Khuda Lahora Colony near the PGIMER around 3am on Sunday.It was last on September 24, 2018, that floodgates of Sukna Lake were opened owing to heavy rainfall after a gap of 10 years. UT chief engineer Mukesh Anand said the floodgates were opened around 3am and closed around 1:15pm on Sunday after the lake’s water level dropped to 1,162.6 feet. “Before opening the floodgates, we had alerted the district administrations in Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula. Taking precautionary measures, we had blocked bridges on Sukhna Choe falling in the city’s jurisdiction,” he said.Anand said there were no reports of flooding along the route of Sukhna Choe in Chandigarh though the bridges were inundated.BALTANA SUBMERGEDAt the Baltana police post, cops managed to shift records, weapons and ammunition to safety. Assistant sub-inspector Kamal Kumar said there were around 50 two-wheelers and 22 three- and four-wheelers that were completely submerged under water. The police post staff broke a wall to make way for the water to flow towards the adjacent rivulet. It carried a three-wheeler along. The condition at the nearby municipal park was such that swings that stand 10-foot tall were all submerged under water. However, no households were affected. Administrative officials led by subdivisional magistrate Kuldeep Bawa reached the spot to oversee the rescue work. NO WARNING AT KHUDA LAHORAMeanwhile, the overnight rain also flooded Patiala Ki Rao flowing on the west of the city, taking Khuda Lahora Colony residents by surprise in early hours.Rohit Thakur, a local, said, “Water entered ours houses around 3am when we were sleeping. Of 450 houses here, around 100 were inundated with up to three-foot-deep water. There was panic, as there was no alert from the UT administration.”Municipal officials visited the area more than an hour after the flooding and started work on cleaning stormwater drains, said Thakur, adding that water level started receding by 6am.“Sewage was mixed with water overflowing from the choe and flooded the houses and street. The main sewage pipe and stormwater drainage opens up in the choe, the level of which at some places is elevated because of heavy siltation,” said PC Rana, a local whose house was flooded.While sewage lines are maintained by the MC, the UT engineering department handles desiltation work. “We have been requesting to both for the last 10 years to clean up the area, but no action has been taken,” said Rana.Raj Bala Malik, Chandigarh mayor and also councillor from the area, said, “When flooding reports came from Khuda Lahora Colony, MC teams were sent immediately. All 22 drainage pipes were clogged with sand and other floodwater debris. We have now cleaned up three of these, and work on cleaning up the rest is going on.” Though water had receded from houses in the morning, streets remained inundated even in the evening.FLOODGATES MAY HAVE TO BE OPENED AGAIN While 80.1mm overnight rain was recorded at the Sector 39 observatory of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the observatory maintained by the forest department at Sukhna Lake recorded much higher rain. “At Nepali Choe, we recorded 145mm rain on Saturday night and early hours of Sunday. Rain above 50mm in the catchment area of the lake causes a strong run-off, filling up the lake much faster, “ said Abdul Qayum, deputy conservator of forests (DCF).IMD, Chandigarh, director Surender Paul said high rainfall was the result of monsoon getting stronger. “Since Sukhna Lake is nearer to the foothills of Himalayas, more rainfall was recorded there.”He said there are chances of heavy rain from Tuesday till the first week of September, which may lead to rise in Sukhna water level again.Administrative officials said with forecast for more rains, flood gates could be opened again. With 419.2mm rain recorded this month so far, highest for August since 2004, the total this monsoon has reached 892.1mm. It has already crossed the normal value of 845.7mm for the whole season (recorded between June 1 and September 30) and is 5.5% surplus. For the period up to August 23, monsoon is 38% surplus.Last year, the city recorded 17.5% monsoon deficit with 697.4mm during the four months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/overnight-rain-wreaks-havoc-in-chandigarh-s-periphery/story-Q1jAxqnXVSoQPET7y31dDM.html
24-08-2020||City||Commuters complain of delay, cancellations of trains on CR||Essential services workers who avail local train services to commute to work have raised complaints about irregularities in local services such as delay, cancellations and no proper announcements at railway stations. Some commuters from Kalyan and Dombivli took to social media sites and demanded that Central Railway (CR) take remedial measures. Manish Pathak, 37, a doctor who travel from Dombivli to Mumbai’s Kasturba Gandhi Hospital every day, said he was forced to wait at the station for hours as trains get cancelled at the last moment. “Local trains are the only mode of transport available to me. Earlier there was delay in the services, but since the past one week there have been cancellation of trains, which forced me to wait at the stations for hours. It affects my work as well,” said Pathak, who tweeted about the issue and tagged CR’s official Twitter handle. Pathak has asked CR to release local train schedule so that people can plan their travel accordingly. “The schedule, which they have given, is not working properly. If there is a cancellation, people should be informed in advance so that they don’t waste time. There are no announcements, no indicators,” added Pathak. Deepak Dubey, 29, who travels from Dombivli to Byculla for work said, “Railway stations and trains are mostly crowded due to irregularities in train services. While there is a schedule put up at the station, most of the times trains are delayed by hours. Since the past one week, we have also faced cancellation of trains.” He added, “This issue needs to be resolved soon as it affects our work. The frequency of trains also needs to be increased so as to avoid overcrowding.” Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, CR, said, “Due to heavy rains and waterlogging, there might be delay in local train services. And on Sundays there might be delay and cancellations due to mega blocks, for which public notice is provided in advance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/commuters-complain-of-delay-cancellations-of-trains-on-cr/story-nfSFeujlBeZDoGWMK8BNnJ.html
24-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharastra may free intra-state travel in 1st week of September||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is likely to open intra-state movement without mandatory e-passes soon. The decision is likely to come in the first week of September once the 10-day Ganesh festival is concluded. Home minister Anil Deshmukh on Sunday said they will also be taking appropriate decision on allowing intra-state and inter-state movement after discussing it with chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar.Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla had, on August 22, written to chief secretaries of all states saying there should be no restrictions on inter-state and intra-state movement of people and goods. His letter also mentions that any such restriction would amount to a violation of guidelines by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) issued earlier during unlock phases.Currently, a person needs to get an e-pass from the state government for intra-state travel in case of emergency and unavoidable situation.Maharashtra chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said they will allow free intra-state movement after Ganesh Chaturthi. “We have already allowed intra-state movement. The condition for obtaining e-pass for travelling will also be scrapped. A decision on this is likely to be taken after Ganesh festival,” Kumar told HT.Government officials said they cannot take the decision immediately as more people are likely to travel because of ongoing festival. “It will allow people to visit their villages, which will lead to further spread of the Covid-19 pandemic in rural areas and make the situation more difficult for the state,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.“We have taken note of the recent guidelines announced by the Centre removing all restrictions on inter-state & intra-state movement of goods and people. Appropriate decision will be taken regarding the same after discussion with Hon’ble CM & DCM,” Deshmukh tweeted on Sunday. In another tweet, the home minister said, “As per the discussions held with Hon’ble CM, the existing #MissionBeginAgain guidelines will be in effect in Maharashtra, till any further announcement.”On August 19, the state government allowed resumption of inter-district bus services of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) which was suspended in March after the nationwide lockdown was imposed.According to the state government’s directive, passengers do not require an e-pass, permission or approval for inter-district travel in MSRTC buses. However, the transport undertaking will issue standard operating procedures for such travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharastra-may-free-intra-state-travel-in-1st-week-of-september/story-fFLPwRLrvITcFK0QcZwFgI.html
24-08-2020||Mumbai||Four critical patients respond well to new drug; need to verify, say experts||Four severely critical Covid-19 patients who were on ventilator support due to extensive scarring of lung tissues that leads to low oxygen levels — a complication induced by Sars-CoV-2 virus — were sent home on minimal oxygen support after pulmonologists at the Pune-based Army Institute of Cardiothoracic Sciences (AICTS) administered a new line of treatment using anti-fibrotic drug nintedanib.“We had lost hope on these four patients. But when we administered Nintedanib with a combination of steroids, their condition turned around. Very safely and without any complications or side-effects, they could be sent home with minimal oxygen support,” said Brigadier (medical) HQ MG&G (Maharashtra, Gujarat and Goa) area, adding that this subset of patients had clear evidence of having suffered pulmonary fibrosis in CT-scans. Nintedanib costs approximately ₹65,000 or less for a month (60 tablets). Lung fibrosis is usually seen in patients who are detected late and have extensive pneumonia. Many a times, it becomes difficult to wean these patients off oxygen despite anti-inflammatory therapies, such as steroids, and they remain in the intensive care unit for a long time. A patient infected with the novel coronavirus associated pulmonary fibrosis is put on high-flow oxygen or other ventilatory supports because he/she cannot maintain normal oxygen saturation levels on his/her own. While oxygen saturation levels for most healthy individuals is around 95% or more, it can drop to as low as 75% among Covid-19 patients, causing death. Dr Lancelot Pinto, pulmonologist at Hinduja Hospital, said that anti-fibrotics such as pirfenidone and nintedanib may have anti-fibrotic potential, but their efficacy needs to be validated in randomised control trials (RCTs).“We have seen several patients with high oxygen requirements and bilateral lung disease improve gradually, and get weaned off oxygen with time. The recovery can be slow, and at times we have discharged patients on home oxygen support, and eventually weaned them off,” said Pinto.He added, “In the absence of a control arm, it is impossible to know whether it was the drug or time that caused the resolution of clinical and radiological features. Already an RCT assessing the safety and efficacy of pirfenidone is underway, and we are looking forward to the results.”“There are plenty of observational studies of drugs for Covid (such as HCQ) that have had promising results, but have failed to show efficacy over placebo in clinical trials. We should definitely not change practice based on a case series of 4 patients,” said Pinto.The team said anti-fibrotic drugs are generally used to treat other types of lung fibrosis such as secondary to autoimmune diseases — rheumatoid arthritis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). “Nintedanib is a medicine which has often been used by some immunologists and rheumatologists in cases where the lungs have developed fibrosis as a result of an autoimmune disease in which the body’s own immunity goes haywire, begins recognising its own organs as foreign and starts attacking it,” said a spokesperson of the team. “In some of those conditions, lungs develop fibrosis and Nintedanib has been used effectively for clinical management of the condition because it’s an expensive drug,” the spokesperson added. Taking this as a cue, the pulmonology department at AICTS decided to try a combination of steroids with nintedanib in four patients with Covid-19-associated lung fibrosis who were difficult to wean off of oxygen due to extensive lung fibrosis and their condition was steadily deteriorating. Doctors said the anti-fibrotic drug was used on four patients who were at a very advanced stage of Covid-19 that required intense treatment. Having recovered, these patients will have to be on minimal oxygen support at home even after turning Covid-19 negative, and follow-ups will continue clinically and through laboratory investigations and CT-scan imaging. The team said nintedanib is reasonably safe but may cause diarrhoea followed by liver function derangement in some. “A patient cannot be discharged unless oxygen saturation level is not above 93-94% which will help him/her carry on with daily activities. The reason these four patients require low-level oxygen and follow-ups is because while their saturation levels will stay at 93-94% when stationery (like sitting), it will drop to 90-91% with little activity,” said the spokesperson. As an observational study, a report is in the pipelines for an internationally peer-reviewed scientific journal on the clinical management using ninetedanib on these four patients. Going forward, the team proposes to recognise similar subsets and utilise the same treatment protocol. The team said that at present there is no published case report of this drug being used on patients who have developed severe pulmonary fibrosis due to Covid-19 and are unable to wean off ventilator. HOW THE PATIENTS ARE CHOSEN Covid-19 patients who are detected late or progressed to the critical phase of illness — meaning they are unable to maintain their oxygen saturations without high-flow oxygen or ventilator support — are evaluated extensively. Computerised tomography pulmonary angiography is carried out to rule out the possibility of pulmonary embolism (clots in the lungs) and check the extent of fibrosis that may have developed in the lung. The patients also undergo various blood tests to look for ongoing inflammation by evaluating the inflammatory markers among other parameters. If the inflammation is controlled with steroids (which are the first line for Covid-19) and CT pictures reveal evidence of prominent fibrosis leading to the patient requiring continued supplemental oxygen and make it difficult to wean him/her off, the therapy with nintedabin begins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/four-critical-patients-respond-well-to-new-drug-need-to-verify-say-experts/story-tuADVn0LqDqxy4J2Onrj2K.html

24-08-2020||Pune||Puneites opt for eco-friendly visarjan, follow safety norms||People were seen wearing masks and following social distancing norms during the immersion of one-and-a-half-day Ganesha idols on Sunday.Many people also opted for an eco-friendly way of immersing the idols at homes as the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had appealed to residents to immerse Ganesha idols at home or at the immersion centres started across the city to avoid the crowd.“Due to the current Covid-19 situation, we decided to immerse the Ganesha idol at home. We had brought Shaduchi mati (clay) idol and immersed it in a bucket with the help of ammonium bicarbonate,” said Kshitij Jog, a citizen of Narayan peth.Another resident Shailesh Kshirsagar said, “We followed all safety precautions while immersing the idol into the river. PMC has taken all measures to ensure that people immerse idols at home or in the artificial tanks. But at the same time, they should have made arrangements at the Visarjan ghats as there are people who want to go the traditional way and immerse Ganpati idol in the natural flow of water.”Dustbins used as makeshift tanks, allege MNSThere was a big tussle between the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) workers and Pune police officials and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) staff after the MNS exposed the artificial tanks made by PMC for Ganpati visarjan were actually the dustbin containers. After the commotion, PMC removed the containers from one of its immersion centres near Shanipar chowk.“PMC has completely failed in making proper arrangements for public immersion. Dustbins were used as makeshift tanks which were not even washed properly. We oppose this irresponsible behaviour of PMC,” said MNS city head Ajay Shinde.Vikram Kumar, PMC commissioner, said, “We have made all the arrangements for immersion at PMC tanks. We have used new containers and they are not dustbin containers. Still, I will look into the matter.”“We appeal to people to immerse the idols at home and or PMC tanks and follow all safety norms,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/puneites-opt-for-eco-friendly-visarjan-follow-safety-norms/story-GSIMiEN5Lmaxl93yREprcM.html

At least 25 lakh people were on the streets during the immersion process during the ten-day festival. So, to avoid such a situation amid the Covid-19 pandemic we have created the idea of artificial ponds on wheels,” said Mohol.According to civic officials last year 14,000 Ganesh idols were immersed after one-and-a-half-day.“As a safety precaution people should immerse the idol at homes and if not at PMC immersion tanks,” added Mohol.All the immersion ghats have been sealed and strict police bandobast is in place at every ghat.“Response to artificial ponds on wheels has been good since morning (on Sunday). This year we are expecting fewer numbers of Ganesh idols for immersion due to the pandemic,” said Dnyaneshwar Molak, head, solid waste management department, PMC.One of the members of Dagdusheth Ganpati Trust on the request of anonymity said, “This arrangement from PMC, is one of the best options in the time of Covid-19. People should follow all safety precautions and celebrate the festival at homes.”Meanwhile, in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) the civic body has sealed the immersion ghats and appealed to people to celebrate and immersion idols at homes as a safety measure amid the Covid-19 crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/30-ponds-on-wheels-ply-on-roads-for-early-ganesh-visarjan/story-oDqlkd0BlFYL3fA1cax3fJ.html
24-08-2020||Pune||Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary declared as eco-sensitive zone||In a boost to preserve the wildlife corridors in Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary, which houses habitats of giant squirrel and other wild animals, the Union government, on August 5, declared the sanctuary as an eco-sensitive zone.The area consists of 42 villages from Pune, Thane and Raigad districts and is spread over an area 130.78 square kilometres. The sanctuary is known for avifauna with species of birds including Indian shag, little cormorant, little egret, Indian pond heron, Asian openbill, black-winged kite, brahminy kite shikra, red wattled lapwing, common sandpiper and spotted dove.According to Madhav Gadgil, prominent ecologist, the notification will ensure that no construction activity will take place in the wildlife surrounding and will help in maintaining the natural biosphere and ecosystem of the area intact.“This is a good step and will help in keeping natural reserves intact,” said Gadgil, who headed the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel, also known as the Gadgil Commission. The commission had designated entire western ghat saying the entire hill range in the ghat is ecologically sensitive. The commission had also proposed banning all kinds of activities.A draft notification was published in the Gazette of India, vide notification of the Government of India in the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change dated July 25, 2019, inviting objections and suggestions from all persons likely to be affected thereby within the period of sixty days from the date on which copies of the Gazette containing the said notification were made available to the public.Villagers object to Union government’s decisionThe Adivasi community of Junnar and Ambegaon have objected to the Central government notification and submitted their suggestions and objections to the effect but they were overruled.Suman Kate, a villager, said, “We don’t want to lose our access to the forest and its produce as it has been our right since many generations. Currently, the area has been declared as an eco-sensitive zone and we fear that we might lose our rights to the forest. The decision must be reviewed with immediate effect.”Another villager Kamlesh Dethe said, “We had given our objections to the notification which was issued last year. It was not taken into consideration and the zone was declared without our consultancy. The villagers are unhappy with the development.”On the opposition from locals, Gadgil said, “The Forest Rights Act 2008 has finalised rights of the local community over the forest. If the government is trying to evict the local population, then people there have equal rights on forest resources.”The protected area of the sanctuary has high faunal and floral diversity with about 22 species of mammals, about 25 species of reptiles and many species of amphibian are found. The area also supports important wildlife such as common leopard, jungle cat, small Indian civet, striped hyena, barking deer, western hanuman langur, common grey mongoose, among others.Area coveredExtent and boundaries of the eco-sensitive zone: The one shall be to an extent of 0.05 kilometres to 10 kilometres around the boundary of the Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary and the area of the eco-sensitive zone is 101.62 square kilometres.List of activities prohibited or to be regulated within eco-sensitive zoneCommercial mining, stone quarrying and crushing unitsSetting of industries causing pollution (water, air, soil, noise, and others.)Establishment of major hydroelectric projectUse or production or processing of any hazardous substancesDischarge of untreated effluents in natural water bodies or land areaSetting up of new sawmillsSetting up of brick kilnsNew encroachment and their regularisation on forest landEstablishment of hotels and resort: No new commercial hotels and resorts shall be permitted within one kilometre of the boundary of the protected area or up to the extent of the eco-sensitive zone, whichever is nearer, except for small temporary structures for eco-tourism activitiesConstruction activities: New commercial construction of any kind wiall not be permitted within one kilometre from the boundary of the protected area or up to extent of the eco-sensitive zone, whichever is nearer||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhimashankar-wildlife-sanctuary-declared-as-eco-sensitive-zone/story-wni982LRT0C3Bm6KAzNFsN.html

This jumbo facility at COEP ground, will add 600 more oxygenated beds and 200 ICU beds to the health infrastructure of the city’s fight against Covid-19. The second jumbo facility will start at the Annasaheb Magar ground in Pimpri-Chinchwad. Although, Mumbai got the first jumbo facility in the state, Pune is now seeing more cases coming up compared to the capital and even more deaths per day. Despite multiple delays due to various reasons including rains, the facility is finally up and ready. The facility was inaugurated online by CM Uddhav Thackeray and the event was attended by deputy CM Ajit Pawar, Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol, Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham, divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao and Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh. CM Thackeray said, “I wish good health for Punekars. The city is now amidst the Covid-19 peak, monsoon and also Ganesh festival and so Punekars have to be more cautious. I urge citizens to maintain social distancing and citizens should follow the same level of precautions which they have been following till date.” Rao had said that the facility has been outsourced to a private agency which will supply manpower and even the smallest details including laundry and consumables have been taken care of. CM also wished the citizens on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi and also expressed thanks that people from all religions have celebrated the festivals in a restrained way this year due to Covid-19. He said, “It is seen across the world that once the first wave is over, the second wave comes and so citizens must not drop their guard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-gets-its-first-jumbo-facility-200-icu-600-oxygenated-beds-added-in-fight-against-covid-19/story-kd4F4RTS3pddulOVA9l8yK.html
24-08-2020||Pune||BVP’s post-Covid19 OPD reports complaints of blood sugar spike among some recovered patients||The Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital and research centre will be studying the onset of diabetes in patients who have recovered from the Covid-19 infection and did not have a blood sugar problem prior to the infection. In addition to recovered patients coming to the hospital with complaints of breathlessness and fatigue, non-diabetics are reportedly experiencing a spike in sugar levels, especially those who were on oxygen or on artificial respiratory systems. The impact of the virus is being studied by doctors and hospitals are setting up post-Covid-19, out-patient departments (OPD). Dr Jitendra Oswal, pediatrician and deputy medical director at Bharati Vidyapeeth Hospital and Research Centre said, “We are now witnessing patients coming back to us with various issues. Breathlessness and fatigue are definitely one of those but also those who never reported having diabetes showed a dramatic spike in sugar levels. This OPD will help us understand if there are is a new onset of diabetes among patients who have recovered from Covid-19. These complications are seen more among those who need critical care like oxygenation or ventilators.” However, according to Dr Oswal, it needs to be studied if the sugar spike is temporary or may lead to new diabetic patients. He said, “Indians especially are very easily likely to get diabetes and so India is the world’s diabetes capital, and we have seen this happen during treatment, now it needs to be studied if the spike remains even after discharge. After the patients recover from acute Covid-19 illness they are found to have respiratory, physical, and psychological dysfunction. Some patients may persist to have symptoms and may require supplemental oxygen therapy for many days after discharge from the hospital. Post-Covid complications are a “new dimension” and people have to be aware of them.” The hospital has been designated as a dedicated Covid-19 hospital since April 14, 2020, and around 3,000 patients have been discharged to date. Many of these patients required ICU care, ventilator support, and supplemental oxygen and anti-inflammatory drugs. Mildly symptomatic patients were managed under the hospital’s home isolation program. Given the number of recovered patients coming back, the hospital has now started its ‘Post Covid-19 OPD’ for all discharged patients since August 18. The OPD will have a physician, a chest physician, a pediatrician, and psychiatrist experts. In addition to diabetes, the post-Covid-19 OPD will check for pulmonary rehabilitation which will look for lung fibrosis (scarring) leading to chronic lung disease which is now the most commonly reported impact of the virus, thrombo-embolic conditions leading to stroke and organ damage, psychological rehabilitation, management of comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension and cardiac diseases to avoid the risk of getting readmitted and management of persistent symptoms like cough, fever, dyspnea, musculoskeletal symptoms (myalgia, joint pain, fatigue), gastrointestinal symptoms, and loss of sense and taste for food. Dr Oswal also added that this phenomenon is being observed across the globe and in July, an Italian study published in the reputed JAMA, involving 143 recovered patients two months after the onset of the first symptom, found over 85 per cent had at least one symptom. The most commonly reported symptoms were fatigue and dyspnea (shortness of breath). In addition to adults, the impact of the virus among kids who have recovered also will be studied. Dr Oswal said, “Though children have usually mild Covid-19 disease, few of them are at risk of a serious, life-threatening immunological response called “hyperinflammatory syndrome”. This Post-COVID disease is known to give rise to heart (coronary) artery damage and risk of heart attack and death. These children will be closely monitored for this. Also, the children who were asymptomatic will be evaluated for their Covid-19 antibody response.” He added, “We will be keeping a close eye on these patients for at least a year for the development of any new sub-acute morbidity. In this period of distress due to the ongoing pandemic, such comprehensive Post Covid-19 care will provide a rehabilitation program to improve their respiratory, physical, and psychological health and get back to a normal life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/bvp-s-post-covid19-opd-reports-complaints-of-blood-sugar-spike-among-some-recovered-patients/story-ozsYr3trPcfUFp554Tx8bL.html

24-08-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal urges Centre to restart Metro services in city||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that he has urged the Central government to consider restarting Metro services in the city in a phased manner, if needed, and conduct a trial run regarding the same soon.“People of Delhi have been requesting us to start Metro services. We have taken this up with the Central government on several occasions. We have urged the Centre to explore the possibility of resuming Metro services in Delhi, while keeping it prohibited in other states as of now. Delhi is a special case because we have the Covid situation under control,” said Kejriwal in a speech at the end of a webinar with traders in the city.Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s services have been shut since March 22 (Janata curfew). With nearly six million passenger journeys daily, the Metro is the lifeline of Delhi. Though Metro services are closed, the Centre and the Delhi government allowed buses and para-transit modes to operate, with restrictions on the number of passengers, since May.According to transport officials, currently there are close to 6,500 buses plying on Delhi roads.With a majority of the services reopened since June, when the Centre announced Unlock 1, people of Delhi continue to face inconveniences while commuting and mostly have to rely on their personal vehicles.Kejriwal said, “We have urged the Centre to consider a phased approach for resuming Metro services, if needed. They can at least conduct trial runs on an experimental basis.”The decision to restart Metro services can be taken by the Union ministry of home affairs.Meanwhile, the DMRC and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which is in-charge of security, have prepared protocols to ensure smooth and contactless travel for passengers inside stations and on trains.The two agencies have drafted rules that focus on the need to ensure social distancing at Metro stations and in trains once the Centre allows operations to begin.Completely cashless transaction at ticketing counters, earmarking designated spots for passengers to stand while waiting for trains or at ticketing counters, use of face masks and Arogya Setu mobile application, leaving alternate seats vacant are some of the measures that Metro has decided to take once the services resume.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communication, DMRC, said, “The DMRC shall be prepared to commence operations whenever directed by the government. All necessary guidelines to combat the spread of Covid-19 shall be implemented and all efforts shall be made to make travel safe for our commuters.”The Metro recently launched its new smart card to promote cashless transactions and also ensure contactless trave. The smart card has an automatic top-up facility. The cards will be available to commuters once the Metro gets a go-ahead to resume its operations.According to senior Metro officials, the smart cards will automatically be recharged at the Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) entry gates with Rs 200 whenever the balance goes below Rs 100.These measures are based on the guidelines provided by the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs to all metro corporations in the country for drafting Standard Operating Procedures. HT had recently reported that the CISF has also started preparations for the resumption of Metro services in Delhi-NCR.According to officials, they have been asked to mobilise staff, set up equipment and ensure that all required precautionary measures are in place to resume train service on a short notice. The CISF has also prepared its own SOPs, which includes use of the Aarogya Setu app to identify Covid-19 patients. CISF personnel, who come in direct contact with travellers at Metro stations, will be required to sanitise their hands after every two or three travellers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-urges-centre-to-restart-metro-services-in-city/story-1u8sgCSSKNYX02NzwrcjNO.html

24-08-2020||Delhi||Extend deadline for new fire safety norms till March 2021: Hotel owners||As hotels and guesthouses in the capital gear up to reopen after a lull of five months, owners of such establishments have a new reason to worry — a bunch of new fire safety norms, which were notified in May 2019.The owners have requested the Delhi government to extend the deadline (from March 31, 2020 to March 31, 2021) for the implementation of the new norms that are currently under review.A delegation of Delhi Hotel and Restaurant Owners’ Association met chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in this regard on Friday. The new rules demand amendments to building bylaws to strengthen fire safety norms. As per the new amendments, kitchen or cooking activity in any form is not allowed on rooftops or basements of buildings, and storage of inflammable materials or temporary roofing is banned in terraces.Besides, inflammable materials — like carpets and wooden or foam panelings — are not allowed on passages, corridors and staircases of buildings, and storage of gas cylinders in violation of standards prescribed by the National Building Code is also banned.After a massive fire in Karol Bagh’s Hotel Arpit Palace claimed 17 lives in February last year, the Delhi government had got all hotels in Paharganj and Karol Bagh inspected. The government had later notified amendments to the building bylaws to strengthen fire safety norms in May 2019. The amendments, which are under review after hotel owners raised concerns about certain provisions, were to be implemented by December 2019 but was extended till March 31, 2020.In November last year, the Delhi government had constituted a sub-committee, which was chaired by a special commissioner of police (licensing), to review and make appropriate recommendations for fire safety of guest houses and restaurants. The committee is yet to submit its report, said a senior police official.Mohit Shah, general secretary of Delhi Hotel and Restaurant Owners’ Association, said, “The process got delayed due to the pandemic. Our fire NoCs are not valid right now since the new norms were notified. After the recommendations of the committee are notified, we need time to implement the new fire safety norms. In our meeting with the CM on Friday, we requested him to extend the deadline for the implementation of the new norms till March 31, 2021.”On Friday, the Delhi Fire Service held a meeting with the Delhi government’s principal secretary (home) to decide on the issue. A meeting with chief secretary Vijay Dev was also held recently to discuss the matter, said a senior official, requesting anonymity.According to a senior official in the home department of Delhi government, the decision to extend the deadline for the implementation of the new norms has to be taken by the urban development department.“So far no decision has been taken in this regard,” said a senior official with the urban development department.Hotel owners say that they need time till next year, as the industry is badly hit due to the pandemic and there is shortage of labourers. “Implementation of the new norms require some changes in our building. But right now, construction workers are not easily available. Moreover, we want to first restart our businesses,” said Boddy Lohia, president of Mahipalpur hotel owners’ association.The hotel owners had raised objections to a few provisions in the amendment, such as installation of Carbon monoxide detectors and fire check or protection doors, and no fire NoCs to hotels with more than four floors.Former DFS chief AK Sharma said the new amendments were an outcome of the Hotel Arpit Palace fire tragedy as it was realised that these hotels need additional norms with respect to life and fire safety. He said that the new norms should be implemented in a timebound manner.“Not only in view of the Covid pandemic, but even earlier also these hotel owner organisations had requested time for implementing these mandates. Are we not playing with the safety of people? Since the government has decided to open hotels, the review committee should get it done on war footing and the report must be submitted without delay. The same must be implemented in a time bound manner. Thereafter, those who do not implement the new rules must be penalised,” Sharma said.Every hotel or a lodging house needs a licence from DCP (licencing) to run it, under the Delhi Police Act. For obtaining the licence, an application form has to be accompanied with land ownership proof, rent agreement and the site and building plan and the premise has to be inspected by the licencing branch.Joint commissioner of police (licensing ) Suvashis Choudhary said the report is being prepared by the sub-committee cand is in its final stage. It is expected to be submitted within the next two weeks.“The new rules issued by the fire department through a notification dated May 27, 2019, were not being followed by many hotels at that time and therefore many of them were forced to shut down. Because hotel owners also had apprehensions towards the new norms, the committee was then set up in November last year to review them,” Choudhary said.Delhi police’s public relations officer Eish Singhal also did not comment on the matter.A Delhi government spokesperson said, “The government will consider their proposal and decide after examining all the details.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/extend-deadline-for-new-fire-safety-norms-till-march-2021-hotel-owners/story-tOcPsFw5EP0ClUcSlfXMVI.html
24-08-2020||Delhi||After basements flood in GK-II, water supply in area to be shut off, teams to hunt out cause||After incidents of flooding in the basement of buildings in south Delhi’s Greater Kailash-II, officials from the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) will conduct inspections in the area, after shutting off water supply in the neighbourhood for 24 hours between Monday and Tuesday.Officials will seek to ascertain if there is a leakage in a 600mm-wide water pipeline laid in the area in January this year. Along with GK-II, water supply is likely to affect part of neighbouring CR Park and adjoining neighbourhoods as well, including Kalkaji and Alaknanda. Officials said supply will remain suspended from Monday evening to Tuesday morning.The problem first came to light around a month ago, has currently afflicted at least 100 buildings in the neighbourhood. SDMC and DJB officials suspect the problem arose due to a “sudden” recharge of groundwater, the cause of which is still not known.According to a senior DJB official, though they have already checked the newly laid main pipeline for leakages, water supply is being suspended on the request of CGWB scientists.“The water pipeline was replaced in January this year, and had there been leakages, it would have been detected early on itself. However, after this issue was reported by residents, we dug up four or five test pits around the pipeline on Sunday to check for leakages, but found them dry. The CGWB will conduct a survey of the area to find out the probable reasons and work out solutions,” said a senior DJB official, who asked not to be named.Meanwhile, water tankers will be sent to the area during the day to help people store water. “Some tankers will also be on standby in case supply is shut off for a longer period,” the DJB official said.Area MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj said the problem is likely because of the rising water table.“A DJB leakage-detection had inspected the area on Sunday morning. Test pits were dug up, but no leakage was found. Then along with municipal officials, we inspected tubewells installed by the corporation in the nearby market to water parks in the area. It was found that water could be traced at the level of 15 feet underground itself, which is too high. Usually, in Delhi water is found at the level of 300 feet,” he said.He added that the rise in the water table is probably because areas around GK, such as Sangam Vihar were dependent on tubewells for a long time. Now, he said, a large number of illegal tubewells in and around have been done away with by the DJB over the past two years, as water pipelines have been laid in many parts of Sangam Vihar now. “With reduced extraction of groundwater from illegal tubewells and borewells, the water table has risen. I have also written to the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) to join the survey tomorrow,” he said.Bhardwaj said this problem has previously occurred in many areas such as Nehru Enclave, Kalkaji and even Nizamuddn West. “It was found that the water table had risen in these areas as well, which is also a good sign for Delhi where the depleting groundwater table has long been a concern.”Residents of GK-II have complained that water has been accumulating in basements for around a month now. The area residents’ welfare association last week also wrote to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and asked for an immediate response. Sanjay Rana, president, RWA GK-II, said the problem started around a month back when water seepage was first spotted in the basement of a grocery store in M-block market. Later the problem spread to some other parts like E, W and S blocks. He said over a hundred buildings in GK-II are tackling the problem, with some basements flooded over one-foot deep in water.“It’s not sewer or drain water, because the water is clean. CGWB scientists checked and found that at a few locations the water was available at around 20 ft which was at 100 feet six months back. This is beyond comprehension. So acting on the advice of CGWB officials, the DJB has decided to shut off water supply in the neighbourhood on Monday evening and Tuesday morning to rule out any leakage in its water line,” Rana said.He said CGWB teams will monitor ground water levels every six hours during the 36-hour shutdown. Residents have been assured that water tankers will be available whenever required in area during the shutdown.Subhash Bhadana, deputy mayor, SDMC visited buildings that were facing seepage, and said SDMC engineers have checked and concluded that drains in the area were “not the source of the flooding”.“I have directed our horticulture department to pump out ground water from all tube wells situated in parks at GK-II so that the underground water level may drop. On Monday, a joint team of ground water department and DJB that will also have SDMC engineers will inspect the entire area to ascertain the cause and find solution to the problem. Our engineers are assuming that it might be the case of sudden rise in ground water level,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-basements-flood-in-gk-ii-water-supply-in-area-to-be-shut-off-teams-to-hunt-out-cause/story-HbwVAuROZbCAn29OBR6P4I.html
24-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi witnesses cleanest August air in 4 years: CPCB data||The air in the Capital this August has so far been the cleanest for four years, thanks to repeated spells of intense rain and persistent drizzles, data from the apex pollution control body showsIn fact, as per the data, till August 23, available with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), this month has had only ‘satisfactory’ and ‘good’ air days, as per the air quality index (AQI).An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.As per data analysed by HT, while August 2019 had two consecutive ‘good’ air days and 20 ‘satisfactory’ days, it also recorded nine ‘moderate’ days. However, the same month in 2018, 2017 and 2016 did not record a single ‘good’ air day. According to CPCB officials, with a forecast of more rainfall over the next week in Delhi and the national capital region (NCR), air quality is likely to remain in the satisfactory category and may even improve. “Usually monsoon months are cleaner, but this year, because of widespread intense rainfall, pollutants were washed away from the whole of northwest region, thus directly impacting air quality. The continuing light showers are likely to keep air clean over the coming week,” said a senior CPCB official, who asked not to be named.On Sunday, as per the CPCB’s daily 4pm bulletin, Delhi’s 24-hour AQI was 53 (satisfactory). Delhi received a spell of ‘heavy to very heavy’ rainfall between August 20 and 21. On August 20, the city experienced a good air day with an AQI of 50. This was the second good air day this month, and third for the year so far. Previously, on August 13, after a period of heavy rain, Delhi’s AQI dropped to 50. The first ‘good’ air day this year was recorded on March 28, days after the nationwide lockdown was imposed, with an AQI reading of 45.“Since August 20, the AQI has been below 60, in the lower range of the ‘satisfactory’ zone, which is a good sign,” the above quoted CPCB official added. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy) at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said, “Generally, monsoon months are cleaner than the rest of the year. Higher number of clean air days this August is a combination of good rainfall and the overall reduction in pollution levels in the months preceding August (during the lockdown). Pollutants did not accumulate as much, and were washed away by heavy rainfall. It is crucial to keep this trend through the coming winter months with aggressive implementation of pollution control measures.”Scientists at the IMD said that with another week of rain forecast, this August is likely to become among the wettest compared to at least the last five years. IMD’s data between June 1 and August 22 shows that Delhi received a cumulative rainfall of 414.2mm. In August alone, Delhi received 217.5mm rainfall, which was a surplus of 32%.“Light rain will continue in many parts, but a ‘moderate’ spell of rain will hit Delhi on the night of August 25, and will continue on August 26 and 27,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre.The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the Central government’s air quality monitoring and forecasting wing, too has forecast that with more rains likely, the air quality over next week is expected to remain in the ‘satisfactory’ zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cleanest-august-air-in-4-years-cpcb-data/story-5gCFB6gp5xYNx8gDJQcPLK.html
24-08-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal says govt working with banks to provide ease loan process for traders||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that his government would soon talk to scheduled banks in the city to ease the process of giving loans for traders, start working on a portal that would help connect traders in the city with those in other states and countries, and improve infrastructure of existing markets in the Capital.In a web interaction with traders from across the city, the chief minister shared a broad road map for the revival of Delhi’s economy in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic. “I want to assure you that in the days to come, we will have a number of announcements that would benefit industrialists and traders in the city. We are currently working on several schemes and policies that are aimed at improving business environment, trade and revive Delhi’s economy.”“Several traders in the city have told us that they are facing difficulties in availing loans under the Central government’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ scheme. We shall soon talk to scheduled banks and ensure that the process of availing loans is eased,” Kejriwal said in a speech at the end of the webinar.In May, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a Rs 20-lakh crore economic stimulus package – under the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ tag popularised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi – in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic, which included collateral-free loans for medium scale, small and micro enterprises.On Sunday’s session, Kejriwal further said, “Delhi has several industrial areas and wholesale markets which produce or trade in some specific products. For them, we shall work on starting a portal which could help connect them with other traders in other states and other countries.”“We have also received a lot of suggestions on improving the infrastructure of existing markets in the city. Delhi’s markets should be of international standards and we are working towards that. We started with the Chandni Chowk project and in the coming days we will work towards improving the infrastructure of more such markets,” said Kejriwal.Leher Sethi, an entrepreneur from the event management industry who was present in the webinar, said: “The hospitality and event industry has been greatly affected. Measures must be taken to revive this industry because events are mostly happening online and this is likely to continue till 2021. In the past one month, around 60,000 events from across 11 countries have been cancelled.”In a web interaction, Kejriwal pointed out how Delhi is one of the rare states in the country which did not have to impose a lockdown for the second time and discussed a series of measures, such as creating a job portal and setting up a committee to advise him on reviving Delhi’s economy in the light of the pandemic.Sanjeev Mehra, president of the traders’ association in Khan Market, said: “We are thankful to the government for providing us with all the support to ensure that physical distancing protocols and hygiene is maintained in the markets. There has been no Covid case in Khan Market, and business is slowly picking up pace.”Praveen Goyal, president of Delhi marble traders’ association, said, “There are more than 1 lakh marble shops in Delhi and more than 1 lakh people are earning their livelihoods through marble business. But there is no organized parking in marble market areas in Delhi. If a marble facilitation zone is created on 100 hectares of land, it will be a huge relief.”Meenakshi Dutt, a salon owner who participated in the webinar, said: “The government must establish a women’s cell or a department in Delhi where women entrepreneurs can report their grievances and issues related to businesses. I want to thank the Delhi government for opening the salon industry in Delhi when the time was right.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-says-govt-working-with-banks-to-provide-ease-loan-process-for-traders/story-9Gyov2PoBC84sLGl3vHycK.html

24-08-2020||World||NY AG probes if Donald Trump pumped up value of estate, assets||New York’s Democratic attorney general asked a court Monday to enforce subpoenas into an investigation into whether President Donald Trump and his businesses inflated assets on financial statements.Attorney General Letitia James filed a petition in state trial court in New York City naming the Trump Organization, an umbrella group for the Republican president’s holdings, as a respondent along with other business entities. The filing also named Eric Trump and Seven Springs, a New York estate owned by the Trump family.The attorney general said Eric Trump, president of Seven Springs and vice president of the organization, should be compelled to testify.The investigation centers on whether the Trump Organization and the president improperly inflated the value of assets to secure loans and obtain economic and tax benefits. Investigators are looking into whether the Trump Organization and its agents improperly inflated the value of the Seven Springs north of the city.In the court filings, the attorney general’s office wrote that “information regarding the valuation of Seven Springs is significant” to the office’s investigation.Emails seeking comment were sent to lawyers for the Trump Organization and Eric Trump.The investigation was launched in March 2019 after Trump’s longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen told Congress that Trump had inflated the value of his assets to obtain more favorable terms for loans and insurance coverage.Since then, the attorney general’s office has issued “a number of subpoenas and has taken testimony seeking information material to these matters,” the court filing said. Investigators have not yet determined whether the law was broken.“For months, the Trump Organization has made baseless claims in an effort to shield evidence from a lawful investigation into its financial dealings,” James said in a prepared statement. “They have stalled, withheld documents, and instructed witnesses, including Eric Trump, to refuse to answer questions under oath.”James’ office issued subpoenas to the Trump Organization and to Seven Springs LLC in December 2019, seeking financial documents, the filing said. Since then, both have “engaged in extensive good-faith discussions concerning the Trump Organization’s compliance with the subpoenas.”The attorney general’s office is also attempting to collect information about several other Trump-related properties, including the Trump National Golf Club near Los Angeles, the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago and an office building on Wall Street in Manhattan where the Trump Organization “owns a ‘ground lease’ pertaining to the property.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ny-ag-probes-if-donald-trump-pumped-up-value-of-estate-assets/story-5W3OBqiEnRUoer2rtwML6I.html
24-08-2020||World||Scientists say Hong Kong man got coronavirus a second time||University of Hong Kong scientists claim to have the first evidence of someone being reinfected with the virus that causes Covid-19.Genetic tests revealed that a 33-year-old man returning to Hong Kong from a trip to Spain in mid-August had a different strain of the coronavirus than the one he’d previously been infected with in March, said Dr. Kelvin Kai-Wang To, the microbiologist who led the work.The man had mild symptoms the first time and none the second time; his more recent infection was detected through screening and testing at the Hong Kong airport.“It shows that some people do not have lifelong immunity” to the virus if they’ve already had it, To said. “We don’t know how many people can get reinfected. There are probably more out there.”The paper has been accepted by the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases but not yet published, and some independent experts urged caution until full results are available.Whether people who have had Covid-19 are immune to new infections and for how long are key questions that have implications for vaccine development and decisions about returning to work, school and social activities.Even if someone can be infected a second time, it’s not known if they have some protection against serious illness, because the immune system generally remembers how to make antibodies against a virus it’s seen before.It’s not clear how different a virus needs to be to trigger illness, but the new work suggests that “COVID patients should not be complacent about prevention measures” and should continue social distancing, wearing masks and other ways to reduce infection, To said.Two experts with with no role in the work agreed.“We’ve always known reinfection was a possibility and I think this is highly suggestive” that it occurred in this case, said Dr. Jesse Goodman, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration chief scientist now at Georgetown University. “If there is a reinfection, it suggests the possibility there was residual immunity ... that helped protect the patient” from getting sick again, Goodman said.However, “if immunity wanes from natural infection, it could be a challenge for vaccines” and may mean booster shots are needed, he added.Julie Fischer, a microbiologist at CRDF Global, a nonprofit health group in Arlington, Virginia, said the study gives convincing evidence that reinfection can happen.“The real question is what this means for severity of disease” if that occurs, and whether such people can infect others, she said.One expert saw the report as good news. Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said it’s encouraging the reported reinfection was without symptoms.“That’s a win as far as I’m concerned” because it suggests a first infection may protect a person from moderate to severe disease the second time around, he said in an interview streamed by the Journal of the American Medical Association.A mid-May survey by the doctors’ information-sharing site Sermo found that 13% of the 4,173 doctors responding believed that they had treated one or more patients who were reinfected. Among the respondents, 7% of those in the U.S. and 16% in other countries thought they’d seen such a case.However, health officials have also wondered whether people who tested positive long after their initial illness were simply showing signs of not completely clearing the virus rather than being infected anew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-say-hong-kong-man-got-coronavirus-a-second-time/story-jtKDhlx90dvxYxkW2bxO7M.html

He was arrested Sunday.The case against Cheng is part of a pattern of Justice Department prosecutions against researchers at American universities who are accused of concealing their professional relationships with Chinese universities. The Trump administration has sought to crack down on professors tempted to exploit their ties to China, and their participation in talent recruitment programs, by stealing intellectual property for Beijing’s economic benefit.Cheng, who was hired by Texas A&M in 2004, led a team of researchers that received, nearly $750,000 in NASA grants for space research. At the same time, though, he served as director of an institute in Guangdong, China that was established by China’s Education Ministry, prosecutors say. In addition, he participated in talent recruitment programs established by the Chinese government that the U.S. says entices professors at American universities to steal cutting-edge research that can be provided to China.Prosecutors say Cheng hid those affiliations from the university and from NASA even as he collected federal grant money, and even though restrictions on the grant barred collaborating or coordinating with China, Chinese universities or China-owned companies.Cheng’s voicemail box at the university was full and could not accept messages, and it was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer. An email to the university seeking comment was not immediately returned.The Justice Department will “continue seeking to bring participate in these talent programs to light,” Assistant Attorney General John Demers, the department’s top national security official, said in a statement.U.S. Attorney Ryan Patrick, the top federal prosecutor for the Southern District of Texas, said the talent recruitment programs exploit “our open and free universities.”“China is building an economic and academic institutions with bricks stolen from others all around the world,” Patrick said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/professor-nasa-researcher-accused-of-concealing-china-ties/story-Xr4tJ26Sfy9HM4sGBYgZgL.html
24-08-2020||World||Police shooting lays bare Wisconsin’s deep partisan divide||The shooting by police in Wisconsin of a Black man sparked strong words of condemnation from the state’s Democratic governor, who said he stood by those who demand justice. Republicans and the police union countered Monday that the governor went too far, urging caution in making any judgments about what sparked the shooting.The divergent reactions to the shooting Sunday by Kenosha police is just the latest example of the deep divide in Wisconsin, a key presidential battleground state that has been at the forefront of partisan battles for the past decade ranging from redistricting to union rights. More recently, Republicans ignored Gov. Tony Evers’ call to do away with in-person voting for the state’s April presidential primary in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.Cellphone footage posted on social media Sunday appeared to show police shooting Blake multiple times in the back as he opened a door and leaned into an SUV. The state Department of Justice said officers were responding to a domestic incident, but it has not released more details. Blake was in serious condition Monday at a Milwaukee hospital.Protests erupted in Kenosha in the hours after the shooting, sparking concerns of more unrest across the country similar to what was seen after the May death of George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police. Chris Ott, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin, said the shooting “looks like attempted murder.”“Exhale,” said Republican state Sen. Van Wanggaard, a retired police officer from Racine, which is next to Kenosha. “Everyone should take a deep breath. ... We must let law and reason, not emotion, guide the next steps.”But Evers was passionate in his response, saying he stands with everyone who has demanded justice, equity and accountability and against excessive use of force when engaged with Black people.“While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country,” Evers said.Wanggaard was among Republicans who condemned Evers for his comments, which were issued just as protesters took to the streets in Kenosha and clashed with police.“The best leaders attempt to diffuse situations, not escalate them,” Wanggaard said. “Evers’ statement was irresponsible and inflammatory. He jumped to conclusions without first having all the facts. At a time when stereotyping situations is especially risky, Evers stereotyped every police interaction with people of color — harming both.”Pete Deates, president of the Kenosha police union, called Evers’ statement “wholly irresponsible.”“As always, the video currently circulating does not capture all the intricacies of a highly dynamic incident,” Deates said in a statement. “We ask that you withhold from passing judgment until all the facts are known and released.”Evers used the latest shooting to demand action from elected officials in Wisconsin “who have failed to recognize the racism in our state and our country for far too long.”Evers called on the GOP-controlled Legislature to pass a package of police reform bills in June, following Floyd’s death. The Legislature has not taken any action on the measures, which would ban the use of chokeholds by Wisconsin police officers, as well as limit other uses of force.Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos on Monday said he was creating a task force to examine police policies and standards, racial disparities, educational opportunities and public safety. He did not address any of the bills Evers and Democrats have advocated.“We must find a path forward as a society that brings everyone together,” Vos said, while denouncing violent protests and saying investigators must be able to complete their work “to know if the shocking 20-second video clip shared with the media tells the whole story.”Wisconsin Republicans echoed a law-and-order theme that President Donald Trump has been using in his reelection campaign, including during stops to Minnesota and Wisconsin last week. While calling for peaceful protests, Wisconsin Republicans also urged patience given the ongoing investigation.Jim Steineke, Republican majority leader of the Wisconsin Assembly, didn’t call out Evers by name but urged elected officials to “resist the temptation to rush to judgment.”“The frustration and anger that many in our communities are feeling must be met with empathy, but cannot be further fueled by politicians’ statements or actions that can stoke flames of violence,” Steineke said.Evers, in the second year of his first term, has been stymied by Republicans who control the Legislature and have it as their goal in November to build majorities strong enough to override any gubernatorial veto. The state also is at the forefront of the presidential race, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week emphasizing the recurring message that “it’s all riding on Wisconsin.” Trump won Wisconsin by less than a percentage point in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-shooting-lays-bare-wisconsin-s-deep-partisan-divide/story-7SGAoEIgeW8rA5hc7fQ0cN.html
24-08-2020||World||Big California wildfires burn on as death toll reaches 7||Firefighters battling three massive wildfires in Northern California got a break from the weather early Monday as humidity rose and there was no return of the onslaught of lightning strikes that ignited the infernos a week earlier.A warning about dry lighting and gusty winds that could spark more fires was lifted for the San Francisco Bay Area and relieved fire commanders said the weather was aiding their efforts.“Mother Nature’s helped us quite a bit,” said Billy See, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection incident commander for a complex of fires burning south of San Francisco.California has had more than 13,000 lightning strikes since mid-August and more than 600 wildfires statewide have burned more than 1.2 million acres, or 1,875 square miles (4,856 square kilometers), said Daniel Berlant, assistant deputy director with California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire.More than 1,200 buildings have been destroyed and 14,000 firefighters have been deployed, he said.The three big fires around the Bay Area and many others burning across the state have put nearly 250,000 people under evacuation orders and warnings and authorities renewed warnings for anxious homeowners to stay away from the evacuation zones.Six people who returned to a restricted area south of San Francisco to check on their properties were surprised by fire and had to be rescued, the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office said.The death toll from the fires reached 7 over the weekend after authorities battling a big fire in the Santa Cruz Mountains south of San Francisco announced the discovery of the body of a 70-year-old man in a remote area called Last Chance.He had been reported missing and police had to use a helicopter to reach the area of about 40 off-the-grid homes at the end of a windy, steep dirt road north of the city of Santa Cruz.The area was under an evacuation order and Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office Chief Deputy Chris Clark said the discovery of the man’s body was a reminder of how important it was for residents to evacuate from fire danger zones.“This is one of the darkest periods we’ve been in with this fire,” he said.The Santa Cruz fire is one of three “complexes,” or groups of fires, burning on all sides of the San Francisco Bay Area. All were started by lightning.Fire crew made slow progress battling the blazes over the weekend, which included a break in the unseasonably warm weather and little wind.A fire in wine country north of San Francisco and another southeast of the city have within a week have grown to be two of the three largest fires in state history, with both burning more than 500 square miles (1,295 square kilometers).The wine country fire has been the most deadly and destructive blaze, accounting for five deaths and 845 destroyed homes and other buildings. Three of the victims were in a home that was under an evacuation order.Officials surveying maps at command centers are astonished by the sheer size of the fires, said Cal Fire spokesman Brice Bennett.“You could overlay half of one of these fires and it covers the entire city of San Francisco,” Bennett said Sunday.In Southern California, an 11-day-old blaze held steady at just under 50 square miles (106 square kilometers) near Lake Hughes in the northern Los Angeles County mountains. Rough terrain, hot weather and the potential for thunderstorms with lightning strikes challenged firefighters on Sunday.Authorities said their firefighting effort in Santa Cruz was hindered by people who refused to evacuate and those who were using the chaos to loot. Santa Cruz County Sheriff Jim Hart said 100 officers were patrolling and anyone not authorized to be in an evacuation zone would be arrested.“What we’re hearing from the community is that there’s a lot of looting going on,” Hart said.He and county District Attorney Jeff Rosell expressed anger at what Rosell called the “absolutely soulless” criminals victimizing people already victimized by the fire. Among them was a fire commander who was robbed when he left his fire vehicle to help direct operations.Someone entered the vehicle and stole personal items, including a wallet and “drained his bank account,” said Chief Mark Brunton, a battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.“I can’t imagine a bigger lowlife,” Hart said.Holly Hansen, who fled the wine country fire, was among evacuees from the community of Angwin allowed Sunday to return home for one hour to retrieve belongings. She and her three dogs waited five hours in her SUV for their turn. Among the items she took with her were photos of her pets.“It’s horrible when you have to think about what to take,” she said. “I think it’s a very raw human base emotion to have fear of fire and losing everything. It’s frightening.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/big-california-wildfires-burn-on-as-death-toll-reaches-7/story-7f1xwY3zYn15g39RBV4jaL.html
24-08-2020||World||Trump vows to ‘prohibit’ US firms from replacing local workers with low-cost foreigners in 2nd term||President Donald Trump, who was on Monday formally nominated by Republicans to seek a second term, has vowed to “prohibit” American companies from replacing local workers with lower-cost foreign workers, a key fallout of outsourcing, and continue his hardline position on immigration.“We have to win. This is the most important election in the history of our country,” President Trump said in an unannounced appearance at the convention, based in Charlotte, after securing the nomination. He will formally deliver the acceptance speech on Thursday, from the White House.Called “Fighting for You”, the agenda also promises to “end reliance” on China by encouraging American companies to bring back operations and continue the president’s “America First” foreign policy, of ending wars and ensuring allies “pay their fair share” towards common defence.The agenda was released on the eve of the four-day Republican Party convention that nominated Trump on Monday morning as its nominee for the November 3 election, with Vice-President Mike Pence as his running mate. They are up against Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, and his running mate, Kamala Harris.Just hours ahead of the convention, Kellyanne Conway, counsellor to the president, announced she is leaving to spend more time with her children. It’s time for “less drama, more mama,” she said in a statement. Conway and her husband, George Conway, a conservative lawyer were a widely watched DC couple. As Conway remained one of the president’s fiercest defenders, the husband was an acerbic Trump critic.The 50-point agenda builds on the “incredible achievements” of the president’s first term in office, the campaign said in the announcement, and added that it will reflect his “optimism and certainty in America’s greatness”.It’s a bare-bones announcement that lists out the president’s 50 second-term priorities, which he will flesh out in his acceptance speech on Thursday, the final day of the convention, and on the campaign trail.“Prohibit American Companies from Replacing United States Citizens with Lower-Cost Foreign Workers,” the agenda said in a section headlined “End illegal immigration and protect American workers”, which indicates both continuity and hardening of the President’s position on immigration.It hits at the core of the outsourcing industry in the United States that has engendered and supported IT giants from many countries — and include TCS, Infosys and Wipro from India.Trump has been turning up pressure on the outsourcing industry — centered around H-1B non-immigrant short-term work visas — from practically the first quarter of his presidency. Earlier this month, Trump issued another executive order prohibiting federal government agencies from contracting work to companies that use foreign workers. At the same time, the president instructed the labor department to “finalize guidance to prevent H-1B employers from moving H-1B workers to other employers’ job sites to displace Americans workers”.Trump has suspended all legal immigration — Green Cards — and short-term non-immigration work visas, such as H-1B, till the end of December to ensure millions of Americans laid off because of the Covid-19 epidemic have a first shot at jobs that become available.Other elements of the agenda on immigration were a continuation of the current policies, such as ensuring new immigrants don’t need state help, block illegal immigrants from taxpayer-funded programmes and free college tuition.Ending “endless wars” and getting “allies to pay their fair share” will be Trump 2.0’s “America First foreign policy”, which continues the emphasis on bringing home troops from Afghanistan and making NATO allies ramp up their respective defence. Other foreign policy priorities include wiping out global terrorists that threaten Americans and build a “great” cyber security defence system and missile defence system.Other priorities were aimed at addressing domestic issues such as tackling the Covid-19 epidemic, finding a vaccine, defend police (against calls for defending them by anti-racism activists), cut drug prices and other promises on healthcare, and education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-vows-to-prohibit-us-firms-from-replacing-local-workers-with-low-cost-foreigners-in-2nd-term/story-6lYh1K8KFDDsMxQkWJaU2O.html
24-08-2020||World||UN warns on coronavirus plasma treatment, says ‘still experimental, results not conclusive’||The World Health Organization on Monday cautioned that using blood plasma from Covid-19 survivors to treat other patients is still considered an experimental therapy, voicing the concern as a US boost for the treatment has many scientists afraid formal studies will be derailed.On Sunday, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized what’s called “emergency use” of the treatment under its special powers to speed the availability of promising experimental drugs during a public health crisis. The action isn’t the same as approving plasma as safe and effective, and numerous rigorous studies are underway to find out if it really works.So far, “The results are not conclusive,” WHO’s chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said during a press briefing. “At the moment, it’s still very low-quality evidence.”Convalescent plasma is a century-old treatment that was used to fight off flu and measles outbreaks in the days before vaccines, and was tried more recently during the Ebola outbreak. When the body encounters a new germ, it makes proteins called antibodies that are specially targeted to fight the infection. The antibodies float in plasma — the yellowish, liquid part of blood — which is collected from Covid-19 survivors and given to patients infected with coronavirus.Swaminathan said WHO considered plasma therapy to be experimental and that it should continue to be evaluated. She said the treatment is difficult to standardize: Plasma must be collected individually, and people produce different levels of antibodies.“Of course, countries can do an emergency listing if they feel the benefits outweigh the risks,” she said. “But that’s usually done when you’re waiting for the more definitive evidence.”In a letter describing the FDA’s emergency action, the agency’s chief scientist said the treatment “should not be considered a new standard of care” for coronavirus infections, and that more data from studies will be available in the coming months.But already, so many Covid-19 patients have requested plasma rather than agreeing to be part of a research study that many scientists fear they won’t get a clear answer on whether the treatment really works -- and if it does, how and when it should be used for the best outcomes.Martin Landray, of the University of Oxford said that while the therapy offers “huge promise,” there was still no proof it works.“There is a huge gap between theory and proven benefit,” he said in a statement.If just a few thousand patients took part in the research “we would have the answer,” said Landray, who is conducting a plasma study in the UK. “If effective, convalescent plasma could be rapidly used worldwide. If not, it could be abandoned,”Stephen Griffin, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Leeds, said there was still considerable uncertainty about the immune system’s response to Covid-19, making any potential use of convalescent plasma challenging.The FDA’s action was announced during a Sunday press briefing by U.S. President Donald Trump, who called it a “breakthrough.”“It appears that the lessons from hydroxychloroquine have not been learned,” Griffin said, referring to the malaria drug touted by Trump and others as a potential treatment for the coronavirus.The FDA also granted hydroxychloroquine an emergency authorization before suspending it months later after several trials showed the drug didn’t work against Covid-19 and raised the risk of heart, kidney, liver and other problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-warns-on-coronavirus-plasma-treatment-says-still-experimental-results-not-conclusive/story-R48JA2Hgv2vGzYIkqjRuMO.html
24-08-2020||World||Police shooting of Black man stirs unrest in Wisconsin city||Kenosha became the nation’s latest flashpoint city in a summer of racial unrest after police shot and wounded a Black man, apparently in the back, as he leaned into his SUV while his three children sat in the vehicle.Protesters set cars on fire, smashed windows and clashed with officers in riot gear Sunday night, while Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden condemned the shooting of 29-year-old Jacob Blake, who was hospitalized in serious condition.Police in the former auto manufacturing center of 100,000 people midway between Milwaukee and Chicago said Blake was shot while they were responding to a call about a domestic dispute. They did not immediately disclose the race of the three officers at the scene or say whether Blake was armed, and they released no details on the dispute.Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, representing Blake’s family, said Blake was “simply trying to do the right thing by intervening in a domestic incident.”The officers were placed on administrative leave, standard practice in a shooting by police, while the state Justice Department investigates.The shooting happened around 5 p.m. Sunday and was captured from across the street on cellphone video that was posted online. Kenosha police do not have body cameras.In the footage, Blake walks from the sidewalk around the front of his SUV to his driver-side door as officers follow him with their guns pointed and shout at him. As Blake opens the door and leans into the SUV, an officer grabs his shirt from behind and opens fire while Blake has his back turned.Seven shots can be heard, though it isn’t clear how many struck Blake or how many of the officers fired. During the shooting, a Black woman can be seen screaming in the street and jumping up and down.“While we do not have all of the details yet,” the governor said in a statement, “what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country.”Biden called for “an immediate, full and transparent investigation” and said the officers “must be held accountable.”“This morning, the nation wakes up yet again with grief and outrage that yet another Black American is a victim of excessive force,” he said, just over two months before Election Day in a country already roiled by the recent deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky. “Those shots pierce the soul of our nation.”Pete Deates, president of the Kenosha police union, called the governor’s statement “wholly irresponsible.”“As always, the video currently circulating does not capture all the intricacies of a highly dynamic incident,” Deates said in a statement. “We ask that you withhold from passing judgment until all the facts are known and released.”Online court records indicate Kenosha County prosecutors charged Blake on July 6 with sexual assault, trespassing and disorderly conduct in connection with domestic abuse. An arrest warrant was issued the following day. The records contain no further details and do not list an attorney for Blake.It was unclear whether that case had anything to do with the shooting.Laquisha Booker, who is Blake’s partner, told NBC’s Milwaukee affiliate, WTMJ-TV, that the couple’s three children were in the back seat of the SUV when police shot him.“That man just literally grabbed him by his shirt and looked the other way and was just shooting him. With the kids in the back screaming. Screaming,” Booker said.Crump, the attorney who has also represented the Floyd and Taylor families, called the police officers’ actions “irresponsible, reckless and inhumane.”“We all watched the horrific video of Jacob Blake being shot in the back several times by Kenosha police,” Crump said in a statement. “Even worse, his three sons witnessed their father collapse after being riddled with bullets. ... It’s a miracle he’s still alive.”In the unrest that followed, social media posts showed neighbors gathering in the surrounding streets and shouting at police. Some chanted, “No justice, no peace!” Others appeared to throw objects at officers and damage police vehicles. Officers fired tear gas to disperse the crowds.In a scene that mirrored the widespread protests in recent months over police brutality and racial inequality, marchers headed to the Kenosha County Public Safety Building, which houses the police and sheriff’s departments. Authorities mostly blocked off the building, which was closed on Monday because of damage, officials said.Wisconsin’s Republican Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke cautioned the public and elected officials against “racing towards judgment,” given how few details were known.“The frustration & anger that many in our communities are feeling must be met with empathy, but cannot be further fueled by politicians’ statements or actions that can stoke flames of violence,” tweeted Steineke, who is white.For more than 100 years, Kenosha was an auto manufacturing center, but it has now largely been transformed into a bedroom community for Milwaukee and Chicago.The city is about 67% white, 11.5% Black and 17.6% Hispanic, according to 2019 Census data. Both the mayor and police chief are white. About 17% of the population lives in poverty.Like other cities across the U.S., Kenosha has been grappling with unemployment in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. Its unemployment rate was 10.8% in June, among the highest in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-shooting-of-black-man-stirs-unrest-in-wisconsin-city/story-jhuIFtYwmtn8mpCNYNgtxH.html
24-08-2020||World||172 countries engaging with global Covid-19 vaccine plan, says WHO||Some 172 countries are engaging with the COVAX facility designed to ensure equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines, the World Health Organization said on Monday, but more funding is needed and countries need now to make binding commitments. Countries wishing to be part of the global COVAX plan have until Aug. 31 to submit expressions of interest, WHO officials said, with confirmation of intention to join due by Sept. 18, and initial payments due by Oct. 9.WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the facility was critical to ending the Covid-19 pandemic, and would not only pool risk for countries developing and buying vaccines, but also ensure prices are kept “as low as possible”.“Vaccine nationalism only helps the virus,” he told a media briefing. “The success of the COVAX facility hinges not only on countries signing up to it, but also filling key funding gaps.”COVAX is co-led by the GAVI vaccines alliance, the WHO and the CEPI Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and is designed to guarantee equitable access globally to Covid-19 vaccines once they are developed and authorised for use. It currently covers 9 candidate Covid-19 vaccines and its aim is to secure supplies of and deliver 2 billion doses across countries that sign up by the end of 2021.“Initially, when there will be limited supply (of Covid-19 vaccines), it’s important to provide the vaccine to those at highest risk around the globe,” Tedros said.He said this included health workers on the front lines of the pandemic, who were “critical to saving lives and stabilising the overall health system”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/172-countries-engaging-with-global-covid-19-vaccine-plan-says-who/story-J0wHyI0QO0SnCns90VnNcP.html
24-08-2020||World||TikTok sues Donald Trump administration over ban, says no security threat||TikTok said it is asking a judge to block the Trump administration from enacting a ban on the social media network, bringing a geopolitical fight over technology and trade into a U.S. courtroom in the run-up to the presidential election.TikTok said in a blog post Monday that its Chinese parent, ByteDance Ltd., is challenging an Aug. 6 order from President Donald Trump prohibiting U.S. residents from doing business with TikTok under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The order doesn’t take effect for weeks, but it escalated tensions as the U.S. declared Chinese businesses a security risk and Beijing assailed the administration as targeting China to score political points. TikTok argues it poses no security threat.The White House issued a second order Aug. 14 under a separate national security law that would force ByteDance to sell its U.S. assets. The suit sidesteps the second order. That order is based on an investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Decisions by the interagency panel, which is led by the Treasury Department, are all but impossible to overturn in court.The Justice Department declined to comment on TikTok’s challenge.Read More: Why Tencent and WeChat Are Such a Big Deal in ChinaThe suit comes as Trump steps up his campaign against China, betting it will help him win November’s election despite upsetting millions of younger TikTok users. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has urged American companies to bar Chinese applications from their app stores, part of his “Clean Network” guidance designed to prevent authorities in China from accessing the personal data of U.S. citizens.The outcome will also have implications for an increasingly interconnected global economy. Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. are among those already showing interest in buying TikTok.The challenge faces an uphill fight, according to James Dempsey, executive director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology at the University of California, Berkeley. Courts don’t generally review the president’s determinations on questions of national security, Dempsey said before the case was filed.But the company may be successful with a due process argument “that focuses not on the president’s ultimate decision but on the company’s lack of an opportunity to respond to the evidence against it,” Dempsey said. “A First Amendment challenge is also possible, but TikTok will have to establish that it has a First Amendment right to be on the phones of Americans or that TikTok is a publisher, separate from the First Amendment rights of its users.”Read More: Why Trump Is Threatening Your Teen’s Favorite AppTrump has threatened penalties on any U.S. resident or company that conducts transactions with TikTok or WeChat, a popular Chinese messaging app, saying that having Americans’ personal data exposed to China creates a national security risk. The apps could get bumped off Apple Inc. and Google’s app stores.While the order blocks all transactions involving the WeChat app, it doesn’t amount to a broader ban on dealings with its owner, Tencent Holdings Ltd., according to a U.S. official. Still, Tencent’s U.S.-listed shares fell 7.4% in the immediate response to Trump’s Aug. 6 decree.On Friday, a group of WeChat users sued in a San Francisco federal court saying Trump’s ban on the messaging app violated their right of free speech and due process rights because it doesn’t provide notice of the specific conduct that’s prohibited.“This executive order risks undermining global businesses’ trust in the United States’ commitment to the rule of law, which has served as a magnet for investment and spurred decades of American economic growth,” TikTok said in a statement hours after Trump’s order. “And it sets a dangerous precedent for the concept of free expression and open markets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-sues-donald-trump-administration-over-ban-says-no-security-threat/story-xwuoUIxTBffbms7GFse9iP.html
24-08-2020||World||Republicans nominate Donald Trump for second term, to take on Biden in the fall||The Republican Party formally nominated President Donald Trump for a second term in the White House Monday, one of the first acts of a GOP convention that has been dramatically scaled down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.Trump has sought to minimize the toll of the pandemic, but its impact was evident as proceedings began in Charlotte. Instead of the thousands of people who were expected to converge on this city for a week-long extravaganza, just 336 delegates participated in a roll-call vote from a Charlotte Convention Center ballroom.Earlier, the convention renominated Vice President Mike Pence, and he thanked the delegates in person.“The choice in this election has never been clearer and the stakes have never been higher,” Pence said. “We’re going to make American great again. Again.”Party Chair Ronna McDaniel said as she began the proceedings: “We are obviously disappointed we could not hold this event in the same way we had originally planned,” But she thanked the city for allowing the convention to move forward in its truncated form.Many of the usual trappings of a convention were present, including signs designating each state and gift bags with Republican swag. But chairs on the ballroom floor were arranged with lots of space between them and convention organizers told participants to wear masks, though adherence to the rule was uneven. Still, the fact an in-person meeting was held at all marked a sharp contrast with Democrats.Last week, the Democrats created a well-received roll call via video montage with diverse officials and others from states across the country. The Republicans, overwhelmingly white, spoke from the ballroom floor.After Trump’s renomination, much of the action is shifting to Washington, where Republicans will spend the week trying to convince the American people that the president deserves a second term.The GOP convention is a crucial moment for Trump, who is trailing in national and battleground state polls and under intense pressure to turn the race around. Just 23% think the country is heading in the right direction, while 75% think it’s on the wrong path, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.Aides want the convention to recast the story of Trump’s presidency and present the election as a choice between his vision for America’s future and the one presented by Democratic nominee Joe Biden.McDaniel worked to highlight that contrast, accusing Biden of embracing a radical left agenda and pushing back on Democrats’ efforts to demonstrate Biden’s empathy and kindness.“The truth is there’s only one person who has empathized with everyday Americans and actually been fighting for them every single day over the past four years, and that’s President Donald J. Trump,” she said.For both sides, it’s an unconventional convention year.The parties’ election year gatherings are typically massive events, drawing thousands of delegates, party leaders, donors, journalists and political junkies for a week of speeches, parties and after-parties that inject hundreds of thousands of dollars into the local economy and deliver a multiday infomercial for the nominee.The coronavirus has changed all that, as much as Trump has resisted. Just 336 delegates — six from each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories — have been invited to cast proxy votes on behalf of the more than 2,500 regular delegates. And stringent safety measures have been put in place guided by a 42-page health and safety plan developed by a hired doctor.Attendees were asked to practice enhanced social distancing and get tested prior to travel, fill out a pre-travel health questionnaire and participate in a daily symptom tracker. They’re also being tested onsite, have been asked to maintain a 6-foot (1.8-meter) distance from other people and to use face coverings as a condition of participation — though many attendees were seen openly flouting those rules Monday morning. The RNC has also committed to contacting every participant five, 14 and 21 days after the event to check on potential symptoms.The event had been met with protests, and police have made several arrests.Besides the formal nomination roll call, the party is also spending time in Charlotte approving a handful of new resolutions, including one that backs Columbus Day as a federal holiday and one that labels the Southern Poverty Law Center, which catalogs the country’s hate groups, as a “radical organization.” Another bemoans “cancel culture,” warning that it “has grown into erasing of history, encouraging lawlessness, muting citizens and violating free exchange of ideas, thoughts, and speech.”But they will not vote on a new 2020 platform, after a unanimous vote to forgo one this year.“RESOLVED, That the Republican Party has and will continue to enthusiastically support the President’s America-first agenda,” a resolution instead reads, in part.After the Charlotte kickoff, most of the GOP convention will take place in Washington, D.C., at and around the White House, as well as by video. It will feature remarks from well-known Trump supporters, including members of the Trump family, outspoken conservatives and everyday Americans who campaign officials say have been helped by Trump’s policies.First lady Melania Trump will speak Tuesday from the Rose Garden, Pence will appear from Fort McHenry in Baltimore on Wednesday and Trump will deliver his marquee acceptance speech on Thursday from the South Lawn before a crowd of supporters — blurring the lines between governing and campaigning yet again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-nominate-donald-trump-to-take-on-biden-in-the-fall/story-nLCAHEwfGkD2ksAU6Kik7K.html

Berlin’s Charite hospital said a team of doctors there had examined him in detail after his arrival.“The clinical findings indicate poisoning by a substance from the group of active substances called cholinesterase inhibitors,” the hospital said in a statement. The specific substance was not yet known, they said. The outcome remains uncertain but long-term effects, especially to the nervous system, could not be ruled out, it said.Cholinesterase inhibitors are drugs that can increase communication between nerve cells in the brain. They are sometimes used to temporarily improve or stabilise the symptoms of people with dementia.Common side effects of cholinesterase inhibitors include vomiting, muscle cramps, headache and hallucinations.Certain chemical classes of pesticides work against bugs by interfering with, or ‘inhibiting’ cholinesterase but they can also be poisonous, or toxic, to humans in some situations.Navalny collapsed on a plane on Thursday last week after drinking tea while on his way to campaign in Siberia.Doctors at the Siberian hospital that first treated Navalny said earlier on Monday they had saved his life but they had not found traces of poison in his system. They had not come under pressure from authorities while treating Navalny, they said. Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin’s side for more than a decade, exposing what he says is high-level graft and mobilising crowds of young protesters.He has been repeatedly detained for organising public meetings and rallies and sued over his investigations into corruption. He was barred from running in a presidential election in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tests-indicate-putin-critic-alexei-navalny-was-poisoned-german-doctors-says/story-Vugi6ON9WzG7zoHbjqjKXK.html

Explaining North Korea’s succession plan||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s disappearance from public life in recent months led to speculation about his health. And the fear for the worst gained credence after reports surfaced that he has handed over some power to his sister Kim Yo Jong.Kim underwent a surgery earlier this year after which his health has been declining. And unlike other democratic countries, the Hermit Kingdom doesn’t have a succession plan in place. It is being ruled by Kim’s family since 1948; the 36-year-old became the supreme leader in 2011.So what happens if Kim dies?Kim’s grandfather Kim Il Sung started the Mount Paektu bloodline in the country in 1948. After his ascension to power, a cult of personality developed around him which was later passed on to his successors: Son Kim Jong Il and grandson Kim Jong Un in 2011.In a democratic country (example India), there are set protocols and designations which have been empowered by the Constitution of the country to run the affairs in case an elected leader is left incapacitated or can’t perform his/her duties due to some other reason. But in North Korea, the leader has to be from Kim’s bloodline.What about his sons?Reports in variuous outlet say that Kim has three sons - and the eldest one was born in 2010. Hence, the reponsibilities to run the affairs of the country rests on the shoulders of his sister Kim Yo Jong. She is the only person that the North Korean leader trusts.Kim has made his sister the “de facto second-in-command”, according to neighbouring South Korea’s intelligence agency. The sleuths of the agency said that Kim has delegated responsibility for relations with Seoul and Washington to his sister.Kim Yo Jong won fame ahead of her brother’s 2019 summit with US President Donald Trump in Vietnam, when her efforts to ensure everything went well included holding an ashtray for the North Korean leader at a train station on his journey.The Kim dynastyKim’s grandfather is a revered figure in the country. Many North Korean consider Kim Il Sung as the father of the country. He established the bloodline after end of the Japanese rule in North Korea in 1945.One of the first things that travellers to North Korea notice is a huge portrait of Kim Il Sung, pictured in front of an airplane and workers alongside the road as they drive out of Pyongyang International Airport. It’s an image that soon becomes very familiar.Millions of portraits, mosaics and paintings of Kim Il Sung, founder of North Korea, and his son Kim Jong Il, the father of current leader Kim Jong Un, offer daily reminders to the public of the central role of the Kim dynasty in their nation’s story.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-happens-is-kim-jong-un-is-dead-explaining-north-korea-s-succession-plan/story-zmgJdgLbfn9n5OcNLbDnWN.html
24-08-2020||World||Amid concerns over Kim Jong Un’s health, expert claims North Korean leader is dead||The updates about the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are being keenly tracked across the world. The 36-year-old, who took over the reins in 2011 has skipped several public appearances in the last few months, giving rise to speculation that something is not right.A journalist, who has extensively travelled in the Hermit Kingdom, has claims that Kim is dead. Roy Calley told some media outlets that there are such levels of secrecy in North Korea that even those living in the country do not know what the reality is.The journalist said that the major changes being introduced by Kim - like making his sister the de facto second-in-command - point towards something major happening in the country.ALSO WATCH | Kim Jong-un reportedly in coma, sister Kim Yo-jong may take over: Key details Calley’s comments came amid reports emerging from South Korea that Kim is in coma. “I assess him (Kim Jong Un) to be in a coma, but his life has not ended,” several media outlets quoted a former aide of South Korea’s late president Kim Dae-jung as saying.Jang also posted on social media, according to local media outlets, that no North Korean leader would entrust any of his authority to another person unless he was too sick to rule or was removed through a coup - pointing towards the transition of power to Kim’s younger sister Kim Yo Jong.He, however, insisted that the North Korean is still in coma and that Kim Yo Jong is not his successor, according to reports from South Korea.The last official reports from North Korea stated that Kim Jong Un has issued a dire warning for the country’s economy amid reports that he delegated some power to his sister, including responsibility for relations with the US.The state media in North Korea reported last week that Kim told a gathering of ruling party leaders that the country “faced unexpected and inevitable challenges in various aspects” and that his development goals had been “seriously delayed”.The unusually candid assessment came as sanctions, flooding and the coronavirus pandemic pushed the North Korean economy toward what was expected to be its worst contraction in more than two decades.Hours later, South Korean lawmakers told reporters that the country’s spy agency determined that Kim had delegated responsibility for relations with Seoul and Washington to his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong. While she had taken an increasingly public role in diplomatic matters, such as responding to a letter from US President Donald Trump earlier this year, one lawmaker described a more formal power-sharing arrangement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-concerns-over-kim-jong-un-s-health-expert-claims-north-korean-leader-is-dead/story-BVaIjc1hk7Y3AicVaCm0iP.html
24-08-2020||World||Tropical storm Marco approaches Louisiana for expected landfall||After a day as a hurricane, Tropical Storm Marco approached Louisiana for an expected landfall around midday Monday, while Tropical Storm Laura was forecast to move along Cuba’s southern coast during the day before entering the Gulf of Mexico and heading toward the same stretch of US coast later in the week, most likely as a hurricane.The Gulf Coast braced for a history-making onslaught from the twin storms, with many evacuees recalling the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when catastrophic flooding breached the levees in New Orleans and as many as 1,800 people died.“What we know is there’s going to be storm surge from Marco, we know that that water is not going to recede hardly at all before Laura hits, and so we’ve not seen this before and that’s why people need to be paying particular attention,” Gov. John Bel Edwards warned at a Sunday briefing.Laura caused the deaths of at least 11 people in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, while knocking out power and causing flooding in the two nations that share the island of Hispaniola.Marco had grown into a hurricane early Sunday, but the National Hurricane Center said its sustained winds decreased to 70 mph (110 kph) after nightfall. The center cautioned that Marco could still cause life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds along the Gulf Coast.Marco was centered about 115 miles (190 kilometers) south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River land heading northwest at 10 mph (17 kph) Monday morning.Laura was centered about 175 miles (285 kilometers) east-southeast of Cayo Largo on Monday morning, and had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 kph). It was moving west-northwest at 21 mph (33 kph) and was predicted to strengthen into a hurricane by Tuesday morning as it followed a path likely to take it to the Louisiana coast by Wednesday night, forecasters said.In the wake of Laura’s passage through the Caribbean, authorities on Sunday reported at least 11 deaths.Haitian civil protection officials said they had received reports a 10-year-old girl was killed when a tree fell on a home in the southern coastal town of Anse-a-Pitres, on the border with the Dominican Republic. Haiti’s prime minister said at least eight other people died and two were missing. In the Dominican Republic, relatives told reporters a collapsed wall killed a mother and her young son.Hundreds of thousands were without power in the Dominican Republic amid heavy flooding in both countries.Despite Marco’s weakening, a storm surge warning remained in place from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Ocean Springs, Mississippi. A tropical storm warning included Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana, and metropolitan New Orleans.A storm surge of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) was forecast for parts of coastal Louisiana and Mississippi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-marco-approaches-louisiana-for-expected-landfall/story-ISdsqutS3RvT8BvoFUvL1K.html
24-08-2020||World||Donald Trump’s diplomatic legacy: lost trust, scarred ties and sanctions||President Donald Trump made some of his flashiest 2016 campaign pledges in foreign policy areas, such as vowing to reevaluate the US relationship with NATO, abandon a landmark nuclear deal with Iran and bring US troops back from “forever wars.”The Republican president, a former businessman from New York who boasts about his deal-making skills, has delivered on some of his pledges, while partially meeting a few others. Some he has so far completely failed to achieve.If Trump is defeated in the November 3 election by Democratic rival Joe Biden, the new administration’s hardest challenge will be to restore the global standing and trustworthiness of the United States, analysts and former US and European officials say.Biden, vice president under President Barack Obama, will be taking over a scarred transatlantic relationship, deep antagonism with China and sanctions-dominated pressure campaigns against Iran, Syria and Venezuela.Here is a look at some of the key policy priorities of the Trump administration and potential challenges for Biden:CHINAA central theme in Trump’s 2016 campaign was to accuse China of “ripping off” the United States while vowing to seal a fair trade deal with Beijing that would help American businesses and create US jobs.After almost two years of tit-for-tat trade war with the world’s second largest economy, Trump has so far managed a stalled first phase of such an agreement. Meanwhile, Washington and Beijing have slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of each others’ goods and the global spread of the coronavirus from China has soured bilateral ties to their worst level in decades, raising fears of a new Cold War.Washington has acted against Beijing on multiple fronts: It ended the special status of Hong Kong, sanctioned top officials over human rights abuses and sought to ban Chinese technology companies from operating in the United States.A Biden administration would have little option but to maintain the hard stance, analysts say, but would likely seek to dial down some rhetoric to create room for engagement.IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL In 2018, the Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, saying he could strike a better one. He also launched a “maximum pressure” campaign to choke off Tehran’s sources of income.Despite almost two years of sanctions on everything from oil revenue to minerals and Iran’s central bank, Washington has yet to force a change of behavior by Tehran and bring it back to the negotiating table. Instead, escalating tensions have carried the two nations to the brink of war. Biden has said he would deal with Iran through diplomacy and re-enter the agreement, but only if Iran first returned to compliance with the deal’s restrictions on its nuclear program. NATO & TRANSATLANTIC TIES Trump has repeatedly complained about the failure of many NATO partners to meet defense spending targets. He has also questioned the continued relevance of the organization created in 1949 at the start of the Cold War with Russia.His attacks soured ties with several European allies, but more members of the alliance have now increased spending to meet its target of two percent of GDP.This year, Trump vowed to cut the number of US troops in Germany, accusing Berlin of taking advantage of the United States while not meeting its NATO obligations.Analysts say repairing the transatlantic alliance will take time, but should be one of the easier tasks awaiting a potential Biden administration.BRINGING TROOPS HOMETrump promised in his 2016 campaign to stay out of foreign wars and bring home US troops deployed in Afghanistan, America’s longest war, which is now in its nineteenth year.Washington has begun cutting troop numbers in Afghanistan after striking a deal with the Taliban in February that envisaged the withdrawal of all US troops. This depends, however, on talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government, which have stalled.Trump also ordered a pullout of US troops from Syria. The decision was repeatedly watered down by aides and the military, but numbers have still been reduced by more than half.PARIS CLIMATE DEAL One of Trump’s most controversial decisions was his withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, something he had repeatedly vowed to do during the 2016 campaign.Trump said the agreement imposed “draconian” financial and economic burdens on the United States and vowed to negotiate a better one. A new agreement has not materialized. The Biden campaign said he would recommit to the original Paris deal and lead an effort to get major countries to toughen their domestic targets.MIDDLE EAST Trump delivered on his 2016 campaign promise to relocate the US Embassy in Israel to divided Jerusalem. The move was slammed by most of the Arab world but won praise from the Israeli government and its supporters, as well as evangelical Christians.His wider Middle East Peace plan was rejected by Palestinians as it allowed Israel to maintain control of long-contested West Bank settlements, but received some encouraging reviews from several Arab states.One, the United Arab Emirates, this month normalized ties with Israel in a historic deal brokered by the United States, a move that many analysts saw as a foreign policy win for Trump at a time when he has been trailing Biden in polls.NORTH KOREATrump surprised the world by entering unprecedented talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He made no progress in persuading Kim to give up his nuclear weapons, but some believe his ice-breaking diplomacy could be a building block for a future administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-diplomatic-legacy-lost-trust-scarred-ties-and-sanctions/story-6hGRrTAtkCWGZaPgTFC9DI.html
24-08-2020||World||White House adviser Kellyanne Conway to leave at end of August||White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said late on Sunday that she will be leaving the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump at the end of August, citing the need to focus on her family. “I will be transitioning from the White House at the end of this month”, she said in a statement.Her departure, about two months before Trump seeks re-election, comes at a crucial time for the president. It leaves him without one of his more passionate spokespersons about his political and policy choices. Conway was his third campaign manager in 2016 and has been one of Trump’s most loyal and outspoken defenders in public and on cable news. She was also the first woman to successfully manage a presidential campaign to victory.More recently, the adviser was instrumental in getting Trump to restart regular, though shorter, White House briefings about the coronavirus outbreak, a practice that officials have viewed as successful in helping to stop a drop in opinion polls the president has suffered largely because of his handling of the pandemic. In a separate statement on Twitter, Kellyanne Conway’s husband, George, said he was stepping back from his role in the Lincoln Project, a project with the stated mission to “defeat Trump and Trumpism at the ballot box”.The decisions by the Conways come a day after their 15-year-old daughter, Claudia, said on Twitter that she was seeking “emancipation”. Claudia has previously been outspoken on social media against her parents’ views. George Conway, a conservative lawyer who had co-founded the Lincoln Project, has been a vocal critic of the president.In a public feud with Kellyanne Conway’s spouse last year, Trump called him a “wack job” and a “husband from hell”, prompting George Conway to say Trump was mentally unfit for his office.On Sunday, Kellyanne Conway described her time in the administration, and previously with the 2016 campaign, as “heady” and “humbling”.She had survived several rounds of staff turnovers in an often chaotic and drama-ridden White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-adviser-kellyanne-conway-to-leave-at-end-of-august/story-zTXMCnvtlk3npAvdxBPUiM.html

The two were expected to also discuss Iran and China.The agreement delivered a key foreign policy victory to President Donald Trump as he seeks re-election and reflected a changing Middle East in which shared concerns about archenemy Iran have largely overtaken traditional Arab support for the Palestinians.Also read: Mike Pompeo heads to Middle East as part of Donald Trump’s Arab-Israeli pushEarlier this month, the US, Israel and the UAE announced the deal to establish full diplomatic relations, which also requires Israel to freeze its plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank sought by the Palestinians as part of their future state.Later in the trip, Pompeo was to meet with Netanyahu’s partner in the government and Defense Minister Benny Gantz, as well as Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi.After his Israel stop Pompeo was also slated to visit Sudan, the UAE and Bahrain, with additional stops in the Gulf possible, the State Department had said. In Sudan, the secretary of state said he would push for “deepening the Sudan-Israel relationship.”Ahead of Pompeo’s arrival, the Israeli military said it struck militant targets in the Gaza Strip early on Monday, in response to incendiary balloons launched into Israel the day before. It was the latest exchange as tensions between the two sides intensified in recent weeks.The army said it bombed “military posts and an underground infrastructure” belonging to Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that rules Gaza. There were no immediate reports of casualties.Militants affiliated with Hamas have launched scores of incendiary balloons into southern Israel in recent weeks, causing extensive damage to farmland, in a bid to pressure Israel to ease the blockade imposed since Hamas took control of the territory in 2007. On Friday, Palestinian militants launched 12 rockets at Israel, nine of which were intercepted, in the largest outbreak of violence in recent months.Israel has responded the balloons and sporadic rocket fire with airstrikes on militant positions.Israel and Hamas have fought three wars and numerous smaller skirmishes in the past 13 years. Last week Egyptian mediators tried to ease tensions and bolster the informal truce between Israel and Hamas that has largely held since the 2014 war in Gaza.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-arrives-in-israel-to-press-trump-s-middle-east-peace-push/story-8SkaWtiujS5l0hZnheHNbL.html

24-08-2020||World||China sells most advanced warship to Pakistan; 3 more to sail by 2021||China on Sunday launched an advanced warship for Pakistan, the largest it has built for any country, and the first among the four most sophisticated naval platforms it is readying for the Pakistan navy amid deepening military and strategic ties with Islamabad.Also read: India rejects J&K reference in joint Pak-China statementLocal media said the Type 054A/P, a guided missile frigate, is the largest combat ship China has sold to a foreign navy and is “an important milestone” for China’s military export sector. The acquisition of the warship will double the combat power of the Pakistani Navy’s surface fleet, Chinese state media reported. By 2021, the Pakistan navy is expected to have three more similar warships in its fleet.The Chinese state-owned Hudong Zhonghua Shipyard in Shanghai held the launch ceremony for the advanced warship with top officials and naval officers attending the function.The shipyard is a wholly owned subsidiary of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, the largest builders in the country.The ship launch took place two days after Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi discussed the situation in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi during the second round of the China-Pakistan foreign ministers’ dialogue in Hainan, off the south China coast.President Xi Jinping called Pakistan a “good brother” and a “good partner” in a recorded message to his counterpart President Arif Alvi after the meeting.New Delhi is currently locked in tension with both China and Pakistan over disputed boundaries and the abrogation of Article in Jammu & Kashmir.India would be closely monitoring the military cooperation between its two hostile neighbours.“It is worth noting that the 054A/P was purchased by Pakistan as the successor to the F-22P frigate, and the F-22P frigate is an export model developed by China on the basis of the 053H3 frigate. China has been working hard to promote the Type 054A frigate to the international market,” local news website ifeng.com reported.Type 054A is the best frigate in service with the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), experts say. The warship has a fully loaded displacement of about 4,000 metric tons and is equipped with advanced radars and missiles.“The Type 054A is a multi-role frigate and is recognized as the backbone of the PLAN fleet of surface combatants with 30 vessels in commission. They have a length of 134 meters, a beam of 16 meters for a displacement of 4,000 tons,” the navalnews.com, a website tracking naval technology, said in a report on the launch.“They have a crew complement of 165 sailors and are fitted with a PJ26 76mm main gun, 8 C803 anti-ship missiles, 32x VLS cells for HQ-16 surface to air missiles, 2x Type 730 30mm CIWS, 2x Triple Torpedo launchers,’’ the website added.Cao Weidong, a senior researcher at the PLA’s Naval Military Studies Research Institute, told the newspaper that it seems that all weapons and radars on the new ship will be made in China which “…reflects our progress in the industry and the Pakistani Navy’s confidence in our technology and capability”.China and Pakistan’s military ties have rapidly deepened in recent years.The new version of the fighter aircraft jointly developed by China and Pakistan with upgraded fighting capabilities, for example, made its maiden flight in December and the first batch is set to be inducted by Islamabad in 2020.The JF-17 Block 3 aircraft was flown above Chengdu in southwest China’s Sichuan province in December, the Aerospace Knowledge magazine said in a report in January.The single-engine, multi-role combat aircraft has been developed jointly by the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) and the Chengdu Aircraft Corporation of China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sells-most-advanced-warship-to-pakistan-3-more-to-sail-by-2021/story-7BIUtEAMdFLHsIznsVdXPO.html
24-08-2020||World||Donald Trump hails FDA’s authorization of plasma treatment for Covid-19||President Donald Trump on Sunday hailed FDA authorization of a coronavirus treatment that uses blood plasma from recovered patients, a day after accusing the agency of impeding the rollout of vaccines and therapeutics for political reasons.The US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) announcement of its “emergency use authorization” of the treatment came on the eve of the Republican National Convention, where Trump will be nominated to lead his party for four more years.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here“This is what I’ve been looking to do for a long time,” Trump told an unusually brief White House news conference. “Today I’m pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives.”The FDA, explaining its decision, cited early evidence suggesting blood plasma can decrease mortality and improve the health of patients when administered in the first three days of their hospitalization.The agency also said it determined this was a safe approach in an analysis of 20,000 patients who received the treatment. So far, 70,000 patients have been treated using blood plasma, the FDA said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “It appeared that the product is safe and we’re comfortable with that and we continue to see no concerning safety signals,” Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told reporters in a conference call.A day before the FDA’s announcement, Trump tagged the agency’s Commissioner Stephen Hahn in a Twitter post in which he said, “The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics.” “Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Must focus on speed, and saving lives!”Trump is looking to boost his lagging poll numbers during the Republican convention this week, and progress in treatments or an effective vaccine to gain control of the virus would aid his re-election chances. At least 5,686,377 cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the United States, according to a Reuters tally, and more than 176,000 Americans have died. Michael Steele, who served as chairman of the Republican National Committee from 2009 to 2011, said the Trump administration was putting politics ahead of science.“This is not about good science or even your health, it’s about his re-election,” Steele wrote on Twitter.Plasma is the element of blood that carries water, enzymes and blood cells throughout the body. It also carries the antibodies humans form to fight off disease and boost immunity.Covid-19 patients have been receiving convalescent plasma for several months through clinical trials at medical centres such as New York’s Mount Sinai Hospital and Johns Hopkins. Supplies of plasma are limited because they require that a recovered Covid-19 patient donate blood and that it matches the blood type of the recipient. Reuters reported that Covid-19 plasma supplies are dwindling, with the American Red Cross saying its stockpile of plasma for Covid-19 patients declined 70% in July. US regulators provided emergency authorization for Gilead Science Inc’s remdesivir as a therapeutic treatment for Covid-19 earlier this year. Reuters reported that a senior administration official said therapeutic drugs that are being studied specifically for Covid-19 could be authorized for use and making doses by fall.The White House declined to comment on a separate report in the Financial Times that the administration is considering fast-tracking an experimental Covid-19 vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca Plc and Oxford University for use in the United States ahead of the Nov. 3 elections.One option being explored would involve the FDA awarding emergency use authorization in October to the potential vaccine, which was developed by Oxford and licensed to AstraZeneca, the FT reported https://www.ft.com/content/b053f55b-2a8b-436c-8154-0e93dcdb3c1a, citing people briefed on the plan.A spokeswoman for AstraZeneca denied the company had discussed an emergency use authorization for its potential vaccine with the US government and said it would be premature to speculate on that possibility. The company said the late-stage Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials for its vaccine candidate are still ongoing in Britain and other markets globally and that it did not anticipate efficacy results until later this year.There are no approved vaccines for Covid-19, but AstraZeneca’s shot, called AZD1222, is widely seen as one of the leading candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-hails-fda-s-authorization-of-plasma-treatment-for-covid-19/story-7AvRWRG3pDNHG6iZbbnEQL.html
24-08-2020||World||Federal judge issues stay in Trump challenge of mail balloting in Pennsylvania||A federal judge on Sunday ordered a stay in President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign’s lawsuit seeking to ban drop boxes and other changes to Pennsylvania’s mail-balloting procedures.The Nov. 3 election promises to be the nation’s largest test of voting by mail and the two major parties are locked in numerous lawsuits that will shape how millions of Americans vote this autumn.The Republican president has repeatedly and without evidence said that an increase in mail-in ballots would lead to a surge in fraud, although Americans have long voted by mail. There is perhaps no more consequential lawsuit than the one in Pennsylvania, which Trump won by less than 1 percentage point in 2016 and is considered essential to his re-election effort.J. Nicholas Ranjan, U.S district judge for western Pennsylvania, said the federal case brought by the Trump campaign would not move forward until similar lawsuits in state courts are completed or unless they are delayed.Justin Clark, Trump’s deputy campaign manager, said the judge’s decision recognized that the issue touched on both state and constitutional issues.“The federal court is simply going to reserve its judgment on this in the hopes that the state court will resolve these serious issues and guarantee that every Pennsylvanian has their vote counted—once,” Clark said. The Trump campaign is seeking to ban ballot drop boxes, which were deployed in the state’s most recent primary and that allow voters to submit absentee ballots and bypass the US Postal Service.The campaign argues the drop boxes were not explicitly authorized in a bipartisan bill passed by the state legislature last year that expanded the state’s mail-balloting procedures.The suit also wants the residency requirement for poll watchers lifted, so that any Pennsylvania voter could serve in that function at any polling location in the state.The judge, a Trump appointee, said the suit involved state laws and he would defer for now to the state courts. “The Court will apply the brakes to this lawsuit, and allow the Pennsylvania state courts to weigh in and interpret the state statutes that undergird Plaintiffs’ federal-constitutional claims,” Ranjan said.The Trump campaign says the ballot drop box invites fraud. The federal judge asked the campaign to provide evidence of actual fraud, but the campaign declined, arguing it did not have to do so in order to win the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/federal-judge-issues-stay-in-trump-challenge-of-mail-balloting-in-pennsylvania/story-i3ZqpQkHF9smNlN7US0GUK.html

The former aide is under arrest in an investigation into bank deposits made at the time amounting to 1.2 million reais ($213,500).Questions about Queiroz have continued to hound the Bolsonaro family in an investigation that has appeared to annoy the president and dent his promise not to tolerate corruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-s-bolsonaro-says-he-wants-to-punch-reporter-in-face/story-coTmTwGocjx3KEBsU8FNrN.html
24-08-2020||World||Nepal: Panel suggests full term for PM Oli, complete executive power for Prachanda||A six-member panel formed by the ruling Nepal Communist Party to resolve the bitter intra-party rift has suggested that Prime Minister K P Oli should complete his five-year tenure, while executive chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ be allowed to exercise full executive power over party affairs, a senior party leader said on Sunday. The task force, formed by Oli and Prachanda on August 15 and later endorsed by NCP’s powerful Central Secretariat on August 17, was led by the party’s General Secretary Bishnu Poudyal. The panel, which submitted its report to Oli and Prachanda on Saturday, includes Standing Committee members Shankar Pokhrel, Janardan Sharma, Bhim Rawal, Surendra Pandey and Pampha Bhusal. Although the details of the report has not been made public, it is expected to pacify the intra-party rift which deepened further after Prachanda and senior leader Madhav Kumar Nepal demanded Prime Minister Oli’s resignation. According to senior NCP leader and Standing Committee member Ganesh Shah, the panel in its report has suggested that Prime Minister Oli should remain in power for a full five-year term, whereas Prachanda should have full executive power over the party’s affairs. When Oli became prime minister two-and-a-half years ago in 2018, he and Prachanda had reached a tacit understanding to share the prime minister’s position turn-by-turn. The panel has suggested the top leaders of the party to adhere to one-man-one-post principle and to promote coordination and collaboration between the two top leaders, Shah said. However, the report needs to be ratified in the Standing Committee meeting, which is likely to be convened this week, he said. There is no other way to maintain unity in the party at this moment, said Shanker Pokharel, one of the panel members. However, it is to be seen how the suggestions of the panel will be implemented, Shah said. According to party insiders, Prime Minister Oli is likely to reshuffle his Cabinet as soon as the Standing Committee meeting of the party endorses the panel’s report to strike a power balance with Prachanda. Oli and Prachanda have held about a dozen meetings to sort out the differences between them. But, as the Prime Minister did not accept the condition of a one-man-one-post, the talks failed. Oli has refused to give up his post as prime minister as well as a co-chairman of the NCP. A bitter internal feud has been brewing in the ruling NCP after top party leaders, including Prachanda, demanded Oli’s resignation, saying his recent anti-India remarks were “neither politically correct nor diplomatically appropriate.” They are also against Oli’s autocratic style of functioning. The differences grew further after Oli said that some of the ruling party leaders are aligning with the southern neighbour to remove him from power after his government issued a new political map incorporating three Indian territories of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura. The two leaders are also engaged in tightening their grip within the party with the escalation of the intra-party feud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-panel-suggests-full-term-for-pm-oli-complete-executive-power-for-prachanda/story-MWozXio6D82tSjyCPf5rLN.html

The National Intelligence Agency, however, said that the new system is not associated with any serious health issue.Chang’s claims come months after the North Korean dictator had not made a public appearance amid speculations of his deteriorating health. He was last seen presiding over a Workers’ Party politburo meeting on April 11 before a top security adviser to the South’s President Moon Jae-in downplayed rumours and said Kim Jong Un was “alive and well”.He was then seen cutting the ribbon at the opening of a fertilizer factory on May 2, KCNA reported.However, Chang has claimed that all photographs of Kim released by North Korea in recent months were fake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-in-coma-sister-kim-yo-jong-to-take-over-reports/story-9HaznCncdJ9iK9yoiI1FqM.html
24-08-2020||World||Northern California firefighters dig in ahead of high winds||Three massive wildfires chewed through parched Northern California landscape Sunday as firefighters raced to dig breaks and make other preparations ahead of a frightening weather system. That system was packing high winds and more of the lightning that sparked the huge blazes and scores of other fires around the state, putting nearly a quarter-million people under evacuation orders and warnings. At the CZU Lightning Complex fire in the Santa Cruz Mountains, south of San Francisco, authorities said their effort was hindered by people who refused to heed evacuation orders and those who were using the chaos to steal. Santa Cruz County Sheriff Jim Hart said 100 officers were patrolling and anyone not authorized to be in an evacuation zone would be arrested.Also read: In just a week, wildfires burn 1 million acres in California “What we’re hearing from the community is that there’s a lot of looting going on,” Hart said. He said eight people have been arrested or cited and “there’s going to be more.” He and county District Attorney Jeff Rosell expressed anger at what Rosell called the “absolutely soulless” people who seek to victimize those already victimized by the fire. Among the victims was a fire commander who was robbed while helping coordinate efforts on Saturday. Someone entered the commander’s fire vehicle and stole personal items, including a wallet and “drained his bank account,” said Chief Mark Brunton, a battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). “I can’t imagine a bigger low-life,” Hart said, promising to catch him and vowing “the DA is going to hammer him.” The Santa Cruz fire is one of the “complexes,” or groups of fires, burning on all sides of the San Francisco Bay Area. They were started by lightning strikes that were among 12,000 registered in the state in the past week. The National Weather Service issued a “red flag” warning through Monday afternoon for the drought-stricken area, meaning extreme fire conditions including high temperatures, low humidity and wind gusts up to 65 mph (105 kph) that “may result in dangerous and unpredictable fire behavior.” In nearly a week, firefighters have gotten no more than the 17% containment for the LNU Lightning Complex fire in wine country north of San Francisco. It’s been the most destructive blaze, accounting for five deaths and 845 destroyed homes and other buildings. It and a fire burning southeast of the Bay Area are among the five largest fires in state history, with both burning more than 500 square miles (1,295 square kilometers). In Southern California, an 11-day-old blaze held steady at just under 50 square miles (106 square kilometers) near Lake Hughes in northern Los Angeles County mountains. Rough terrain, hot weather and the potential for thunderstorms with lightning strikes challenged firefighters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/northern-california-firefighters-dig-in-ahead-of-high-winds/story-AwAzvJTMDwETy30CvCPVgP.html
24-08-2020||World||US announces emergency authorization of plasma treatment against Covid-19||American authorities announced on Sunday an emergency authorization for doctors to use blood plasma from recovered coronavirus patients as a treatment against the disease that has killed over 176,000 in the US.The move by the Food and Drug Administration comes as President Donald Trump faces intense pressure to curb the contagion that has hobbled the world’s largest economy and clouded his once-promising prospects for re-election in November.The plasma is believed to contain powerful antibodies that can help fight off the disease faster and help protect people from being seriously hurt by it.“This product may be effective in treating COVID-19 and... the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product,” FDA said in a statement.While the treatment has already been used on patients in the United States and other nations, the extent of its effectiveness is still debated by experts and some have warned that it could carry side effects.“Convalescent plasma probably works -- though it still needs to be proven in clinical trials -- but not as a rescue treatment for people who are already severely ill,” said Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.Trump faces tough campaign He said that plasma would likely work much better right after a person was exposed to the virus, when the body is trying to neutralize the infection -- the problem being that plasma supplies are limited, meaning it would be difficult to get enough to treat everyone in early stages of the disease.Trump told reporters the therapy shows “an incredible rate of success” and “will save countless lives”, but this went much further than his own health officials’ cautious welcome of the treatment.Challenged by a reporter to explain the apparent contradiction, Trump passed the question to one of his experts, then ended the press conference.The FDA already allowed convalescent plasma transfusions for coronavirus patients under certain conditions, such as clinical trials and gravely ill people.The Washington Post said that over 70,000 virus patients in the US have received such a transfusion.Trump has been widely criticized for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic in the US, which remains the world leader in infections and fatalities.He faces a tough re-election battle against Democratic challenger Joe Biden, with no effective treatment or vaccine expected before the vote on November 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-emergency-authorization-of-plasma-treatment-against-covid-19/story-JjPcJyuGd8WGQjDUZYL6GM.html
24-08-2020||World||Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu accepts compromise, avoids election||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Sunday that he had agreed to extend contentious budget talks with his main rival, preventing a collapse of his government that would have triggered a fourth national election in under two years.While the decision defused the immediate budget crisis, it did not address the deeper issues that have plagued the power-sharing arrangement between Netanyahu and his bitter rival, Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz. Since forming a coalition government in May, the two men have repeatedly feuded, and Netanyahu, facing the distraction of a potentially career ending corruption trial, has repeatedly hinted that he would prefer a new government that might be more lenient toward his legal woes.In a nationally televised address, Netanyahu said now was not the time to force the country into an unwanted election. He cited the new opportunities created by his recent historic agreement to establish diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates, combined with the economic and public-health challenges caused by the coronavirus crisis.“Now is the time for unity. Not for elections,” he said.Under their coalition deal, Netanyahu and Gantz had faced a midnight deadline Monday night to agree on a budget. Otherwise, the government would have collapsed and automatically triggered a new vote.Sunday’s budget compromise merely gives the sides an additional 100 days to reach a deal, setting the stage for a similar showdown in December. In the meantime, Netanyahu said it also would allow the government to direct spending to struggling areas of the economy and allow schools to reopen on time next week.“This proposal allows money to begin flowing immediately to the citizens and the economy and it prevents the need for elections,” he said.There was no immediate comment from Gantz or Blue and White.Netanyahu, citing the country’s economic crisis stemming from the coronavirus outbreak, has called for a short-term budget of several months. Gantz says the sides must stick to their original agreement of a two-year budget, especially with most of 2020 already behind them.Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said Sunday’s compromise extended a period of uncertainty that has harmed large parts of society.“Another 100 days without a budget?” he said in a statement. “This government is detached from reality, enough!”Netanyahu and Gantz, a former commander of the Israeli military, battled to three stalemates in a series of elections in under a year. With neither man controlling a parliamentary majority and the country facing a burgeoning coronavirus crisis last spring, they agreed to form their partnership.Their parties — Likud and Blue and White — split control of key government ministries and parliamentary committees. In addition to serving as defense minister, Gantz took on the new role of “alternate prime minister,” and the men agreed to rotate the premiership in November 2021, at the halfway point of their partnership.But since taking office, the rivals have clashed over almost every key issue, including the budget, Netanyahu’s pledge to unilaterally annex occupied West Bank territory and this month’s historic agreement to establish official ties with the UAE. Gantz was locked out of the UAE deal, which froze the annexation, and only learned about it after it was completed.But critics, including Gantz, say that Netanyahu’s legal troubles are driving his decision-making process. Netanyahu has been charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals in which he is accused of exchanging favors with powerful media figures.In January, his trial is scheduled to move into the witness stage — when a series of former allies are scheduled to testify against him in sessions set to take place three times a week. The testimonies will likely be an embarrassing and time-consuming distraction.A new election could potentially give Netanyahu a parliamentary majority with allies who would allow him to make key appointments, including a new justice minister, national police chief and attorney general, that could influence his legal process and delay or cancel the trial.“The only thing standing between us and another round of elections has nothing to do with the unprecedented economic crisis, but rather with Prime Minister Netanyahu’s demand for an immediate change to the system for appointing senior public officials,” said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank.“At the heart of the changes Netanyahu is pushing for is his demand to grant himself or those in his inner circle with greater influence, if not total control, over these appointments,” he said, calling Netanyahu’s demands a “conflict of interests.” Plesner made the remarks shortly before Netanyahu’s appearance.Yet forcing new elections would also carry great risks. The country would be plunged into chaos during a deep economic and public health crisis. Lockdown measures imposed last spring led to a spike in unemployment, and then easing the lockdown too quickly led to a renewed outbreak in the coronavirus that the government has not yet been able to control.The economic troubles have led to a drop in support for Netanyahu’s Likud party and drawn thousands of people to join anti-Netanyahu protests outside his official residence, calling on him to resign. Recent opinion polls have indicated the country remains deeply divided, with Likud and its allies holding an edge, but not assured of an outright victory with his right-wing allies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-s-benjamin-netanyahu-accepts-compromise-avoids-election/story-zFIifIZB9TPScAUyioVlGN.html
24-08-2020||World||Iran: UN nuclear chief’s visit to Tehran no link to US push||Iran said Sunday that an upcoming visit this week by the head of the U.N.’s atomic watchdog agency to Tehran has nothing to do with a U.S. push to impose so-called “snapback” sanctions on Iran — even as Tehran acknowledged a recent explosion at a major uranium enrichment site was “sabotage.”The Trump administration last week dismissed near-universal opposition to its demand to restore all U.N. sanctions on Iran, declaring that a 30-day countdown for the “snapback” of penalties eased under the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers had begun.Both U.S. allies and foes have joined forces to declare the action illegal and doomed to failure. The U.S. argues that Iran has violated the restrictions imposed on its nuclear program under the 2015 deal, a charge Tehran has dismissed.Iran’s official IRNA news agency quoted on Sunday Iran’s envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA, Kazem Gharibadadi, as saying that the visit this week is “neither related to the snapback mechanism nor the U.S. demand.”Gharibabadi said the visit by the IAEA chief Rafael Grossi comes within “the framework of Iran’s invitation.”“We do not allow others to manage Iran,” he said, adding that Iran’s trust in the IAEA has been “damaged in recent months.”He expressed hope Grossi’s visit will lead to building trust. “It is important to assure Tehran that the agency will move based on impartiality, independence and professionalism,” said Gharibabadi.The IAEA said on Saturday that Grossi will head to Tehran to press Iranian authorities for access to sites where the country is thought to have stored or used undeclared nuclear material. Gharibabadi said Grossi was due to meet with Iranian officials on both Tuesday and Wednesday.Later Sunday, Iran’s semiofficial Fars news agency quoted the spokesman of the country’s atomic agency, Behrouz Kamalvandi, as saying that “security investigations confirm sabotage” in the July 2 blast at the Natanz nuclear facility. He said details would be released later at the proper time.Iranian officials had initially downplayed the fire, first raising the possibility of sabotage days later, but have been careful not to directly blame the U.S. or Israel, whose officials heavily hinted they had a hand in the fire.Kamalvandi also said the IAEA was seeking access and inspection at two “places” near the capital Tehran and central Iranian city of Isfahan.The landmark 2015 nuclear deal was endorsed by a U.N. Security Council resolution and includes the snapback provision. President Donald Trump pulled America out of the accord in 2018 and imposed severe U.S. sanctions on Iran.Last week, Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in a letter to the U.N. Security Council said the U.S. has no right to demand the restoration of U.N. sanctions, arguing that the U.S. lost the right to make demands when it withdrew from the accord.The five countries now in dispute with the U.S. administration — Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany — remain supporters of the nuclear deal to rein in Iran’s nuclear program and prevent its development of nuclear weapons. The five nations and Iran will meet in Vienna on Sept. 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-un-nuclear-chief-s-visit-to-tehran-no-link-to-us-push/story-flRO8oYbTUXkNloPUL1TrK.html

Demonstrations against racism and police brutality have swept the United States since the death in May of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Earlier on Saturday there were scuffles in downtown Portland between anti-racism protesters and right-wing demonstrators. Participants clad in body armor and helmets traded punches and blasts of pepper spray as police officers mostly looked on, according to video of the clashes posted on social media. President Donald Trump’s administration in July deployed federal forces to deal with the protests in Portland. On Friday, he denounced the demonstrations as “crazy” and said cities run by Democrats had descended into chaos. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler is a Democrat.Portland police said this week that they have declared a riot at least 18 times since May 29.On Sunday they said the 14 people arrested were booked into jail on charges including rioting, assaulting a public safety officer, disorderly conduct, and resisting arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-arrest-14-after-portland-rocked-by-clashes-between-demonstrators/story-I0iSESSJijQvJaLfdHNTCN.html
24-08-2020||India||Heavy rain lashes Bihar, flood situation remains grim||Heavy showers at a few places in the already flooded North Bihar districts are set to complicate the sufferings of marooned people with rivers originating from Nepal likely to swell further and pose threat to their safety embankments. As monsoon became active again in Bihar, Sursand, a township of Sitamahri that borders Nepal, received 189.50 mm rain by Monday afternoon. Very heavy rain also lashed Madhwapur in Madhubani, while moderate to heavy rain occurred at many places in north-central parts of Bihar during the past 24 hours, said officials at Patna Meteorological Centre on Monday. The embankment of Gandak caved in at many places in Gopalganj and East Champaran on July 24 following heavy discharge from Nepal via Valmikinagar barrage and about 200 mm rain in its catchment areas of the two districts. A Met department official, Shatrughan Kumar Mandal, said, “A monsoon trough crossing Jharkhand and West Bengal is shifting towards the Bay of Bengal. Besides, a low-pressure area formed over the Bay of Bengal is likely to intensify. Under the influence, south districts of Bihar are likely to experience enhanced rain activity for next two days.” According to the water resources department (WRD) release, many rivers including Ganga and Gandak, Burhi Gandak, Bagmati and Kosi continued to flow above the danger level (DL) at various points along their course, thus exerting tremendous pressure on their embankments at different locations. “Our engineers are maintaining round the clock vigil to carry out flood protection work and avert the disaster,” said a senior officer of WRD. The increase in flow of water in Gandak and Sone from Valmikinagar and Indrapuri barrages respectively has posed threat of fresh flooding in areas of Gopalganj, Saran, East Champaran and Bhojpur districts. As the embankments on Gandak could not be repaired and the river flowing above the danger limit at Dumariaghat, the floodwater from the river has engulfed dozens of new villages on Monday. The discharge from Indrapuri barrage in Sone has crossed 1.27 lakh cusec on Monday again. Flood situation in the state remains grim as majority of rivers including Gandak, Burhi Gandak, Bagmati, Khiroi and Ghaghra continue flowing above the danger limit in Gopalganj, Sitamahri, Muzaffapur, Darbhanga, Samastipur, Khagaria and Siwan. The Ganga was flowing about 18cm above the normal level at Gandhi Ghat in Patna, 35cm at Hatidah and 36cm above the danger limit at Kahalgaon. The current spell of floods has so far affected a population of more than 83.62 lakh of 1333 panchayats of 130 blocks of 16 districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-rain-lashes-bihar-flood-situation-remains-grim/story-PUKWFkgtvaOFWuGer00tOP.html

State industry department’s official figures indicate that in the last month alone, projects worth around Rs 4,500 crore were grounded in Telangana, particularly in and around Hyderabad. “We continue to receive investment proposals worth hundreds of crores of rupees, which is a good sign for the state’s economy in the post-Covid-19 scenario,” a senior official in the department familiar with the development said. The Telangana government is holding a two-day virtual conference “Make in Telangana” on August 27 and 28 with the theme “Invest in Telangana: Opportunities in Post Covid-19,” with an objective to explore investment opportunities and new partnerships. The conference will be addressed by CEOs of leading Indian and global companies including IT, pharma, textiles, electric vehicles, food processing, aerospace and defence, retail and infrastructure, the official said. On August 11, Medtronic, an Ireland-based medical equipment giant, announced its plan to scale up and expanding its Medtronic Engineering & Innovation Centre (MEIC) in Hyderabad at a cost of Rs 1200 crore. “It is going to be the largest global R&D centre outside of the United States for Medtronic generating over 1000 jobs,” state industries minister K T Rama Rao said. “It will be a big boost to Telangana and it will cement Hyderabad’s position as the medical devices hub in India,” he said. On August 13, Telangana received yet another major investment proposal from Medha Servo Drives Pvt. Ltd to set up Medha Rail Coach Factory, India’s largest private sector rail coach factory at an investment of Rs 1000 crore with an employment potential of 2,200 (1000 direct and 1200 indirect) in the state. KTR took part in the ground-breaking ceremony of Medha Rail Coach Factory in Kondakal village of Shankarpally, Ranga Reddy district in the presence of his cabinet colleagues T Harish Rao and P Sabitha Indra Reddy. “The facility will have a capacity of manufacturing coaches, locomotives, intercity trainsets, metro trains, monorail, etc. Production capacity is planned for 500 coaches (of various types) and 50 locomotives per year,” the industries minister said. Similarly, on August 17, KTR laid the foundation stone for an advanced polyester film manufacturing facility at Shahabad in Ranga Reddy district, to be set up by Ester Industries Ltd, a leading manufacturer of Polyester Films at an investment of Rs 1,350 crore. It will provide jobs to about 800 people. The minister also laid the foundation for two other projects in the last one month: Rs 500 crore smart data centre of the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an umbrella organisation for operating retail payments and settlement systems in India at Nanakramguda and a new Research and Technology Centre of Sai Lifesciences Limited, a growing contract research organisation, at an investment of Rs 400 crore at Genome Valley. The industries minister said post-Covid-19, there is immense opportunity for the state to attract investments from other parts of the world, and the infrastructure development and construction sector would play a major role in it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-crisis-telangana-continues-to-attract-investments-in-key-sectors/story-gE6vxODcFNkDegTuuQYSuI.html
24-08-2020||India||Did he say it or did he not?: Rahul’s remarks on letter writers create flutter||Did Rahul Gandhi say it or did he not? This was the question on everyone’s mind after his purported remarks on a letter written by over 20 party leaders seeking urgent organisational reforms created a flutter. High drama played out at the nearly seven-hour Congress Working Committee meeting with sources saying that Rahul Gandhi lashed out at the letter writers and some leaders found it to be insinuating that it was written in cahoots with the BJP. However, the Congress promptly denied this and said “not a word of this nature” was said by the former party chief. Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal, one of the 23 signatories to the letter addressed to Sonia Gandhi seeking an immediate organisational overhaul and a collective leadership, hit out at Rahul Gandhi in a tweet, saying, “Rahul says ‘we are colluding with BJP’. Succeeded in Rajasthan High Court defending the Congress Party. Defending party in Manipur to bring down BJP government.” “Last 30 years have never made a statement in favour of BJP on any issue. Yet ‘we are colluding with the BJP’!” But Sibal posted another tweet a little later, saying he was withdrawing his earlier tweet after being “informed by Rahul Gandhi personally that he never said what was attributed to him”. Tagging Sibal’s earlier tweet, Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also said that Rahul Gandhi hasn’t said a word of this nature nor alluded to it. “Please don’t be misled by false media discourse or misinformation being spread. But yes, we all need to work together in fighting the draconian Modi rule rather than fighting & hurting each other and the Congress,” Surjewala tweeted. Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad was also at the centre of the controversy with a section of the media reporting that he offered to resign over Rahul Gandhi’s remarks. Seeking to set the record straight, the leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha said a section of the media was “wrongly attributing that, in CWC I told Shri Rahul Gandhi to prove that the letter written by us is in collusion with BJP”. “Let me make it very clear that Shri Rahul Gandhi has neither in CWC nor outside said that this letter was written at the behest of BJP. What I said was, yesterday some Congress person had said that we did it at behest of BJP & in that context I said ‘It is most unfortunate that some colleagues (outside CWC) have accused us of collusion with BJP, and if those people can prove this allegation, I will resign’“. Congress MP Manickram Tagore also tagged Sibal’s earlier tweet and said, “Kapil Sibal ji We all have great respect for you. @INCIndia made you cabinet minister and gives a lot of importance. you are NOT inside the CWC. You are reacting to a leak that is false. It does not reflect well on a leader as senior as you are, to react to hearsay.” He later posted another tweet to thank Sibal after the former cabinet minister clarified his remarks and withdrew his earlier post. Some BJP leaders also hit out at Rahul Gandhi over his purported remarks that the letter by over 20 Congress leaders seeking changes in the organisation will help the ruling party. They said Gandhi was “obsessed” with the saffron party and that “one’s destruction is near when one stops using his own mind”. “So obsessed is Rahul Gandhi with the BJP that he is beginning to see Congress’ veteran leaders as those working in ‘collusion’ with BJP. Someone rightly said when one’s destruction is near, one stops using his own mind,” BJP general secretary Bhupender Yadav said. BJP’s Tom Vadakkan, who was in the Congress for decades and was considered close to the Gandhi family before he joined the saffron party last year, said the opposition party’s internal politics is being played out as a result of their “misdeeds”. “Mirror has cracked. When a mirror cracks, there is no way to put it together. You have to throw it out,” he said in a swipe at the Congress leadership over the letter. Vadakkan also said the commitment of the leaders, who are signatories to the letter and include veterans like Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Ghulam Nabi Azad, to the Congress is “definitely much more” than Rahul Gandhi. “They are not born in the party. They have lived in the party. They have only suggested a course correction and free and fair elections and a leader who is available to lead the party round the clock,” he said. Vadakkan claimed that the denial by the Congress that Rahul Gandhi made any statement linking the letter’s signatories to the BJP was an “afterthought”. “He (Rahul) believes if you are not with him, then you are with the BJP, not even the Trinamool Congress or any other party,” the BJP leader said.

The Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority has given permission for the trial run of the voyage from Daundkandi (Cumilla) to Sonamura via river Gomti. The river was chosen for having sufficient water for movement of boats and small ships.“Historical moment of Tripura! Trial Run of Ship is to be conducted in first week of September. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority has given permission for trial run of voyage from Daundkandi (Cumilla) to Sonamura via river Gomti,” tweeted the chief minister.During the trial run, 50 MT cement will be transported in a barge from Dhaka to Sonamura. This is the first time any kind of goods will be reaching Tripura by ship, said the CM. He also expressed his gratitude towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi, shipping minister Mansukh Mandavia and Bangladesh government for their cooperation. The Sonamura-Daudkandi route was included in the Indo-Bangladesh Protocol (IBP) routes that was signed by both High Commissioner of India in Bangladesh Riva Ganguly Das and shipping secretary of Bangladesh Mohammad Mezbah Uddin Chowdhury at Dhaka this May. According to a survey conducted by the Bangladesh authorities, 89.5 kilometres out of 90 kms of the Sonamura-Daudkandi protocol route falls in Bangladesh and 500 metres in India. Earlier last month, a floating jetty on Gomati river was launched as part of the Indo-Bangladesh international inland waterways project. According to the plan, small boats having capacity to carry 50 tonne of goods would start moving through this route to Bangladesh with the setting up of a temporary jetty soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trial-run-on-indo-bangladesh-inland-waterway-route-starts-in-september/story-z0FmqXH7WL9oX2KewPNL3M.html

We have to increase our vote share,” he said.Targeting DMK, he alleged that it has been “inciting feelings against the national spirit”.“They have been on a lookout to see to it that the assimilation into national mainstream is always disrupted. They have been anti-development,” he said.“We can say that in Tamil Nadu, DMK has become a sheltering ground for people who are not working in interests of the nation. We have to be alert, active and see to it that we are able to give a befitting reply to such people,” he added.Lauding Prime Minister Narendra Modi he said the Prime Minister led from the front in the fight against Covid-19.“He took a very bold decision to prepare the county to fight the pandemic and make the health system robust. There was no dedicated Covid-19 facility when the lockdown began but now there are more than 1500 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals in the country,” he said.Nadda said the last National Education Policy came in 1986.“It was just a change in figures and no change in policies and spirit. Under PM Modi, we have got an independent education policy, which is Bharat education policy. Under the New Education Policy, rich and poor are both going to get a qualitative and affordable education. Acceptability has also been improved as local languages are set to be used as a mode of education till class VIII,” he said.Nadda also lauded BJP workers their effort in the party’s `Feed the Needy’ programme.He said that teams of state unit should be strong and use should be made of social media to strengthen the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jp-nadda-hits-out-at-dmk-says-bjp-s-footprint-increasing-in-tamil-nadu/story-3WTfVu9MDTnQpNZcJD46YM.html

24-08-2020||India||No confidence motion against Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan-led govt defeated in assembly||The Kerala legislative assembly on Monday defeated the no-confidence motion moved by the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) against the Pinarayi Vijayan government brought in the backdrop of the sensational gold smuggling case. This is the first no-trust motion against the government which has completed four years and four months in office.The motion moved by senior Congress leader V D Satheesan was defeated by 47 votes, while 87 legislators opposed it 40 supported it. The house witnessed turbulent scenes during the day-long discussion and the CM took three and a half hours to reply to the barrage of charges. While the UDF listed a number of allegations including the recent gold smuggling case, the alleged commission in the Life Mission project and the ‘gift’ higher education minister KT Jaleel received from the consulate of the United Arab Emirates, the LDF denied all charges saying the opposition was worried over the growing popularity of the government. The debate turned noisy at regular intervals as members of both camps traded charges against each other. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said never in the history of the state had three central agencies frequented the state secretariat and there are reports more agencies will be roped in to probe the gold smuggling case.A week after the seizure of 30 kg gold from a consignment in the UAE consulate in the state capital, the CM was forced to suspend his powerful private secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer. But the opposition said the CM was trying to get away by sacrificing his secretary and he knew about main accused Swapna Suresh and her alleged deals. Besides smuggling, during investigation, many alleged irregularities also cropped up. The Enforcement Directorate found that Suresh had accepted Rs four crore commission in the Life Mission project. It is a Rs 20 crore project intended to build free apartments for the flood-affected with the help of the UAE-based charity organization Red Crescent. The ED and NIA had also started an investigation against minister KT Jaleel who reportedly accepted some fund and 4000 kg ‘gift’ from the consulate in March. Though the minister pleaded that these consignments were holy books the opposition alleged that some of the packets contained smuggled gold. Even if the minister’s version was right, he can’t get away from the foreign exchange management act, experts said.But the CM said central agencies were deployed after he wrote to the Prime Minister and the government was not worried over the probe. He asked the opposition to wait till the probe was over. He also took a dig at the principal opposition party Congress saying most of its leaders are in a race to join the BJP. He said with mere allegations nobody can browbeat his government which has managed the Covid-19 pandemic successfully and brought in many new programs for the poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-confidence-motion-against-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-led-govt-defeated-in-assembly/story-2dpJQo8wgrnbOnKcRjkQvJ.html

Jindal assured CM Patnaik that the JSW is fully committed to all its projects in the state.The JSW Steel has proposed to build the plant at the same site in Jagatsinghpur that was once allocated to Korean steelmaker Posco for its steel project. In 2017, Posco had to abandon the project, 13 years after it signed an MoU to build a steel plant, due to lack of dedicated iron ore mines and popular resistance at the project site.Jindal said that the JSW is tying up with IIM Sambalpur to create the “JSW Centre for Development Studies for Odisha.” The JSW Steel will also establish a 100-bed hospital and a school at Koida in Sundargarh district in PPP mode with an objective to develop mining areas for the benefits of the local people.During the discussion, Patnaik stressed on maximum value addition of state resources within the state for accelerating job creation and revenue generation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jsw-group-to-invest-rs-1-lakh-crore-in-odisha-over-10-years/story-lFhe65tKs00XHrOgD155sK.html

24-08-2020||India||In Unlock-4, metro services likely to resume; schools to remain shut: Officials||After months of deliberations, the Centre is finally likely to allow resumption of metro services from September 1, when the fourth phase of unlocking economic activities will begin, people familiar with the development said. Bars, which were also closed since lockdown came into effect on March 25, might also be allowed to sell liquor over the counter for takeaway services, the officials said. Schools and colleges, however, will continue to remain closed but the government is considering reopening institutes like IITs and IIMs. According to deliberations in the ministry of home affairs (MHA) and other concerned departments, cinema halls and auditoriums will also continue to remain closed for another month. There is a view in the government that even if cinema halls are allowed right now, it won’t be financially viable for them to run shows with only 25-30% capacity due to physical distancing norms. On metro services, officials said that modifications are still being worked out in consultation with ministry of housing and urban affairs, local governments, metro rail corporations and security agencies. “The new norms being drafted by the MHA on resumption of metro rail are likely to include contact-less ticketing through metro cards, increase in the average stoppage time at each station, markings for queues across all stations to control crowds and maintaining social distancing and an overhaul in the air conditioning system inside the trains to ensure supply of fresh air,” said an official who didn’t wish to be named. This officer said that the metro rail across the country, which has been shut since March 22, is likely to begin in a calibrated manner, similar to how railways and flight services were resumed with limited frequency and capacity. The Unlock-4 guidelines for the same will be issued later this week and once the MHA gives the nod, respective state government can further decide how to run the metro trains and their timings, another officer said. Passengers travelling in metro trains may not be allowed to use tokens anymore as Centre plans to implement a contactless ticketing system using only metro cards once restrictions on public transport are lifted, Hindustan Times had reported on April 30. “We are ready to resume services in a few days’ notice but are awaiting the formal nod from the MHA. Across states’, preparations have been made to ensure marking across all stations. Delhi has the highest volume of metro users. Arrangements have been made at the stations and inside the trains for social distancing. We will need to manage crowds and the frequency of trains depending on the crowd,” a second officer cited above said. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which provides security to the metro, is also ready and has already conducted drills on how passengers will queue up at entry points, platforms, among other things like use of Aarogya Setu app for all, said an officer in the paramilitary force. Officials said Unlock-4 guidelines will only mention the activities which will be prohibited while the rest can resume. The containment zones will continue to be under strict lockdown and monitoring. They added that social, political, sports, entertainment, academic, cultural, religious functions and other large congregations are also likely to remain prohibited next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-unlock-4-metro-services-likely-to-resume-schools-to-remain-shut-officials/story-ODYEBuXxUHc9BtwtFCoNXK.html
24-08-2020||India||Corneal transplants, donations hit hard in Odisha over Covid concerns||Corneal transplants in Odisha have been adversely affected by Covid-19 with several hospitals stopping all such procedures while others reducing such operations over fears of infection.Cornea is the clear, dome-shaped surface covering iris that helps protect the eyes from dust, germs, and foreign particles. A corneal transplant, or keratoplasty, is a surgical procedure that replaces a damaged or diseased cornea with healthy tissue from a donor. After cataract, corneal blindness is the most common form of blindness in the country.Though Odisha sees around 1800-2000 corneal donations a year, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought down the numbers to less than 25 per cent as hospitals either completely stopped corneal retrieval and transplantation or reduced the number of such procedures over fears of infection.“Since there is a risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through conjunctiva of the eye, most hospitals have stopped doing corneal transplants. As it is not possible to do RT-PCR test on a dead body and get the result within six hours of death, the transplantation procedures have been devastatingly affected. As with most solid-organ transplants, the risk of transmitting infectious diseases and viruses is an important aspect of corneal transplantation that can affect recipients or those handling donor tissue,” said Dr Sujata Das, medical director of Drushti Daan Eye Bank in Bhubaneswar which does a bulk of the corneal transplantation in Odisha.“From 100-150 corneal donations at Drusti Daan Eye Bank every month, the numbers are now down to 18-20 a month. As we can’t do RT-PCR test, we are screening out several possible donors to avoid infections. We are mostly taking cornea of those who died in accidents or those who committed suicide. The harvested cornea is also being kept for two days before it is grafted,” said Das.In Cuttack’s SCB Medical College and Hospital and JPM Eye Hospital and Berhampur’s MKCG Medical College and Hospital, the corneal transplants have totally stopped after the pandemic started. Dr Santosh Mohapatra of JPM Eye Hospital said unless the hospital is sure about Covid status of the dead, there would be no harvesting of the cornea. “In our hospital, we were doing 60-70 corneal retrievals and a similar number of transplants, but the number is now zero since the last 5-6 months. If the pandemic continues like this, we have to see how to screen out patients who could be possibly infected by Covid as there might be a subclinical infection or undiagnosed cases of fever and pneumonia,” said Mohapatra.Similarly, in Cuttack’s SCB Medical College and Hospital, the corneal retrieval and transplantation have totally stopped after pandemic. “We can’t harvest cornea from anyone dying of encephalitis, jaundice or rabies. As Covid is a fairly new disease and not much is known about it, we can’t take a risk of harvesting cornea,” said Prof Prashant K Nanda, head of the department of ophthalmology of SCB Medical College.In MKCG Medical College and Hospital, before the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, the ophthalmology department used to conduct an average of seven cornea transplants every month. However, the operations have stopped since March following the outbreak of the Covid-19, said Suchitra Dash, head of the department.“Around 150 patients were in queue for the transplantation till the end of March, the number has now gone up to over 250 by now. The eye bank of the medical college which harvest on an average of 10 corneas every month is not harvesting anything for the last few months. We can’t take the risk of collecting cornea of the deceased without knowing their Covid status,” said Dash.Pravas Acharya, who runs an organ donation NGO called Body and Organ Donation Initiative, said many of the patients who were in queue to get cornea transplanted have little option but to wait till the pandemic curve flattens. “Family members of several deceased persons have wished to donate the eyes of the dead persons, but it could not be harvested, as the hospitals are discouraging it. The pandemic has not only affected corneal donation, but also harvesting of other organs,” said Acharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/corneal-transplants-donations-hit-hard-in-odisha-over-covid-concerns/story-9phSvziDslxOlL77BEtFcK.html

Stating that this is not the first time that the Congress was facing difficulties, he said that only the Gandhi family had held the party together during tough times.Claiming that the country was in an undeclared emergency with democratic pillars under attack from the BJP, and that only Congress could protect principles enshrined in the Constitution, Siddaramiah said, “We as a party should be united to be effective in our relentless fight to make our country better. This is possible only if the Gandhi family leads the party and that is the opinion of all leaders, supporters, and workers.”He also requested her to “convince Shri Rahul Gandhi to take up the position (of party president”. KPCC president DK Shivakumar released a video as a follow up to his letter to Sonia Gandhi in which he said that only the Gandhi family could keep the party together. Asserting that all matters should be discussed within party fora and not on public platforms, Shivakumar appealed to her to continue as Congress chief.Several other leaders including working presidents of the state unit Eshwar Khandre and Saleem Ahmed, former KPCC president Dinesh Gundu Rao as well as several others requested the Gandhi family to continue leading the party.Senior leader and RS MP Mallikarjuna Kharge in a series of tweets said, “The party should not forget the sacrifices and contributions made by the Nehru-Gandhi family for over a century. They have stood like a rock for the idea of India and ensured we have built an equitable society and strong democracy.”He also said, “During this time of crisis, all leaders and workers of INC India should stand by Smt Gandhi and strengthen the party. If for any reason, she herself is unwilling to continue, I believe that Sri Rahul Gandhi should take over as President immediately and put all uncertainties to rest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-gandhi-family-can-keep-congress-together-say-karnataka-congress-leaders/story-Gb4RDGNUuHCV6vEG4vaMlL.html
24-08-2020||India||Uttar Pradesh awaits bypolls to 8 assembly seats||Uttar Pradesh may witness a mini-assembly election of sorts in the coming months if the Election Commission decides to hold bypolls to eight seats in the state assembly along with the Bihar polls. Five of these eight seats fell vacant after the death of sitting members.“The Election Commission of India has to take a call about holding bypolls to the eight assembly seats. As of now, we have no information about the possible timing of the bypolls,” said a senior officer. Election rules mandate that the bypolls shall be conducted within six months of the assembly seats falling vacant. However, the EC has not yet given any indication about holding these bypolls. “For seats, where the six month time period is complete, the EC has given a certificate, saying a decision about holding the bypoll there will be taken later,” said the officer. Legal expert CB Pandey, a former advisor to the governor, said, “Yes, the EC should ideally hold an election to a vacant seat in six months. The poll panel can defer the elections in special circumstances like Covid-19 or any other reasons. These vacancies have no impact on the state assembly.” Uttar Pradesh assembly has a sanctioned strength of 403 members. There were two ministers among the five who died recently - Kamal Rani Varun, who held the Ghatampur seat in Kanpur Nagar district, and Chetan Chauhan, who represented Amroha’s Naugawan Sadat assembly constituency.Both ministers died of Covid-19 complications. BJP’s Janmejaya Singh (Deoria Sadar) died on August 21 and Veerendra Singh Sirohi (Bulandshahr) passed away on March 2. Samajwadi Party’s Paras Nath Yadav, who represented Malhani in Jaunpur, died on June 12. The other seats declared vacant include the one that had been held by BJP member Kuldeep Singh Sengar (Bangarmau, Unnao) who was disqualified following the life sentence awarded to him in a rape case. His seat has been declared vacant with effect from December 20 last year. The Swar seat was declared vacant with effect from December 16, 2019 after the Allahabad high court declared the election of Samajwadi Party’s Mohammad Abdullah Azam invalid. Earlier, the Tundla assembly seat of Firozabad was declared vacant on June 4 following the resignation of former UP minister SP Singh Baghel when he was elected to the Lok Sabha from Agra. The poll body will also have to take a call about holding the biennial election to 11 seats of the Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Parishad. The term of 11 MLCs from the graduate and teachers constituency of the state legislative council ended on May 6. Another seat has fallen vacant in the council following disqualification of former Bahujan Samaj Party leader Naseemuddin Siddiqui, who had switched loyalties to the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-awaits-bypolls-to-8-assembly-seats/story-PoeJUqtbwgHL3XZoKm5ITK.html

But all, especially senior leaders should raise concerns at the party forum only,” Gandhi said after a seven-hour-long meeting of the CWC, the party’s highest decision-making body.Also read: CWC meeting ends, Sonia Gandhi to continue as Congress president for nowThe CWC meeting was called to find a way out of the internal crisis triggered by a letter from 23 Congress leaders seeking overhaul of the organisation. Some of the demands of these leaders included choosing an active, full-time and visible president.A large section of the leaders backed Sonia Gandhi at the virtual meeting. Led by former prime minister Manmohan Singh and AK Antony, these leaders attacked the group which wrote the letter. Antony dubbed the letter as “unfortunate and cruel”.One of the senior Congress leaders Kapil Sibal, who is also among the signatories of the letter, created a flutter when he tweeted against Rahul Gandhi over purported remark linking them to the Bharatiya Jahata Party (BJP). He withdrew his tweet after a clarification from Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala. “Was informed by Rahul Gandhi personally that he never said what was attributed to him.

His condition is stable, hospital authorities said. Shibu Soren and his wife Roopi Soren had recently tested positive for Covid-19 and they had been in home isolation. “He was admitted to the hospital as a precautionary measure. Everything is normal,” said JMM general secretary-cum-spokesperson, Vinod Pandey. “Guruji (as Soren is popularly known) undergoes a routine check-up every three-four months at Medanta in Delhi. So, we consulted the doctors there regarding his health issues. They suggested admitting him in hospital as he is Covid-19 positive. Based on the suggestions, we admitted him at Medanta, Ranchi.” Samples of the former Jharkhand chief minister and his wife were collected on Friday and their test reports came late in the evening. Earlier on August 7, 12 security guards posted at Shibu Soren’s official residence in Ranchi’s Morabadi ground tested positive for the viral infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-jharkhand-chief-minister-shibu-soren-in-hospital-after-testing-covid-19-positive/story-4u9lBVgCfleqgPXWehcLSO.html
24-08-2020||India||Facing BJP fire, Mamata Banerjee’s veiled attack on PM Cares Fund||Under fire from the opposition over allegations of corruption in purchase of medical equipment to fight coronavirus in Bengal, chief minister Mamata Banerjee, in a counter attack, sought to know how much money has been deposited with the ‘Take Care Fund’, an indirect reference to the PM Cares Fund. The BJP and governor Jagdeep Dhankhar had alleged that there has been a multi-crore scam in the purchase of medical equipment to fight the pandemic in Bengal. “Some people are questioning the money spent over purchasing masks. I would ask them to first come clean and let me know how much money has been deposited with the ‘Take Care Fund’ before questioning others,” Banerjee said at the state secretariat during a virtual administrative meeting with district officials. The PM Cares Fund was set up by the Centre on March 28 as a public charitable trust with the primary objective of dealing with any kind of emergency or distress situation such as that posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Taking note of the allegations, the West Bengal government had set up a three-member committee last week to look into the matter.“We enquire whenever we get an allegation of corruption from any citizen be it against any minister or any officer. The state’s top bureaucrats, including the chief secretary, home secretary and finance secretary were handling the process of purchasing medical equipment. There was no political interference,” said Banerjee. Dhankhar, however, had alleged that that the probe panel set up by the Mamata Banerjee-administration was an attempt to cover up the truth. Leaders of the BJP’s Bengal unit echoed the sentiment. “Multi Crore Scam-Pandemic Purchase @MamataOfficial. Cover Up Probe-Lacks credibility. Decision Makers (-one) probing to shield culpability #MAP. Post facto saviour mechanism! Independent Probe can alone fasten culpability. Need Probe to track money trail and ill-gotten gain,” Dhankhar had tweeted on Friday. Banerjee, however, reminded how the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had to withdraw swab testing kits after they were found defective. “Even the ICMR had to recall the kits after they were found defective. This means something (some scam) was behind it. Before questioning the West Bengal government, one should first ask from where the ICMR purchased the defective kits,” she said. Mamata lashed out at the ruling BJP government at the Centre, claiming that it owes more than Rs 53,000 crore to the West Bengal government. “The state hasn’t received a penny from the Centre to fight the pandemic. Have you ever found out from where the state is arranging the funds to purchase medical equipment? We had set up a Covid-19 fund and have received more than Rs 150 crore which we utilised. But we never come to know how much money other such funds have received till date,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facing-bjp-fire-mamata-banerjee-s-veiled-attack-on-pm-cares-fund/story-JbHweDaJ3gyGCKTn3sCaUP.html

Read full statement here||The Congress Working Committee (CWC) held a seven-hour-long virtual meeting on Monday amid a controversy over a letter written by 23 party leaders calling for sweeping reforms in the organisation. It was decided in the meeting that Sonia Gandhi will continue to lead the party.The members of the CWC, the party’s highest decision-making body, also decided to form a committee to help Gandhi in day-to-day functioning of the organisation.The meeting was held in the context of two emerging views in the party, one of the 23 Congress leaders seeking dissolution of powers to state units and revamping the CWC, and another of the group that has come out in support of party president Sonia Gandhi.Read full statement here:“The Congress Working Committee [‘CWC’] takes note of the letter of Congress President, Smt. Sonia Gandhi addressed to General Secretary (Organisation) as also a letter written earlier by certain Congress leaders to the Congress President.The CWC has extensively deliberated on the letters and, after detailed discussion, places on record the following:First, the last six months have seen the nation in the throes of multiple crises. We have been beset by (i) the Corona pandemic that continues to claim thousands of lives, (ii) downward-spiraling economy, (iii) massive job losses and growing poverty, and (iv) brazen aggression into and occupation of Indian territory by the Chinese. CWC Meeting: Track Live UpdatesSecond, the two voices that have been at the forefront of exposing the Government’s inadequate responses, divisive politics and audacious propaganda are of Smt. Sonia Gandhi and Shri. Rahul Gandhi. Smt. Sonia Gandhi’s hard questions on the handling of the migrants’ crisis put this Government to shame. She ensured that Congress-ruled states tackled the pandemic effectively and provided access to healthcare and treatment to all sections of the people. Her leadership has rankled and embarrassed those occupying the highest offices in this Government. Shri. Rahul Gandhi has resolutely led the fight against the government from the front. The CWC, reflecting the overwhelming view and desire of the rank and file of the Congress, unanimously resolved to strengthen the hands of Smt. Sonia Gandhi and Shri. Rahul Gandhi in every possible way. The CWC makes it clear that no one will be or can be permitted to undermine or weaken the party and its leadership at this juncture. The responsibility of every Congress worker and leader today is to fight the pernicious assault on India’s democracy, pluralism and diversity by the Modi Government.Third, and most importantly, the voices of our two leaders have inspired a generation of Indians, both within and outside of the Indian National Congress, to rise and demand answers from this Government which seeks to desperately distract the people through shallow and manufactured issues. It is under their leadership that crores of Congress workers and supporters have reached out to fill the large, callous gaps in governance left by this Government as a result of which millions belonging to the poor and middle classes have been unjustly deprived of their rights and their livelihoods. Fourthly, the CWC notes that inner-party issues can not be deliberated through the media or in public fora. The CWC urges and advises all concerned to raise such issues only in party fora in the interest of propriety and discipline. Fifthly, the CWC authorises the Congress President to affect necessary organisational changes that she may deem appropriate to take on the challenges listed above.In the light of the above deliberations and conclusions, the CWC unanimously requests Smt. Sonia Gandhi to continue to lead the Indian National Congress until such time as circumstances will permit an AICC session to be convened.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cwc-passes-resolution-after-7-hour-long-meeting-read-full-statement-here/story-zfNEKTnrSi3CTf9ZREyVDJ.html
24-08-2020||India||Congress: 5 chiefs from Nehru-Gandhi family, 13 from outside since independence||As a leadership crisis grips the Congress, experts having chronicled the country’s oldest political party said on Monday that it may be theoretically possible for the party to have a president outside the Nehru-Gandhi family, but not practically. The party’s history shows that it has had at least 13 presidents from outside the Nehru-Gandhi clan since independence as against five from its first family. However, the family members have been at the helm for a much longer period of time as against the others. Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have headed the party for the majority of the period since independence. Sonia Gandhi, who has been its longest-serving president, offered to quit at a stormy CWC meeting on Monday after a letter from more than 20 party leaders sought organisational reforms and a collective leadership, but she was urged to stay on as the interim chief till a full-time president is appointed. Among the leaders outside the Nehru-Gandhi family, J B Kripalani, B. Pattabhi Sitaramayya, Purushottam Das Tandon, U N Dhebar, N Sanjiva Reddy, K Kamaraj, S. Nijalingappa, Jagjivan Ram, Shankar Dayal Sharma, D.K. Barooah, K B Reddy, P V Narasimha Rao and Sitaram Kesri have headed the party. The debate over whether a person from outside the Gandhi family was re-ignited last week when Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, in a year-old but recently published interview, endorsed her brother Rahul Gandhi’s stand on a non-Gandhi president for the Congress, saying there are plenty of people capable of leading the party. Rasheed Kidwai, senior journalist and writer of the book “24 Akbar Road”, said the key issue before the party today is about the political leadership which has always been with the Nehru-Gandhi family. “In the first general election, the slogan was ‘A vote for Nehru is a vote for the Congress’. Even 2004 onwards, Sonia Gandhi wielded the political leadership that now resides with Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka. So the political leadership of the Congress has by and large always been with the Gandhis and even non-Gandhi presidents have owed allegiance to them,” he told PTI. Asked if a non-Gandhi can run the party with the Gandhi family retaining the overall leadership, he said, “Theoretically yes, practically no.” Sanjay Kumar, Director at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, said the tenure of Gandhi family presidents cannot be compared with non-Gandhi family presidents as there would be stark difference in the quantum of tenures. “A person from the Gandhi family is both an asset and a liability for the party.  The person would be an asset as he/she acts as a glue for the party which keeps the party together. They are also a liability and that liability is coming to the fore more prominently now as the Gandhi family has not been able to inspire voters and leaders of the party,” Kumar told PTI. He opined that it is going to be very difficult for a non-Gandhi president to function in the prevailing situation as various factions could emerge and the pulls and pressures would be very high. Sanjay K Pandey, a political commentator and a professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), echoed similar views, saying it will be very difficult for a non-Gandhi president to work with the family having a dominant imprint on the party. “Unless the Congress devises a mechanism to deal with such a scenario, the future of the party is not very bright,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-5-chiefs-from-nehru-gandhi-family-13-from-outside-since-independence/story-E83sjr5DyIwmWs4Efz3gzN.html
24-08-2020||India||Mamata Banerjee urges PM Modi to postpone NEET, JEE to keep students safe amid Covid-19||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to postpone the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) due to be held in September. “In our last video conference with Hon’ble PM Shri @narendramodi Ji, I had been vocal against the UGC guidelines mandating completion of terminal examinations in Universities/Colleges by the end of September 2020, which had a huge potential to put student lives at risk,” tweeted Banerjee. “Now with the directive of @EduMinOfIndia to conduct NEET, JEE 2020 in September, I would again appeal to the Centre to assess the risk and postpone these examinations until the situation is conducive again. It is our duty to ensure a safe environment for all our students,” she said in a second tweet. Adhir Ranjan Chowdury, leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, also wrote to the Prime Minster on Sunday urging him to postpone NEET and JEE. Students in West Bengal and several other states have been demanding postponement of these examinations over the past few days. The All India Students Association (AISA), a Left organisation, has planned protests in Kolkata and other cities. On Monday afternoon, the West Bengal education department held a meeting in Kolkata, where officials discussed the pros and cons of postponing the academic year in secondary and higher secondary schools under state boards instead of curtailing the syllabus as earlier proposed by some people to help students cope with the syllabus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-urges-pm-modi-to-postpone-neet-jee-to-keep-students-safe-amid-covid-19/story-og27BN5Ig22RfmmCiKjOJP.html
24-08-2020||India||Pakistan’s follow-up action on terror tag for Taliban leader is an invite for talks||Less than a week after taking steps to enforce UN Security Council sanctions against hundreds of terrorists, Pakistan on Monday invited a Taliban delegation led by one of the UN-designated leaders for talks on Afghanistan’s troubled peace process.Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a co-founder of the Taliban and deputy political chief of the group, was among the scores of Taliban and Haqqani Network operatives named in a statutory regulatory order issued by Pakistan’s Foreign Office on August 18 to enforce the UN sanctions, which include a freeze on assets, a travel ban and ensuring they cannot access weapons.Baradar and the delegation of senior Taliban leaders arrived in Islamabad from Doha in Qatar on Monday, and are expected to hold talks with Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership.Pakistan’s recent move to enforce the UN sanctions, which also apply to Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Saeed, Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar and hundreds of terrorists, was widely perceived as having been taken with an eye on an upcoming assessment of the country’s counter-terror financing regime by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The assessment is expected in October. People familiar with developments said the invitation to the sanctioned Taliban leader underlined Pakistan’s reluctance to sincerely take action against terrorist individuals and entities. “How can one take the notification they issued on August 18 seriously when this is the next step taken by them?” said one of the people cited above.Baradar, currently one of the Taliban’s main negotiators, had signed the peace deal with the US in February. He was arrested in the Pakistani port city of Karachi in 2010 and was released from prison in 2018 as part of Islamabad’s efforts to wield greater influence in the Afghan peace process.Pakistan’s statutory regulatory order of August 18 states that a request to extradite Baradar to Afghanistan is pending in the Lahore high court, and that he was a member of the Taliban’s Quetta Shura (council). Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen tweeted on Monday that Baradar and his delegation were visiting Islamabad at the “invitation of Pakistan’s foreign ministry” for talks on developments in the Afghan peace process, and “relaxation and facilitation of peoples’ movement” and trade between the two countries. Taliban officials visit other countries to further “positive relations” and convey the group’s stance on the peace process. “These visits were postponed due to the spread of Covid-19 but the series has been resumed now,” he said.Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told a news conference on Monday the talks with the Taliban were aimed at bringing peace and stability to Afghanistan. “I invited them and will have a detailed meeting with them tomorrow (Tuesday),” he said.Qureshi also said the Taliban leaders were visiting Pakistan at Islamabad’s invitation and the process wouldn’t be hampered by the UN sanctions. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said Pakistan was more intent on protecting its political interests than cracking down on terror.“FATF began increasing the pressure on Pakistan after several attacks by anti-India terrorist groups based in Pakistan. Since then, Pakistan has taken some steps to show it is acting on FATF’s action plan. But it will keep on protecting its political interests, over and above what it does for FATF,” he said. “This invitation to Mullah Baradar shows it is doing exactly that. Once global pressure eases, there is no guarantee that Pakistan will continue with even these token restrictions,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-s-follow-up-action-on-terror-tag-for-taliban-leader-is-an-invite-for-talks/story-K1kLaZAoEfbs4kYqpe0YnJ.html
24-08-2020||India||‘Won’t let you move around in state’: Congress minister warns dissenters||The party workers won’t allow them to move freely in the state if they do not apologise to the Gandhi family, Maharashtra Congress minister Sunil Kedar on Monday warned dissenters from the state - Mukul Wasnik, Prithviraj Chavan and Milind Deora - who questioned the Congress’ top leadership in a letter that has caused an upheaval within the party.Kedar’s outburst is in response to a letter signed by 23 leaders in which they have suggested far-reaching changes, including dissolution of powers to state units and revamping the Congress Working Committe (CWC).The letter stated that even after 14 months of the 2019 verdict, the Congress party has not undertaken “honest introspection” to analyse the reasons for its continued decline.“I wholeheartedly support Hon. Sonia Gandhi ji as president. Its shameful on Mukul Wasnik, Prithviraj Chavhan and Milind Deora to raise questions on leadership of Gandhi family. These leaders must apologise for their act immediately. Otherwise Congress workers will see how they move in the state freely,” he said in a series of tweets.“Congress can give fight to BJP govt only when party has Gandhi as its head. This is high time to stand firmly behind Sonia ji’s leadership,” he added.The three leaders are yet to respond to the criticism made by Kedar, MLA from Nagpur district. He currently holds animal husbandry and dairy development portfolio in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government in which Congress is an ally along with Shiv Sena and NCP.Meanwhile, Yashomati Thakur, another minister in the state government and one of the state working presidents of the party, said that Rahul Gandhi should again lead the party. “Gandhi is not a ‘Family’ it’s ‘DNA of India’. If Soniyaji has made up her mind then Rahulji should lead the party. India Needs Rahul ji,” she said in a tweet on Monday.Vijay Wadettiwar, another minister in the state government, said they would quit state government the moment Rahul Gandhi will order them for the same. “The government wouldn’t have formed if Rahul ji didn’t approve of the coalition. Even today if he takes up the party chief position and decides to quit the government, then we will move out the very next moment. There is no question of staying in the state government if leadership takes a call,” he told reporters.The 23 leaders, including former chief ministers, members of the party’s highest decision-making body, Congress Working Committee (CWC), and sitting members of Parliament, in the letter also said that over-centralisation of the organisation and micro-management has always proven to be counter-productive. They said that the party has witnessed a steady decline reflected in successive electoral verdicts in 2014 and 2019, noting that the reasons were manifold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/won-t-let-you-move-around-in-state-congress-minister-warns-dissenters/story-1FFmuix7OInEb3m2TD0CkK.html

24-08-2020||India||CWC meeting ends, Sonia Gandhi to continue as Congress president for now||The meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) ended on Monday, after deliberating on the turmoil within the party for seven hours, with a resolution that Sonia Gandhi will continue to lead the party.The members of the CWC, the party’s highest decision-making body, also decided to form a committee to help Gandhi in day-to-day functioning of the organisation.CWC Meeting: Track Live UpdatesA session of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) will be called within six months where future course of action will be decided.Sonia Gandhi, who was adamant on quitting the post of party president, agreed to continue. She said after the marathon meeting, “Congress is one big family and I don’t hold anything against anyone. But all, especially senior leaders should raise concerns at the party forum only.” The crisis was triggered by a letter written earlier this month by a group of Congress leaders - 23 of them - who suggested complete overhaul of the party, including full-time president, a parliamentary board if a non-Gandhi become the party chief and collective leadership.In her response, Gandhi asked the CWC members to begin the process of electing the next party president. She also presented a statement which was read out by KC Venugopal. Many leaders, including former prime ministr Manmohan Singh, urged Gandhi to continue.Three of the 23 dissenters - Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma and Mukul Wasnik - also lauded her contribution to the party and insisted that their letter was not intended to question the leadership of the Gandhi family. Explaining the reasons for writing the letter to the Congress president, Azad made it amply that it was not directed against Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi as “misconstrued” and alleged by some people.Party general secretary Ambika Soni, meanwhile, demanded action against the dissenters, saying rules are equal for both seniors and juniors in the party.Former union minister RPN Singh praised Sonia Gandhi for being available 24x7 to guide the party during Jharkhand elections. “We won the elections. Secondly, I want to tell all CWC members that we should all learn from Sonia Gandhi,” he told the CWC. Singh also wanted Sonia Gandhi to continue on the post till a new president is elected. Sonia Gandhi completed one year as the party’s interim chief on August 10. She was a full-fledged party president for over 19 years from May 1998 to December 2017 when Rahul Gandhi took over the reins from her and resigned in May 2019 owning moral responsibility for the party’s rout in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cwc-meeting-ends-sonia-gandhi-to-continue-as-congress-president-for-now/story-Jnnrzk7lrw1xjQ94muqmDM.html

He further urged the PM to consider starting the new academic year from January 2021 instead of June-July 2021 so that students do not lose a year.Thackeray said that various institutions and universities are scheduling examinations, which isn’t a “practical” and “feasible” idea considering the rising cases of Covid-19 in the country.In his letter, he said that he wished to draw the PM’s attention to the plight of the students.“While most of our country is still working from home due to increasing Covid numbers, various institutions and universities for professional and non-professional courses have been trying to schedule examinations. This isn’t a practical and feasible option sir, as most states are facing increasing numbers of Covid, along with red zones still in place and transport yet to resume,” the chief of Shiv Sena’s youth wing said.Last week, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asked the state education department to consider the idea of changing the academic year to January from June in the light of the delay in kicking off the academic year.“We may also think of starting our academic year from January 2021 instead of June/July 2020 so that no student loses the academic year. Sir I’m sure that with this intervention, we would be able to prevent a larger spike in infection and contribute to our fight in keeping our citizens safe,” said Aaditya Thackeray.The Shiv Sena and the Sena-led Maharashtra government have opposed the Centre’s decision to hold final-year examination citing risk to students, teaching and non-teaching staff during the pandemic. He added that wherever schools and colleges were reopened, a large number of people were infected with Covid.“In our country, most students live with their parents and grandparents and the Infection, if at all, can be fatal. The system for even a single paper would include not just students, but teachers, non-teaching staff and much more of the state apparatus, most of whom are in the high-risk groups. Sir, I humbly request you to intervene and postpone all academic activity to do with physical or online examinations across the country, for all professional courses, including entrance exams.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-isn-t-practical-postpone-exams-aaditya-thackeray-to-pm-modi/story-ppysbOB2MAcWn6QyE2GsYI.html
24-08-2020||India||DRDO sets an ambitious 2021 target for 108 defence items at meeting with Rajnath Singh||Days after the government announced a policy change to encourage self-reliance in the defence sector, a Defence Research and Development Organisation team on Monday told the government that 108 systems and subsystems would be delivered by the Indian industry within the next 18 months. The list of 108 items that the industry would design, develop and manufacture was handed over to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh by DRDO secretary Dr G Satheesh Reddy.“This initiative will pave the way for Indian Defence industry to develop many technologies towards building an AtmaNirbhar Bharat,” defence minister Rajnath Singh tweeted after the meeting with the DRDO delegation.Singh said he had been apprised about the systems and subsystems that had been identified for development by Indian industry. The list, reviewed by HT, includes mini and micro UAVs, mine laying and marking equipment, armoured engineering reconnaissance vehicle and fuel system components for aircrafts.“The DRDO will provide its support to industries in this development process,” the minister said.Of the 108 items, 68 items would be developed before the end of this year. The remaining 40 items are targeted to be manufactured by the end of 2021.The government had earlier this month gone public with plans to restrict imports in the defence sector over the next five years, putting out a list of 101 items that would to be produced within the country by 2024. Singh had then made it clear that the embargo on imports would kick in between 2020 and 2024. The decision was taken in consultation with the defence industry. The list of weapons and systems to be placed on the restricted import list includes artillery guns, missile destroyers, ship-borne cruise missiles and long-range land attack cruise missiles.`||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-sets-an-ambitious-2021-target-for-108-defence-items-at-meeting-with-rajnath-singh/story-mbq2pdS5yivyQv3aLeoXuM.html
24-08-2020||India||China dumps large-scale optic fibre cables from India, tariff wars expected||India has found a large-scale dumping of optic fibre cables from China, days after Beijing extended anti-dumping duty for five years on import of fibre optic product made in India, which could trigger a similar tariff measure to check influx of the Chinese product in the Indian market, two officials aware of development said.The government is considering imposing remedial duty on the import of ‘single mode optical fibre’ as an investigation by the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) has confirmed its dumping mainly from China, the officials said requesting anonymity. The DGTR is a single-window agency for administering all trade remedial measures including anti-dumping, countervailing duties and safeguard measures.After a detailed investigation, the DGTR on Friday concluded that import of single mode optical fibre at dumped rates is threatening to cause “serious injury” to Indian manufacturers and recommended imposition of a 10% safeguard duty on its import from all countries except for developing nations barring China, the officials said. The government had already raised basic customs duty (BCD) on it by 5% in July 2019.The finance ministry is expected to take a final decision on this matter soon, they said. Single mode optical fibres are used as a medium for telecommunication operations such as community access televisions (CATV), fibre to the home (FTH) and computer networking because it is flexible and can be bundled as cables.“Effectively, the measure is against Chinese firms as combined import from all other developing countries is less than 9%. China alone has a share of over 84% in its import,” one of the officials said.The DGTR’s recommendation came close on the heels of Chinese commerce ministry’s punitive tariff on the same product imported from India for five years, effective from August 14. According to officials, China is resorting to tariff barriers as its companies are suffering from overcapacity, and also diverting its exports to the Indian market after global boycott of the Chinese products. “Based on complaints by the domestic optic fibre industry, the DGTR had initiated the investigation on Chinese dumping on September 23 last year. It had issued a primary finding on November 6 last year, but its recommendations could not be implemented at that time,” the first official said. A second official said India is very cautious about Chinese unfair trade practices especially after June 15. Sino-Indian tensions have shot up after a violent brawl between Chinese and Indian soldiers on June 15 along the Line of Actual Control in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh in which 20 Indian army personnel and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers were killed.Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consultancy firm DVS Advisors LLP, said, “The precursor for this issue has been laid much before the border issue with China. However, the timing of the notification of the findings and recommendations indicate towards China considering the fact that in November the same was not notified.”Dumping is an unfair trade practice that entails the export of a product at a price lower than its value and is countered by punitive actions, which are acceptable measure under multilateral trade agreements, the officials said. Remedial actions include imposition of anti-dumping duty (against under-priced imports), safeguard measures (imposition of a duty, a quota, or both against unexpected import surge) and countervailing duty (against export subsidies) to protect domestic units.India has taken a tough position against unfair Chinese trade practices as it is committed to protecting domestic industry under the government’s Make in India campaign, the officials said. India-China bilateral trade is heavily tilted in favour of China. According to trade figures released by the General Administration of Customs of China (GACC) in mid-January 2020, India’s trade deficit with China was $56.77 billion in 2019; bilateral trade amounted to about $92.68 billion last year, a 1.6% annual increase.“Given the domestic economic scenario, the finance ministry is expected to accept this,” Vijayasarathy said adding that the move cannot be linked to China alone as the government has been indicating its intentions of protecting the domestic industry.“In the budget, customs duty was increased for more than 10 products. Since China is a major supplier for India with huge trade surplus, any action on imports across the board would impact China. Atmanirbhar Bharat itself is to restrict the influence of China on Indian markets and with relationships soaring, indirect economic sanctions will help both in hurting China and giving a boost to the fortunes of the domestic industry,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-dumps-large-scale-optic-fibre-cables-from-india-tariff-wars-expected/story-7KoR9raunhmoWvhh7Vh25J.html
24-08-2020||India||Kerala assembly passes resolution against awarding airport contract to Adani Group||The Kerala assembly on Monday unanimously passed a resolution urging the Centre not to lease out the Thiruvananthapuram international airport to Adani Enterprises. The lone Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member O Rajagopal walked out of the house after he was denied permission to speak in the assembly. Later, police arrested BJP state president K Surendran and many party leaders for staging a dharna outside the assembly seeking the resignation of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Moving the resolution the CM said the Centre should re-examine its decision and allow it to run the airport as a special purpose vehicle in which the state government has a majority stake. “For the last two years the state has been opposing the move. I have written twice to Prime Minister Modi. Still it was handed over to a private entity ignoring the state’s protest. The Kerala assembly unanimously urges the Centre to reconsider its decision,” the CM said introducing the resolution. Last week the Kerala government had moved the High Court to stay the decision and it is expected come up before the court in a couple of days. It also called an all-party meet to oppose the decision. But Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram Shashi Tharoor had supported the Union government’s decision saying the private participation will help usher in much-needed development. While supporting the resolution opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said there was a “criminal conspiracy” to hand over the airport to the Adani group after the government appointed a legal agency to manage the bidding which was represented by the same industrial group. On Sunday, state industry minister EP Jayarajan said the government was not aware of the legal agency’s background. “We want the government to examine this serious lapse. It is strange while the government opposed Adani group’s takeover, one of the sister companies of the same group was engaged for bidding for the airport. It is a serious conflict of interest,” said Chennithala. The state government has been opposing the privatization of the airport vehemently and fought many legal battles but the court refused to interfere in it saying it was part of a policy decision. In February 2019, the government-owned Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) had participated in the open bidding for the airport but Adani Enterprises quoted the highest and won it. Union Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had criticized the state’s move saying it was not right to oppose the move after losing the bid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-assembly-passes-resolution-against-awarding-airport-contract-to-adani-group/story-uHKYRaYTj3vm6QQgQD7b0N.html

A senior police officer said that according to Bhat’s family, he had gone to Shopian on Wednesday. “He has been missing since. He (Bhat) was booked under PSA in 1995. There are 12 FIR against him and efforts are on to trace him,” the officer said.Also read: Don’t delay development projects, Jammu and Kashmir L-G tells officersThe officer also said that the audio clip seems fake. “We are investigating every aspect of this case.” The 2.56-minute message, purportedly released by terrorists, claimed that Bhat had been killed and buried at an unidentified place.In the clip, an unidentified person can be heard saying that Bhat was involved in “anti-movement activities” and had met his fate. “We have been after him for a long time and finally got him,” the person said in the clip.The message claimed that the body hadn’t been handed over to his family because of Covid-19. “We understand the pain of the family. To avoid the spread of Covid-19, the body wasn’t given to his family. Just as the Indian forces, after killing our comrades, bury them in unmarked graves at unidentified locations,” the message said.Earlier, on August 2, Shakir Manzoor, who was working with 162 Territorial Army battalion in south Kashmir, was abducted from Kulgam district. His burnt vehicle was found later. The jawan could not be traced despite a search operation by army and the police in Shopian and Kulgam areas. A similar message was released later, claiming that Manzoor was killed and buried at an undisclosed location.In the last two months, five BJP leaders, including two sarpanches, have been killed in different parts of Kashmir. Earlier in July, Congress sarpanch Ajay Pandita was killed in Anantnag district which forced many panchayat members to resign from their parties.The government also shifted dozens of panchayat members and block development council (BDC) members, majority of them from the BJP, to safer places after an evaluation of threats from terrorists.Soon after taking charge, Jammu and Kashmir’s new Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha had said adequate security would be provided to panchayat members and political workers in Kashmir.Sinha was speaking at a function in Srinagar in which a large number of panchayat workers participated and demanded security in the backdrop of attacks on BJP workers in different parts of the Valley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-panchayat-member-untraceable-terrorists-claim-they-killed-him/story-dQ1RgAkgUPxHh1XJCfPaRN.html
24-08-2020||India||Longest river ropeway, across Brahmaputra, opens in Guwahati||India’s longest river crossing ropeway — across river Brahmaputra — was opened to the public on Monday, nearly 11 years after work on it was started.The 1.8-kilometre-long ropeway, built at a cost of Rs 56 crore, extending from central to northern Guwahati, will reduce travel time between both banks to just eight minutes.The ropeway was inaugurated by finance, PWD, education and health minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma. Development minister Siddhartha Bhattacharya and member of Parliament Queen Ojah were also present.“It is a matter of pride and satisfaction that we now have the longest river crossing ropeway in India in our state. This is also the first ropeway in the state,” said Sarma after the inauguration.Every day, hundreds of people cross the Brahmaputra using ferries, but the service gets discontinued for several days during peak monsoon, when the water level in the river crosses the danger mark. Inauguration of the ropeway will address that problem.Each cabin on the ropeway will be able to ferry 30 passengers at a go and nearly 250 persons would be able to cross the river every hour. However, due to Covid-19 protocols in place, only 15 passengers would be allowed per commute for the time being.The ropeway will have two terminals — one near Nehru Park at Panbazar in Guwahati and the other across the river at Rajadwar village, behind the Dolgobinda Temple.The ropeway, which operates on a twin-track, single-haul, bi-cable double reversible jig back system, was constructed by Kolkata-based Samir Damodar Ropeways, with technical and logistical support from Swiss firms.The project was cleared by the state government in March 2006 at a cost of Rs28 crore and work on it started in December 2009. However, the work came to a halt in 2011 as the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) objected to it, saying it posed threat to Urvashi island on the Brahmaputra.After obtaining necessary clearances in 2015, work on the project restarted in 2017. A trial run of the ropeway was conducted in March before the Covid-19 restrictions came into place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/longest-river-ropeway-across-brahmaputra-opens-in-guwahati/story-lstT4tANbLmmEku1Wzx8MO.html

The patients must get quality treatment facilities,” he said according to the statement.“But do not merely increase the beds. The increase in beds should be supplemented with arrangement of all necessary medical equipment and human resources,” he said.He reiterated that all districts must keep their integrated command and control centres in the utmost active mode and make them function efficiently for coordinated Covid-19 management.“Through these integrated control and command centres, keep in touch on a regular basis with the patients who are in home isolation. Monitor their health status regularly, using the system. At the same time, keep all ambulances fully active for transporting Covid patients. Pay special attention to Lucknow and Kanpur Nagar districts vis-a-vis Covid-19 management,” he said.The chief minister observed: “Contact tracing is helping keep Covid-19 spread under control. So, do more and better contact tracing. Speed up door-to-door survey to detect anyone with Covid symptoms. If need be, create more door-to-door survey teams and set targets for them.”He also asked officials to invoke the National Security Act (NSA) against those who resort to black-marketeering of fertilizer and said all farmers must get the required quantity of fertilizer, the statement added. “Invoke NSA against those who put fertilizer in the black market,” he said.Touching upon investments to shore up the economy amid the pandemic, the chief minister asked the officers and departments concerned to keep in touch with investors, sort out their problems and issues.Talking about waterlogging in Noida and Greater Noida following heavy rain, Adityanath asked the officers concerned to evolve a system to prevent such situations in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adityanath-orders-increase-in-number-of-hospital-beds-for-covid-19-patients/story-r1c5WG8gbB3h1FVBH3bqJI.html
24-08-2020||India||BJP refrains from commenting on CWC meet, calls it Congress’ internal matter||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)  on Monday refrained to comment on the developments during the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting, where differences among senior leaders emerged after one group wrote a letter to Sonia Gandhi seeking an overhaul of the party. Several BJP leaders however said that the sparring at the CWC showed the lack of internal democracy within the country’s oldest party. “Whatever is happening is an internal matter of the Congress party and the BJP would not like to comment on it; however, the statements that are emerging from the CWC prove the pseudo internal democracy in the party,” said BJP spokesperson Sanjay Mayukh. At the meeting, which was called to discuss the churning that is taking place with a section of leaders seeking a change in leadership, differences came to fore with a section of leaders who support Sonia Gandhi training their guns on the leaders who wrote to her, seeking a complete overhaul of the party. Wayanad MP and former party chief Rahul Gandhi called the letter ill-timed. Also Read: CWC meet: Leaked letter puts Congress seniors on back footAnother BJP spokesperson, Tom Vadakkan, who joined the party after quitting the Congress and was considered close to the Gandhi family, said the developments at the CWC indicated that internal strife is now in the public domain. “As a member of the BJP, I would not want to comment about the internal affairs of the Congress party. However, as a former Congressperson, I can say that the mirror has cracked, and it is all out in the public domain.” A controversy erupted after senior leader Kapil Sibal lashed out at Rahul Gandhi for alleging that some leaders who wrote the letter were acting at the behest of the BJP. Sibal later deleted the tweet and said he was incorrectly informed of the statement. Vadakkan however said the back and forth was “scripted”. Also Read: Sibal backtracks after reacting to ‘colluding with BJP’ remark“These people who were trying to add value to the construction of the party were slandered. What he (Gandhi) basically said was that if you’re not with me, you are with my enemy. However, an attempt is now being made to save face. It could have been handled better; they (Gandhis) could have taken the constructive advice well and thanked them for the honest assessment,” he said. Vadakkan also said that though the Congress party refers to internal democracy and speaks about holding elections, it is only a ruse. “They talk about elections but they are never fair, there is always backdoor management. Even in the CWC, there are selective appointments. So essentially, it is not an election but a nomination and it is a family enterprise,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-refrains-from-commenting-on-cwc-meet-calls-it-congress-internal-matter/story-jfNm2I9aTIlP8fdWZQV8eJ.html

The senior leader had said he was ready to quit if Rahul Gandhi’s remark about “colluding with the BJP” were proven to be true.“Poetic Justice: GHULAM NABI sb u’d accused me of exactly this.

24-08-2020||India||Woman, 30, allegedly gang-raped in Bengal, asked to pay fine; 5 arrested||A 30-year-old tribal woman has alleged that she was gang-raped in the early hours of August 19 in the Mohammad Bazar area of West Bengal’s Birbhum district because she defied people in her village and had a relationship with a youth from a non-tribal community. Five people named have been arrested in the case. Hours after she was tortured, the woman and the youth were allegedly made to face trial at a kangaroo court. The woman and the youth were asked to pay a fine of Rs 10,000 and Rs 50,000, respectively, local people said. Instead of paying the money, the woman went to the police and lodged a complaint two days later. “All five men named in the FIR have been arrested for rape. We are conducting an investigation into the alleged kangaroo court as well,” Subimal Paul, additional superintendent of police (headquarters) Birbhum district, told HT on Monday afternoon. In her complaint, the woman, a widow and mother of two children, said that there was a community puja in her village on August 18. That very afternoon, she and the youth were locked up inside a community club and beaten when they were caught together on the road, the woman claimed. In the early hours of the next day, five men took her to a desolate place and took turns to rape her, the victim alleged. She and her partner were released on the morning of August 19. In her complaint, the woman, however, did not mention the kangaroo court. Police arrested all the five accused between Friday and Sunday. One of them is an elderly leader of the local tribal community. The Suri court on Sunday remanded them in police custody for a week. The BJP hit out at the ruling Trinamool, claiming the incident has once again exposed how unsafe women are in West Bengal. “There are numerous incidents that the media never gets to know. In many cases, the rape victims are too scared to file a complaint. Also, kangaroo courts are quite common in rural Bengal because the ruling Trinamool Congress encourages its workers to take law in their hands,” said Bengal BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu. In 2018, West Bengal earned the dubious distinction of being the state with the most number of recorded incidents of acid attacks, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report. Fifty acid attacks were reported from Bengal in 2018, while Uttar Pradesh and Odisha recorded 40 and 13, respectively. The NCRB report for 2016 showed that while Kolkata was one of the safest cities for women in the country the state recorded the highest number of cases of domestic violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-30-allegedly-gang-raped-in-bengal-made-to-pay-fine-5-arrested/story-0CiGzhQrU2eMUOcN00SM7L.html
24-08-2020||India||26/11 Mumbai attack witness moves HC, seeks compensation||Devika Rotawan (21), the youngest survivor and an eye-witness to the November 26, 2008 terrorist attacks on Mumbai, has moved the Bombay high court (HC),seeking direction to Maharashtra government to allot residential premises for her impoverished family and also to make provision for her undergraduate education.Also read: Pakistan bans 88 new terrorists in bid to slip out of FATF’s grey listRotawan has filed a petition through advocate Utsav Bains in high court. The petition has expressed apprehension that her family would have to face homelessness because they had not been able to pay monthly rent for their room in a chawl (tenement) at Subhash Nagar in Mumbai’s Bandra (East) owing to acute financial constraints.She said because of several morbidities, it was not possible for her father and brother to earn a livelihood and they have defaulted in making their monthly rental payments.Rotawan, who has recently taken admission to an undergraduate course in humanities at Chetana College in Bandra and plans to pursue a career in civil services, was nine years old at the time of the 2008 Mumbai carnage.A bullet had pierced her right thigh, as two outlawed Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militants from Pakistan had fired indiscriminately on passengers at the crowded Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and also hurled grenades at them.Rotawan, who was to travel with her parents to Pune by a train, fell unconscious shortly after she was hit by a stray bullet.Police took her to the adjoining Saint George’s Hospital, where she underwent six surgeries within a month and a half and was bed-ridden for another six months due to post-operative care.  Rotawan has pleaded before HC that following the Mumbai carnage, several representatives of the Central and state government visited their room in the chawl and assured to provide them accommodation under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) quota because of their acute poverty.The officials, she claimed, also assured to make adequate arrangements for her education, and monetary assistance over and above what was required for her medical treatment.However, the petition cited that all the government assistance received by her was required to be spent on her treatment and post-operative care.Her petition cited that despite the fact that she was a victim of a dastardly terrorist attack and she along with her father proved to be key eye-witnesses against Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the sole 26/11 attacker caught alive and hanged to death in November 2012, the authorities did not take care of her family’s needs to date.    In 2009, she had also approached various government authorities requesting them to extend rehabilitative measures for her family and also sent several representations.“However, all our efforts went in vain,” the petition added. All kinds of assurances were made, but they turned out to be hollow promises until the 26/11 trial was in progress, the petition stated .The plea also prayed before HC that rehabilitative measures prove to be elusive after the memories of terror attacks fade from the public’s consciousness because of the absence of a definitive law or policy to safeguard the victims’ needs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/26-11-mumbai-attack-witness-moves-hc-seeks-compensation/story-TNiXMMSDZVSaRGat8LUp4J.html
24-08-2020||India||Prank calls hit emergency ambulance services during Covid pandemic in Jharkhand||Prank and fake calls have emerged as a major concern for the provider emergency ambulance services during the Covid-19 pandemic in Jharkhand, as these calls are leading to queues and delay in assigning the ambulances, officials said. The state’s call centre for 108 Ambulance service gets around 40% fake calls every day, officials said. In Jharkhand, people are often found complaining of not getting an ambulance in time or calls going unattended, which are often caused by fake or prank calls that result in less productivity and clogged telephone lines. Sumit Basu, project head of Ziqitza Healthcare Ltd, which runs the emergency 108 ambulance service on behalf of Jharkhand government, said, “The fake and abusive calls have turned out to be a big hurdle in smooth functioning of the emergency ambulance service during the pandemic Covid period. At this time of crisis, some people still do not understand the seriousness of emergency services.” Basu said, “We receive 6,000-7,000 calls a day at our centralized call centre in Doranda. However, 40% of them are either fake or abusive or unimportant calls, which not only waste the time of the employee attending the calls but also delay the service to the persons who might need it urgently.” The emergency ambulance service was started in Jharkhand on November 15, 2017. At present, 337 ambulances are functioning across the 24 districts of the state. According to the agency, the ambulances have provided services to the 4,75,625 people till August 18, 2020. Basu said after the outbreak of Covid-19 in March, a total of 80 ambulances have been dedicated for Covid patients. “These ambulances are not used for other patients, as it needs extra precautions and safety. Since March, more than 11,000 Covid-19 patients have been transferred through these ambulances,” Basu said. There are many instances where an ambulance service was sought but when the vehicle reached the spot, there was no patient, he said. The abusive and prank calls also hit the morale of the employees and also irritate them sometimes.“We have many times blocked the numbers of fake callers and also lodged a few FIRs. But, people will have to understand that fake calls might deprive people from availing the ambulance services in extreme need,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prank-calls-hit-emergency-ambulance-services-during-covid-pandemic-in-jharkhand/story-jbVnQ4yicoI9Fn3LL7eJrO.html
24-08-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi never said signatories of letter were colluding with BJP: Azad||New Delhi: Ghulam Nabi Azad, leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha and veteran Congress leader, clarified on Monday that Rahul Gandhi had never stated that those who wrote the letter to interim party chief Sonia Gandhi were colluding with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Also read: Sibal backtracks after reacting to ‘colluding with BJP’ remark“Rahul Gandhi at no point of time inside the Congress Working Committee (CWC) or outside said that the signatories to the letter were doing it at the behest of the BJP. This is a totally wrong thing, which has been attributed to Rahul Gandhi,” Azad told HT. “Secondly, what I said at the CWC meeting was that, unfortunately, most of the people have not seen the full text of the letter. Because in the leak, which is unfortunate, only some portions of the letter have come out. Without going into the full text of the letter, some of my colleagues yesterday (on Sunday) said that this was being done at the behest of the BJP. I have said that if any of those people and leaders will prove that it was done at the behest of the BJP, I will resign. In that context, I said that I will resign if they prove it and I did not ask Rahul Gandhi to prove that. I have not resigned,” he said. In the meeting, a Congress leader said Azad made it amply clear that the letter was not against Sonia and Rahul as “misconstrued” and alleged by some people. For the past one month, the leader quoted Azad as having said, there were rumours doing the rounds that Rahul does not want to come back as the Congress president at the moment and Sonia does not want to continue as the party’s interim chief beyond August 10 when she had completed her one-year term. There were also suggestions that Sonia might appoint somebody to the post and the letter was written in that context, the former Jammu & Kashmir chief minister told the CWC. Azad told the meeting that the letter was written to urge the interim Congress president to discuss and consult with them before appointing somebody to the post. Should a third person be appointed to the top post, that person has to do certain things, such as form the parliamentary board, be active and have collective leadership, he told the CWC. Azad said letter was the do’s and don’ts for the third person and that they should be consulted before appointing anybody to the highest post in the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-never-said-signatories-of-letter-were-colluding-with-bjp-azad/story-NWOeCKpLrmT9JkA18hml4N.html

24-08-2020||India||Sonia asks CWC to elect a new chief, Rahul questions timing of dissenters’ letter||The Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on Monday started as expected, with interim chief Sonia Gandhi asking the party’s highest decision-making body to begin the process of electing a new president, thereby relieving her of the duties. Party general secretary in-charge of the organisation KC Venugopal read Gandhi’s letter to CWC. The meeting came a day after a letter written to Sonia Gandhi purportedly by 23 leaders, including Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mukul Wasnik, Anand Sharma, Kapil Sibal, Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Prithviraj Chavan and Jitin Prasada, was leaked to the media. In the letter, the dissenters sought a complete overhaul of the organisation and the formation of a parliamentary board, and maintained that the Gandhis will always be an integral part of a “collective leadership”. Also Read: CWC meet: Leaked letter puts Congress seniors on back footAt Monday’s CWC meeting, Sonia Gandhi said that it had been a year since she was asked to lead the party till a new president was elected. The CWC had named her the party’s interim chief on August 10 last year after Rahul Gandhi turned down calls to withdraw the resignation he had given on May 25, taking moral responsibility for the party’s rout in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. “A year has lapsed now. In the party’s interest, I ask CWC to begin deliberations to put in place a process of transition to relieve me of my duties,” she said. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was the first speaker after Venugopal read Sonia Gandhi’s letter and urged her to continue on the post till a new president is elected. Former defence minister AK Antony said if Sonia Gandhi was unwilling, then Rahul Gandhi should take over. He said weakening the high command meant weakening the party. “How can my colleagues write such a letter? This is cruel and unfortunate,” added Antony. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his Chhattisgarh counterpart Bhupesh Baghel urged Rahul Gandhi to lead the party once again. Rahul Gandhi questioned the timing of the letter written by dissenters—the Congress president was ill and the party was fighting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. He was referring to the upcoming by-elections in Madhya Pradesh and the internal turmoil in the ruling Congress in Rajasthan where Sachin Pilot and 18 other legislators revolted against Gehlot. The rebellion ended after Pilot met Rahul Gandhi and the party formed a three-member committee to resolve issues raised by both the sides. Azad then spoke and explained the reasons behind the letter. He offered to resign if it was proved that he had been colluding with the BJP, as alleged by some of his party colleagues in tweets, letters and statements on Sunday after the contents of the letter and the names of those who had written it were reported by the media. There was some drama outside the CWC meeting as well. Media reports quoting Rahul Gandhi stated that those who had written the letter were colluding with the BJP, prompting a strong response from senior leader Kapil Sibal. “Rahul says ‘we are colluding with BJP’. Succeeded in Rajasthan High Court defending the Congress Party. Defending party in Manipur to bring down BJP government. Last 30 years have never made a statement in favour of BJP on any issue. Yet ‘we are colluding with the BJP’!” he tweeted. Reacting to this, the party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted saying Rahul Gandhi had said nothing to that effect. “Please don’t be mislead by false discourse or misinformation in the media. But yes, we all need to work together to fight the draconian Modi rule rather than fighting and hurting each other and the Congress,” he said. Soon after, Sibal withdrew his tweet and said Rahul Gandhi had informed him personally that he had never made such a remark. “Was informed by Rahul Gandhi personally that he never said what was attributed to him. I therefore withdraw my tweet,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-asks-cwc-to-elect-a-new-chief-rahul-questions-timing-of-dissenters-letter/story-XfsgGXE7vMMkr66hyfDRLN.html

24-08-2020||India||Amid Covid-19 pandemic, Mumbai witnesses quietest Ganesh Chaturthi in 17 years: Report||Processions in Mumbai during the first day of the Ganesh idol immersions for Ganeshotsav were quieter this year than the noise levels measured during the entire festival last year. This year’s noise levels on the first day of the celebration were much lesser when compared to the data recorded since 2003, anti-noise campaigners stated in a report.The highest levels of noise were recorded 100.7 decibels (dB), as loud as a motorcycle, from a procession at Worli Dairy in south Mumbai, non-government organisation Awaaz Foundation said in a report.Last year, the highest noise levels were recorded only during the last day (Anant Chaturdashi) at 121.3 dB. The highest noise level over the past 17 years was recorded during Ganeshotsav 2015 at 123.7 dB followed by 123.2 dB recorded in the year 2013.Also read: Recovered Covid-19 patients’ test results come positive for monthsOn Sunday, lowest noise levels were witnessed at Shivaji Park in Dadar at 53.1 dB from a collection point and an artificial immersion site. At all remaining areas, ambient noise (traffic but no loudspeakers or noisy instruments) contributed to the noise level and ranged between 65.3 dB and 77.2 dB.According to the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, residential areas should have a maximum noise level of 55 decibels (dB) in the day and 45dB during night.How loud is too loud?Noise levels up to 70dB are acceptable to the human ear.Continuous exposure to decibel levels higher than 70dB can lead to hearing loss. Continuous exposure to noise in the range of 100dB-110dB can result in sensorineural hearing loss, which usually occurs suddenly. If detected at an early stage, the damage is reversible. (Source: WHO)“Ganesh Chaturthi this year was the quietest ever recorded since 2003. There were no crowds in most places and almost no loudspeakers or other noisy instruments. More artificial immersion spots and policies for online celebrations helped reduce the din,” said Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation. She added that that the Covid-19 pandemic and associated impacts played a major role in ensuring smaller and less noisy processions.“Although we need to understand how sustainable will this dramatic change in noise levels this year be in a post Covid world,” she added.On Sunday, the city saw a total of 40,823 idol immersions - 39,845 households and 978 Sarvajanik (public) - of which 22,859 idols were immersed across artificial immersion sites - 22,149 households and 710 Sarvajanik, respectively.Also read: Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray asks people to be careful during festivals“This year, the administration was more careful while people were cautious about the ongoing pandemic and decided to avoid crowds. At the same time, alternative sources through artificial immersion spots helped avoid large groups near natural immersion sites such as Girgaum Chowpatty, Shivaji Park, Juhu beach etc. We will ensure this trend continues throughout remaining immersion days,” said Narendra Barde, joint municipal commissioner (zone II), Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). A senior official from the Mumbai police said, “We have strictly implemented noise abatement measures this. The use of disc jockey sets and loudspeakers is prohibited. Wherever large crowds have the possibility of gathering, more police personnel are being deployed there and social distance is being maintained.”The Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Samanvay Samiti (BSGSS), the umbrella body of Ganesh mandals, said they have directed all mandals in the city not to violate noise rules. “The city is celebrating a simple festival this year. The noise is minimal only from aartis (ceremonies during prayers). There are directives from the police and the Bombay High Court. We will see what happened at Worli since majority of idols immersed were household and not under our control,” said Naresh Dahibhavkar, president, BSGSS.Abdulali added, “It is heartening to know that the Ganpati mandals voluntarily cooperated not only to safeguard public health and the environment but to undertake important social causes in the crisis of pandemic that we currently face.”Noise pollution is an unrecognised crisis where unwanted or excessive sound can have deleterious effects on human health.According to Dr Samir Bhargava, ENT surgeon at DrRN Cooper Medical General Hospital, Vile Parle, if noise levels are high at night, the main impact is on the mind more than our hearing abilities. “The stress will lead to blood pressure issues, irritability, and headaches. Depending on the duration of the exposure, the level of 102 dB as average noise levels is extremely dangerous for citizens, especially for children and senior citizens,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-pandemic-mumbai-witnesses-quietest-ganesh-chaturthi-in-17-years-report/story-8cb3eG9Jlp3Zhtci6aL4yJ.html
24-08-2020||India||CWC meet: Sibal backtracks after reacting to ‘colluding with BJP’ remark||New Delhi: Amid the fireworks in the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on Monday, a friction between the veterans and Team Rahul Gandhi played out publicly on Twitter for a few minutes , when party’s communication chief Randeep Singh Surjewala rejected former Union minister Kapil Sibal’s allegations that Rahul accused some senior leaders of colluding with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during the crucial meeting.Also read: LIVE Updates of CWC meeting here“Rahul Gandhi hasn’t said a word of this nature nor alluded to it. Please don’t be misled by false media discourse or misinformation being spread,” Surjewala replied to Sibal on Twitter even when the meeting of the party’s highest decision-making body was still in progress. Sibal, one of the top legal brains of the Congress, had mentioned earlier in the day that Gandhi reportedly alleged in the meeting that seniors are colluding with the BJP. No such allegation or even indication was made by Rahul in the meeting, party leaders said. Sibal, too, withdrew his statement quickly. “Was informed by Rahul Gandhi personally that he never said what was attributed to him. I, therefore, withdraw my tweet,” he tweeted as a rejoinder to his earlier angry outburst. In his previous tweet, Sibal, who is not a member of the CWC, possibly got carried away by the reports appearing on social media, listed his acts of loyalty to underline that in his 30 years’ association with the Congress, he had never made any statement in favour of the BJP on any issue. He pointed out how he “succeeded in Rajasthan high court defending the Congress party”, and he is “defending the party in Manipur to bring down BJP government”. Sources said that Rahul took the initiative to defuse the situation and it was clarified to Sibal that no such accusations against the leaders who wrote the letter was made by the former Congress president. In his tweet to Sibal, Surjewala also called upon the lawyer-turned-politician to stand united in the fight against the BJP. “... yes, we all need to work together in fighting the draconian (Narendra) Modi rule rather than hurting each other and the Congress,” Surjewala said. Later, Manickam Tagore, who represents Tamil Nadu’s Sivaganga constituency in the Lok Sabha, also responded to Sibal’s outburst and tweeted, “Kapil Sibal ji we all have great respect for you. @INCIndia made you Cabinet minister and gives a lot of importance. you are NOT inside the CWC. You are reacting to a leak that is false. It does not reflect well on a leader as senior as you are, to react to hearsay!”Kapil Sibal ji We all have great respect for you. @INCIndia made you cabinet minister and gives lot of importance. you are NOT inside the CWC. You are reacting to a leak that is false. It does not reflect well on a leader as senior as you are, to react to hearsay!pl #CwcMeeting https://t.co/etyVpflQQzThe leaked letter seeking major changes in the functioning of the party sparked a raging debate in the CWC. At the meeting, Rahul had questioned the timing of the letter and pointed out that it was sent when the party was facing crisis in Rajasthan and more importantly since his mother was unwell. A leader said the party high command is livid about the leaked letter and has even identified the possible brains behind the move. At the beginning of the meeting, general secretary K C Venugopal, the in-charge of the organisation, also lashed out at the dissenters, who had written the letter. His opening gambit in the meeting was a pointed question: “Why was the letter leaked?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cwc-meet-sibal-backtracks-after-reacting-to-colluding-with-bjp-remark/story-3zUdxyWg2KDYTreReu8BLM.html

This is his payback time to the district after working for a vernacular newspaper for decades.On the occasion of the 74th Independence Day on August 15, he started a campaign called “Bastar Abhar” in Bilori village. The idea was to encourage the villagers to plant saplings in the name of each family member registered in the ration card.“I have started this campaign from village Bilori and more than 1,200 saplings have been planted so far. My aim is to cover each and every village of Bastar district in the next one year,” Kashyap said.The total population of Bilori gram panchayat is 2,561 and ration cardholders are 683. While the district’s total population is 8,34,375, around 6,98,864 of them are still living in villages.Also read: Chhattisgarh CM writes to centre, seeks funds for bridges“I have been flooded with calls following the success of the campaign at Bilori village. They have been calling me to start the campaign in their villages. I am calling this campaign Bastar Abhar. The state government is offering several benefits to those who live in rural areas. Planting a sapling is acknowledging doing our bit for the environment and society. The concept is to make the Bastar district and villagers realise that trees are life,” said Kashyap, who is also a member of Chhattisgarh Wildlife Board.Bastar Abhar has received an overwhelming response from people belonging to all walks of life. Help is at hand for Kashyap - from sarpanchs to state forest officials.“I have never seen villagers so motivated towards planting saplings. Everyone is planting a sapling and also taking a pledge to protect it,” said Umman Baghel, a sarpanch of Bilori village.Kashyap has done his preliminary homework of mapping the district’s demographic profile.“Our district has 414 ration shops, of which 366 are located in rural areas. A total of 1,63,868 people have ration cards. If they plant fruit-bearing saplings in their villages, the initiative will not only increase their income but will also make our district greener,” he saidBastar’s forest cover has consistently decreased because of persistent felling of trees through the years.“The state government is giving pattas (rights) on forest land due to which logging is rampant in tribal-dominated districts. The government does engage in afforestation drives but those are few and far between as compared to logging activities. Besides, they rarely plant fruit-bearing saplings,” said the former journalist.Somaru, a resident of Bastar district, said that the Bastar Abhar campaign would empower the tribals in the district.“The initiative will give us additional income, as most of the saplings being planted belong to the fruit-bearing category. Also, our dependence on the jungle for fruits will come down,” said Baghel.Shahid Khan, chief conservator of forests (CCF), Chhattisgarh, said the forest department is supporting the Abhar campaign.“Awareness will be created among the public in a bid to ensure that every ration card holder plants a sapling in his village and also takes responsibility to protect it. It is a commendable initiative and the demand for saplings will be met from the nursery run under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, (MGNREGA), 2005. The district can become green if Bastar Abhar succeeds,” said Khan.Indrajit, chief executive officer (CEO), Zila Panchayat, said Bastar Abhar would be launched at every gram panchayat of the district.“Bastar Abhar will help villagers to develop an emotional relationship with trees that will make the district greener. We will provide all support to the campaign,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bastar-abhar-former-journalist-s-mission-to-make-district-greener/story-AKVTt9h4T5gKPBe5jB8YiO.html

24-08-2020||India||CWC meet: Leaked letter puts Congress seniors on back foot||A leaked letter seeking major changes in the Congress functioning has turned counterproductive and even offset the temporary upper hand a group of veterans gained after Sonia Gandhi’s meeting with the Rajya Sabha leaders earlier this month. At the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on Monday, party leader Rahul Gandhi questioned the timing of the letter and pointed out that it was sent when the party was facing crisis in Rajasthan and more importantly, Sonia Gandhi was unwell. Also read: At CWC meeting, Congress leaders ask Sonia Gandhi to continue as party chief, criticise letterAccording to a top strategist of the Congress, the party high command is livid about the leak of the letter and has even identified the possible brains behind the move. At the beginning of the CWC meeting, general secretary K C Venugopal, in charge of the organisation, also lashed out at the leaders who wrote the letter. Speaking first in the meeting, he said, “Why was the letter leaked?” Congress president Sonia Gandhi had cited the letter in the meeting while she asked the CWC to start the process of appointing a new party president and made it clear she will no longer stay as the interim party chief. The group of veterans, now under attack had a clear upper-hand just two weeks ago when they emerged as team UPA, got united under the pretext of safeguarding former Manmohan Singh’s legacy after Congress MP Rajiv Satav called for an introspection into the second UPA era. Key ‘Team UPA’ leaders had closed ranks on Saturday and turned the ‘junior versus senior’ fight as an attempt by Rahul Gandhi aides — who felt UPA was responsible for Congress’ falling fortunes — to undermine the legacy of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. UPA ministers Shashi Tharoor, Anand Sharma, Milind Deora, Manish Tewari (among the 23 signatories of the letter to Sonia Gandhi) were vocal on Twitter. UPA minister Anand Sharma — another signatory of the letter — wrote 11 tweets to remind that “honest introspection” is always helpful and “Congressmen must be proud of UPA’s legacy.” They tried to label the young brigade as critics of Manmohan Singh’s legacy to corner some Team Rahul members. While Sharma cautioned young leaders “No party disowns or discredits it’s legacy. Nobody expects the BJP to be charitable and give us credit but our own should respect and not forget,” Deora invoked Manmohan Singh’s words— history will be kinder to me — to say, “Could he have ever imagined that some from his own party would dismiss his years of service to the nation & seek to destroy his legacy - that, too, in his presence.” Tewari, who had lashed out at Congres MP Rajiv Satav on Friday, continued his attacks. “BJP was out of power for 10 years. Not once did they ever blame Vajpayee or his government for their then predicaments.

The tweets represent his bona fide belief and retracting his statements would be an insincere apology, Bhushan said in a statement submitted before the Supreme Court on Monday.“An apology has to be sincerely made. If I retract a statement that I otherwise believe to be true or offer an insincere apology that in my eyes would amount to contempt of my conscience and of an institution (Supreme Court) that I hold in highest esteem,” the statement said. On August 20, the Supreme Court had asked Bhushan to reconsider his stance and offer an apology by Monday (August 24) while hearing on the sentence to be awarded to him. Earlier, on August 14, the court had ruled that Bhushan was guilty of contempt of court and kept the matter for deciding on punishment for August 20. Also read: ‘History will judge the court’ - Kapil Sibal on Prashant Bhushan contempt caseOn August 20, Bhushan issued a statement in which he chose to stick to his tweets. He had posted two tweets, one against the Supreme Court on June 27 and another against CJI Bobde on June 29.Bhushan’s first tweet read, “When historians in the future look back at the last six years to see how democracy has been destroyed in India even without a formal Emergency, they will particularly mark the role of the SC in this destruction, and more particularly the role of the last four CJIs.”The second referred to CJI Bobde and said, “The CJI rides a Rs 50-lakh motorcycle belonging to a BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader at Raj Bhavan, Nagpur, without wearing a mask or helmet, at a time when he keeps the SC on lockdown mode denying citizens their fundamental right to access justice!”Attorney General KK Venugopal, on August 20, asked the court not to punish Bhushan. The court is now expected to pronounce its order in the coming days on the sentence to be imposed on Bhushan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prashant-bhushan-declines-to-apologise-over-his-tweets-says-an-insincere-apology-would-amount-to-contempt-of-my-conscience/story-L4BU5rSEmxDmGWLR9SEupK.html
24-08-2020||India||BJP won’t project any CM face in Bengal for 2021 polls: Kailash Vijayvargiya||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will not project anyone as its chief ministerial candidate in West Bengal for the crucial 2021 assembly polls, Kailash Vijayvargiya, the party’s national general secretary overseeing the state unit said in Kolkata late Sunday night. “The achievements of the Narendra Modi government will be our face and it will ensure our victory. After the polls, elected BJP lawmakers can select their leader,” said Vijayvargiya who is in the city to attend a series of meetings where strengths and weaknesses of district units in south Bengal are being evaluated. A silent campaign over the BJP’s ‘prospective chief ministerial face’ for the 2021 election had become a thorn in the flesh for the leadership, a number of BJP leaders told HT. “We strongly suspect that the campaign was started by a section of party leaders pursuing personal agenda. It became the subject of widespread gossip and speculative news items, helping the TMC to project our Bengal unit as a divided house. All this will end with Vijayvargiya’s announcement,” said a senior BJP leader, requesting anonymity.Also read: Speculations rife on role allotment in Bengal BJP after meetings in Delhi, Kolkata Quoting unnamed “BJP sources,” numerous news portals, social media pages and vernacular dailies have named a prominent sports personality, a BJP Rajya Sabha member, a Union minister, a member of a Right-wing think tank group and, last but not the least, a monk from the Ramakrishna Mission as the possible chief ministerial candidate against Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee. While the monk dismissed the rumour, the others avoided running into any debate. Significantly, the salient point of all these posts and news reports was an attempt to argue that the BJP needed to project an “erudite Bengali” as the next chief minister since state president Dilip Ghosh, despite being the most popular among opposition leaders in Bengal, invites criticism with his controversial comments. This, BJP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders told HT, was the outcome of personal aspirations of a handful of leaders. Ghosh was an RSS pracharak from 1984 till he joined the Bengal BJP in 2014. Under his leadership, the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019, which is a record. “Maybe he is a bit rustic but Ghosh has become a darling of the crowds. This might have made some people frustrated and insecure,” said a Bengal BJP leader who handled campaigns in 2019. “The timing of these so-called news reports and social media posts, which were clearly planted, is significant. The party has to restructure the central organisation, a process delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Also, the Union cabinet may undergo some reshuffle,” said a senior leader aware of the developments. Not willing to comment on internal differences, Bengal BJP vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said, “I can only talk about two facts. The Bengal BJP fought unitedly in 2019 under the leadership of Ghosh and created a situation where the TMC looked vulnerable. Secondly, the central leadership re-elected Ghosh as state president for the second term and made it clear that he will lead the battle in 2021.” The Assam unit of the ruling BJP on Sunday also rubbished veteran Congress leader Tarun Gogoi’s claim that the former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi could be the BJP’s chief ministerial candidate for the 2021 assembly polls. It said the party will have no chief ministerial face.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-won-t-project-any-cm-face-in-bengal-for-2021-polls-kailash-vijayvargiya/story-X61PjON95O908WPmIkfvZI.html

The former Congress president said that the letter was sent to the party chief at a time when she had not been keeping well. He also said the letter came at a time when the “party is fighting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Madhya and Rajasthan.”In the letter, former chief ministers, members of the party’s highest decision-making body and sitting members of Parliament, had suggested far-reaching changes including dissolution of powers to state units and revamping the highest decision-making body.One of the 23 Congress leaders had even sought dissolution of powers to state units and revamping the CWC even as another of the group as come out in support of current party president Sonia Gandhi.Sonia Gandhi said during the meeting that she was not willing to continue as interim chief even as several leaders urged her to stay on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-ghulam-nabi-azad-offers-explanation-over-letter-offers-to-resign/story-ZRqWmBHz6iBpFI7Dn8gH9N.html

Reports quoted Rahul Gandhi as saying at the CWC that this was done in collusion with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).As soon as the reports surfaced, those who had raised the issues in the Congress - many of them senior party leaders - reacted in disbelief. One of them, Kapil Sibal, said he has never made a statement in favour of the BJP in the last 30 years. He also said that they have defended the party in many crises. Another senior leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, also part of the group, offered to quit.Congress soon got into damage control mode, with party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala clarifying that the reported remarks attributed to Rahul Gandhi are untrue.After the clarification, Sibal said he is withdrawing his tweet.The meeting of the CWC, Congress’ highest decision-making body, has been called after a group of 23 leaders wrote a letter to Sonia Gandhi earlier this month seeking an overhaul of the organisation.Apart from Azad and Sibal, 21 other leaders were part of the group that wrote the letter on overhauling the Congress. AK Antony and other leaders who want Sonia Gandhi to continue called the letter unfortunate and cruel.Sonia Gandhi, meanwhile, remained adamant on quitting as Congress president. In her opening remarks at the meeting, Gandhi made the offer to quit saying she had given a detailed reply on the issue to AICC general secretary K C Venugopal.She also handed over a detailed reply to Venugopal, who read out its contents.“A year has lapsed now. In the interest of the party, I ask CWC to begin deliberations to put in a place of process of transition to relieve me from my duties,” she said at the meeting.The crucial meeting of the CWC started in New Delhi amid divisions in the party over the leadership issue.The party is divided on the leadership matter with a section demanding collective leadership and another reposing faith in the Gandhi family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cwc-meeting-kapil-sibal-objects-to-rahul-gandhi-s-collusion-with-bjp-remark-sonia-gandhi-adamant-on-quitting/story-LZwIvwryAPKweeZooo38CO.html

KS Chauhan, nodal officer of Uttarakhand Film Development Council (UFDC) said that these shoots include songs, films, short movies and videos. “The demand to conduct shoots in Uttarakhand has been high as producers are not able to travel to foreign countries and the state provides picturesque locations similar to foreign locations. Since the process of Unlock started at the end of June, we received requests for 33 shooting projects, all of which were approved. The work continued with officials ensuring that social distancing and all other norms are strictly followed,” said Chauhan.Also read: The future of travel - Slow, meaningful and closer to home The official said the feedback received from the film community revealed that the documentation and the approval process in Uttarakhand is easier as compared to Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, which is why the demand is high. Chauhan further informed that at present, a production team is conducting a recce in the state for Shahid Kapoor’s upcoming film ‘Jersey’. The approval for the project will be given soon after the locations are finalised. In a bid to welcome film producers and shooting units to the state, the Uttarakhand government, on June 20, issued standard operating procedures (SOP) for film shooting with a focus on physical and social distancing, regular thermal scanning and frequent sanitisation. The district administrations had been directed to ensure that film shooting activities are closely monitored and in case of any violation, the concerned sections of Disaster Management Act, 2005, the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and the Indian Penal Code (IPC) are enforced. Also read: 3 buried under debris while clearing landslide site in Uttarakhand, 1 body recoveredProduction houses had been asked to ensure thermal screening of all crew members or staff on a daily basis, and use of a non-contact thermometer or fever guns. Film shooting will not be allowed in containment zones and the head of the film shooting unit or audio-visual sector must ensure that no member of the team or crew belong to the Covid-19 containment zone of the district. Indoor shoots will have a maximum capacity of 15 people while outdoor shoots will have a maximum of 30 people. Last month, the guidelines were revised and the maximum capacity for indoor shoots was increased to 50 persons with a strict enforcement of social distancing guidelines. However, there are no restrictions on the number of persons for an outdoor film shoot, subject to following all norms of physical distancing and safety norms issued by the state and Central government. On Sunday, information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar said that production of films and television programmes can resume with all essential health protocols in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). After a consultation with the home ministry and the health ministry, a standard operating procedure (SOP) has been firmed up for the production of films and television programmes, including adherence to social distancing, respiratory etiquette and use of face masks, Javadekar said in an announcement cheered by the entertainment industry based in Mumbai. According to the SOP, actors facing the camera will be exempt from wearing masks. All remaining crew members will have to adhere to the guidelines of the health ministry. In some cases, people aged over 60 years - considered a high-risk group - are not allowed on the sets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shoots-of-over-30-films-songs-get-completed-in-uttarakhand-as-state-govt-eases-norms/story-kcrsEz6aWjJOioQ8DFerUI.html

Shyam Singh, superintendent of police of Birbhum district and his team on Sunday went door to door on bicycles wearing kurta and pyjama (just like the students) and talked to residents. Most people told the SP that they do not want walls being constructed by the vice-chancellor as it goes against the spirit with which Rabindranath Tagore built the institution. “People now have to take a detour just because walls have come up in Shantiniketan. Senior citizens are facing problems as they have to walk a longer distance. The path which could have been covered just by one minute’s walk is now taking more than 10 minutes,” said Urmila Ganguly, a senior citizen. Last Monday even chief minister Mamata Banerjee was visibly irritated with the boundary wall at Visva Bharati. The chief minister had said that she doesn’t want any construction that destroys the beauty of Visva Bharati. “When Rabindranath Tagore built Visva Bharati he wanted students to be in the heart of nature and study in the open. He did not want wood and cement structures,” Banerjee had said. While speaking to the police team, Tagore’s great grandson Supriyo Thakur also expressed his displeasure and disapproved of the idea of building walls. “It is a welcome move that the district administration has come to discuss with the senior citizens but the idea of building walls is not acceptable,” he said. On August 17, a large crowd of local people led by some Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders, demolished two gates of the campus of Visva Bharati and vandalised construction material stocked by the authorities to build a wall around the ground where an annual fair is held. The university authorities have already demanded a CBI probe into the incident and also requested the Centre to deploy central paramilitary forces for security at the campus. “In an administrative meeting held by the chief minister several persons had expressed their displeasure with the walls that have been built at Visva Bharati. We went to seek the opinion of some senior residents on a Sunday morning,” said a senior police officer who was in the team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-start-survey-at-visva-bharati-in-bengal-to-seek-opinions-of-senior-residents/story-bCErETO4vOZ7Vh6hfX2fDL.html

If the exams are conducted as scheduled, it would put students’ lives at risk, said the CM in a tweet.“In our last video conference with PM Modi, I had been vocal against the UGC guidelines mandating completion of terminal examinations in Universities/Colleges by the end of September 2020, which had a huge potential to put student lives at risk,” Mamata Banerjee tweeted.“With the Education Ministry’s directive to conduct NEET, JEE 2020 in Sept, I would again appeal to Centre to assess risk and postpone these exams until the situation is conducive again.

In the interest of the party, I ask CWC to begin deliberations to put in a place of the process of transition to relieve me from my duties,” Gandhi said.Party leader AK Antony maintained that if Sonia Gandhi was unwilling to continue as the party president, Rahul Gandhi must take over.Follow the latest updates on the CWC meeting here:The meeting was called after 23 party leaders wrote a letter to interim party chief Sonia Gandhi seeking an overhaul of the organisation. Kapil Sibal, Shashi Tharoor, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Prithviraj Chavan, Vivek Tankha and Anand Sharma were among the leaders who wrote the letter to Gandhi.ALSO WATCH | Explained: What started dissent in Congress? Several leaders including Venugopal, Antony and Rahul Gandhi criticised the letter by the 23 leaders.Rahul Gandhi questioned the timing of the letter sent to the party chief at a time when she was unwell. He condemned the letter for being written at a time when the “party is fighting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.”“Weakening the high command is weakening the party. How can my colleagues write such a letter,” Antony told party members while Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh said he was hurt by the letter.Ghulam Nabi Azad, part of the group that wrote the letter on Congress’ overhaul, praised Sonia Gandhi and offered to quit saying if he was “in any manner doing this to help the BJP or doing it at its behest.”Azad’s statement was contested by Priyanka Gandhi who said: “What you are saying is the opposite of what you have written in the letter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-asks-cwc-to-relieve-her-as-interim-party-chief-manmohan-singh-requests-her-to-continue/story-xhazprK2I3b5L3udA2OFLO.html
24-08-2020||India||Militants claim killing panchayat member in Kashmir who went missing last week||Militants in an audio message claimed to have killed a panchayat member from South Kashmir’s Khanmoh village who has been missing since August 9, police said.Panchayat member Nisar Ahmad Bhat went missing from Shopian and police have been trying to trace him.A senior police officer said that according to family members, Bhat went to Shopian on Wednesday. “Since then he has been missing. He (panch) was booked under PSA in 1995. There are 12 FIR against him and efforts are on to trace him.” The officer, however, said the audio clip seems fake. “We are investigating every aspect of this case.”In a 2.56 minute long message purportedly released by militants, they claimed that Bhat has been killed and buried at an unidentified place. An unidentified person is heard saying that the panchayat member was involved in “anti movement” activities” and had met his fate. “We have been after him for a long time and finally got him.”The message claimed that the body wasn’t handed over to his family because of Covid-19.“We understand the pain of the family. To avoid the spread of Covid-19, the body wasn’t given to his family. The same way, Indian forces after killing our comrades bury them at unmarked graves at unidentified locations,” the message said.Earlier on August 2, Shakir Manzoor, who was working with 162 Territorial Army battalion in south Kashmir was abducted from Kulgam district and his burnt vehicle was found later. Soon after the abduction, police and army had launched a search operation in Shopian and Kulgam areas. However, the jawan could not be traced. A similar message was released which claimed that Manzoor was killed and buried at an undisclosed location. In the last two months five BJP leaders including two sarpanches have been killed in different parts of Kashmir. Earlier in July, Congress sarpanch Ajay Pandita was killed in Anantnag district which forced many panchayat members to resign from their parties.The government also shifted dozens of panchayat members and BDC members, majority of them from the BJP, to safer places after an evaluation of threats from militants.Soon after taking charge, Jammu and Kashmir’s new Lt Governor Manoj Sinha had said adequate security would be provided to panchayat members and political workers in Kashmir. Sinha was speaking at a function in Srinagar in which a large number of panchayat workers participated and demanded security in the backdrop of attacks on BJP workers in different parts of the Valley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/militants-claim-killing-panchayat-member-in-kashmir-who-went-missing-last-week/story-x9a0174WYHiX9hUTNInuRM.html

The daily testing figure was around 200,000 less than that of the previous day. Also read: Ludhiana residents struggle to give Covid samplesSunday’s was the lowest test count since August 10, when 477,027 tests were conducted. On Saturday, 801,147 tests were conducted across 1,515 Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-approved laboratories in the country. Last Friday, India had achieved a milestone, when it had conducted a million tests. On average, the country has been conducting 850,000 tests per day over the past week. On August 1, 5,25,689 tests were conducted; on August 6 (6, 664,949); and on August 16 (746,608). ICMR officials said during weekends the number of swab samples that arrive for testing is usually lower, but the rising average daily tests in the past three weeks are a pointer towards the progress being made in aggressive Covid-19 testing mechanism across the country. “On weekends, the number of tests usually goes down a bit. There could be several reasons, including fewer swab samples being collected and reduced work shifts of laboratory technicians. This is more an aberration than a norm. It doesn’t mean that the country’s testing capacity has reduced. The daily testing count is only going to increase from here on,” said an ICMR official requesting anonymity. India, which had conducted its first Covid-19 test on January 23 at ICMR’s National Institute of Virology in Pune, has conducted 3,590,213 tests to date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-performs-6-lakh-covid-tests-on-sunday-lowest-in-2-weeks/story-tKGfJ4USP9pGZmhIT8YgfN.html
24-08-2020||India||Lockdown comes as a blessing in disguise for Uttar Pradesh’s small tarai farmers||Kuldeep Singh, a farmer in Uttar Pradesh’s Tilhar area of Shahjahanpur, faced many troubles ranging from a shortage of labour to transportation of fertilizer during the Covid-19-induced lockdown. But the 52-year old now feels that the lockdown had been like a blessing in disguise for farmers with small land holdings in the tarai belt. That’s because lockdown restrictions reduced the cultivation of Saatha rice, mainly carried out by well-off farmers to increase their profits. Though more than 70 percent of farmers grow this type of rice to make extra profit, locals said farmers with smaller land holdings suffered the consequences as the farming of this water-intensive crop would make groundwater levels dip sharply, making things difficult for small and marginal farmers.Also read: UP Board moots drop boxes for to provide kids without e-wherewithal with study materialThis year, however, Singh didn’t face any problem in irrigating his crops during summers as the water levels hadn’t depleted as much. Groundwater shortage is caused by many factors but Saatha rice cultivation contributes to it in a big way, said locals. “Saatha rice variety that is grown here is sown in April and harvested in June. Farmers depend only on groundwater for irrigation of this variety of crop which severely impacts the underground water level,” explained Navjot Singh, a farmer from Tilhar who has been demanding a ban on Saatha rice farming. “Only farmers with big farms can afford to pump out underground water, those with smaller land holdings can’t,” Navjot added.Covid-19 lockdown, however, changed things on the ground.“Lockdown meant restrictions and only 10 percent of farmers could cultivate Saatha rice. The rest planted vegetables or other crops that do not require much water. This has helped replenish the underground water level in the region,” said Singh. Recent underground water level survey reports by the district administration confirm the same.“In the past few years, the water levels in 85 percent blocks where Saatha is grown used to drop below 150 ft during the cultivation period. This time, such a drop has been limited to only 28 percent of theses blocks,” said Praveen Singh, the local irrigation officer.“This year, the markedly lower level of dip in underground water levels indicates that farmers are moving away from crops that need large amounts of water. The district administration will continue to support such moves. We plan to organise awareness campaign in the region to tell people about the harms of growing water-intensive crops and suggest alternatives too,” said Jagannath Prasad Tripathi, district magistrate of Shahjahanpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-comes-as-a-blessing-in-disguise-for-uttar-pradesh-s-small-tarai-farmers/story-nydRgedS0VRnwrr2WBv7TP.html
24-08-2020||India||A look at how Congress faced a similar leadership crisis in 1998-99||Many Congress leaders are reminiscing the 1998-99 timeline, when the party saw its last major revolt and questions were raised over the leadership on the lines of the ongoing kerfuffle. Also read: CWC meet: Possible scenariosSonia Gandhi had repeatedly turned down appeals to join the Congress – following the assassination of her husband and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on May 21, 1991 – until 1997, when she agreed to enter politics and became a primary member of the party at its Kolkata plenary. Prior to Gandhi’s political plunge, the former PM PV Narsimha Rao and Sitaram Kesari had led the Congress and also faced internal revolt that had cut short their reign at the trop. While Rao had to step down in 1996, Kesari was removed in a hurriedly-called meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the apex executive body, which will meet on Monday to tackle the current leadership crisis. Kesari was blamed for the party’s lack of preparedness for the mid-term elections in 1998 and his style of decision-making had ruffled the feathers of several leaders, including R Kumaramangalam and Aslam Sher Khan, who had quit the Congress in protest. On March 14, 1998, Gandhi was elected as the Congress president. The biggest challenge for her was to rejuvenate and unite the faction-ridden party. But over a year later on May 15, 1999, and just before the Lok Sabha elections, three leaders --- Sharad Pawar, PA Sangma and Tariq Anwar -- revolted against her, challenging her projection as the party’s prime ministerial candidate, ostensibly on the grounds of her foreign origin. Soon, she resigned from the post. In her resignation letter to the CWC, Gandhi had written: “Although born in a foreign land, I chose India as my country and would remain an Indian till my last breath. India is my motherland, dearer to me than my own life.” The move prompted a resignation spree from several party leaders and also the then Congress chief ministers such as Digvijaya Singh (Madhya Pradesh), Sheila Dikshit (Delhi), Ashok Gehlot (Rajasthan) and Giridhar Gamang (Odisha). Hundreds of party workers had gone on hunger-strike and a nationwide agitation was launched to request her to take back the resignation. Finally, Gandhi relented and agreed to withdraw her resignation only after the party expelled Pawar, Sangma and Anwar for six years on May 20, 1999. She informed the party leaders of her decision on May 24, 1999. The next day, a special session of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) was convened to welcome her back as the party chief. The grand old party appears to have come full circle in its 134-year-old history. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-congress-faced-leadership-crisis-in-1998-99/story-h2Lf0X6az80xQGPgvBe1BN.html

Also read: ‘Not just my father, he was India’s son too,’ says Sonali Jaitley“On this day, last year, we lost Shri Arun Jaitleyji. I miss my friend a lot. Arunji served India diligently. His wit, intellect, legal acumen and warm personality were legendary,” PM Modi paid glowing tribute to the veteran Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader on social media. The PM was away on a state visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on this day last year, when Jaitley had breathed his last after a prolonged illness. The PM also shared a link of what he had said at the former Union minister’s prayer meeting last year. The ruling BJP’s official social media handle posted a short video on the former finance minister and one of the tallest leaders of the party. “He left us early but he also left behind indelible imprints on the Indian economy, law, governance and probity in public life. His impeccable life will serve as guiding path for the talented future generations,” the party said. Union Minister for Home Affairs Amit Shah remembered Jaitley as “an outstanding politician, prolific orator and a great human being who had no parallels in Indian polity” and described him as “multifaceted and a friend of friends, who will always be remembered for his towering legacy, transformative vision and devotion to nation”. Union Minister for Defence Rajnath Singh tweeted, “Jaitleyji was a stalwart who made a big contribution towards the BJP’s growth and rise to power. He made a mark as a successful lawyer, seasoned parliamentarian and effective administrator. I offer my heartfelt tributes to him.” Jaitley’s doting daughter Sonali Jaitley-Bakshi, who wrote a poignant article on his father for HT, posted a picture of her early childhood. She tweeted, “Today marks one year without my father. Do I miss him? Yes. Do I miss his presence? Never, for he is always with me. I love you, dad --- thanks for everything.” His son, Rohan, too shared old photographs and tweeted, “It’s been a year since you left us, dad @arunjaitley. In many ways, it feels like it was just yesterday. The pain is still as fresh. But so is my resolve to live by your values, principles and vision. You are always with us. So missed, so loved.” Jaitley (66) was admitted to New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on August 9 after he had complained of uneasiness. He died of multiple organ failure on August 24, 2019. Jaitley had opted out of the central government, citing his poor health condition, when the second National Democratic Alliance (NDA) dispensation, headed by PM Modi, took oath on May 30, 2019. Kirren Rijiju, Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs & Sports (Independent Charge) and Minister of State for Minority Affairs and a Member of Parliament (MP) from Arunachal Pradesh, said Jaitley was an “exceptional orator with gifted personality”. Jaitley’s friend Swapan Dasgupta, a Presidential nominee to the Rajya Sabha, tweeted: “We miss his erudition, his sharp analysis and his amazing powers of persuasion. I miss his wicked humour, his irreverence and his loyal friendship.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tributes-pour-in-on-jaitley-s-first-death-anniv/story-bf937WmCHynbjYPrK3975O.html

The number of Covid-19 cases in India crossed three million on August 22. Last week, 397,277 Covid-19 cases, including more than 5,700 deaths, were added to the country’s infection tally.There were 710,771 active Covid-19 cases, the health ministry’s dashboard showed at 8am. With 57,469 patients discharged between Sunday and Monday morning, the number of recoveries has reached 2,338,036 and recovery rate at 75.26%, data showed.The health ministry said the gap between recoveries and active cases continued to widen, with the number of patients recovering currently more than three times the active cases. The widening gap has led to active Covid-19 cases becoming about 23.24% of the total positive case reported in the country so far. India had reported its first Covid-19 case on January 30.“This is because of effective implementation of Centre led policies ensuring efficient clinical management in hospital settings for critical patients, and supervised Home Isolation for moderate and mild ones,” the health ministry tweeted on Monday morning.“The constantly increasing recoveries have ensured that the actual caseload of the country viz. the active cases, has reduced and currently comprises only 23.24% of the total positive cases. This has also resulted in a gradually falling mortality rate.”According to the health ministry’s data, India has witnessed 57,542 people succumbing to the viral disease to date. It has said that India’s Case Fatality Rate (CFR) at 1.86% is one of the lowest globally. The ministry has been attributing this to the comprehensive and sustained effectiveness of the Centre’s policy of “TESTING aggressively, TRACKING comprehensively & TREATING efficiently”.“Higher number of recoveries and declining mortality rate among COVID patients have shown that India’s graded and pro-active strategies are delivering results on the field,” it has said.According to Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus tracker, the global tally stands at 23,358,598 with 807,830 fatalities. The US leads the tally with 5,701,938 Covid-19 cases, followed by Brazil with 3,605,783.

The prototype can bring much-needed relief for those who need it the most amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Deepak Pathania, an industrial designer based in South Goa, has designed a unique, ‘Multi-Mask’ for complete protection from Covid-19 which he said will be a ‘one-stop’ for future mask requirements.The face shield fits onto the mask and stays in place attached to it which is strapped onto the face. This makes it possible for the user to simply slip it on or take it off if the face shield is not required.Also read: US announces emergency authorization of plasma treatment against Covid-19“The face-shield could simply be slipped on to the mask when required without any straps. The user’s speech was not muffled as it only flows through the filter, bypassing the face shield. All parts of the mask could be washed easily and hence minimised bio-waste. The mask could also be customised later with fittings like electronic filter, audio/video recording etc making it future-ready,” Pathania said.Pathania is collaborating with a Pune-based design company to help with the final design, tooling and production process.Pathania, who honed his skills at the National Institute of Design, has already applied for a patent for this device after checking if a similar mask has been devised anywhere in the world.His newly set-up company, Med Interventions and Beyond Pvt Ltd, is currently at the incubation stage at the Centre for Incubation and Business Acceleration, Goa (CIBA).“The idea was to make the product compete with the best in the world. Crowdfunding platforms have a category for products in the “prototype stage” and it is important to spread the word because pre-selling a product is a good way to generate capital and also get feedback on the product, its acceptability and pricing,” Pathania said.The Multi-Mask has been featured on the US-based crowdfunding site, ‘Indiegogo’ to help attract funds for its manufacturing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-designer-comes-up-with-multi-mask-for-complete-protection-against-covid-19/story-FnSYdv3oOnRoAIhrl36pVJ.html

Active Covid-19 cases are the current disease burden of the country.“This is because of effective implementation of Centre-led policies ensuring efficient clinical management in hospital settings for critical patients, and supervised home Isolation for moderate and mild ones,” the health ministry tweeted on Monday morning.The widening gap has led to active cases becoming about 23.24% of the total positive case reported in the country so far. The first case was diagnosed positive on January 30, this year. The Covid-19 recoveries have also touched 75% (74.90%).“It is indeed a result of all the efforts that government has made to manage the outbreak. We are detecting Covid-19 infections early; for which credit largely goes to enhanced testing apart from robust surveillance system in place. We have managed quite well given the large population size of India,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.Even though overall deaths related to Covid-19 are moving closer to 60,000, the case fatality rate (CFR), that dropped below 2% a week ago, now stands at 1.86%, which is among the lowest as compared to other countries.“Deaths have definitely reduced and we don’t see too many patients needing ventilator support. One of the reasons for it could be that cases are being detected early and reaching hospital well in time. The treatment starts well before they reach the critical stage. In fact, most of the positive cases do not require hospitalization these days, as these are being managed well at home,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, critical care department, Medanta Hospital.Doctors treating Covid-19 patients also say that now they know better what works on these patients.“We now know the disease better than what we knew at the start of the pandemic. There are more treatment options open before us and we know things like steroids are working very well in saving lives. There are other supportive therapies that we are now confident about,” said Dr Srikant Sharma, senior consultant, Moolchand Hospital.“Knowing a disease better helps in overall disease management, which is why we are able to save more lives than before,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-recoveries-now-three-times-active-cases-health-ministry/story-xa9vFEkpbXOTyZADpohyzI.html

Gathering is inevitable, when we want to get back to our normal lives,” the CM said. Maharashtra, on Sunday, recorded 10,441 new Covid-19 cases, as the tally rose to 682,383. The state crossed 22,000 fatalities after 258 new Covid-19 related deaths were recorded on Sunday and the cumulative toll stands at 22,253. Of the fatalities recorded on Sunday, 213 were from the previous 48 hours and 23 were from last week. The remaining 22 deaths were from the period before last week. The case fatality rate (CFR) in Maharashtra is 3.26%. So far 488,271 Covid-19 patients have recovered from their viral infection, including 8,157 on Sunday. At present, Maharashtra has 171,542 Covid-19 active cases. There have been demands from various quarters, including from the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), for reopening of gymnasiums and religious places of worship. However, the state government is yet to take a call. Though the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has asked state governments to allow unrestricted movement of people and goods between states, the MVA government has not acted upon it yet. The CM said the next 10 days are crucial for the state’s battle against Covid-19. The state is anticipating a spike in Covid-19 cases following an uptick in the movement of people during festivals such as Ganesh Utsav and Muharram. “The next phase is important for the state. The next eight-10 days are going to be crucial, as the Ganpati festival is on. Paryushana concluded on Sunday and Muharram will also be observed in a few days. Besides these festivals, a raging monsoon is a carrier of several diseases,” Thackeray said. State health department officials attributed the spike in Covid-19 cases to the easing of lockdown restrictions and anticipated a similar trend to continue. The CM said though the Covid-19 situation in Mumbai is “under control”, he cautioned the authorities to guard against any complacency to prevent a second wave of attack, as has been the global trend. “A dedicated Covid-19 facility is being commissioned in Pune, and two more will be added in this week. People ask me why do we require so many healthcare facilities? We cannot remain careless. Absolutely not. Today, the situation in Mumbai is under control, but I shall not rest. We are continuing with our strategy of tracing, tracking, testing etc. Globally, a second wave [of Covid-19] has occurred. We are striving to prevent a second wave. But what should we do, if it occurs? Earlier, we had faced an acute of shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, including N-95 masks, and also ventillators,” the CM had said while unveiling the Pune healthcare facility. Mumbai recorded 991 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, as the city’s tally rose to 136,353. It also recorded 34 fatalities and the cumulative toll is 7,422. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-cautious-over-reopening-to-prevent-second-wave-thackeray/story-rbzvwGoIrC4TY0VWx3X4sI.html
24-08-2020||India||Two Delhi teachers among 47 selected for national teachers award 2020||For the last 21 years, 47-year-old Surender Singh travels from Haryana’s Sonipat to north-west Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar in a DTC bus spending nearly two hours every day with one motive in mind - to help children from marginalised families get a better education.Singh, a primary teacher at a North Delhi Municipal Corporation school in Sarai Pillai thala in Adarsh Nagar, is among the 47 teachers selected for the national teachers’ award 2020. He is also a mentor teacher with 11 North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run schools under him. He is known for his innovative idea of modifying the nibs of fountain pens to help children improve their handwriting in their initial days at school.“A majority of the students who come to us are from very poor families and they do not get any guidance at home. When they come to us, they don’t even know how to hold a pencil. To help them write better, I came up with this idea of changing the nibs of fountain pens and make them sharp as wooden pens that we would use earlier with ink. I cut the nib with a pair of scissors and rub them on a stone to sharpen their edges. I also distribute ink pots to students regularly. It helped them a lot in improving their handwriting. Teachers from many other schools adopted my idea,” he said.Also read: UP government teachers team up to help colleagues in tough timesSingh had also helped hundreds of his students to crack the entrance exam of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalayas (popularly known as RPVVs) - a system of schools run by the Directorate of Education (DoE) for class 6. “I hire a bus and take them to the entrance centres as well,” he said.When asked if he does not get demotivated since there are regular complaints of delay in distribution of salaries at the North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run schools, he said, “It’s definitely problematic for us all but we can’t stop working. We have a huge responsibility as teachers.”Ira Singhal, deputy commissioner of north civic body, said, “It’s a huge moment of pride for the corporation. We are hoping for more teachers from municipal corporation schools to get recognised in future.”Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini sector B-8, is the only one who won the award from across the CBSE-affiliated schools in the country this year. The 51-year-old has been working in the education sector for the last 27 years.Arora is known for several innovative community service projects including converting an old school van into a 3D lab. “We have installed a 3D screen on the bus with content on health, science and hygiene. The bus goes to nearby MCD schools and slum areas accompanied by some teachers and gives a digital exposure to kids there. The kids in municipal schools and slum areas are deprived of technology. It gives immense satisfaction to see those kids wearing 3D glasses and watching content on day-to-day life things such as photosynthesis and cleanliness,” she said.Besides, Arora also conducts several programmes on sustainable development goals in her schools and has also written books on healthy food habits for kids. “With every recognition comes responsibility. The award will give us the motivation to do more in future,” she added.The Union Education Ministry, earlier known as Human Resource Development Ministry, gives national teachers awards every year recognising their achievements in the field of education. The teachers apply for the award online and get shortlisted at three levels - district, state and national. The department of school education and literacy of the education ministry constitutes an independent jury at the national level to select the awardees. This year, 153 teachers were shortlisted and 47 of them were selected for the award.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-delhi-teachers-among-47-selected-for-national-teachers-award-2020/story-nQUndMDDhqVgqYYjYnc8zO.html

Speaking via video conferencing during the commissioning of an 800-bed dedicated Covid hospital in Pune on Sunday, Thackeray said the state government is preparing health infrastructure to fight in case there is a second wave of outbreak of the disease in the state.“When we say we want to resume our lives normally, then crowding is inevitable. We are opening things gradually, but while doing so we are also ensuring that a second wave does not start,” he said.There have been demands from various quarters, including from leaders within the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi, to allow gymnasiums and religious places to open up. But so far the state has not taken a call.The Union home ministry has asked state governments to allow unrestricted movement of people and goods between states. The state, however, is yet to take a call in it.Thackeray said that the next 10 days are crucial for the state’s battle against coronavirus. The state is anticipating a rise in Covid-19 cases with the increased movement of people during festivals, including Ganeshotsav and Muharram. “The next phase is quite important for the state. The next eight-10 days are going to be crucial as Ganpati festival is on, Paryushan of the Jain community is going on, Muharram is also in a few days. Along with these festivals, there is monsoon, which brings diseases,” he said.

Mumbai recorded 991 new infections on Sunday, taking the city’s tally to 136,353.

We are continuing with the tracing, tracking, testing, etc. Globally it is seen that after a wave, a second wave (of Covid-19) comes. We are striving so that no second wave comes, but if it comes, then what will we do?

24-08-2020||India||UP govt allowed undue benefit of Rs 572.48 cr to developers in 2010: CAG report||The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audit report claimed that the Uttar Pradesh government allowed undue benefit of Rs 572.48 crore to developers at the cost of Ghaziabad Development Authority in 2010 by altering the land use indicated in the Master Plan without levying land-use conversion charges. The report on Economic Sector and Public Sector Undertakings of Uttar Pradesh for the year ending March 31, 2018, was tabled in the state legislative assembly on Saturday. The report stated that following the state government order of August 2001, the land-use conversion charges were to be levied on the net area of the land at the circle rates fixed by the district magistrate for the existing use of land. The government order had stated that rates of land-use conversion would  be 50 percent in case of land-use conversion from agriculture to residential land.Also read: Cong orders probe after its top two leaders in Agra quit over video rowAccording to the audit report, the state government, in May 2006,  selected two developers for the development of hi-tech townships in Ghaziabad. The Master Plan- 2001 was in force, according to which the land use of the area designated for the hi-tech townships was agricultural. In July 2005, the state government approved the Master Plan- 2021. It was provided that for the use of the land designated for hi-tech township, the developers selected by the state government shall have to pay the applicable land-use conversion charges and the remaining land shall be considered agricultural.  The two orders issued by the state government on May 18, 2006, and September 17, 2007, introducing the hi-tech township policy-2006 and 2007 also stipulated that the applicable land use conversion charges shall be payable by the developers, the CAG report said. In an order on April 23, 2010, regarding Master Plan- 2021, the state government stated that there was no provision under the UP Urban Planning and Development Act, 1973 for showing land use as indicative for hi-tech township, the report added. The land had been shown in the Ghaziabad Master Plan- 2021 and, therefore, the land use will be considered residential. The land-use conversion charges would not be payable on this area, the state government said, according to the CAG report. The CAG noticed that by the order issued on April 23, 2010, the housing and urban planning department, on the request of the developers, altered the indicated land use in the master plan to residential and, consequently, no charges for conversion of land use were, henceforth, payable by the two developers. The CAG further noticed that the authority has approved (October 2010 to October 2013) the layout plans of the developers for an area of 4,772.19-acre land, which included 3,702.97-acre land indicatively earmarked as hi-tech township in the Master Plan - 2021, wherein land-use conversion charges of Rs 572.48 crore were to be levied on the developers.  However, due to state government order on April 23, 2010, the charges could not be levied. Thus the land use of agricultural land was changed to residential land without levying conversion charges, the CAG report said. This resulted in the extension of an undue benefit to the developers and loss to the authority of Rs 572.48 crore, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-allowed-undue-benefit-of-rs-572-48-cr-to-developers-in-2010-cag-report/story-Hq5F8IM8cCX6bUExiRrb1J.html

Digvijaya Singh went to the extent of saying that he can’t imagine the Congress without Nehru-Gandhi family and that an ordinary worker of the party would not accept anyone else as the party president. The two leaders’ tweets appeared within a gap of less than half an hour. Also read: CWC meet today, Sonia Gandhi in favour of a new leaderThe meeting of Congress Working Committee, the highest decision-making body of the party, is taking place in the backdrop of more than 100 Congress leaders, including former chief ministers and members of parliament, writing to the party president to bring about massive changes in the party in view of the prevailing circumstances. Kamal Nath tweeted, “Any suggestion or insinuation that Mrs. Sonia Gandhi’s leadership is in question is absurd. I appeal to Mrs. Sonia Gandhi to give strength to the Congress Party by continuing as President and lead the Congress.” He said, “I have had the privilege of working with Sanjay Gandhi, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. I have also had the privilege of serving the Congress Party as a Member of Parliament for almost 40 years and as the longest-serving Member of Parliament. I have been the general secretary of the Congress Party for many years. We must not forget that in spite of the canard against Smt. Sonia Gandhi, she led the Congress Party to victory in 2004 and made Atal Bihari Vajpayee sit at home.” Digvijaya Singh tweeted, “Sonia ji’s leadership is accepted by all. If Sonia ji does wish to step down then Rahul ji should accept the post of President while giving up his insistence (on not holding the post). Digvijaya Singh added, “This is the time for unanimity of views in the Congress, not the difference of opinions. It is known to all which family offered sacrifice and supreme sacrifice for the freedom of the country and thereafter. I don’t agree with what is appearing in the media.

The Congress betrayed the people with false promises like waiver of farm loan in 10 days in order to come to power in the state.” “Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi had promised that farm loans of up to to Rs 2 lakh will be waived within 10 days or else the chief minister will be sent back on the eleventh day,” he said.“Congress made false promises to come to the power in the state,” he alleged.Scindia had quit the Congress in March this year and later joined the BJP.On the Congress’s agitation against the BJP’s membership drive in Gwalior, Scindia said, “At least they (Congress leaders) came out of their houses to protest against BJP’s drive five months after losing the government in MP.” With an eye on the by-elections to 27 assembly constituencies in Madhya Pradesh, especially in Gwalior- Chambal region of the state that accounts for 16 of these seats, the ruling BJP has launched the membership drive here on Saturday.Twenty-two rebel Congress MLAs in Madhya Pradesh, mostly from the Scindia camp, resigned in March, reducing the 15-month-old dispensation led by Kamal Nath to a minority and paving the way for the BJP to form the government in the state.These former MLAs had later joined the BJP.The BJP then sent Scindia to Rajya Sabha, while many of his loyalists got important portfolios in Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s cabinet.Last month, three more Congress MLAs in the state resigned and joined the saffron party, taking their number to 25, while two assembly seats had fallen vacant due to the demise of legislators.The Congress now has 89 MLAs in the House, while the ruling BJP has 107. The effective strength of the 230-member House has come down to 203 due to the resignations and deaths of legislators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/had-turned-down-mp-dy-cm-s-post-offered-by-congress-says-scindia/story-kM9Jyof6iBEwW9pCiSYlVN.html

The decision to induct women in the fighter stream was taken five years ago. “I won’t say there were no challenges and the proposal to allow women in the fighter stream faced no resistance. But this wasn’t due to a gender bias. It was because people pointed out practical difficulties related to biological issues — mainly pregnancy-related aspects,” air chief marshal Raha told HT. The controversy triggered by the Netflix film, Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl, has turned the spotlight on women in the military, particularly the air force. While women officers have been flying helicopters and transport planes for more than two decades, the IAF’s first female fighter pilots were commissioned into service only three years ago. Raha said he dealt with the internal resistance to the proposal to allow women to fly fighter jets by emphasising the need to be progressive and giving them a chance to realise their aspirations. “My argument was if women want to become fighter pilots, then why should we stop them? Women pilots cannot perform the duties assigned to them during pregnancy as that may not be good for the mother and the baby. But that would be for a certain period of time. The bigger goal was to empower women and people eventually understood that,” said Raha. In 2016, the IAF advised its first batch of three women trainees to put off motherhood for at least four years after they got into service so that their training schedule was not disrupted. That was only an advisory and not a no-pregnancy clause. The decision to allow women to fly warplanes was taken on an experimental basis in 2015 for five years. The air force is set to expand the scope of the experimental fighter pilot programme for women, IAF Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria told HT in an interview in May. Nine women have been commissioned as fighter pilots after the experimental scheme for their induction into the combat stream was introduced in 2015, a watershed in the air force’s history. The government then said it was a progressive step that mirrored contemporary trends in the militaries of developed countries. “I think women fighter pilots have settled into their new roles rather well and their performance matches that of their male counterparts. It’s important to empower women in our country where even educated families sometimes do not provide them equal opportunities,” said Raha. The former IAF chief said he hadn’t watched the film, Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl, but felt miserable about the way the air force had been projected from reading some reviews. “The film has maligned the reputation of the IAF. The content appears to have been trivialized and commercialized. The film makers have wasted an opportunity to project women and the military in the right light,” Raha said. Currently, there are a total of 111 women pilots serving in the IAF, including those who fly transport planes and choppers. The head count of women in the military adds up to nearly 3,500, but combat roles were off limits to them until the IAF took the lead in crushing internal resistance to induct them into the fighter stream. Warships, tanks and combat positions in infantry are still no-go zones for women, who were allowed to join the armed forces outside the medical stream for the first time in 1992. The armed forces began inducting women by granting them short-service commission for five to 10 years before the government came out with a new policy in 2008 to give them permanent commission in a few arms and services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/built-consensus-to-induct-women-fighter-pilots-says-ex-iaf-chief/story-BAoPgmfqrmjn8WrnbnNMuK.html
24-08-2020||India||Sexist or sensational? Film stirs row||In the summer of 1994, months after she was commissioned into the Indian Air Force (IAF) as part of the first batch of 12 women officers, wing commander Anupama Joshi (retired) faced a daunting prospect.She was appointed fire officer, a prestigious position whose holder had to learn and lead the fire drill. As part of her duties, she was asked to get into a basket dangling off the hydraulic ladder and demonstrate a fire rescue from a multistoried building. Joshi remembers being scared. “I was scared of the height; plus it was a little basket hanging seven or eight floors above the ground,” she told HT. As the hydraulic ladder was raised in the air, Joshi clutched the railing of the basket. “I was smiling and giving a look that everything was going well. Inside, I was afraid but I knew I couldn’t say no, because then it would become about a woman’s ability to perform a duty,” she said. “So I did my little prayer, grit my teeth and successfully finished the task.”At the time, the IAF was experimenting with inducting women and as the first batch, the pressure to perform was immense. “I was always 5-10 minutes early for every task because I knew it would never be about Anupama being late, it would become about a lady officer being late,” she said.Almost three decades after Joshi and the “dirty dozen” –what the first batch called themselves – entered the force, attitudes towards women officers and questions of discrimination are under the spotlight with the release of the recent Hindi film, Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl. Based on the life of one of the first women pilots to fly during combat, the film depicts stark discrimination and sexism, drawing criticism from the IAF and the air force officers’ community. In response, Saxena has defended her position and some experts have pointed out that all institutions struggle with gender inclusivity and that filmmakers can take some creative liberties with depiction.The nepotism debate On August 29, 2019, Karan Johar’s official Instagram account put up a poster showing Janhvi Kapoor, daughter of movie producer Boney Kapoor and late actor Sridevi, in an IAF pilot’s overalls and helmet hooked into the crank on one side, surrounded by men in similar blue overalls cheering her on. The poster was the first look of Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl, based on “India’s first Air Force woman officer who went to war”, the poster claimed. A second poster weeks later showed Kapoor embracing Pankaj Tripathi, who plays her father, Anup Saxena. On December 28, 2019, when Kapoor posted photographs on her Instagram account — sitting inside a helicopter in the same blue overalls, with Saxena, director Sharan Sharma and other crew members— she announced a wrap. “Can’t wait for you guys to see it,” she posted to her 8.9 million followers. But the coronavirus pandemic made a theatrical release impossible and by June, it was announced that Netflix bought the film for ₹50 crore.By this time, the death by suspected suicide of actor Sushant Singh Rajput was roiling the film industry and stirring a debate on nepotism within Bollywood. A Netflix promotional video showing Kapoor speaking to Saxena drew ire on YouTube against nepotism with some calling for a boycott of the film. “When I tweeted the film looked solid, I was instantly trolled. Why? Because the film has been produced by Dharma Productions and it stars Janhvi Kapoor as Gunjan Saxena. I was called a “Dharma stooge” and much worse,” wrote critic Anupama Chopra in Film Companion.In the first two weeks of August, Sharma, Tripathi and Kapoor gave several interviews and appealed to people to watch the movie before forming opinions. “You can’t decide the merit of a book on its cover. I know this is a democracy, and everyone is free to express what they wish to… but it will be more fruitful if people talk about the film after watching it,” Tripathi said in an interview to HT. But the August 12 release brought fresh problems . Social media users began to call the film ‘anti-national’, not only for showing gender-based discrimination in the IAF but also for its depiction of patriotism. The IAF released a statement expressing its disappointment. A week after the release, Saxena’s batchmate Srividya Rajan claimed she – and not Saxena – was the first women pilot to fly into the Kargil war zone. As the controversy snowballed into national news, the film’s crew and production house fell silent and insiders described shock and surprise at the hostile reception from a section of the audience and the air force – especially at the claims of factual inaccuracy – given that the film was widely publicized before and is based on books and newspaper articles. Kapoor, Sharma and Dharma Productions didn’t respond to multiple requests for comments. Tripathi told HT, “I don’t know anything about the debate that’s going on. In any film I do, there’s nothing apart from acting that I know or even want to know. I feel one should just do their job and go.”Mumbai-based film critic Mayank Shekhar attributed the silence to “a proper smear campaign against the film industry”. “Look at the comments on the trailers or on Instagram or any other platform. These are not spontaneous. The point is to shut people up because there is no way to engage with these comments.” A representative from Netflix refused to comment on the matter. Air force reacts Shortly after the film’s release, IAF sent a letter to Dharma Productions, Netflix and the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), saying certain scenes and dialogues in the movie and its trailer, which were forwarded to it for viewing, were found to “portray the IAF in an undue negative light.” “IAF is deeply concerned about the false portrayal of gender bias as institutional work culture,” a senior officer said on condition of anonymity. The letter said as per initial understanding, Dharma agreed to represent IAF with authenticity and make all efforts to ensure the film would help inspire the next generation of officers. The IAF said it was a gender-neutral organisation and always provided equal opportunity to both men and women. The summary of the scenes and dialogues of the script that were considered objectionable were annexed to the letter, said a second IAF officer, asking not to be named. The letter pointed out the production house was informed about the objectionable portions and advised to delete or modify them. However, it added that instead of deleting the scenes, Dharma proposed a media plan in the run up to the film’s release and inserting a disclaimer. The letter made it clear these options were inadequate. The annexure of the IAF letter detailing its objections are not in the public domain – a questionnaire by HT received no response – conversations with officials helped draw a rough sketch of the possible disagreements. One set pertained to scenes where Saxena’s scheduled sorties are repeatedly cancelled by the flight commander because no male pilot is willing to fly with her, and the non-cooperation of authorities to set right infrastructure problems such as the absence of toilets for women. A second set were to the depiction of junior male officers refusing to salute Saxena and her male batch mates making pejorative comments and being hostile to her. A third set was against the depiction of physical aggression and seniors forcing Saxena to enter an arm-wrestling match with a male batch mate to prove her toughness. “Flight commanders welcome newly posted officers, they do not insult them. They groom youngsters, do not humiliate them,” tweeted Nitin Welde, IAF veteran and himself a trainer.“Absolutely fictitious” Within the air force community, there is deep anger and consternation over the movie’s depiction of a sexist and hostile force. “The film has smeared the reputation of an honourable service with its cooked up instances of gender bias. There may have been some teething troubles in the initial years but what has been shown in the movie is absolutely fictitious and revolting,” said a serving officer, asking not to be named. In WhatsApp groups and personal discussions, particular anger is directed at the projection of male officers as lewd misogynists. “Do the film makers realize how those officers would be feeling about their horrible portrayal? I happen to know some of those fine officers, including the flight commander, who were posted at the Udhampur air base during that time. Forcing a woman officer to arm-wrestle with a male counterpart or asking her to change into flight overalls on the tarmac, this is nothing but fiction,” said a second serving officer. Going the extra mileConversations with three former women officers threw up three sets of challenges they faced in the initial years, but all three were emphatic in saying that IAF was cooperative and backed them during any problems they faced. The first was with outdated policies. Joshi and other women, for example, were not detailed for night patrols initially for safety reasons but after they argued that they needed to be treated equally, it became a norm. For the first three weeks in June 1992, her batch of 12 women walked around the Air Force Academy in Dundigal, Telangana, in civilian clothes because no uniform was designed for women. “In some cases, there was over protection of women, and I had to tell people to look at me as an officer, not as women. We must understand that for 20 years, many of these people spent treating women differently. But this didn’t mean disrespect or institutional bias,” Joshi said. Wing commander Pamela Pereira (retired) said the force supported and nurtured women officers. She agreed that at first women pilots were a novelty, and the syllabus for the trainee cadets was different from that for men. “We had to prove ourselves more, and it was not always smooth sailing.” The second challenge was some male officers who misbehaved with them. Joshi explained there were some incidents where men misbehaved but the organisation had systems in place. She put up an airman for obscenity and he was court marshalled. “This would not be possible in any other organisation,” she said. “Majority were progressive thinking and supportive. A few had doubts about our abilities. But these people are in every profession. We were fighters. We knew how to tide over difficult situations,” said Rajan. Joshi pointed out that many women offices found their life partners in the forces.The third challenge was infrastructural. All three officers said when they first arrived, facilities were scant but added that the force and fellow officers made adjustments soon.Joshi explained that she would latch male officers’ washrooms and use them, or use facilities built for civilian women employees – clerks, stenographers. “I found the IAF the safest place for a woman to work. Later, in my fight for permanent commission, many men came forward,” said Joshi. “And, if we pledge our life for the country, finding a toilet is not that important.”Pereira said male officers would vacate changing rooms to let her use them, and later facilities were built. “We knew we had to compromise a bit. But no woman officer was treated badly or left to fend for herself,” she added. “No ill treatment”Of course, the most serious charge against the film is of historical inaccuracy. Rajan, for example, said the lack of toilets was exaggerated and that women officers used a toilet of a woman medical officer in the next building -- hence, it was not a big issue. Rajan and Saxena joined the academy in 1994 and commissioned together in June 1996 in a batch of six women. They were sent to the Udhampur air base, where they became the first women pilots in the station– doing sorties to support the army, communication, search-and-rescue and casualty evacuation. “There was no ill treatment or humiliation. We were given equal opportunities. If the organization had problems with women, why would it induct them?” she asked. “We always had the option of complaining if any misbehaviour happened.”When the Kargil conflict broke out in May 1999, Rajan claimed that she – and not Saxena – was part of the first team sent to the Srinagar base and flew sorties. At the time, she said, media was not allowed and reporters were only let in two weeks later, when she had finished her two-week shift and Saxena was on the frontlines. “But I was there first, before the media came there, and I was the first woman pilot to fly in Kargil. This film has erased me,” said Rajan – adding that flight log records would support her claim. Saxena has not responded to the specific allegations – multiple texts and calls from HT went unanswered – but defended herself in a blog published on NDTV on August 17. She quoted the Limca Book of Records to say she was the first woman to fly in a combat zone. Numerous newspaper and magazine articles also name her as the first, though some also name Rajan. In the blog, she pointed out it was not her, but IAF that “opened the doors to the media” on her achievements. “How can anybody deny the obvious fact of me being a pioneering woman officer during the Kargil war?” she asked. On gender bias, she agreed that there existed no discrimination at the organizational level. “The experiences of different woman officers would be different. To deny it completely speaks of a feudal mindset and undermines the grit of women officers,” she wrote. Objections raised This was the second objection raised by an arm of the military to a show or movie in recent weeks. Last month, the defence ministry wrote a letter to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), drawing attention to producers of movies and web series “distorting” the image of the Indian Army and said they should obtain a no-objection certificate from the ministry before airing such content. The government has not responded to the request. CBFC member Vaani Tripathi Tikoo pointed out that the film — which was cleared for theatrical release — was now streaming on an OTT platform that didn’t have any regulations. “We have no control on what is streaming on them, it’s not in the ambit of CBFC.”Tikoo also said the procedure for certifying biopics and military personnel is different. “Since Prasoon Joshi became the chairperson, he has been very sensitive to that fact, and in most of our screenings, we invite military personnel to see the film. At the end of the day, we are not experts in military and defence,” she said. “The guideline states any film which has issues of national security and defence should be viewed in purview of the permissible, it should not lead to any kind of communal violence, it shouldn’t harm national security, and should not disrespect the national emblem.”Shohini Ghosh, director of Jamia Millia Islamia’s AJK Mass Communication Research Centre, said that had the film not committed itself to being a biopic, it may not have got mired in this debate. (The film offers a disclaimer that the events have been dramatized). “What we would have been left with is a powerful film on sexism in a hallowed male-dominated institution. Many women would be able to identify with how even if you are up to doing your job, sexism stands in the way, as the environment is built for men. The film also redefines patriotism, as not just limited to slogan-mongering jingoism, but as a love for the country that emerges from one’s own passions and sincerity. It’s patriotism that includes everyone, not just those who are at the borders,” Ghosh said.A standing ovationAt any rate, the film and the ensuing controversy has also highlighted the giant strides made by women pilots in three decades -- from a time when they were inducted in administrative roles for 10 years with an optional five-year extension to now, when they are flight commanders and elite fighter pilots.Joshi remembers when as cadets just three months into their training in October 1992, her batch were told they would be a special contingent at the Air Force Day parade in New Delhi. “We were super excited, especially after we were put up in the officers’ mess and everything — food, drinks — was made free for us, We would stay up all night, talking,” she said.On October 8, 1992, Joshi led the woman contingent and they were later corralled to meet the president, prime minister and defence minister, in whose presence the then air chief NC Suri called the women his 12 angels. “We got the loudest applause and a standing ovation from the gallery. President Shankar Dayal Sharma said this was one of the proudest moments for him,” said Joshi. At the time, there were zero women officers in the IAF. Today, there are 111.

The data released by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) showed that the country performed 8,01,147 Covid-19 tests in the past 24 hours. The overall tally stood at 3,52,92,220. On Friday, 10, 23, 836 tests were conducted. “At times, this (low-test count) happens on weekends. However, it doesn’t mean that there is a decline in our testing capacity,” said Dr Rajnikant Srivastava, spokesperson, ICMR. “It is only by aggressive testing that the positive cases can be identified, their contacts tracked in a timely manner and critical patients provided the needed clinical treatment…,” said Union ministry of health and family welfare (MOH&FW) in its statement released on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-day-after-hitting-1-million-mark-800k-tests-on-saturday/story-XvOTxoGJtPKuTOQFbCq7gP.html
24-08-2020||India||Sellers of school uniforms all dressed up but nowhere to go||Himanshu Bhardwaj has been keenly waiting for schools to reopen — no, he is not a vociferous votary of in-class teaching, but a manufacturer and trader of school uniforms with massive unsold stocks. “I never thought schools could ever be closed for so long and we could ever go out of business,” says Bhardwaj, sitting inside his shop in east Delhi’s Gandhi Nagar.The shop’s shelves are laden with coats, shirts, trousers of various sizes; fabrics of different patterns and colours: plain, twill, matty, oxford checks, stripes in blue, white, grey, green and other school colours. Behind him on the wall are showcased ties and belts with logos of schools as far away as Assam and West Bengal. “The lockdown happened just when we were readying to dispatch uniform to them. About 40,000 summer uniforms are lying unsold in my godown,” says Bhardwaj.Bhardwaj is not the only one.The continued closure of schools due to the Coronavirus crisis -- -- since March 19 in Delhi -- has caused unprecedented disruption in the country’s school uniform market, which, according to the industry estimates is worth 18,000 crores. India has one of the largest K-12 (kindergarten to class 12) school systems in the world with more than 1.4 million schools with 250+ million students, according to a FICCI report.The Delhi-NCR and Solapur in Maharashtra are the two biggest school uniform manufacturing hubs in the country. The Gandhi Nagar market in the capital alone boasts of about 100 school uniform traders and manufacturers, who attract vendors and retailers from all across the country, providing direct and indirect employment to about 1 lakh people in the city—cutters, tailors, stitchers, embroiders—between August and March. In fact, August is the time when manufacturing for winter uniforms starts, but this year most tailoring units, which are concentrated in east Delhi, Noida and Sahibabad are shuttered.“We start production in January for the new session in April, and in August for the winter session. But with large stocks of summer uniforms having remained unsold, we are facing a cash crunch, and there is no way we can start production till the existing stocks are cleared and we receive payment. If the schools open in December, there would not be any winter uniforms in the market,” says Anil Jain, sitting inside his shops in Gandhi Nagar. There are hundreds of packed white lab suits lying behind him.Jain is one of the few traders who have chosen to keep his shop open in the market where a majority of shops of uniform traders and makers have remained closed since March. Jain says he keeps the shop open more to kill boredom at home than in hope of getting any business. None of the 150 schools he has made pre-ordered uniform with their emblems has picked up their stocks, he says. “Many of them, especially budget schools, have stopped taking my calls.”The average cost of uniform in wholesale is anything between Rs 300 to Rs 900, depending on the fabric, size and the customisation required. “Till January, I had so many vendors and school representatives exploring new uniform designs flipping through these catalogues,” says Bhardwaj, pulling out a catalogue of a well-known uniform fabric brand. One of his shelves is packed with catalogues with fabric samples and uniform designs.Gandhi Nagar has over 150 tailoring units, each employing 20 to 70 people, with different specialties. “There were people who would cut, stitch, and there were those who specialised in embroidering logos on the uniform,” says Vivek Sharma. Hanging from the front of his shop are children’s mannequins in school uniforms made by his firm. “I employed about 50 people, who are now jobless,” says Jain, who has been in the school uniform business for the past 25 yearsDelhi also has many traders and manufacturers who supply belts and ties to uniform manufacturers all over the country. Sadar Bazar-based Sushil Verma, for example, has been making ties and belts for uniform manufacturers in Solapur and Delhi. He is sitting on a large stock of undelivered belt and ties. “I am afraid a lot of them are white belts with school logos printed on them. They might fade,” says Verma. “I used to make about 2,500 belts a day, but have not produced a single belt or tie since March.”If Gandhi Nagar has manufacturers and traders, Katra Choban in Chandni Chowk is the hub of uniform fabric dealers —and they say their business is facing a crisis like never before. “Our sales are down by 90%. Most uniform manufacturers have withheld our payment because they have not been able to get payment from school vendors. We have unsold stocks worth lakhs, and have not placed any new order with fabric manufacturing firms,” says Sanjeev Malhotra, partner, Prakash Lal Rakesh Kumar, one of Delhi’s better- known and oldest uniform fabric dealers. His customers include uniform vendors of some of Delhi’s biggest and oldest schools.Most dealers procure fabric from mills in Bhilwara in Rajasthan and Bhiwandi near Mumbai, home to some of India’s biggest textile mills. “School uniform fabric accounts for most of our output; our production for school uniform fabric is down by 80%. But we have seen a slight increase in demand from the health sector,” says Kishore Kothari, director, Valji Uniform, a Mumbai-based firm, which is one of India’s largest uniform fabric manufacturers. “But the industry will see a quick recovery as soon as schools reopen.”Bharat Arora, general secretary, Action Committee of Unaided Recognised Private Schools, an association of private schools in Delhi, says there is no requirement of uniform as long as schools are closed. “Children are free to wear the dress of their choice as they take online classes at home. Even otherwise, while some schools appoint vendors for uniforms for the convenience of parents, the latter have always been free to buy it from wherever they want,” says Arora. “The schools decide what their uniform should be, but not where should the parents buy them.”Aparajitha Gautam, president of Delhi Parents Association, said some schools had initially asked parents to make their children wear uniforms while attending online classes. “We protested and asked the parents not to follow such directions as they are already facing financial stress in the current situation. There is no point buying a new uniform when the schools are closed,” she said.The North Delhi Municipal Corporation, like other two corporations in the city, gives Rs 1,100 per student to parents to buy school uniforms for their children. Nearly 2.75 lakh students are enrolled at 714 primary schools run by the civic body. The corporation, which spends around Rs 30 crore on school uniforms, has released the funds to parents to buy uniforms. “Every year, this fund is released in April but due to lockdown this year, it was given in July and August first week. Though schools are yet to open, we have released the money so that the parents can buy uniforms as soon as the schools reopen,” says Ira Singhal, deputy commissioner of the North Delhi Corporation.Back in Gandhi Nagar, traders are not too optimistic about the reopening of schools. If Bhardwaj has started stocking women’s wear such as salwar suits, kurtis – not the right garments, he admits, for a firm called NHPS School Uniform; Sharma has started dealing in pyjamas and T-shirts. “I have never sold anything other than school uniforms, but we need to look beyond uniform to survive at least till the time schools reopen, ” says Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sellers-of-school-uniforms-all-dressed-up-but-nowhere-to-go/story-BW5ym7APhdOiMB9gzHaojN.html
24-08-2020||India||Delhiwale: Cheeku and Peeku||It’s very tough to make out who is who. Cheeku and Peeku are twins. Barely a month old. They don’t speak much. They stay together. And they seem to have recovered from the great loss they suffered a bit too soon in their life.“Their mother died a few days after their birth,” says Ratan Kumar. It is evening and he has brought Cheeku and Peeku for their regular evening outing in this south Delhi park. They live in nearby Jia Sarai village. Mr Kumar quietly watches as Cheeku and Peeku hover around his feet. It is a humid evening but the siblings are looking like fresh balls of snow.Cheeku and Peeku are rabbits. “I bought their mother from Adchini for 650 rupees,” says Mr Kumar, looking at the twins as they fiddle about the greens, just outside their empty steel cage. “We don’t keep them inside the cage at home... it’s used just as a carriage to bring them to the park.”Mr Kumar, a security guard in a monument, was never really fond of the idea of keeping pets, but he bought the twins’ mother after being persuaded by his four kids. He says that Cheeku gets his name from his mother. “She was originally named Cheeku by my daughter Komal.”There is no knowing how deeply the twins felt the death of their mother, confesses Mr Kumar. “But for a week or so they barely moved about the house, they would keep lying on the floor together, their heads slumped one upon the other. Many times we had to force them to eat.”Now Mr Kumar silently spreads out his arm and, as if on cue, both rabbits raise themselves on each of his palms. Lifting the twins closer to his face, Mr Kumar says in a flat tone that “by now they have forgotten their mummy.”He turns to look at the woody expanse beyond the park’s boundary, and gesturing vaguely towards that direction, he says, “I buried the mother there... my son Ankuj was with me.”Absentmindedly dropping the rabbits on the cushiony grass, he nods towards Peeku and says, “This one is very sharp, very clever and far more active... Cheeku is dull, peechhe reh gaya (he’s left behind).”If the twins have overheard these words from their human father, they show no reaction.“Everyone in my family loves them both equally... we feed them with roti-subzi and fruits, and all the other things we ourselves eat daily.”Meanwhile, it is getting dark. A few evening walkers are going past the twins but they don’t show any excitement on spotting the rabbits—perhaps they are used to seeing them here around this time.

24-08-2020||India||Shooting for movies, TV shows to restart but with riders: Govt||After an almost five-month halt, production of films and television programmes can resume with all essential health protocols in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar said on Sunday, as the government spelled out strict do’s and don’ts for film and television shoots.After consultation with the home ministry and the health ministry, a standard operating procedure (SOP) has been firmed up for the production of films and television programmes, including adherence to social distancing, respiratory etiquette and use of face masks, Javadekar said in an announcement cheered by the vast entertainment industry based in Mumbai. According to the SOP, actors facing the camera will be exempt from wearing masks. All remaining crew members will have to adhere to the guidelines of the health ministry. Production of films and television programmes ground to a hall on March 25, when a nationwide lockdown was imposed in the aftermath of the outbreak of Covid-19. After 68 days of stringent curbs, the government initiated the “Unlock” process starting in June, gradually relaxing curbs. The entertainment industry had demanded that be allowed to resume work. Some states have allowed resumption of shooting of films and television programmes with many riders. In some cases, people aged over 60 years --- considered a high-risk group --- are not allowed on the sets.“It’s great news because it means we are moving towards starting shoots on a full-fledged basis,” said Nikkhil Advani, the filmmaker who owns the production house Emmay Entertainment. “Since we are either already working or are in the process of starting to work in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, we have to go through the MIB {ministry of information and broadcasting} guidelines in detail to see as to if they differ from various state-specific guidelines. But it’s great news for everyone including the daily-wage labourers who have had no work for over five months now. So, I welcome the move by MIB.”As per the guidelines announced on Sunday, high-risk employees will have to take extra precautions; they are advised not be exposed to frontline work requiring contact with public. Masks will be mandatory for all, sanitisation norms will have to be adhered to, respiratory etiquette will be strictly followed, and the use of the Aarogya Setu app will be advised “We, as the film fraternity, welcome the ministry’s move as the work has been stuck for a really long time. And everyone is tired of sitting at home, especially those whose livelihoods are directly dependent on film/TV shoots. So, I am happy that we, slowly but surely, are moving towards normalcy again,” said filmmaker Anees Bazmee, whose next film, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, is due to restart filming in Lucknow soon.Thermal screening at entry points will be mandatory and only asymptomatic persons will be allowed on the premises of shooting. A physical distance of six feet has to be maintained at all times as far as feasible Crowd management in parking lots outside the premises to ensure physical distancing is also part of the guidelines that will need to be followed. The guidelines also call for ensuring that the temperature setting of all air conditioning devices should be in the range of 24-30°C. Recirculation of air has to be to be avoided to the extent possible and cross-ventilation ensured.Production houses have also been asked to ensure visitors and audience are not allowed on the sets; for outdoor shooting, coordination with the local authorities will have to be ensured to minimise and manage spectators, Staggered call and pack-up timings have to be ensured or different production by studios having multiple sets. “Common locations such as sets, cafeteria, make-up rooms, edit rooms, vanity vans, washrooms, etc. shall be sanitized regularly. Sensitive equipment, while keeping in consideration the delicate nature and technical feasibility, shall be sanitized, to the extent possible, before and after the shoot. Adequate provisions for rational use of gloves, boots, masks, PPE {personal protection equipment} etc. shall be undertaken,” the guidelines said. The new dos and don’ts also forbid sharing of costumes, hair wigs, makeup items, equipment, and use of PPEs by make-up artists and hair stylists.The guidelines have a specific provision for anti-stigma behaviour and said stigmatisation or unruly behaviour shall be dealt with strictly in coordination with the local authorities. “Suitable provisions may be made for temporary isolation of any suspect case that may get reported,” the guidelines said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shooting-for-movies-tv-shows-to-restart-but-with-riders-govt/story-z5uaeFqD2TLBopToi6aVUM.html

Posting a copy of his letter on his Twitter account, Baghel said, “Sonia ji and Rahul ji are a ray of hope for us in every challenge. We are all with you. Millions of party workers and people of Chhattisgarh and the entire nation is with you....” Baghel in his letter said that the Nehru-Gandhi family has significant contribution in transforming India and their sacrifices for the country are unforgettable. “Despite facing several crises in the past, millions of workers of the 135-year-old Congress party has always shown faith in the Nehru-Gandhi family,” Baghel stated in his letter. The Chhattisgarh chief minister further said that at present, some leaders within the party have started discussing ideological differences publicly. “I request all party members to maintain unity within the party during this challenging time. It has been the tradition of Congress that all issues are discussed in detail at various levels and decisions are then taken in a democratic manner. We remember that the Congress party under the leadership of Rahul ji put up a good show in the Gujarat assembly elections and paved the way for the formation of the government in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. Only Sonia ji and Rahul ji seem to be a ray of hope for bringing the country out of the crises,” Baghel said in his letter. He also requested, “Amid voices of dissent, you should stand firm and show a new direction to the country and take charge of the party leadership. We are hopeful that under your strong leadership, Congress will again touch new heights.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-cm-bhupesh-baghel-urges-rahul-gandhi-to-return-as-congress-chief/story-k92Ya7tmKR08BsdI0XOiDJ.html

People close to Ganguly and who are aware of the developments said he met chief minister Mamata Banerjee at Nabanna, the state secretariat, last month and returned the documents relating to the land. Neither Ganguly nor the state government commented on the issue. His visit to Nabanna was described as a “courtesy call”. Ganguly reportedly decided to backtrack from the project as there is litigation over the land. Incidentally, the erstwhile Left Front government gave Ganguly a plot of land at the Salt Lake Township for a similar project but that land too led to litigation and he had given it back to the state. Ganguly’s decision to return the plot of land to the TMC government has led to speculation in political circles that he is increasing his distance from the ruling party. There have been rumours for some time that he may join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) prior to the 2021 assembly polls. During his recent interactions with the media, Ganguly however, ruled out such a possibility, saying he has no plans of joining active politics. Ganguly is known to have a warm relationship with both Banerjee and Union home minister Amit Shah. The chief minister backed Ganguly and helped him become the president of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) without having to face an election. Shah and some Central ministers played a crucial role in making Ganguly the president of the BCCI in 2019. Shah’s son Jay Shah is the BCCI secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sourav-ganguly-returns-land-he-took-from-bengal-government-to-build-a-school/story-QpTZsgb9LwDtVmdHtcil0I.html
24-08-2020||India||Donald Trump woos Indian-American voters, with clips from Howdy Modi||The race for Indian American votes is well and truly under way.The Trump campaign on Saturday released a video titled ‘Four More Years’, which seeks to rally the 1.2 million Indian-American voters in the US ahead of the November presidential election and features clips showing Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressing the ‘Howdy Modi’ event in Texas last year and the US President ‘Namaste Trump’ event in Ahmedabad this February. The two leaders had shared the stage on both the events. “America enjoys a great relationship with India and our campaign enjoys great support from Indian Americans!” Kimberly Guilfoyle, national chair of the Trump Victory Finance Committee, wrote in a tweet with the short video.Donald Trump Jr, the president’s eldest son and Guilfoyle’s partner, retweeted the post.The video opens with a panoramic view of the stadium where the ‘Howdy Modi’ event was hosted in Houston in September 2019 and cuts to the February event in Ahmedabad, which was the US President’s first visit to India. “America loves India,” Trump says in a clip from the event, adding “America respects India, and America will always be faithful and loyal friends to the Indian people.”The video marks the campaign’s most visible pitch yet to the Indian-American voters, and comes just hours ahead of the Republican party’s convention that will official nominate Trump for a second term on Monday. The video was also released just days after Democratic presidential nominee and former US vice president Joe Biden declared California Senator Kamala Harris his running mate, making her the first Indian-American and Black woman to be nominated for the key position by a major US party. Harris, 55, has since invoked her Indian heritage -- her mother was a cancer researcher who emigrated to the US from Chennai -- multiple times, including at the Democratic National Convention earlier this week.The Biden campaign, too, has reached out to Indian-American community in the run up to the four-day Democratic convention that began on August 17. At an Indian Independence Day celebration held virtually on August 15, the Democrat had pledged closer ties with India and a better deal for Indian-Americans in a short, policy-laden message, saying he will stand with New Delhi in confronting “new threats its faces in its own region and along its own border”. He also promised to check China’s “impunity” along the border and not tolerate cross-border terrorism.Al Mason, who conceptualised the ‘4 More Year’ video, said, “The video depicts great friendship and love between India- US - cemented by the emotional bond between Prime Minister Modi & President Trump. Trump is much loved by the community.”Mason leads Trump campaign’s outreach to the Indian-American community and is the co-chair of Trump Victory Indian-American Finance Committee. The video, he added, “will evoke mega support in terms of fund raising at the grass root level and votes for President Trump in battleground states — a must win for Trump”.The American states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida are likely won or lost by wafer-thin margins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trump-woos-indian-american-voters-with-clips-from-howdy-modi/story-eUvWEsra7WkhYnZEkXIzGO.html
24-08-2020||India||CWC meet today, Sonia Gandhi in favour of a new leader||Congress president Sonia Gandhi looks set to announce her decision to step down at Monday’s meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision-making body, after 103 Congress leaders wrote a letter to her this month, seeking a complete rehaul of the organisation.The letter, which was signed by former chief ministers and members of Parliament, alleged “drift” and “uncertainty” over the leadership of the 134-year-old party. The letter was signed by, among others, Kapil Sibal, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Shashi Tharoor, Bhupinder Hooda, Milind Deora, Manish Tewari and PJ Kurien, and delivered to her residence – 10, Janpath – on Independence Day.Hindustan Times has learnt that Gandhi responded to the letter a few days later with a hand-written note to one of the signatories.WATCH: Grand old party’s dissent within, Sonia says look for new chief According to two senior Congress leaders that HT spoke with, the 73-year-old Gandhi said Congress leaders should get together and find a new chief because she does not want to carry the responsibility of leading the party any longer.Sonia Gandhi became interim president of the Congress after Rahul Gandhi quit as the party chief in May 2019, owning responsibility for the Congress’s rout in last year’s general elections, in which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led the National Democratic Alliance to power for the second straight term.Expressing her sense of hurt at being targeted by party leaders who made the complaint against the Congress leadership public, Gandhi wrote in the note that she was not interested in leading the party and had accepted the post of interim chief after much persuasion only on condition that the party will find a replacement for her soon, according to the two senior leaders cited above, who requested anonymity.Congress leaders made desperate pleas to her after Rahul Gandhi rejected their calls to withdraw the resignation that he offered on May 25, 2019.For the record, party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said: “Reports of Sonia Gandhi resigning from her post of Congress president are false.” The two leaders that HT spoke to confirmed that Gandhi was inclined to resign at the CWC meeting, called to discuss the leadership issue.“If she has to resign, she may do so when she meets with the leadership tomorrow,” said one of the two leaders, requesting anonymity.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said in Gwalior: “The Congress is bound to sink; no power in the world can save it.”Also read | After letter, some Congress leaders back GandhisWhile Surjewala and other party leaders denied that she had already resigned, Monday’s CWC meeting is set to be a stormy one with a confrontation likely between those who are unhappy with the current style of functioning of the leadership (Sibal, Azad) and those that are part of the current power structure – KC Venugopal, Randeep Surjewala and Rajeev Satav, among others.In a column published in Hindustan Times on August 4, Sibal wrote about the importance of value of organizations. “The management of a large public corporation committed to growth, with a huge shareholder base, has to deal with a host of complex issues. This requires the management to listen to the voice of its shareholders — a vital input for the corporation’s strategy, operations and growth,” the Congress leader wrote.The organisers have decided to make it an extended session which will be attended by all Congress chief ministers. Chief ministers Amarinder Singh of Punjab, Ashok Gehlot of Rajasthan and Bhupesh Baghel of Chhattisgarh released statements in favour of Sonia Gandhi’s leadership.One party leader told Hindustan Times that the letter had been leaked to the media to force a discussion on the leadership issue at the CWC meeting.“This is not the right time to raise such an issue, given the need for a strong opposition against the BJP-led NDA,” said Amarinder Singh. “A move by these Congress leaders to demand a rehaul of the party at this critical juncture would be detrimental to its interests.”“It’s very unfortunate. There was no need to go to the media. I strongly believe that Sonia Gandhiji should continue at this juncture,” said Gehlot.The group of senior leaders wrote the letter after four months of deliberations, HT has learnt. While Kurien said that the full details of the letter would be released after the CWC meeting on Monday, another signatory told HT that they were forced to write the letter after months of frustration. “Senior leaders would approach the Gandhis but would be told to speak to Surjewala. How can some of these senior leaders seek a clarification from him?” the signatory added, requesting anonymity.“It’s okay that they wrote a letter and expressed their concern,” said one Congress politician from the other side, also requesting that he not be named. “What is worrying is that they have been meeting about this issue. It means they have been actively seeking change.”“She’s a very dignified lady and never wanted to be Congress president,” said CWC member and leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. “When she passes through Central Hall, she is greeted by MPs from all parties and this shows how much people regard her.”In the letter, the 23 leaders have acknowledged an erosion of the party’s support base and pointed to the lack of honest introspection after electoral defeats. The leaders have also outlined an agenda for reform — a full-time, effective, active and visible president; elections at all levels in the party (including the CWC); establishing an institutional leadership model to collectively guide the party; and a national coalition with like-minded parties, among other measures.Zoya Hasan, Professor Emerita, JNU, said: “The letter of 23 is certainly not a 1969 moment in the Congress. But it is a significant development as it is forcing the party’s hand. Such a letter has not been written in a long time. And that is its importance. Thanks to the letter, the Congress’s existential crisis is out in the open. The drift and failure to confront its deep crisis has harmed the party immensely. This uncertainty must end. Congress is divided on the leadership issue and on the role of Gandhis. If Sonia Gandhi quits, the question is who will replace her... the issue cannot be brushed under the carpet any longer. They need to sort themselves out and elect a full-time president.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cwc-meet-today-sonia-in-favour-of-a-new-leader/story-yWviR0xVHIMY2NrkH4dJBL.html
24-08-2020||India||BJP rejects report that ex-CJI Ranjan Gogoi is party CM pick||The Assam unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has rubbished former chief minister and veteran Congress leader Tarun Gogoi’s claim that former Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi could be the BJP’s CM candidate for next year’s assembly polls in the northeastern state. “People utter a lot of meaningless stuff when they grow very old, we would put Gogoi’s statement in that category. I have met many former chief ministers, but no one makes such baseless assertions like Gogoi. There is no iota of truth in what he said,” Assam BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass said. On Saturday, Tarun Gogoi, 85, who was the chief minister from 2001 to 2016, had told journalists in Guwahati that the former CJI, who took his oath as a nominated Rajya Sabha MP in March this year, could be the BJP’s CM face in 2021. “I have heard from my sources that Ranjan Gogoi’s name is in the list of BJP’s probable chief minister candidates. I suspect he might be projected as the CM by the party in the next assembly polls,” Tarun Gogoi said. “BJP is happy with Ranjan Gogoi for the Ayodhya Ram mandir verdict and therefore he was nominated as a Rajya Sabha MP after his retirement. Gogoi could have refused to be a Rajya Sabha MP, but his acceptance shows he is interested in active politics,” he added. Tarun Gogoi, who represents the Titabar seat in the Assam assembly, said that he would contest next year’s elections, but will not be the Congress’s prospective CM candidate. On Saturday, Congress and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) agreed to form an alliance against the ruling BJP in the 2021 polls. “There’s nothing to comment on Tarun Gogoi’s utterances. It seems he knows more about our party than those who are in the BJP,” said Assam BJP’s chief spokesperson Rupam Goswami.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-rejects-report-that-ex-cji-gogoi-is-party-cm-pick/story-p6JuOzppO4ecQoSGoE7krL.html
24-08-2020||India||Locals not consulted on Bhagirathi plan: Experts||Independent expert members on a committee appointed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to prepare the Bhagirathi Eco-Sensitive Zone’s zonal master plan (ZMP) and independent members of a panel formed to scrutinise the ZMP have written to the government saying they hadn’t approved the final plan released in May.The members wrote to the Union ministry of water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation and the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) expressing their concerns over the plan released by the latter, saying they had concluded that the document was “flawed” and not in consonance with a 2012 notification of the project.One of the main concerns raised by the panel is that the ZMP was to be prepared specifically “in consultation with local people, particularly women”. The Bhagirathi Eco-Sensitive Zone stretches from Gaumukh to Uttarkashi in Uttarakhand and covers an area of 4,179.56 square kilometres, including 88 villages.But the letter, written by nine independent members,a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times, stated the draft ZMP was not translated into Hindi and, as a result, was never put before the panchayats and villagers for their comments and suggestions before the final document was prepared.“We had no inputs from villagers and panchayats for whom the ZMP was being prepared. The ZMP submitted for approval violates the letter and spirit of the BESZ notification,” the letter stated.The members wrote that the ZMP was a compilation of departmental proposals primarily based on current schemes, which are unacceptable because they lacked public feedback.Expert members also raised concerns about several unaddressed issues in the final ZMP such as land use change, local participation and scope for panchayats in taking decisions and on highway widening, which will lead to the felling of over 12,000 trees, including 6,000 Deodar trees“The plan, which was sent to the MoEFCC by the Uttarakhand government, is a compilation of departmental plans. It’s not what people have asked for or recommended. Five token consultations were carried out by the district magistrates in 2017 but we were never told what responses were received from the public. Women community members were not the focus of these token consultations,” said Ravi Chopra, who is a part of the 11-member ZMP scrutiny committee that was set up following a Supreme Court (SC) order and the ZMP preparation committee. “All members are not supposed to approve the ZMP. Additional chief secretary of Uttarakhand government was heading the drafting panel. He must have approved the ZMP in consultation with other members. The job of Union ministry of water resources was to get the draft plan scrutinised by an 11-member scrutiny committee. We had forwarded their comments to MoEFCC as it is the approving authority,” said UP Singh, secretary, ministry of water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation.On July 29, HT had reported on differences of opinion among several committee members, who had raised concerns about the final ZMP. For instance, some members had pointed out that slope cutting could be fraught with danger for the region’s fragile ecology. “Therefore, the undersigned, who were entrusted with this task by the Hon’ble Supreme Court and by the Hon’ble NGT, hereby declare that the abovementioned ‘approved ZMP’ does not have our consent or approval, nor does it consist of our scrutiny,” the letter added.RP Gupta, secretary, environment ministry, could not be reached for a comment on Sunday but his office confirmed that it had received the letter from panel members.“The process of designing and notifying any ESZ sets the foundation of how much its mandate is accepted and enforced. This is not just important for the conservation of the area but also for determining social, ecological and economic futures. Without this, ESZs can be non-starters,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/locals-not-consulted-on-bhagirathi-plan-experts/story-aEK7o36cNOodOwfQGqdATK.html
24-08-2020||India||Relief for Swara Bhasker as AG refuses action in contempt case||Attorney general KK Venugopal on Sunday declined to grant permission for the initiation of criminal contempt of court proceedings against Bollywood actor Swara Bhasker for a statement that a petitioner said was critical of the Supreme Court and its judgment in the Ayodhya title dispute case.Bhasker’s statement that the Supreme Court acknowledged the illegality of the demolition of the Babri Masjid in its November 2019 judgment and yet rewarded those who brought down the mosque “appears to be a factual statement” and reflects Bhasker’s perception of the incident, Venugopal said in his letter to the petitioner, Usha Shetty, declining the request. “The statement appears to be a factual one and is a perception of the speaker. The comment refers to the judgment of the Supreme Court, and is not an attack on the institution. This does not offer any comment on the Supreme Court itself or say anything that would scandalize or lower the authority of the Supreme Court. In my opinion, this statement does not constitute criminal contempt,” the AG’s letter stated.The plea against Bhasker, which was filed by Shetty on August 17, was placed before AG for his consent to list the matter before the court.As per Section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act and Rule 3 of Rules to Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of Supreme Court, the consent of the AG or the solicitor general is required before the apex court can hear a criminal contempt petition filed by an individual.The November 9 judgment of the Supreme Court in the Ayodhya dispute, which was delivered by a bench headed by then Chief Justice of India ( CJI) Ranjan Gogoi, had awarded the 2.77 acre disputed site for the construction of . a temple; it directed the Centre to allocate a five-acre plot elsewhere for the construction of a new mosque. The 16th Century Babri mosque was demolished in December 1992 by Hindu activists who believe that the site marks the birthplace of the warrior-god Ram. The top court had acknowledged the existence of a valid mosque at the disputed site and had expressly stated that the acts of Hindus in placing idols inside the mosque in 1949 and destruction of the mosque in 1992 were illegal.Bhasker had, on February 1, attended a panel discussion organized by the non-government organisation (NGO) Mumbai Collective on the topic Artists Against Communalism. During the discussion, Bhasker, as alleged by the petitioner, made the following statement:“We are now in a situation where our courts are not sure whether they believe in the Constitution or not…We are living in a country where the Supreme Court of our country states in a judgment that the demolition of Babri Masjid was unlawful and in the same judgment rewards the same people who brought down the mosque.”Regarding Bhasker’s statement about courts not believing in the Constitution, the AG said that it was a vague and general statement not related to any particular court and cannot be taken seriously.Venugopal had on, August 20, asked the Supreme Court not to punish lawyer Prashant Bhushan for contempt of court in relation to his tweets against Supreme Court and current CJI SA Bobde.After AG declined permission, Shetty’ lawyers on Sunday wrote to solicitor general Tushar Mehta, seeking his consent.Shetty submitted that the statement by Bhasker was derogatory and intended to scandalize the Supreme Court. It is not merely a cheap stunt for publicity, but a deliberate attempt to incite the masses to “resist and revolt against the apex court,” she added.“The statement intends to incite feeling of no confidence amongst public with respect to the proceedings of the Supreme Court. It amounts to criminal contempt,” the petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/relief-for-swara-as-ag-refuses-action-in-contempt-case/story-ScKkOALOpzafSFBvyQZx5I.html
24-08-2020||India||Dissent brewed over aloof leadership?||The letter of dissent by top Congress leaders was triggered by a combination of factors -- primarily the exclusion of seniors in decision-making and contentious internal appointments -- according to several of the over 100 signatories Hindustan Times spoke to.A communication breakdown between the Gandhis and other leaders in the party was cited by the signatories, who said only party general secretary KC Venugopal and national spokesperson Randeep Surjewala had access to the top leadership.“There are just three people running the party: Sonia Gandhi, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi. Nobody else has been consulted for anything in the last three years,’’ said one of the leading signatories who did not wish to be named.The dissenters that HT spoke to said their letter was a wake-up call to get the party ready ahead of the 2024 elections. “It’s now been exactly 15 months since the loss and yet there has been no tangible way forward that has been pointed out,’’ said one of the Lok Sabha members of Parliament who signed.Also read | Most Congress workers would like to see Rahul Gandhi lead the party: Sachin PilotA Rajya Sabha member among the signatories said, “There has been no manthan (introspection) at all. We are not asking for any key positions. We have thanked the ex-president and the president but we want someone to stand up and say that the nation is more important.’’HT has learnt that one of the key triggers was Sonia Gandhi’s speech at the all-party meeting called by the Prime Minister after the Galwan Valley clash in June in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. At the meeting, Gandhi was the only leader who took a critical position against the government, asking questions pertaining to an intelligence failure and of Chinese forces building up along the LAC.“This was a key foreign policy issue and yet none of the experts in the party who are dealing with foreign policy were consulted. There was a feeling that a stand should be taken by the party by consensus,’’ said one of the leaders.Key foreign policy experts among the signatories include former UN envoy-turned-MP Shashi Tharoor and former Union minister Anand Sharma.Also read | Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel urges Rahul Gandhi to return as Congress chiefThe leaders who met on Sunday evening also dismissed the “coterie” that surrounded Rahul Gandhi. “They are kids. Why don’t we have a parliamentary board which is elected? Why is everyone nominated whether it is to the CWC or to the extended CWC?’’ said one of the persons who organised the signatures.While the exit of senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, who moved to the BJP, added to the unease, appointments of Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury as Lok Sabha leader to, most recently, that of Ajay Maken as general secretary upset many of these leaders.“There is no understanding as to what qualifies someone for an appointment. There is nothing against Maken or Chowdhury but why isn’t there a discussion?’’ said the person cited above.The other camp within the party dismissed these concerns as stemming from personal uncertainties. Its members pointed out that key signatory Ghulam Nabi Azad’s term as Leader of the Opposition (LoP) will end on February 15 next year and there is no indication that he will get re-elected around that time. Azad is also the party general secretary in charge of Haryana.Similarly, general secretary Mallikarjun Kharge’s entry into the Rajya Sabha has diminished deputy leader Anand Sharma’s chances of becoming the LoP. His term ends in April 2022.“The others are all feeling sidelined in the party,” said a Congress functionary.While charges flew thick and fast, the signatories and their supporters said they would not stay silent any longer. They said their next course of action would be determined after the CWC meeting on Monday....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dissent-brewed-over-aloof-leadership/story-2czfPIRTCxjZHA1tV8URwK.html
24-08-2020||India||12.7 per cent dip in diesel demand in July||Diesel consumption, a bellwether of economic performance,declined 12.7% in July compared to the previous month mainly because of demand constraints, heavy rains in parts of the country and weekend lockdowns imposed in several areas to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) .Consumption of diesel in July dropped to 5.5 million tonnes (MMT) compared to 6.3 million tonnes in June. Overall consumption of petroleum products also dropped 3.7% drop to 15.7 million tonnes compared to 16.3 million tonnes in the previous month, according to the oil ministry’s data-keeper Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC). The July consumption of diesel compared with 6.8 million tonnes in the same month last year. A contraction in the use of diesel eased from -55.5% in April year-on-year to -29.3% in May and -15.4% in June after the coronavirus disease lockdown was gradually relaxed starting on June 1. The trend, however, saw a reversal in July with a 19.3% contraction.year-on-year..Experts said diesel demand typically decrease in the monsoon months of July and August, and reckoned that an uptick in the economic activity after Unlock 1.0 should be sustainable in the coming months. The country had been under a 68-day lockdown since March 25. It started opening up gradually from June 1, with Unlock 1.0. The Union government on June 29 issued guidelines for Unlock 2.0 to lift more restrictions imposed to stop the spread of Covid-19 pandemic effective for a month from July 1.Ram Singh, a professor at the Delhi School of Economics, said a drop in diesel demand in July compared to June does not indicate any major blip in the ongoing economic recovery, which will continue in the coming months. “Diesel consumption saw a jump in June because of pent-up demand after the lockdown... Besides, the onset of monsoon in July also reduced demand for diesel [for irrigation],” he said.SC Sharma, an energy expert and a former officer on special duty at the erstwhile Planning Commission, said: “High consumption of diesel in June occurs due to harvesting and to some extent DG [diesel generator] based electricity demand. However, as monsoon enters, the agriculture and power demand is largely met from monsoon water as also wind power and hydro power. Accordingly, diesel demand goes down by 15% to 20% during July, August every year.” According to the latest Industry Consumption Report published by the PPAC, “certain restrictions at state and district levels coupled with lower demand for products and services” moderated the speed of recovery in diesel consumption to the pre-Covid level..The report pointed tot key factors affecting diesel consumption in July. “Unlock 2.0 has carried forward the economic recovery but in moderated pace. Most of the industries across states are operating at 70 to 80% capacity due to a subdued demand,” it said.Weekend lockdowns and other restrictions imposed by state and district administrations to curtail the spread of Covid-19 have also affected the consumption of diesel, it said. While rural demand on account of agriculture related activities continues to drive consumption growth, flooding in Bihar and some northeastern states has also affected consumption, it added.The report said diesel consumption in July 2020 was also affected by other factors such as slow growth in sales of commercial vehicles and a decline in port traffic. “Commercial vehicle sales as reported by individual companies are showing a slow pace to recovery. Major automobile companies have reported a fall in sale of M&HCV [medium and heavy commercial vehicle] by about -70% and of LCV [light commercial vehicle] by about -30%,” it said.According to the report, the traffic handled at major ports in India recorded a contraction of 13.2% and collectively they handled 51.5 million tonnes of cargo during July 2020 as against 59.3 million tonnes handled during the corresponding period of the previous year....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-7-dip-in-diesel-demand-in-july/story-A785vDisice69yD3KCz9QJ.html
24-08-2020||India||Contempt of court provision vague: Former Supreme Court, High Court judges||A provision in the Contempt of Courts Act of 1971 that criminalises statements on grounds of “scandalizing” the court is vague and susceptible to a dubious interpretation, former Supreme Court and high court judges said.Scandalising the court as grounds for criminal contempt is found in Section 2( c)(i) of the 1971 Act and states that a publication or act will amount to such contempt if it “scandalises or lowers the authority of any court”.“The definition of criminal contempt on the ground of scandalising the court is very vague. The word ‘scandalising’ must be clarified by giving a precise definition of what ‘scandalising the court’ means. That is essential because the provision entails serious criminal consequences,” said retired Supreme Court judge V Gopala Gowda.Section 2( c)(i) has come under the scanner recently after proceedings were initiated against lawyer Prashant Bhushan under that provision for his tweets critical of the Supreme Court and the current Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde.“The word ‘scandalising’ is subjective and will depend on the perception of the concerned person. The provision is not clear as to whether it has to be looked at from the perception of the court, the individual judge or public. As long as the words ‘scandalising the court’ are present (in the statute book), it will be susceptible to arbitrary exercise of power,” retired Madras high court judge K Chandru said.Prashant Bhushan’s case is not an isolated example and there have been many instances in the past when cases were initiated for criticism of the judiciary.“In Tamil Nadu, a person who used to run a magazine, wrote a letter to the high court after the high court had acquitted a murder accused. The letter stated that since the high court has acquitted the accused, it should tell public as to who is the actual culprit. The high court punished him for criminal contempt of court. What is ‘scandalising’ in that letter? He was not attributing any motives to the judges. It was only an immature statement and also showed the person’s lack of understanding of criminal law. Such instances go unnoticed because the people punished are not famous persons,” retired justice Chandru said.India’s contempt of court law is derived from British law, but in 2013, the United Kingdom abolished ‘scandalising the judiciary’ as a form of contempt of court on the grounds that this went against freedom of expression while retaining other forms of contempt like behaviour causing disruption or interference with court proceedings.“One of the reasons why England, in 2013, repealed scandalising judiciary as a ground for contempt is to allow constructive criticism. A strong judiciary in a democratic republic is the bulwark of masses of this country. It must work towards fulfilling the goals set out in the constitution -- to secure social economic and political justice for the masses and to uphold their fundamental rights. If the judiciary is not functioning keeping in mind these objectives, an individual, be it a lawyer, law student or a layman, should have the freedom to point out the same and it cannot be said to be criminal contempt. Freedom of expression is a fundamental right,” retired justice Gowda said.Is this fundamental right being curtailed by courts using contempt of court provisions?“Judges are using this as a weapon to silence critics. The word ‘scandalises’ is susceptible to dubious interpretation. Therefore, it has to go. It violates Article 14 and 21 of the constitution,” said retired justice Chandru.Contempt of court law is intended to protect the institution and not individual judges and the law should not be used to stifle healthy criticism, retired justice Gowda said.“Majesty of the court is built on its functioning and its judgments. There are thousands of cases in which directions of Supreme Court and high courts are not being implemented. If courts decide to initiate civil contempt in all those cases, then the entire institution will have to function only for hearing contempt proceedings,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contempt-of-court-provision-vague-former-sc-hc-judges/story-0rzJOODbOyIIrqrJhQwxnM.html
24-08-2020||India||After letter, some Congress leaders back Gandhis||Congress chief ministers, state units and senior leaders rallied in support of the Gandhi family on Sunday and urged Rahul Gandhi to take the reins without delay after a section of the party wrote to interim chief Sonia Gandhi and sought an overhaul of the organisation,complaining of “drift” and uncertainty in the leadership. The also termed as unfortunate a move by this group of party leaders to challenge the Gandhi family leadership ahead of the crucial Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on Monday. The development has exposed a deep divide in the grand old party on the leadership issue. Congress chief ministers Amarinder Singh (Punjab), Ashok Gehlot (Rajasthan), Bhupesh Baghel (Chhattisgarh) and V Narayanasamy (Puducherry ), state unit chiefs DK Shivakumar (Karnataka), Balasaheb Thorat (Maharashtra), Anil Kumar (Delhi), KS Alagiri (Tamil Nadu) and Ripun Bora (Assam), Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, former union ministers Salman Khurshid and Ashwani Kumar, Youth Congress chief Srinivas BV, Lok Sabha MP Manickam Tagore and former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah all backed the Gandhi family, urging Sonia Gandhi to stay on until Rahul Gandhi is ready to take charge once again. Rahul Gandhi resigned in May 2019, taking responsibility for the Congress’s rout in general elections, and Sonia Gandhi reluctantly became interim chief. Opposing the bid to challenge the Gandhi family leadership, Captain Amarinder Singh said this was not the time to raise such an issue. “The move by these Congress leaders to demand a rehaul of the party at this critical juncture would be detrimental to its interests, and the interests of the nation. What the Congress needs is a leadership that is acceptable not just to a few but to the entire party, through its rank and file, and the nation at large,” he said, adding that the Gandhis fitted the role. “Sonia Gandhi should continue to helm the Congress as long as she wants,” he said, adding that Rahul Gandhi should thereafter take over as he is fully capable of leading the party. Gehlot termed the letter written by the 23 party leaders to Sonia Gandhi as unfortunate and said the Gandhi family has kept the party united. “News of 23 senior most Congress leaders writing letter to Hon’ble CP is unbelievable and if it is true - it’s very unfortunate, was no need to go in media. I strongly believe that Hon’ble CP Smt Sonia Gandhi ji should continue to lead the party at this crucial juncture where the fight is to save the ethos of our Democracy. She has always taken challenges head on. But if she has made up her mind,-I believe @RahulGandhi should come ahead and be the Congress President as country faces the biggest challenge to save our Constitution,Democracy,” he tweeted. The Chhattisgarh chief minister wrote a letter to Rahul Gandhi, urging him to return as the party chief. “Hon’ble Sonia ji and Rahul ji are the ray of hope for us in every challenge. We are all with you. Millions of party workers and people of Chhattisgarh and the entire nation are with you…,” Baghel wrote on Twitter.“I saw the news in some newspapers that ex Congressmen wanted overhaul and changes in Congress party This kind of statement will create confusion in the minds of millions of Congress men This a ploy by BJP to divert attention of people from Facebook controversy,” the Puducherry chief minister tweeted, referring to a report in Wall Street Journal that Facebook had favoured a soft approach towards hate speech by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) politicians . Siddaramaiah tweeted, “It is unfortunate that the leadership of Gandhi family is being questioned by few. In these difficult times of undeclared emergency and attack on democracy by BJP, we should collectively strive to strengthen Congress and not weaken it.” Ashwani Kumar and Salman Khurshid spoke against elections to the party president’s post and favoured a consensus. They argued that elections would be divisive. Thorat described Rahul Gandhi as a “courageous, sensitive and intellectually committed leader” and demanded that he lead the party. He said Sonia Gandhi should continue to lead the Congress as its interim president until Rahul Gandhi takes over as the full-time president. “With due respect to Rahulji’s sentiments, we would like to say, ‘Come Back, Rahulji’. Under your leadership, we will be the voice of millions of Indians, we are determined to make history. This is not only the need of the Congress party but the need of the entire country as well,” said Thorat. The Delhi Congress, after an emergency meeting. adopted a resolution demanding Rahul Gandhi’s return as the party’s chief without delay. The meeting, presided over by the Delhi unit chief, noted that some senior leaders going public with their call for a change in the leadership had given “ammunition” to Congress opponents to mount an attack on the party, demoralising its cadre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-letter-some-cong-leaders-back-gandhis/story-QR98Qeg8IH9Q6uO8mtCnGP.html

The Pune-based company’s clarification said that the government has granted it permission to only manufacture Covishield and stockpile it for future use, according to news agency ANI. It has also said, according to ANI, that Covishield will be commercialised once trials are proven successful and requisite regulatory approvals are in place.

24-08-2020||Editorials||Announce another fiscal stimulus||On August 22, this newspaper published an exclusive report based on a presentation made by the ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The presentation said that as on August 1, three-fourths of India’s MSMEs were working at less than half their potential capacity. It also said that more than 90% had opened up, showing that the unlock process, at least in principle, has been almost completed. These statistics underline the central economic challenge facing the economy. Just allowing enterprises to open is not going to restore the status quo ante, which existed before the pandemic forced a nationwide lockdown. To be sure, the economy was not in great shape even before the pandemic. GDP growth rate fell from 8.3% in 2016-17 to 7%, 6.1% and 4.2% in 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20. Most estimates expect India’s GDP to contract by 5% or more this year. MSMEs account for 30% of GDP. They employ almost one-fourth of India’s workers. That an overwhelming share of MSMEs is not using even their existing capacity means that they are facing a crisis of demand. If this situation is allowed to persist, it will generate a vicious cycle. Firms will lay off workers. Laid-off workers will lose their salaries, which will further squeeze demand. Orders for new investments and raw materials will be postponed, or worse, cancelled. This will lead to yet another round of job losses and demand depression. These developments will have an adverse impact on the financial sector as well. As revenues start falling short of past expectations, loan defaults will increase, which will add to the existing mountain of bad debt. All these developments have implications for India’s economic recovery, both in the short-and-medium term. Breaking this vicious cycle requires urgent policy intervention. The government was wise to focus on liquidity challenges in its initial response to Covid-19. But it needs to shift gears. Demand, not liquidity, is the main challenge facing the economy today. At a time when consumer and business sentiment is down, the only way to boost demand is a fiscal stimulus. While there is some merit in the argument that it should be timed appropriately, at least the road map should be laid out as soon as possible. Any further delay on this front will only make matters worse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/announce-another-fiscal-stimulus/story-rojRt2LO5F5J8er2uO4RXL.html
24-08-2020||Editorials||The 2013 floods lie forgotten in Uttarakhand’s new construction plans||On Sunday, the Rishikesh-Badrinath Highway in Uttarakhand’s Tehri Garhwal district was blocked due to a landslide, which killed two people. In addition to the closure of this critical link, 100 more roads are also blocked due to rains. While landslides are not uncommon in this area, the latest episodes are another reminder that this geologically young region is unstable and infrastructure development has to take into account the natural fragility of the area. Otherwise, the consequences can be disastrous. For example, the 2013 Uttarakhand floods were a natural phenomenon, but the human tragedy that followed was because governments overlooked geological features and drainage patterns, and allowed illegal construction on river banks and over natural water channels.Unfortunately, the 2013 experience has been erased from State memory. In July, the Centre approved the zonal master plan (ZMP) for the Bhagirathi eco-sensitive zone that stretches from Gaumukh to Uttarkashi (4179.59 sq km). While the Centre claims that ZMP will boost the ecology, environmentalists claim the opposite. The rush to clear ZMP is because the Centre wants to expedite the 900-kilometre Chardham Highways project, which will connect the four pilgrimage sites of Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath.The project is on course despite protests against it and scientific evidence that shows the region is unstable. The Geological Survey of India’s report on the 2103 tragedy says that constructions have disturbed the natural slope of the mountains, leading to landslides. While it is true that better connectivity improves lives and livelihoods and ensures political dividends, the fragility of the area is also a reality. The government must calculate the region’s carrying capacity, and then draw up its development and tourism plans. In an era of the climate crisis, this road map is a prerequisite, not a choice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-2013-floods-lie-forgotten-in-uttarakhand-s-new-construction-plans/story-xlsHPfogboXTE2mfCRIIRO.html
24-08-2020||Editorials||The quest for cleaner cities||Last week, the Union government announced the results of the Swachh Survekshan 2020, an annual survey that ranks and recognises the performance of cities on sanitation and solid waste management. This year’s survey assessed 4,242 cities in 28 days, and Madhya Pradesh’s Indore topped the list of cities with more than 100,000 people. The best-performing state with more than 100 cities is Maharashtra, and with less than 100 cities is Madhya Pradesh. The cleanest capital city is New Delhi. Over the years, these rankings have mainstreamed discussions on public hygiene and pushed cities to become cleaner. For instance, before it was praised for its cleanliness drive in 2017, Indore battled a mounting garbage problem. Since then, the Indore Municipal Corporation has done away with garbage dumps, implemented 100% household-waste segregation and converted waste to usable products and partnered with non-governmental organisations to change citizen behaviour. There have also been changes in the ranking methodology to make it more competitive and robust, although some states have criticised its metrics and methodology as well. While the Centre must look into these grievances, laggard cities must also emulate the cities that are performing well. The scope and size of work will indeed be different for each city, but the basic requirements to achieve these goals are the same: Administrative and political will along with public participation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-quest-for-cleaner-cities/story-B2BykFulfLgPkgUjpaOT0H.html
