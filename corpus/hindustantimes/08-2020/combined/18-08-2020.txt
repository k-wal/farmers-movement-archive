Due to lasting concerns about transmission and a newfound aptitude for working from home, we must expect an overall reduced demand and an increased preference for personal modes of transport. Unhindered, there is a high likelihood that there would be a permanent modal shift towards automobiles that would spatially and environmentally overload our cities and substantively impact our quality of life. Consequentially, this would threaten the financial viability of transit operators, especially those already stretched thin before the hit in ridership, and will further tilt the scales away from an optimal urban transportation landscape.On the other hand, this crisis also presents an opportunity to guide the recovery of urban transport towards long-term development goals. Transport networks in Indian cities, whether public or private, road or rail-based, are severely overburdened. Investment in infrastructure to address more effective circulation and interchange of people and goods will have an economic multiplier effect — both job-creation in the present and boosting growth and productivity in the future. But where should we focus our energy and resources to have long-lasting and positive change while providing the most bang for our buck?First, direct efforts towards accessibility instead of only mobility. While mobility focuses on movement of people and goods and the distances they cover, accessibility emphasises the ability of people to obtain the same goods, services, and activities without necessarily having to move, or at least move as much. Accessibility necessitates rethinking our cities to optimally integrate transportation with land uses to increase proximity, connectivity, and convenience. One method for this, Transit Oriented Development (TOD), has been discussed and studied in the Indian context for over a decade, with even a National TOD Policy framed in 2017, but little progress has been seen on ground. TOD is a concept that has come of age, and its implementation to enable access to live-work-play triangles without needing to commute long distances will be a game-changer for the urbanscape.Second, facilitate the increased demand for personal modes through non-motorised modes, not just cars and two-wheelers. According to a United Nations Environment Programme report in 2014, even in a large city like Delhi, 48% of trips were less than two kilometres (km) and another 14% were between two and four kms. The high frequency of short distance commutes shows that alternative modes are easily manageable and feasible to adopt.Kolkata has already taken the lead to cater to the recent increase in demand for cycling by permitting bicyclists to cut through neighbourhood lanes, thereby reducing their travel distance. While certainly a step in the right direction, this is not enough, and a strong enabling environment is necessary to create a lasting change. In addition to such policies that prioritise non-motorised modes, infrastructure such as designated spaces, routes and crossings to promote safety, bike-share systems to promote availability, and water fountains, wash facilities, and trees to promote user comfort are essential to make active modes more widespread than only the current captive users.Third, integrate pricing of all modes of transport, private and public, to ensure continuity of public operators of transport in the context of reduced transit demand. Reduced transit ridership is not always a bad thing in the Indian context since public transit operators have historically operated at crush loads. However, it would place these operators in financial jeopardy with existential risks. The resulting reduced availability of transit will have a compounding effect by pushing users towards personal modes and will be detrimental to our clogged cities. Such a shift will affect the fabric of sustainable transport infrastructure of Indian cities and must be avoided in any scenario. We need pricing measures that disincentivise private vehicle adoption through congestion pricing, parking charges, and variable pricing to modulate demand, and channel revenues from these to cross-subsidise public transit.With such measures, we will be able to moderate the demand for the private automobile, adequately increase transit supply, allow for social distancing, and cater to the long under-invested transportation infrastructure of our cities.Transport is the backbone around which a city functions. A radical transformation is needed, and we must only look at instances of global cities that used transportation to rejuvenate and reinvent themselves away from the auto-centric cities they once were — Istanbul transformed itself through pedestrianisation, Amsterdam by inculcating a bicycling culture, Bogota through integrating bus networks and land use, and Seoul by turning urban highways into public places. India must use this crisis as an opportunity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/moving-urban-india-after-the-covid-19-pandemic-opinion/story-dGqF2c8hHOgyZj52OLFhSM.html

This is essential to preserve India’s traditional strengths and ensure it doesn’t fall into the same trap as other countries, which have lost their livelihoods and indigenous traditions.In India, textiles comprise the second-largest sector after agriculture. Its potential for creating wealth is enormous. India has a living tradition of handicrafts, practised on an everyday basis. All India’s crafts are inherited through guilds which have a long history, and this is their inherent intellectual property. This specialisation offers employment to an estimated 16 million people in the country.When the pandemic hit Europe, Italy, Spain and France were among the countries affected. But think of another element they had in common. The relentless growth of fashion empires, and their diversification into billion-dollar licensing arrangements made fashion in Europe very powerful, early on in the game. They began to dictate the terms of the luxury goods trade through very effective marketing, and new products. These companies dominated global markets. They soon started producing their prime goods elsewhere, and to better their margins, began hiring Chinese tailors, off the books, and gave them licence to manufacture copies of their garments, cheaper and faster. In the process, they were willing to teach them the secrets of family-owned businesses and enhance their capability to produce couture garments — sometimes giving them the patterns to do so to buy them at a fraction of the cost of European manufactured goods.The Chinese learned the craft swiftly and, very soon, they were a force to be recognised, as they used “Made in France” labels on much cheaper copies. In Italy, the hub of luxury good manufacturers, too, their numbers proliferated and they displaced traditional Italian family enterprises. One of the major production areas, incidentally, is in and around the city of Wuhan, a textile hub of low-end garments for the world. The Western world, in its pursuit for cheap merchandise, has still not recognised that selling their know-how created adverse long-term consequences, and perhaps not just in fashion.This story has repeated itself elsewhere. Uzbekistan is at the heart of a complex nomadic and oasis culture in Central Asia and is a significant stretch of the famous Silk Road route. The cities down the historic road were the most prolific in their textile language and produce, as caravans, traded their textile ikats and embroideries with the world down the ages. A few years ago, I went there on a trip to study their traditional ikats. The Fergana valley, the birth place of Babar, was supposed to be the richest in terms of traditional crafts. But, barring a few exceptions, the genius of textiles that I was looking for was elusive. The women, unfortunately, were clad in velvet and synthetic kaftans, looking quite alien from their surroundings. They were all wearing kaftans, manufactured and printed in China, using copies of patterns from traditional ikats. The only place today where genuine textiles still exist is India.And that is the issue.India is as prone to losing its textile crafts to another country as the others. It only needs to look at its past. The British brought down India’s share in textile exports to the world from 25% to 2%, taking over the production of Indian-inspired cloth from the 18th to the 20th century. By a miracle, Indian textiles have survived through the efforts of revivalists in the post-Independence era, such as Kamala Devi Chattopdhyaya and Pupul Jayakar.We are already seeing Chinese inroads in the Benaras sari markets, where there are jacquard copies of the Benaras-bordered tanchoi saris selling in the market for a song.China is predatory. It has always been known for its sericulture, as India has been for its unusual silk yarns, which were hand twisted and woven with a great deal of expertise to keep the saris pliable, soft and easy to pleat. I have done wardrobes for the Miss Universe and Miss World pageants for many years. I always would propose they wear the Benaras sari to a function, but gave up as I could not find a sari which draped softly and looked the way the Ravi Verma saris looked in his paintings. I then studied Benaras silk saris for a few years in an effort to find out what had changed the saris radically from exotic, sexily-contoured unstitched garments to the present, stiff totally unwearable, saris which balloon out. It was incredible to discover that the reason was that the original yarns from Bhagalpur which were hand-spun, with no twist, called paat-baana, without which the beautiful masterpieces of Benaras could not have been woven, had been substituted by Chinese yarns. This changed the structure totally and made them unattractive to wear. The tragedy of the silence of the looms of Varanasi is that people continue to weave this imported yarn because it is cheap.Benaras can survive and sustain itself adequately if we revert to the original yarns. We have indigenous mulberry silks from Karnataka, which are softer, finer, lighter and allow for more pliability when woven and have a wonderful texture. Organic ahimsa silks from the terai regions, India’s tussars and mogas, are an intrinsic part of our heritage. If even one family in India owns one good Benaras sari in their wardrobe, which a young bride would like to possess, the city will have no problem keeping its weavers employed.China dumped silk yarn in India at prices a fraction of their costs initially, and then slowly raised the prices to set up a lucrative business. The business, unfortunately, is run by middlemen, ignorant of the fact that they are producing goods which are unwearable and at the same time enhancing dependence on Chinese silk yarn. A ban on imports of this yarn will perhaps affect production for a while, but we have the resilience in our textile techniques and as a country that taught the world the beauty of producing textiles, can easily find alternatives.Covid-19 is a wake-up call. India must preserve its textiles. The beauty of the peacock must not succumb to the fire of the dragon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-china-is-destroying-our-textiles-writes-ritu-kumar/story-X1bPluYO4bBQye3cvn3Q5J.html
18-08-2020||News||Pandit Jasraj: The Tansen of our times | Opinion||Pandit Martand Jasraj was deeply embedded in India’s national psyche and was an inimitable part of its cultural ethos. This void is irreplaceable. In my life, even more so. I do not recall of any auspicious occasion, from my house-warming to the marriage of my son, which were not blessed by his magical voice.He was the last of the great quartet in our classical vocal tradition comprising Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, an exponent of the Kirana Gharana; Kishori Amonkar, an exponent of the Jaipur Gharana; Girija Devi, an exponent of the Seniya and Banaras gharanas; and Pandit Jasraj, an exponent of the Mewati Gharana. Given my passion for Indian music, I was privileged to share a personal bond with all of them. However, there are some characteristics which were exclusive to him.His magnanimity, indulgence and equanimity were unique to him. On no occasion did I find him irritated, complaining of either an inattentive audience or any transient illness. On one occasion, when I remarked about his viral fever, he jocularly answered that the presence of such distinguished music lovers and our enthusiasm had made his discomfort vanish.Born in Hisar, Panditji traversed a long distance in his life from various traditions, imbibing the essentials of different styles of singing. I have heard some recitals of him being taught by his elder brother, Pandit Maniram, and it is amazing to hear the re-orchestration of the best guru-shishya tradition.As an exponent of the Mewati Gharana, he sought to blend various musical styles, not confined to ghayal alone. In this sense, he had a futuristic vision. He recognised that the classical tradition, without losing its purity of form and content, must evolve. That is why, while learning from the Mewati Gharana, he improvised on his musical styles, particularly kirtan. He also innovated the well-known Jasrangi, which involved both the female artist and himself performing collectively for wider community acceptance. After all, the Om Namo Bhagwate Vasudevaya Namaha, which he sang on many occasions, comes with a supreme sense of spirituality unique to Jasraj and which invoked instant community participation. In imbibing the classical tradition, he constantly sought to improvise and improve on it.On a special occasion, on May 8, 1998, it was a hot and humid afternoon. He decided to sing a raga Dhulia Malhar, which he explained at length was a precursor of the rains and where the rain particles are often mixed with dust particles to produce intense dust storms preceding the rainfall. As he continued his singing on that hot afternoon, clouds appeared from nowhere. It started drizzling, which cooled the atmosphere greatly. The magical appearance of the clouds and the rains from nowhere reminded everyone present there of the legendary Tansen. It was said that Tansen could summon the rains while singing Malhar and light up the lamps during Deepak.Undoubtedly, Pandit Jasraj, whom we all experienced in that evening, was the 21st century Tansen in drawing legendary powers to invoke the gods and spirituality so much needed by humans.In a sense, it is somewhat ironical that a man born in Hisar, travelling through the entire orbit of the musical traditions of India, and from Hyderabad, then to Sanand, then as the supreme national star, would have passed away in New Jersey. My only comfort in this time of grief is that he left us doing what he best loved — educating and teaching students on the great Indian cultural tradition of classical music, of which he was the noblest interpreter. Following his calling of globalising the Indian classical music tradition, he founded schools in Atlanta, Tampa, Vancouver, Toronto, New York, New Jersey, Pittsburgh, Mumbai and Kerala.Durga Jasraj, his loving daughter, who was trained assiduously by her father, looked after him to the very end. He had greatly encouraged her in promoting the Tiranga in close cooperation with the notable poet and lyricist Javed Akhtar. For me, this sudden shock is all the more poignant because I had often spoken to him during his stay in New Jersey and he constantly assured me of his well-being and how much he was looking forward to singing for avid music lovers after his early return to India. Alas, this will remain our unfulfilled dream.On his passing, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi said, “The unfortunate demise of Pandit Jasraj Ji leaves a deep void in the Indian cultural sphere. Not only were his renditions outstanding, he also made a mark as an exceptional mentor to several other vocalists.” Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, with whom I worked, greatly loved and admired the music of Pandit Jasraj. He had described him as “Rasraj”, the king of rasas. In 2019, the International Astronomical Union even named a minor planet orbiting between Mars and Jupiter as “Jasraj” after him, enchanting the Gods as part of our planetary constellation.The great legacy of the spirituality, which Indian classical music represents, must be nurtured. Pandit Jasraj had a lasting lesson for all of us that traditions must remain contemporary and relevant to the life of a common person. Mainstreaming Indian classical music with community participation was his lasting contribution. May the Tiranga fly high.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/pandit-jasraj-the-tansen-of-our-times-opinion/story-LhaqjHQM2miI1pFVX1dhZK.html
18-08-2020||Mumbai||422 new deaths reported in Maharashtra; govt wary of Covid-19 spread during Ganeshotsav||Maharashtra reported 422 new Covid-19 fatalities on Tuesday, taking the state’s toll up to 20,687, while 11,119 fresh infections pushed up the case count to 615,477. Of the 422 deaths, however, 327 were from the past 48 hours, 67 from last week and 28 are from the period before last week, according to the state health department. The state authorities are currently wary of a spike in cases if people crowd places during Ganeshotsav, which begins on Saturday. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who has expressed concern about a second wave and warned authorities, told the latter on Tuesday to be “extra cautious during the festival”. Mumbai, meanwhile, recor-ded 931 Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, taking its tally of infections to 130,410. The city’s toll rose by 49 to 7,222. While cases in Mumbai have plateaued over the past month, Pune district, which comprises Pune City, Pune Rural and Pimpri-Chinchwad, remains the worst affected in terms of daily rise in cases and fatalities. On Tuesday, Pune City reported 1,267 new cases, Pimpri-Chinchwad 747 and Pune Rural 418. Of the 89 deaths recorded in the district, 54 were from Pune City, 16 from Pune Rural and 19 from Pimpri-Chinchwad. The state’s case fatality rate (CFR), which has been a cause for concern for the government, is still high at 3.36% against the national CFR of 1.94%.Maharashtra’s recovery rate stands at 71.14%, as 9,356 patients recovered on Tuesday, taking the total number of recovered patients to 437,870. The active Covid-19 cases in state stand at 156,608.Meanwhile, authorities are gearing up to counter a spike in cases this month-end or early September owing to crowding during Ganeshotsav. Although most parts of the state are witnessing their peak and the downward trend of infection is expected to begin by August-end, authorities and the state-level task force appointed for the clinical management of the critical patients are wary. “During today’s meeting with the collectors and divisional commissioners the chief minister has asked them to be very careful about crowding during the festival. He has asked district authorities to increase lockdown curbs during the festival and rigorously follow state guidelines. The public mandals have been asked to arrange for online darshan of Ganpati idols to avoid crowding. The CM has also been asking authorities, during review meetings, to ensure that there is no emergence of a second wave in any of the districts,” said a state official, on the condition of anonymity. Health minister Rajesh Tope said they expect the downward trend of the Covid-19 infection after mid-September. “We have been witnessing peaks across the state, but are not sure how long it will last. We have been witnessing stabilisation of cases in Malegaon, Dharavi and the spread is in control in Aurangabad. In most places, the spread has been plateaued and now the downward trend is expected,” he said, adding that district and civic authorities have been asked to go for aggressive tracking and testing and also ensure that fatality rate remains low. The CM, in the meeting with district-level officials, said parts of Maharashtra have reached their peak of Covid-19 cases, while some parts are close to getting there. “…therefore, the measures adopted till now should be implemented effectively further and without any laxity,” a statement from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) quoted Thackeray.The chief minister also urged public Ganpati mandals to implement the guidelines issued by home department. “There will not be any processions, as per guidelines, but all precautions must be taken so that there is no crowding. It is the utmost importance to see to it that spread of coronavirus does not increase due to it,” the statement further said.Dr Avinash Bhondve, Maharashtra president of Indian Medical Association, said, “After plateau, there will be fall in the cases by month-end but there is upsurge expected if the curbs are not followed properly. This may or may not be necessarily because of Ganeshotsav.”Thackeray, during the meeting, said while cases have come under control in some areas, some other districts have seen a surge in the number of patients. Thackeray directed district administrations to take guidance from the state-level Covid task force to reduce the case fatality rate. He said districts, where more patients are testing positive for coronavirus, must ensure an adequate number of ICU beds and beds with oxygen supply.Meanwhile, Tope said the state-level Covid task force will also study the cases where people who have recovered from Covid-19 are facing respiratory issues. The health minister said the topic was discussed at length during the review meeting on Tuesday.“Recently there have been cases where recovered people are facing respiratory problems and have to be admitted. Till now, we believed that the recovered patients have built an immunity to fight the virus and that they will not face any health issues. We are seeing a new form of Covid-19. In most districts we are seeing virulence and resistance by Covid-19. The task force will carry out a study on this. We will consult the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR),” Tope said, after attending the CM’s review meeting.Tope said he is for opening up of gymnasiums in the state, however, the final decision rests with the chief minister. “Under the Disaster Management Act, the chief minister has the authority to announce relaxations. As health minister, my stand is and has been that there is no harm to open up gymnasiums while maintaining social distancing. There are several people who want gyms to be opened as it helps in building immunity. The chief minister is concerned about social distancing. But for that we can issue standard operating procedure (SOP) to open up gyms,” he said.The minister said that some areas that had experienced a surge in cases are now under control. He added that following the measures will remain crucial. “In several areas such as Dharavi, Aurangabad city, Malegaon, etc, the situation is now under control. The cases there have plateaued. How high the peak will be [in a particular area] is impossible to say. We have seen that the curve is flattening where antibodies have developed in 25-30 per cent [of the population]. We will have to wait and watch, but will have to continue following out protocol in a mission mode,” said Tope.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/422-new-deaths-reported-in-maharashtra-govt-wary-of-covid-19-spread-during-ganeshotsav/story-hkOvUq1HtbffmrLafS1jMJ.html

The accused and the survivor were in a romantic relationship when he raped her and allegedly posted her nude photos on a social media site. He later told her that he would remove the pictures only if she allowed him to have sex with her again. According to the complainant’s statement, the sexual abuse took place between February and August 12, after which the woman decided to file a complaint on August 16 with Charkop police station. The survivor told police that she and the accused were in a relationship at the time of the incident. In February, he called her to his house at Naigaon in Palghar, where he allegedly raped her, and then took nude photos of her without her permission. The accused then posted her pictures online, and when she pleaded with him to delete them, he agreed to do so only if she continued to have sex with him. The accused then raped her before deleting the picture, and threatened her of dire consequences if she told anyone about the incident, said an officer from Charkop police station. He allegedly raped her on multiple occasions after that. “Following her complaint on August 16, we registered a first information report (FIR) against the accused and arrested him the same day,” added the officer. The accused has been booked under sections 376 (punishment for rape), and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and section 4 (punishment for penetrative sexual assault) 8 (punishment for sexual assault) and 12 (punishment for sexual harassment) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/22-year-old-arrested-raping-minor-in-naigaon/story-tErOvDs36s8fha69rSvenL.html

The authority is looking at engaging Indian companies to manufacture the rakes. RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA said, “We have widened the scope so that more Indian companies can participate in the process.” According to officials, companies that manufacture metro rakes can also participate in the bidding now. Earlier in June, the authority had scrapped bids after it received two responses for the tender from Chinese companies, CRRC corporation Ltd and BYD Co Ltd. A senior official from MMRDA also said that the Chinese firms were continuously asking for revisions in terms and conditions. MMRDA is looking at acquiring 10 additional rakes for 19.5 km corridor since early 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/monorail-rakes-mmrda-makes-third-attempt/story-9zczQx0bSvPK6FG0CPxkpI.html

During the investigation, the crime branch found that no theft had occurred and that the men had allegedly submitted a fake complaint at the suggestion of an advocate. The central unit of the crime branch was roped in to investigate the theft case after Prasad Nikam, 27, filed a complaint against unknown persons on August 8. Working as a team leader at the store’s Belapur office, Nikam had told the police that the money was stolen in the early hours of August 5. Nikam had claimed that the cashier Ganpat Prajapati, 21, had told their manager Manoj Boricha, 32, that he had slept at the office on the day of theft due to heavy rains. He claimed that the shutter was open when someone stole the money from the cash drawer. When the police checked for CCTV footage and questioned the staff, they found several discrepancies. More so, no suspicious activity was seen in the CCTV footage. After questioning the complainant, it was revealed that the story of theft was fake. “On August 7, the company had conducted an audit where they found that ₹2.2 lakh was a deficit in their balance. To avoid being pulled up from their superiors, Nikam, Prajapati and Boricha sought advice from an advocate who suggested them to file a false theft case,” said a crime branch officer. Police said they suspect that the trio or other staff members may have siphoned the money over the last one year in small amounts. The NRI police will now file a B-summary report before the magistrate, as the case is false and cannot go to trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/online-fruit-vegetable-store-files-fake-theft-complain-booked/story-9dvIDtGw8TowqkrGO4nZ3M.html

At present, two legislators share one bench. All legislators will be provided hand sanitisers and high-quality face covers and masks to protect themselves from the coronavirus. The Himachal assembly has 68 members, including the Vidhan Sabha speaker.There will be 10 sittings during the monsoon session that will conclude on September 18. Vidhan Sabha speaker Vipin Singh Parmar said September 10 will be a private-member day.The budget session of the assembly was cut short due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Of the 21 sittings scheduled, only 15 could be held.‘Since the budget session was cut short due to the Covid-19 crisis, we have decided to hold a longer monsoon session, “ said the CM.The main opposition party, Congress, has been continuously demanding that the government call the monsoon session of the legislative assembly. “We are expecting many issues to be taken up in the House during the monsoon session. The Covid-19 crisis should be discussed on priority,”he said. “All members of the House will be given equal opportunity to raise issues of public importance,” said ParmarThe Congress has been constantly blaming the government for handling the Covid-19 situation ineptly.During the session, the opposition will try to push the government on the backfoot by raising the issue of procurement in health department. The Congress has also charged BJP leaders of flouting social distancing norms . It escalated its attacks on chief minister Jai Ram Thakur after a deputy secretary in his office tested positive and the office was sealed for a day. Later, power minister Sukhram Chaudhary also tested positive. Former chief ministers Shanta Kumar and Prem Kumar Dhumal had gone into self-quarantine after BJP president Suresh Kashyap met them .

18-08-2020||Mumbai||Cambridge International to revise grades of June series exam||A week after results of IGCSE (Class 10), AS and A level (Class 11 and 12) qualifications for the June 2020 series were declared, Cambridge International has now decided to revise its scores.In a notice issued on its official website on Monday, the board said it will revise its earlier granted grades after receiving feedback from several schools. “We have decided that the grades we issue for the June 2020 series will not be lower than the predicted grade, submitted by the school. If a grade we issued last week was higher than the predicted grade, the higher grade will stand,” states the board’s official response. The board released the results of its June series examinations on August 10. This year, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, it had decided not to hold exams for its June 2020 series. Instead, it engaged with education authorities, governments and schools around the world to develop a robust process for awarding students with assessed grades. Revised grades will be sent to students in the coming days. “In the meantime, in order to provide immediate certainty to students, schools can inform them of the predicted grades they submitted to us. We provided this information to schools on results day,” the board stated. While very few students from the city took the June series examinations, principals said the move will help them. “Predicted grades of students which are submitted by schools are usually on the basis of their overall performance throughout the year. Matching students’ grades with those scores would help better their performance. This is especially good for students who wish to compete in the state board for college admissions as every mark matters there,” said the principal of an IGCSE school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cambridge-international-to-revise-grades-of-june-series-exam/story-ZTPWZoW1IQewtyL5noWKEO.html

The state government is planning a 500-km expressway that will connect three coastal districts of Maharashtra - Ratnagiri, Raigad and Sindhudurg.According to MSRDC, the expressway will start from Chirle in Panvel of Raigad district and connect till Patradevi at the Maharashtra-Goa border. The first part will be constructed between Chirle to Raigad-Ratnagiri district, followed by another part till Guhagar-Chiplun (NH-166E), the third stretch from Guhagar-Chiplun to Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg border and the final phase between Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg border till Patradevi. Each of the stretches will be about 100-125kms long.“We have divided the works to expedite the process,” said Radheshyam Mopalwar, vice chairman and managing director, MSRDC. The under-construction Mumbai Trans Harbour Link will also be landing at Chirle.The state authority is looking for consultants to conduct a feasibility study and prepare a detailed project report for the greenfield expressway. The project report will also dwell on the financial management, land-pooling and development of nodes along the route.In March 2020, state urban development minister Eknath Shinde had announced that a greenfield expressway will be constructed along the Maharashtra coastline. Shinde had also said that the project will help boost coastal tourism and reduce the stress along the Mumbai-Goa National Highway.MSRDC has undertaken the construction of the Samruddhi corridor, which will connect Mumbai and Nagpur in eight hours, at a cost of ₹ 55,000 crore. It has also undertaken the construction of the Versova-Bandra sea link at a cost of ₹7,000 crore and is looking at extending it till Virar at a cost of ₹24,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/msrdc-speeds-up-konkan-expressway-work-divides-it-into-four-stretches/story-NlXuqm40ycWyE7zLx5pZVO.html
18-08-2020||Mumbai||Three of five trapped Nashik leopards at SGNP to be released back to wild||The Maharashtra forest department has decided to release three of the five captured leopards from Nashik, which were transported to Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) Borivali, back to the wild.While the three leopards - two males (sub-adults) and one female (approximately 3 years old) - will be rehabilitated from captivity, another male leopard trapped during the first week of August at Nashik will be brought to the national park, said, officials.This also comes as a breather for SGNP officials as the leopard rescue centre could not accommodate any more rescued or captured leopards as its capacity was full (18 leopards across 18 cages).The decision to release the animals was based on directions passed by the state’s principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF wildlife). “I have instructed the Nashik forest department to release three leopards as early as possible since they have no connection with the human-animal conflict cases. We have ensured there is the least amount of human imprint during their temporary stay in captivity,” said Nitin Kakodkar, PCCF (wildlife), Maharashtra. These three leopards were captured on July 2, 12 and 21.Leopards from the wild kept in captivity for long alter their natural course of survival as these cats get dependent on a particular time for feeding and begin losing instincts including hunting. “Thus, their early rehabilitation is critical,” said Kakodkar.Nashik forest officials said they were aware of the release. “Either on Thursday or Friday, we will be transporting the captured adult male with us to SGNP, and taking the three leopards for release at an undisclosed location in territorial forest areas in Nashik itself,” said Vivek Bhadane, range forest officer, Nashik. Bhadane said the department had trapped 13 leopards throughout July and one the first week of August from territorial forest areas. “While five leopards were sent to SGNP, one in Nashik forest department custody, remaining were released back in the wild,” he said.Leopard captures were carried out in an attempt to address human-animal conflict across a 12-km stretch along the Darna river (between Sinnar and Eklahare) where leopard numbers had risen significantly leading to a surge in conflict with five deaths and five serious injuries reported since December 2019.A preliminary report based on the analysis tissue samples of the deceased and swab samples of the trapped leopards by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, an adult male leopard was identified to be responsible for conflict cases. “Once we realised this, we began drafting the plan to release the female leopards and the sub-adult male. However, as far as the two other captured adult males are concerned, we will await further communication from CCMB but no decision on their release has been taken so far,” said Kakodkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/three-of-five-trapped-nashik-leopards-at-sgnp-to-be-released-back-to-wild/story-fwWbN4TytPdKwq6Aw3d7IO.html
18-08-2020||Mumbai||30-year-old man held for builder’s murder||Juhu police on Tuesday arrested 30-year-old Abdul Rehman Abdul Latif Shaikh alias Sonu for the murder of 55-year-old real estate developer and chairman of Al Sofi group, Abdul Munaf Shaikh on Monday morning. Shaikh, a resident of Saifi House in Andheri, West, was walking towards the mosque at around 6am on Monday morning when an unknown person wearing a cap attacked the builder from behind, slit his throat and stabbed him multiple times with a chopper. According to Juhu police officers, Sonu was unhappy that his father had sold a plot measuring three acres at Junaid Nagar in Andheri to Shaikh. Sonu was unhappy because he believed that his father had sold the plot at a cheaper rate. He had also threatened the victim on many occasions. Sonu also had gone ahead and encroached a small portion of the plot and built a shop on the land Shaikh had purchased. However, in 2019, Shaikh demolished the shop after he decided to develop the plot, said an officer. But since then Shaikh has been receiving threats from Sonu. In October 2019, the victim had filed a written complaint and marked his copy to the state home minister, Mumbai police commissioner and the joint commissioner of police (crime) stating that he faced a threat to his life and that people were stalking him. The complaint was passed on to DN Nagar police station for enquiry but an FIR was not registered. Later, Shaikh in another letter dated January 7, 2020, again wrote asking for an FIR to be registered and for necessary action to be taken. The letter was written by him in January, a copy of which is with Hindustan Times, states, “A few criminals from our area including Abdul Rehman Abdul Latif Shaikh also known as Sonu has hatched a conspiracy to kill me during my walk for early morning prayers to the nearby mosque. He (Sonu) had further informed me that the said goons had waited for me, armed with weapons, on a few occasions to attack me.” The letter goes on to state, “The said goons were learnt to have previous criminal cases at DN Nagar, Versova, Amboli and Juhu police station. Last year, they had even thrown firearms into a nullah at Juhu Galli, when DN Nagar police team had visited their house.” Parmeshwar Ganme, senior inspector from DN Nagar police station confirmed that they had received a letter in October 2019 from the victim. “We inquired into the case, but we did not find anything at that time,” said Ganme. Police sources said that both Sonu and the victim were called to the police station and the matter was sorted out. But on Monday morning, Shaikh was murdered. Police officers said that Sonu had contracted the person who attacked Shaikh. Soon after the attack, the assailant went to his friend’s place, changed his clothes and is now on the run. Juhu police officers have recovered the blood-stained clothes from the house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/30-year-old-man-held-for-builder-s-murder/story-5bLuLHWuwEwvWgip08pudJ.html
18-08-2020||Mumbai||Philippines government to follow Dharavi model to curb Covid spread in slums||The Philippines government will follow the Dharavi model to contain the Covid outbreak in their densely populated slums, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) chief Iqbal Singh Chahal said on Tuesday. BMC has shared the details of the Dharavi model with the Philippine government’s health department. “The Philippines government will follow the Dharavi model. Team BMC shows the way to the world to fight Covid-19 virus, on front foot,” said Chahal. Chahal also shared a news report from Philippine daily Inquirer.net. The news report read: “The DOH declared that it would follow the successful Dharavi-Mumbai campaign conceptualised by Assistant Municipal Commissioner Kiran Dighavkar. Dharavi in India is Asia’s largest slum where the Hollywood movie, Slumdog Millionaire, was shot.” Dharavi is India’s largest slum, with over 8.5 lakh people living in around 55,000 dwelling units spread across approximately 2.5sqkm. The population density here is 3.4 lakh per sqkm. On an average, in Dharavi, 8 to 10 people live in a 100-sqft room, making social distancing virtually impossible.The Dharavi model includes testing in high numbers, moving positive patients to institutional quarantine facilities, shifting high- and low-risk contacts to separate quarantine facilities, and treating patients in time. BMC organised fever camps, door-to-door surveys, used private clinics and dispensaries to reach a maximum number of people and detect Covid-19 early, according to Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G North administrative ward, with jurisdiction over Dharavi. Dharavi has seen cases in single digits for the past few days, and its curve flattened by the end of June. On Monday, Dharavi recorded four new cases, and five each on Saturday and Sunday. It saw nine new cases on Friday, and six on Thursday. This is in contrast to number of cases that were being reported in a single day in May, when Dharavi saw its peak of the infection. On May 3, Dharavi recorded its single day highest number of cases at 94. The total number of Covid-19 cases in Dharavi has touched 2,672, with only 80 active cases. Currently, the doubling rate in Dharavi is 269 days, and growth rate is 0.27%, in contrast to May when the growth rate was at its peak at 4.8%. Dighavkar said, “We are giving the Philippines government information on how we conducted fever camps in Dharavi, and carried out contact tracing, and organised institutional quarantining.” Over the past few weeks, Dighavkar has been flooded with calls from municipal corporations in cities of Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Kolhapur, for guidance. Chahal said, “BMC’s Chase the Virus Policy has shown the world the way to fight Covid-19, but BMC is not complacent. We will never lower our guard.” Chahal pointed out that doubling rate in Mumbai is now 86 days, with a low infection rate of 0.8%, and a discharge rate of 81%. Mumbai has done 6.6 lakh tests. He said, “There are 17,800 active cases in Mumbai, symptomatic patients in hospitals are 5,388 and 7,548+ beds are vacant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/philippines-government-to-follow-dharavi-model-to-curb-covid-spread-in-slums/story-VOeD6lsv4buQRE0sB1PiUL.html
18-08-2020||Mumbai||2 months on, BMC yet to start screening patients via 10 new X-ray vans||Almost two months after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) procured 10 vans and X-ray machines to screen individuals for Covid-19, the mobile facility has not started functioning as the x-ray machines do not fit in the vehicles. Five of the machines have been installed in Covid jumbo centres while the remaining five are lying at King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital.With residential complexes reporting a sudden surge in Covid-19 cases, the civic body, in a bid to diagnose more patients from housing societies, decided to use X-ray vans to screen people across various localities, to detect abnormalities in the chest owing to the presence of Sars-Cov-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19. For this purpose, in July BMC procured 10 X-ray machines and vans.The X-ray machines were to be fitted in the vans and synced for analysis with the radiology department of KEM Hospital. However, the hospital was unable to fit the machines into the vehicles. “Even though the machines are portable, they are still too bulky to be fit into a van. The civic body should have used one as a pilot project before procuring all 10 X-ray machines,” said an officer from BMC.“These machines are worth lakhs. Before making such random decisions, the civic body needs to be more careful,” said the officer. However, Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital, has claimed that the radiology department has been able to fix one machine in a van, and soon, screenings will begin.“With some alterations, we have been able to fit one machine into a van. We will fix the other machines soon and start screening people through chest X-rays,” he said.These X-ray machines, with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), will scan the images of people and provide the report within minutes. If an X-ray report raises suspicion among doctors, the resident will be tested either through rapid antigen test or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.According to doctors, Sars-Cov-2 affects the lungs of patients, and X-ray scans may help in identifying the virus earlier. The radiological screening of lungs helps in distinguishing Sars-Cov-2 from other respiratory infections.“These scans help in identifying small patchy, translucent white areas in the lungs that we call ‘ground-glass opacities’ or GGOs. It forms cotton-like white spots in lungs,” said Dr Natasha Nanda, a radiologist from Dr LH Hiranandani Hospital.China, where the virus first broke out and spread to the rest of the world, first started using X-ray screenings to identify suspected individuals and installed the machines at all fever clinics in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-months-on-bmc-yet-to-start-screening-patients-via-10-new-x-ray-vans/story-3PMABYdchAGqz3ofPZBS5N.html

The court directed the state to inform the court about a concrete mechanism within two weeks. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Revati Mohite Dere was hearing a petition filed by an advocate, complaining of the exorbitant charges collected by private hospitals across the state for the treatment of Covid-19 as well as non-Covid patients. The bench, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Abhijeet Mangade, was informed that private hospitals were overcharging patients admitted for Covid-19 treatment for PPE kits. He submitted that while the government was procuring each kit for ₹378, private hospitals were charging much more for it. Mangade further submitted that though the state in its May 21 circular had put a cap of the charges private hospitals could recover from patients, there were two instances in which his acquaintances had been overcharged for treatment. Mangade further submitted that he did not seek any directions against the two hospitals that had allegedly overcharged his acquaintances, but wanted the court to address the larger issue of the general public who faced such exploitation. He further submitted that as the state had not put a proper mechanism in place to keep a tab on private hospitals, private hospitals were overcharging patients in an unbridled manner. The state, through assistant government pleader Nisha Mehra, submitted that municipal commissioners and district collectors were empowered to address the issue and action had been taken against hospitals that were found overcharging patients. She added that the authorities concerned had also directed the hospitals to refund the excess amounts charged. She further added that through an August 7 circular, flying squads had been constituted to visit private hospitals and ensure that they did not resort to overcharging. When the court sought to know the progress of the flying squads, Mehra said she did not have the data and required two weeks to submit it. The court then observed, “The government has not paid attention to the aspect of charging mentioned in the May 21 circular. We expect the state to apply its mind on the same and come up with a proper mechanism to address the concerns raised by the petitioner.” The state was asked to file an affidavit detailing the mechanism within two weeks. “We know that the state of affairs and how the government mechanism works, hence it would require two weeks,” said the chief justice, when Mangade sought a shorter date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/form-mechanism-in-2-weeks-to-curb-private-hospitals-from-overcharging-covid-patients-hc-to-state/story-R9AHNDX2Y4Zh5ial8z0TpJ.html
18-08-2020||Mumbai||‘Surplus’ teachers can report to nearest school, help with online classes: Maharashtra education department||As schools in Maharashtra continue to teach students online, the state education department in a circular released on Monday asked teachers, who have been declared ‘surplus’ in their schools and are yet to get a fresh appointment elsewhere, to report to any school near their homes to help with virtual classes. As per department norms, if a school has more teachers than the student-teacher ratio of 30:1 per class, the appointments of surplus teachers are cancelled and they are transferred to other schools with vacancies. However in the current situation, as teachers cannot be asked to travel due to lockdown-related restrictions, the department has allowed them to work with the nearest schools. “Such teachers can help schools with the online teaching-learning process like conducting classes, planning academic activities etc. This will also help schools in working more efficiently during the ongoing pandemic,” stated the circular. While there is no clear estimation on how many teachers are yet to get the postings, the state has more than 10,000 surplus teachers. The department has also asked local authorities to relieve teachers who were earlier engaged in Covid-related duties, so that they can join their respective schools. “It has been decided to relieve such teachers with immediate effect,” said state education minister Varsha Gaikwad in a tweet on Monday. Schools have welcomed the decision, but said that the local authorities will have to intervene in the issue. “It should not happen that many surplus teachers report at the same school, while others continue to have none,” said a principal of a Thane-based school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/surplus-teachers-can-report-to-nearest-school-help-with-online-classes-maharashtra-education-department/story-RrBKK4kSaMZo6YguvfPahP.html
18-08-2020||Mumbai||Heads of private hospitals could face civil, criminal action if they refuse to admit Covid-19 patients: HC||Heads of private hospitals requisitioned for treatment of Covid-19 patients may face civil and criminal proceedings if they refuse to admit patients despite having beds available.Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the state government to appropriately warn requisitioned private hospitals that their directors, heads, or owners would be held liable for civil and criminal action if any Covid­19 patients are turned away despite the availability of beds.The bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice Shrikant Kulkarni issued the directive along with a slew of guidelines and directives for containing the spread of Covid-19 in the Marathwada region.The bench was hearing a suo-motu petition concerning several issues and complaints about the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in 13 districts of the region.After hearing the government, local bodies and police authorities, the bench directed all district collectors of the 13 districts to form a task force, which will be functional round-the-clock to coordinate all efforts being made to contain Covid-19.The bench also directed that helplines should be made available immediately to answer frequently-asked questions about Covid care infrastructure, government and private Covid care centres, the availability of beds, etc.Besides, the task force has also been entrusted with the duty of regulating charges to be levied by private hospitals, to ensure compliance thereof and handle complaints regarding overcharging and billing by these hospitals.The bench directed that routine medical tests of doctors, paramedics and employees deployed on Covid-­19 duty should be carried out to safeguard their health given their exposure to the coronavirus infection.HC has suggested that the district administrations should also consider deploying mobile laboratories to conduct rapid antigen tests to make it convenient for the public at large and especially senior citizens or patients with co­morbidities to undergo tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/heads-of-private-hospitals-could-face-civil-criminal-action-if-they-refuse-to-admit-covid-19-patients-hc/story-H76Ay4ij9JP2bMrLvw7kfK.html
18-08-2020||Mumbai||2 die of malaria and Covid-19 dual infection: BMC||The city has started recording a gradual rise in the number of malaria cases with the ongoing monsoon season. For the first time since the outbreak of Covid-19 in March, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has recorded two deaths where the duo was suffering from a combination of malaria and novel coronavirus infection.As per data provided by BMC, a total of 592 people in the city have been diagnosed with malaria until August 16. The two deaths have resulted in breaking the city’s decade-long record of zero fatalities due to malaria.In the first case, a 27-year-old man from G North ward, that covers Dharavi and Dadar, on August 3 within 24 hours of hospitalisation. “The patient had developed a fever and started vomiting from July 30. He was first taken to a local hospital where his condition started deteriorating further. Later, when he was diagnosed with Covid-19, he was admitted to a civic-run hospital but his condition was too severe,” said a health officer from BMC. The patient was an alcoholic, which had further compromised his immunity.In the second case, a 40-year-old man from M East ward, that covers Govandi, died on August 4. The patient developed fever and cough on July 25 when he was receiving treatment at a hospital in Navi Mumbai. He was shifted to a civic-run hospital in Mumbai on July 29 when his condition worsened. After running a diagnosis, he was found positive for Covid-19 and malaria. His cause of death has been marked as a type-1 respiratory failure with Covid-19 pneumonia with malaria.Both victims were from wards which were once hot spots for Covid-19 infection. Local activists claim that with all the focus on Covid-19, BMC has failed to pay attention to precautionary measures for monsoon-related ailments.“Considering these two areas comprise the biggest slums of Mumbai, every year we witness a large number of malaria and dengue cases. But with civic officials busy controlling the spread of Covid-19, they didn’t fog the vulnerable areas. The drains are clogged and overflowing. The lanes haven’t been cleaned, and are filled with mosquito breeding grounds,” said Dr Ansari Sheikh, a general physician and activist from Dharavi.BMC health officers refuted the allegations. Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC said that every year during monsoon, the city records the highest number of malaria cases in August and September. “Both patients had Covid-19, so we can’t say the cause of death was malaria. However, we have increased our routine surveillance and are spraying insecticides in all wards,” she said. Last year, in August, 824 cases of malaria were reported.The city has reported a lower number of other monsoon-related ailments this year, till August 16. In the same period, 16 patients have been diagnosed with leptospirosis and five with dengue. No cases of swine flu have been recorded.BMC has instructed all private practitioners to provide doxycycline to patients with fever, to avoid further complications related to leptospirosis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-die-of-malaria-and-covid-19-dual-infection-bmc/story-BoSuHtgq9ISa5r1ocbAw4M.html
18-08-2020||Mumbai||BMC to test those above 50 years in containment zones||Starting this week, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has started to proactively conduct Covid-19 tests – both rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests – on citizens above 50 years of age with co-morbidities living in containment zones and sealed buildings. Along with senior citizens, high-risk contacts from these areas will also be tested. So far, only symptomatic patients were being proactively tested by BMC. However, new directives by the municipal commissioner ordered such tests on asymptomatic senior citizens as well as high-risk contacts. All 24 administrative wards have been asked to scale up their daily Covid testings. Ward officials will set up week-long testing camps at specific locations in their wards where citizens can get themselves tested. Antigen kits are being used more for Covid tests than RT-PCR, as the results of the former are out within 15-20 minutes. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said, “The idea behind this is early detection and treatment of comorbid patients. Senior citizens should be given early treatment for which detecting the virus in time is important. Further, we will also conduct testing of senior citizens beyond containment zones and sealed buildings.” Sanjog Kabre, assistant municipal commissioner of P North ward (Malad), said, “With more cases in high-rises, we are setting up camps outside housing societies for Covid testing. Prior to this, our daily testing number was around 100-150. We will now push it up to 500 daily tests, including antigen kits. We are also visiting workplaces of frontline staff and conducting antigen tests there.” Recently, the civic body narrowed down its focus to 10 administrative wards, which account for 46% of Mumbai’s total. The plan was to increase testing and deploy more personnel to visit containment zones, among other measures, in these wards. The wards that have been selected on the basis of their Covid-19 cases growth rate, doubling rate, positivity rate and fatality rate are R-North (Dahisar), R-South (Kandivli), R-Central (Borivli), S (Bhandup), N (Ghatkopar), T (Mulund), G-North (Dadar-Mahim), M-East (Govandi), P-North (Malad) and L (Kurla). On Tuesday, Mumbai reported 931 Covid-19 cases with total infected cases in the city reaching 130,410, followed by 49 deaths taking the toll to 7,222, according to the state health department data. As per BMC’s data, of the 49 deaths, three were of patients below 40 years of age, 31 of patients above 60 years, and 15 patients were between 40 and 60 years. The data further stated that 892 patients recovered and were discharged on Tuesday. A total of 105,193 patients have been treated and discharged so far. The number of active patients in the city is 17,704. Further, total Covid tests done till Monday stood at 6.63 lakh. Meanwhile, Dharavi reported four new cases on Tuesday. The tally of the slum is 2,676.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-test-those-above-50-years-in-containment-zones/story-16ygdMq7iYh5CmXWivp64H.html
18-08-2020||Gurugram||Property registrations to happen only in revenue estates where records are online||Property registrations in Gurugram that was to begin from August 17 is likely to be postponed as the revenue department is still fine-tuning the new software system. When the process does begin, the district administration said, registrations will be carried out only in those revenue estates where records known as jamabandi have been digitised.Jamabandi contains entries regarding Ownership, cultivation and up-to-date of various rights on the land. All changes of rights coming to the notice of the revenue agency are reflected in the jamabandi “There are 40 revenue estates (of 291) in the district where ‘jamabandi’ records have not been digitised. The new software shall plug loopholes and ensure a transparent system,” said Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram.Haryana government had banned registration of property deeds from July 22 after a probe revealed many illegal registries were carried out during the lockdown period from March 22. A number of revenue officials in the district have also been booked for violating property registration rules.Khatri said that as far as the illegal registries were concerned, only a civil court could decide their fate as there was no provision under revenue rules to cancel them. “Only if the government amends rules in this matter can the department can take action,” he said.District revenue officer Basti Ram his department was engaged in digitising revenue records and expected it to be completed soon. “We are working to completely digitize the record and also awaiting directions with regard to registration from headquarter in Chandigarh. We hope in next couple of days things would be back on track and in a better way,” he said.Meanwhile, the property dealers and brokers in the city said that they had been suffering since the ban on registrations. “First, deals could not happen during lockdown, and when things were beginning to move, the ban happened. This way, business has been badly hit,” said Subash Sharma, a broker based in sector 23.Last month, Haryana deputy CM Dushyant Chautala had said that government was planning to amend the rules and change the size of the plot and definition of urban area land to plug illegal registries. Instead of two kanals, which is present norm for agricultural land to obtain a no objection certificate from the administration, the government is proposing to increase it to one acre. The definition of land would be changed from agricultural to vacant land, he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/property-registrations-to-happen-only-in-revenue-estates-where-records-are-online/story-9Mh28HecC5FCqQgL1YkraI.html
18-08-2020||Gurugram||Ggm positivity rate declines to 6.95%; fourth highest in the state||Gurugram’s Covid-19 test positivity rate (TR) dipped below 7% since June, according to the recent state health department data. On Tuesday, Gurugram’s positivity rate stood at 6.95%, lower than Faridabad, Panipat and Rewari districts that had a rate between 8% to 11%, the highest in Haryana. Test positivity rate is the percentage of positive cases out of the total Covid-19 tests conducted. It is an important parameter to estimate the prevalence of infection and helps in locating areas where virus is spreading rapidly. A higher test positive rate is usually an indication of higher transmission in the community, with chances of more people having contracted the virus but haven’t been tested. Gurugram still is higher than the state average of 5.6%, but is lower than the national average of 8%. In June, when the Union government announced the first phase of resuming economic activity through “Unlock 1”, the positivity rate of the district was 18%. In July, which saw steep rise in cases and a concomitant increase in testing with the introduction of antigen testing, it reduced to 8% by the last week. Gurugram health officials said they aim to reduce the rate to 5% by focussing on on areas where there has been a resurgence of Covid-19. An advisory issued by the World Health Organization in May read: “Less than 5% of samples positive for Covid-19 at the least for the last two weeks, assuming that surveillance for suspected cases is comprehensive.”Dr. Virender Yadav, Gurugram chief medical officer said, “To further reduce the test positivity rate in Gurugram, the department has increased testing and have been responding to those tested positive by isolating them at their homes or admitting high-risks contacts in hospitals. It is over the time, the test positivity has come down drastically. Increased testing, timely test results and contact tracing has led to the decline,” said Yadav. According to him, Gurugram is able to do contact tracing of 96% cases which are being tested positive.Till now, 138,921 samples have been tested in Gurugram, out of which 64,591 were through rapid antigen tests and 74,330 were RT-PCR tests. Considering the positivity rate of antigen tests which is nearly 2-3%, while that of RT-PCR is 7-9%, Yadav said, “RT-PCR and antigen tests are being conducted in proportion. If 700-1000 RT-PCR test on an average is being conducted in a day then 1000-1200 antigen tests are also being done. In August alone 35,000 tests have been done including both the tests.” According to him, the district would have done a total of one lakh tests per million population by Wednesday, which will be the highest in the state. Since certain areas in the city are noticing resurgence of Covid-19 cases, testing camps will be organised to further lower the positivity rate. “These are some of the densely populated areas which were once the worst-affected areas like Wazirabad, Tigra, Chanderlok and Sohna. Antigen testing camps will be held on a weekly bases to trace cases and break the chain of transmission,” said Yadav. Wazirabad has reported more than 700 cases since June. Likewise, Chanderlok and Tigra have reported more than 600-700 cases. Sohna has also been one of the affected having at least 14% positivity rate in mid-July. POSITIVITY RATE: OTHER DISTRICTS Currently, Faridabad has the highest positivity rate of 10.9% followed by Panipat (9%) and Rewari ( 8%). While the remaining 18 districts have positive rates between 5.8% to 1.2%. Data shows that Jind has the lowest positivity rate of 1.2%. In the last week of July, Gurugram’s positivity rate stood at 8.5% , third in the state after Faridabad (13.8%) and Rewari (9.0%). The positivity rate of Panipat was 5.6% at that time. According to Rajib Dasgupta, chairperson, centre of social medicine and community health, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), based on the positivity rate districts can be divided into two groups. “One group comprises of districts with positive rate above 5%, which are mostly big cities like Ambala, Panchkula, Sonepat, Faridabad, Panipat, Rewari. On the other hand, the second group comprises of nearly half of the districts with positive rates below 5% but where numbers are gradually increasing. These districts require more attention as they might lack testing infrastructure compared to any other big cities. Increased testing and monitoring of cases is crucial in these districts to control the mortality rate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/ggm-positivity-rate-declines-to-6-95-fourth-highest-in-the-state/story-tEPnXKGdeEUQA75OctSh3J.html
18-08-2020||City||MCG house meeting on Aug 28, issue of revenue roads likely to be raised||Gurugram: The status of selling or exchanging revenue roads in residential areas is likely to be among the final list of agendas that will be discussed in the house meeting of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on August 28.Other issues likely to be on the table would be isolation centres in residential areas, transfer of private colonies, and MCG’s sapling drives.The MCG is scheduled to hold the house meeting at a community centre in sector 27, invitations for which were sent to all 35 councillors and senior officials of the MCG on Tuesday.“At least 26 out of 35 councillors have already submitted their list of agendas for next week’s house meeting. I had informed councillors that they could include agendas that were part of the earlier list or submit a new list altogether. By the end of this week, the final agenda list will be prepared and shared to all councillors and relevant officials prior to the meeting,” said Mayor Madhu Azad.Revenue roads are a major issue across the city as a large number of townships, condominiums, societies have revenue roads passing through them that largely serve no purpose.These are essentially small vacant land owned by the government in residential areas. Private builders or residents welfare associations cannot construct or barricade it.In administrative language, a revenue road is a path in a village which connected residential areas to agricultural lands or fields. When the city urbanised rapidly in the late 1990s and early 2000s, while the villages became townships, these revenue road stretches remained.In 2018, the MCG proposed to allow private builders to buy them under the existing circle rates or exchange it with a land of equal size elsewhere. Since then there has been little progress.Apart from this, councillors are likely to look into the MCG taking over Sushant Lok 2 and 3.MCG was scheduled to hold a house meeting on July 7, at the same venue. However, with MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh having to attend a state-level meeting on the same date, it was cancelled. Officials said that several of the pending agendas which were not addressed due to the cancellation are likely to be repeated on August 28.The status on MCG’s sapling drive which started on June 27 is also one such agenda which is likely to be repeated again. Initially, the MCG had set a target of planting more than 40,000 saplings, however, following strong response by RWAs they have tripled their objective and are targeting to plant over 120,000 saplings across the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mcg-house-meeting-on-aug-28-issue-of-revenue-roads-likely-to-be-raised/story-xiZTgFBdMS4tYMTvjlQ7ZI.html
18-08-2020||Gurugram||GMDA drafts SOP for maintenance of green belts, will fence such areas to keep out encroachments||The Gururgam Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has completed drafting a standard operating procedure (SOP) to ensure uniform development and maintenance of green belts in the city, officials privy to the development said on Tuesday. The new guidelines contain provisions for protection of green areas as well as for private companies that wish to maintain green belts in Gurugram using CSR (corporate social responsibility) funds.Subash Yadav, metropolitan green planner in GMDA’s urban environment division, said, “Maintaining green belts has been a struggle for us. But over the past year, the authority has made a focused effort on clearing encroachments from such areas, and the next step is to restore the greenery. However, we realised a uniform, step-by-step directive is needed for the same, which is what the SOP is for.”The 13-page document lays emphasis on site selection and preparation, stating, “The success of plantation and aesthetic value of green belt depends on quality of site preparation.” It provides user agencies with detailed instructions on how to remove civil debris and rank vegetation, how to plow and prepare the soil, and how to ensure that the green belts remain sufficiently irrigated. The SOP also calls for fencing of green belts to keep out encroachments. “Fencing is the second most important component of development of green belts. Fencing helps in protection of plants from biotic interference,” the SOP states. “Until now, fencing of green areas was not a step we had considered. But given our past experience in maintaining green belts, we think it is necessary now,” Yadav added.As for the plantation process itself, the SOP dictates that trees and shrubs must be planted in horizontal rows of three, with flowering species in the first, outermost row, including native species such as amaltas, dhak, and harsingar trees. The second row will consist of ‘avenue trees’ that grow to a uniform height, such as silveroak, moulsari and kachnar trees. In the innermost third row, user agencies will be expected to plant taller ‘long rotation’ trees that will shade the green belt, and whose products may be harvested in the future, such as jamun, peepal, neem and semal trees.Rajbir Singh Bondwal, advisor, GMDA urban environment division, said, “We have also provided guidelines for continued maintenance of these areas, which is the most important thing.” Bondwal further said that getting private companies to care for green belts has so far been a challenge without a uniform protocol. “Now that all user agencies have a singular document that they can refer to, regular maintenance will become much simpler, and agencies can be held accountable in case of lapses,” he said. To demonstrate the utility of its newly drafted document, GMDA last week began a plantation drive in Behmrampur village on the occasion of Independence Day, while other plantation drives in Dhanwapur, Sikandepur, Chandu Budera, Badshahpur and Wazirabad are on the anvil. “These are in the tendering process and will be funded by GMDA. They will serve as a model for corporate partners, who is expected to maintain their allocated green belts on the same lines,” Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-drafts-sop-for-maintenance-of-green-belts-will-fence-such-areas-to-keep-out-encroachments/story-7VeOGH8psuMrj4m4QYpMDL.html
18-08-2020||Gurugram||First-year engineering student shoots himself dead in Sector 84||A first-year student of marine engineering allegedly committed suicide by shooting himself at his brother’s house in Sector 84 on Monday evening, said the police. The police said that the deceased had come to Gurugram during the lockdown and was staying with his elder brother for the last four months. His father was undergoing treatment in a private hospital in the city and his elder brother was with his ailing father when the incident took place. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said the police control room received a phone call, reporting that a man was found shot dead in an apartment building of a residential colony. Following this, a team from the Vatika police post was sent to the spot. “A countrymade pistol was found lying on the bed and the man was found lying in a pool of blood,” he said. During investigation, it was revealed that the family members were not aware of the reason behind the suicide, said police, adding that so suicide note was recovered from the spot. Sangwan said the family is also unaware of the fact that the deceased had a countrymade pistol. “The brother, on whose statement the case has been registered, said that he is unaware from whom his brother had acquired the weapon and the possible reason behind acquiring the gun. There was no issue within the family that might have prompted him to end his life,” he said. The elder brother in his statement to the police said that he received a call from his brother at 6.30pm and he asked him at what time he was reaching home. Around 8.30pm, the complainant reached home and found the door to be locked. He tried reaching out to his brother but his mobile phone was switched off. He then approached the society’s maintenance office for duplicate keys but they didn’t have any. The brother then called a carpenter, who broke a glass adjacent to the wooden gate after which the complainant opened the door and entered inside the apartment. “As soon as he discovered his brother’s dead body, he informed his family members, relatives and friends and then called police control room. No suicide note was found from the spot,” said Sangwan. The body was handed over to the family members after the post-mortem examination on Tuesday, said the police. A case under section Arms Act was registered at Kherki Daula police station and a probe is underway, said police. The police are also scanning his call records to find out the motive.Gurugram does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are +914066202000 from ‘Roshni’ (Hyderabad-based) and +914424640050 from Sneha India Foundation (Delhi-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/first-year-engineering-student-shoots-himself-dead-in-sector-84/story-XFZhBzy7CDVH5r3n2mozoL.html
18-08-2020||Mumbai||Gangster Ejaz Lakdawala tests positive for Covid-19||Gangster Ejaz Lakdawala, a former associate of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, who was arrested by Mumbai Police in January, has tested positive for Covid-19.The anti-extortion cell (AEC) of the crime branch on August 8 had taken police custody of Lakdawala from Taloja jail, in connection with a fake passport case in which his daughter Sonia Lakdawala alias Sonia Shaikh is also an accused.After his police custody was over, the gangster was supposed to return to Taloja jail. Since the state has made it mandatory for all new inmates to undergo Covid testing before being lodged in the jail, Lakdawala was tested a few days ago. “His test result came positive. He was immediately admitted to GT Hospital’s high-security ward. His condition is stable and he has no major Covid symptoms,” said a crime branch officer.All the AEC personnel who came in close contact with the accused have been asked to home quarantine, said a senior police officer.It is not clear whether he contracted the virus in jail or while in police custody.Lakdawala has been on India’s most-wanted list from 1998 when he escaped from Nashik jail. He was wanted in 27 cases of murder and attempt to murder and in 80 cases of threatening businessmen for extortion in Mumbai alone.During his initial years, Lakdawala was among the close confidants of Dawood who used to provide logistical support to D-Company members in Mumbai for extorting money from Bollywood film producers and businessmen. But after Rajan split with Dawood, Lakdawala chose to work with Rajan. While on the run for years, he had stayed in Malaysia, Bangkok, South Africa and Canada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/gangster-ejaz-lakdwala-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-hYWgbhUhohdh3CDt5huX0O.html

In the letter, Fadnavis said that the city’s Covid-19 case fatality rate in the last 17 days of August stood at 5.40%. Around 7,000 tests were being carried out daily, but considering the city’s population, this was too less.Fadnavis said that the only way to tackle the spread of Covid-19 was to test more aggressively to identify positive patients, isolate and treat them. “Despite insistence, I cannot fathom why the number of tests is not being increased. Even though the case fatality rate in the country is now at 1.92%, Mumbai’s has consistently hovered at 5%”, said Fadnavis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fadnavis-writes-to-cm-thackeray-regarding-high-fatality-rate-seeks-increase-in-tests/story-lEZ1AQIz9vZCpxcMQXfvXN.html

The police said probe has revealed that at the same time, both the mobile phones that he was carrying were turned off. The police are now checking all the CCTVs of the approach roads leading to Sector 46, near his residence and the Delhi-Gurugram border to ascertain the circumstances leading to the victim’s disappearance. In one of the CCTV footage, the victim can be seen walking in a service lane near green belt in Sector 46 for a few metres. A police official, who is part of the three-member SIT, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The victim had two mobile phones with him at the time of his disappearance. Both were turned off at 8.02pm. We are checking his call records and the CCTVs in the areas where he was last seen.” Dheeraj Ahlawat, 38, who was working in the department of corporate loans for a private bank, was last seen walking near a service lane around 7.45pm on August 5. His family said that he had gone for a walk with a friend at 7pm. Around 7.30pm, his wife had called him and he told her over the phone that he was nearby and would return shortly. At 7.42pm, his friend went home, leaving him alone. The police said at 8.30pm, when his wife called him again, both his phones were found switched off. The family members then contacted his friends and relatives and tried to locate him. On August 6, they filed a missing person’s complaint under Section 346 of Indian Penal Code at the Sector 50 police station. A day later, the victim’s body was found by a Delhi police team of K N Katju police station from Haiderpur water treatment plant in Rohini. Since the body was yet to be identified, it was kept it in a hospital for identification. The body only had an undergarment and was partially decomposed. P K Mishra, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Rohini district, Delhi, said, “The body was recovered from a mesh in water treatment plant in Haiderpur. After its identification, the post-mortem examination was conducted and the probe was handed over to Gurugram police, with whom an FIR was already registered.” His father, Raj Singh, said, “One of our relatives is a sub-inspector in Delhi police. We contacted him for help in locating my son. Through his contacts and database, he told us that on August 12, a similar looking body had been traced in Rohini area. The body was decomposed since it had been in water but we identified him through his built and a ‘rakhi’, which my daughter had tied on his hands on August 3. It had the word, ‘veera’ written on it. He was found in his undergarments. He did not have enmity with anyone and did not mention any threat from anyone to us before. Every day around 7pm, he used to take a break and go for a stroll. He always carried two mobile phones, in case one died. He would not venture too far without informing us.” After the post-mortem examination in Delhi on August 13, the kidnapping charge was added to the FIR. The police said the body did not have external injuries but the cause of death would be established after the post-mortem report comes out. An SIT was formed on Monday after the victim’s family met the police commissioner, demanding a probe and alleged that police had not carried out a proper investigation after they had initially approached the police. Preet Pal, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, “It is a blind case and we have initiated the probe. The post-mortem report is awaited.

18-08-2020||Mumbai||State to provide insurance cover for private doctors, NGOs, activists working on frontline||The Maharashtra government on Tuesday declared that it will offer insurance cover of ₹50 lakh to private doctors working on the frontline. The amount will be given to the next of kin if the doctor dies from Covid-19 while treating patients infected with the disease. It has also decided to provide an insurance cover of ₹25 lakh to social activists or NGOs conducting final rites of Covid victims in rural areas.State health minister Rajesh Tope said, “Any private doctor who was treating Covid-19 patients at his private hospital or a government hospital and eventually died after getting infected, with it will be eligible to get insurance cover of ₹50 lakh. The next of kin of the private doctor will get the insurance amount.”The only condition is that the concerned district collector will have to verify and the director of health services will have to endorse the claim application, he said.Life insurance was one of the demands earlier made by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and the Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC). Tope said he has given a written assurance to the representatives from both the organisations, in a meeting held recently.In another decision, the state has decided to provide an insurance cover of ₹25 lakh to social activists or NGOs performing final rites of those who died to Covid-19. The decision was taken considering the instances where NGOs or social activists came forward to perform the final rites of a Covid-19 patient after family members refused to attend, out of fear of getting infected, state rural development minister Hasan Mushrif said while making the announcement.“A social activist or an NGO involved in performing final rites of those who died due to the coronavirus in rural areas will get insurance cover of ₹25 lakh. It means if such a person dies due to Covid-19 infection than his or her next of kin will get the insurance amount,” Mushrif said.The only condition is that the social activist should not be in government service and the NGO should be registered with the charity commissioner, he said. “These people are putting their lives at risk by performing the final rites of unclaimed bodies. Considering that the decision is approved, the insurance cover scheme will be applicable until September 30,” he added.Doctors should reconsider over-prescribing Tocilizumab for Covid treatment, says TopeState health minister Rajesh Tope said that doctors should seriously reconsider over-prescribing Tocilizumab as the firm (Roche) manufacturing the drug has admitted that it is not that effective in treating Covid-19. Tope also said that the task force will be making changes in the treatment protocol overuse of the drug considering the same.“Doctors should seriously give a thought to prescribing Tocilizumab in the backdrop of Roche’s letter in which it has admitted that the drug is not that effective for treating Covid-19. The task force formed to reduce Covid-19 casualties has formulated treatment protocol considering guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the World Health Organization (WHO). It will also consider changing the treatment protocol for overuse of this drug for Covid treatment following the development,” said the health minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-to-provide-insurance-cover-for-private-doctors-ngos-activists-working-on-frontline/story-bvPytVUU3w4e9aFHuxlPBK.html

On Tuesday, some locals from Saini Sunpura village in Greater Noida under Ecotech3 Police Station, who had gone there for a walk, heard a whining from inside the dark pit of the reservoir and dialled the police control room. The police in turn got in touch with a city-based animal NGO named Smart Sanctuary to coordinate the rescue.“We received a call from a PCR and immediately reached the spot. We were actually surprises to see that the dog was still alive. The entire building is threat and anyone, especially children who play in that area, can fall into the abandoned water pits. It’s a dry and dark reservoir, not in use and runs at least 25 feet deep. I went inside using the ladder and it took some time to rescue the animal,” Kaveri Rana, managing trustee, Smart Sanctuary.According to a veterinary doctor, the dog had turned skeletally thin and possibly survived only on rainwater. The doctor said that the animal could have been stuck there for at least two weeks.“It’s a fully grown canine in its prime. It was only eight and a half kilograms when we pulled it out, as compared to teh typical weight of between 20 to 25 kilos. All its body fat and muscles had been used up as energy sources that kept it alive. It seems that the dog must have been stuck there for at least two weeks or perhaps more. Dogs can survive that long without food. It’s on liquid diet for now and will take at least four weeks to recover,” said Dr. Ravinder Kaur, a veterinary doctor at canine and feline critical care unit, Ghaziabad.The locals who called up the police claimed that some people had accidentally fallen earlier into the reservoir earlier.“The reservoir is near our village Saini Sunpura. We were walking past it when we heard the whining and called the police. The reservoir is an open threat to even humans. A few months ago, a man from our village had also fallen into it and was found a day later. Many children go there to play as well. The reservoir needs to be repaired and its openings closed.,” said Vishwas Nagar, a resident Saini Sunpura, Greater Noida.Contacted, officials said that they are looking into the matter.“We will get the reservoir checked and fixed. The matter has come to our attention now and the concerned official will soon inspect the entire premises so that such an incident is not repeated,” said Deep Chandra, additional CEO, Greater Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/dog-stuck-in-empty-water-reservoir-for-over-a-week-rescued/story-3ZD6FxTalhQWiI965kielL.html
18-08-2020||Chandigarh||Private hospitals in Mohali asked to increase critical Covid care bed capacity||Private hospitals in Mohali were on Tuesday asked by deputy commissioner (DC) Girish Dayalan to increase tertiary (or specialised) Covid care bed capacity as a buffer when cases were surging even as an adequate number of beds were available. Dayalan was speaking at a meeting with the representatives of government and private health institutions. Most of the institutes agreed to make more ventilator equipped beds available.To others who said they did not have the requisite infrastructure, Dayalan said, the “district administration will facilitate setting up of L3 facilities (dealing with complicated or critical cases) and provide ventilators and paramedics to private hospitals to meet the challenge unitedly.” He also added that the district administration had procured 30 ventilators which would be installed by Thursday in selected institutes. There was enough respiratory care equipment in stock including the oxygen cylinders, oxygen - flow masks, hospital beds, ventilators and personal protection kits, Dayalan added. The DC also made it clear that no Covid patient requiring tertiary care would be declined admission without permission from the expert referral committee. The committee, comprising the civil surgeon and doctors from other government and private hospitals, has access to bed status in every health institution on real time basis. It is empowered to move a patient from L2 to L3 (critical care centres) or vice versa depending on his or her condition. The administration will also conduct ‘moblile-testing’ by running vans to conduct random rapid tests in the areas around large industries and spots such as labour chowk to increase the testing range. Besides, the district had appointed dedicated teams to continue surveying areas especially the containment zones and keep a tab on Covid spread there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/private-hospitals-in-mohali-asked-to-increase-critical-covid-care-bed-capacity/story-1P0lp6C3KzP1gepOYDlncP.html
18-08-2020||Noida||Noida to get ₹180 crore under centre’s ‘Safe city’ project||Noida will soon have exclusive women police outposts, dedicated help desks at all police stations, more ‘pink’ toilets, said the district police, with the city being recently selected for the ‘Safe City’ project by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA).Noida was selected for the scheme by the home ministry last week and would be the second city in the state after Lucknow (selected last year in November) to get funds under the project. The MHA has approved a total budget of ₹180 crore for Noida under the Nirbhaya Fund scheme. Noida will be developed as a ‘Safe City’ with the central and state governments contributing funds in 60:40 ratio.The project will be implemented by the police commissionerate, with support from different industrial development authorities (Noida authority, Yamuna Expressway authority among others) besides help from the transport department.Noida was among four cities whose name was sent to the MHA by the state government last year in December for development under the ‘Safe City’ project. The other three cities whose names were sent were Varanasi, Kanpur, and Gorkahpur.“The proposals under this project aim at women’s safety and empowerment by not only providing a safe and secure environment but also enabling them to defend themselves against such crimes,” said Noida commissioner of police (CP) Alok Singh. He also added said there is a need to take concrete law enforcement initiatives focused upon mitigation and proactive resolution of criminal offences against women.The police commissioner also said in addition to the facility to lodge any complaint with Police Control Room (PCR) with the 112 helpline, a special ‘women powerline’ (1090) is being run on which women can lodge a complaint. “Many mobile applications for women have also come up at the state and local levels. We are now trying to integrate all of them over a common platform. The plan includes setting up of an Integrated Smart Control Room, setting up ‘pink’ outposts (exclusively administered by women police) for facilitating ease of filing a complaint by women, night patrolling by women police officers, setting up women help desks at all police stations with counselors, implementing safety measures in buses, installing CCTV cameras, improving street lighting in identified crime areas, setting up more ‘Pink’ toilets (facilities equipped with sanitary napkins among other amenities) and integration of ‘women powerline’ with the single emergency number 112,” he said. “An integrated approach will help in assisting women in distress on a 24x7 basis.”Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Nitin Tiwari, the nodal officer of the ‘Safe City’ project, said the project will also have provision for integration with other projects of Noida police such as Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS), cyber security cell among others in the future. “CCTV surveillance at public places will include installation of cameras across the city at strategic locations around public places frequented by women and vulnerable sections and where CCTV surveillance can assist the law enforcement agencies in prevention and detection of crimes,” he said.Tiwari further said that CCTV surveillance will first connect to the local police station level, where a local command centre (LOCO) will be established with a storage capability of seven days. “The same feed from the police station will be available at district headquarters, where a district command centre (DISCO) will be established. The DISCO will have alerts and aggregation capabilities, which will be integrated with the existing central command centre(CENCO). The project will involve deployment of video and communication analytics software for identifying and promptly tracking persons and vehicles involved in incidents of harassing women in public places,” he said.However, experts have raised concerns with Noida’s impetus on increased surveillance for ensuring women safety. Kalpana Vishwanath, co-founder and chief executive officer of Safetipin, an organisation that works on make cities safer for women, said that installing CCTV cameras and installing ‘pink’ toilets does not translate into ensuring safety and security of women completely. “Moreover, the Nirbhaya fund is not meant only for the technological interventions planned by the Noida police. I think a multi-prolonged outlook and many other efforts are needed from the centre and states to make cities safe for women,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-to-get-180-crore-under-centre-s-safe-city-project/story-DDBaEm6Ny5OiRbU8hHp5XO.html

Of this, ₹1,000 crore will go towards for land acquisition to develop industrial sectors (up from ₹600 crore of last fiscal), ₹126 crore for developmental work in villages (₹106 crore last fiscal) and ₹221 crore for the Noida-Greater Noida Metro Link connecting Noida’s sector 71/50 to Greater Noida West’s sector Knowledge Park-V area. Other expenses were not expanded upon.The authority had approved ₹6,289 crore budget last year.“We will receive a revenue of ₹5037.37 crore for the financial year 2020-21 from different heads and have decided to spend ₹4,600 crore,” said Ritu Maheshwari chief executive officer of the Noida authority.The authority also approved a proposal that allows the developers to pay the 8.5% simple interest on the group housing land dues. This is following a Supreme Court order that directed the Noida authority, and also the Greater Noida authority, to impose the interest on land cost as per the existing the current marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) of State Bank of India (SBI).The interest rates on group housing rates would often go up to 15-23% after the authorities levied more interest on late payments. Developers had moved the apex court demanding lower interest rates claiming that high rate of interest would render their realty projects non-profitable.The authority also approved a decision to allow set up the restaurant and other commercial space at the rooftop of the Botanical Garden multi level car parking facility in sector 38A, and developing two higher secondary schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-approves-5037-crore-budget-for-the-city/story-DHrstXgDGx8JL1hxpfzqBO.html
18-08-2020||City||Nine arrested for participating in a horse-cart race in Greater Noida||Nine persons were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly organising and participating in a horse-cart race on National Highway 91 in Dadri in violation of traffic rules.The police said some motorcycles and three-wheelers were also driving along the two horse-carts and chasing them in the race which was captured on video.Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said around 7am the police received information that some people had organised a race involving two horse-carts violating traffic and social distancing rules amid the coronavirus pandemic. A number of local people had also gathered at the spot to view the race which also saw the participation of some motorcycles and three-wheelers, he added.“A police team reached the spot and found two three-wheelers, one Maruti Eeco car and some motorcycles at the sport, while the owners of the horse-carts had escaped with their animal-driven vehicles,” he said.The police seized the vehicles at the spot and arrested nine persons— Babban, Kasim, Arshad, Sajid, Furqan, Aad Mohammad, Hasan and Yasin, and Shahrukh. All suspects are residents of Ghaziabad, the police said.Yaqub, a local resident said, “Two horse-carts and some people on motorcycles and three-wheelers raced for about two or three kilometres on the highway, and it was very unsafe for commuters on the road to navigate.”Dinesh Singh, station house officer, Dadri said the arrested persons claimed that they had only come to watch the race. “We came to know that two horse-carts were involved a race but the owners managed to escape from the spot. We have arrested these nine people because they were also racing with the horse-carts. We have launched a search to arrest the men who were running the horse-carts. We do not know if a bet was also placed in the race,” he said.The police have registered a case against under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant, 269 (unlawfully or negligently spreading infection of any disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of IPC.Police said the horse-cart owners have been identified, both are also residents of Loni in Ghaziabad, and will be arrested soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nine-arrested-for-participating-in-a-horse-cart-race-in-greater-noida/story-T9GC1oXFk8JTARicd8WlmO.html

The woman Shaishta (identified by her single name in the police records), was from Inder Nagar in Bulandshar and was seven months pregnant. According to the police, she had married Amir (single name), a resident of Rithori village in Dadri in March 2019.The victim’s brother, Naimuddin, told the police that on Tuesday morning he received a phone call from a marriage broker, who had facilitated the marriage, who told him that Shaishta’s in-laws had shot her dead. “We quickly came to Dadri, and found her dead with a bullet injury in her abdomen. My sister was seven months pregnant,” he said.Naimuddin filed a complaint of dowry death against Amir, his father Iliyas and ten other family members at the Dadri police station. All the suspects are on the run, the police said.In his complaint to the police, Naimuddin said his family had incurred an expense of ₹10 lakh on Shaishta’s wedding. “However, since the marriage her husband and in-laws were demanding dowry. They started torturing her for ₹5 lakh. We initially thought the matter would resolve over a period of time, but they have killed my sister,” he said.Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police (Greater Noida) said that the Dadri police had received a call from Iliyas on Tuesday. “He claimed that Shaishta had ended her life by shooting herself with a gun. However, when the police team reached the spot all the family members were absconding,” he said.Pandey said that Iliyas’s statement appeared dubious to the police. “The neighbours revealed they had heard a gunshot at night. She was shot in the chest and that likely means that she hadn’t shot herself,” he said.The police have registered a case under sections 302 (murder), 304b( dowry death), 498 (detaining a married woman with criminal intent), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code, and section 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act against Amir, Iliyas and ten other members of their family.The body has been sent for an autopsy and the reports are awaited. The police teams are conducting searches to arrest the people named in the FIR. “ We have not found the weapon used in the crime. We are probing the matter from all angles,” Pandey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/22-year-old-pregnant-woman-killed-over-dowry-in-dadri/story-90xPdo85AiByGoP3PI6ISM.html

18-08-2020||City||With revised targets, UP plans over 131,000 tests per day||Ghaziabad Amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh, the state government has issued directions to all the 75 districts to together conduct at least 131,380 tests per day. The two districts of Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar have been given a daily target of conducting 2,540 tests each -- 2,000 tests with the help of rapid antigen kits and 540 through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. As per the directions issued by Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health), the districts have been given different targets ranging from 360-960 RT-PCR tests per day and 1,200-2,000 tests through rapid antigen kits. “Since the number of cases are rising, there is need to conduct more tests. Therefore, we have assigned minimum targets for RT-PCR and rapid tests for each district. On priority, the tests should be conducted for close contacts of positive patients and also for those having symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in containment zones,” stated the directions issued on Monday. According to state officials, the total testing in the state till August 17 stood at 3,966,848 with share of about 12.82% in overall samples tested across the country. According to figures of Union ministry of health & family welfare, a total of 30,941,264 samples were tested up to August 17 and 8,99,864 samples were tested alone on August 17 across the country. According to the last available data (as of August 15) from GB Nagar, the district completed about 151,314 tests, including 93,683 conducted with the help of rapid kits that have a share of 61.91%. GB Nagar district officials said that they are already conducting more tests than the target given by the state. “Our previous RT-PCR target was about 360 tests per day and now it is 540 a day. In comparison, we are conducting about 800-1,000 RT-PCR tests per day. The RT-PCR test is being done for patients having symptoms and co-morbidities,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, GB Nagar. On the other hand, Ghaziabad officials said that they are conducting about 3,000-3,500 tests per day which include about 900-1,000 RT-PCR tests. Till August 17, the district collected about 157,021 samples and test results were received for 155,291 samples. The overall Covid-19 cases in the district stood at 6790 till August 18. “We are focussing on people having ILI and SARI symptoms and those who are close contacts of Covid-19 positive patients. Besides, our surveillance teams are also conducting surveys in containment zones in order to find out suspected cases,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad. Of the 155,291 tests conducted so far in Ghaziabad, 88,513 were conducted through rapid antigen kits with a share of 56.99%. The test positivity rate of rapid kits is about 2.46% as compared to about 6.8% through the RT-PCR tests, as per the official figures. “We have ordered more rapid kits for meeting the minimum requirement set by the state officials. If a person tests negative through rapid kits, we are conducting subsequent RT-PCR test only if the person is symptomatic. But the subsequent RT-PCR test is done for all people having co-morbid condition,” Gupta added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-revised-targets-up-plans-over-131-000-tests-per-day/story-3se3nGQbC2UNvhJW6wZQmI.html

During the past 20 days of testing, about 80 workers from phase 4 of the project either have been found positive or are under isolation, the officials said, adding that only two workers from phase 2 have tested positive. According to the officials, they have availability of about 1,200 workers out of 2,000 required for phase 2, while phase 4 of the project that requires 1,500 workers is facing a shortfall of about 700. “The shortage of workers is there since the lockdown period, as many workers have not returned from their home towns. We are trying to finish the work for the two phases by end of December. During the past 20 days, testing of workers were taken up from the health departments of Ghaziabad and Meerut, and about 80 to 90 workers have been affected by Covid-19. They are either positive or placed under quarantine,” said Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI. The DME project comprises four phases, of which the construction work is underway for phase 2 (19.8km from UP Gate to Dasna) and phase 4 (32km greenfield expressway from Dasna to Meerut). The phase 1 (from Akshardham to UP Gate) and phase 3 (from Dasna to Hapur) of the project are already operational. The 32km-long phase 4 spans across two districts of Ghaziabad and Meerut and has achieved physical completion of about 73%. On the other hand, the phase 2 which is entirely in Ghaziabad is 83% complete, the officials said. The affected workers are under the categories of skilled, semi-skilled and construction labourers. “Those workers who have been found positive are being regularly checked by the doctors . We are taking up all measures to control the infection in the workforce. But with the issue cropping up, the project work may be affected further,” Garg said. Ghaziabad chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said that the health department takes up “intermittent testing” of workers engaged in the DME project to prevent the Covid-19 spread among the workforce. “Our teams go to the project site and also conduct camps. Those who are found positive are shifted to a Covid facility while their close contacts are shifted to facility quarantine,” said Gupta.The NHAI officials said that the shortage of workers and the pandemic issues may delay some of the upcoming works which have received clearances now. “We recently received clearances for five different works. One of them is related to the new rail overbridge (ROB) at Chipiyana near Lal Kuan. The ROB will be about 115 metres in length and have 14 lanes. The other clearance is received for the work at three places over the Ghaziabad-Hapur railway section in Dasna. We are trying to hire more workers to complete the project by December, 2020,” the project director said. In November last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during a review of major infrastructure projects, had directed that the ongoing DME project, which will provide faster and safer connectivity between Delhi and Meerut, should be completed by the revised timeline of May, 2020. The PM on December 31, 2015, had laid the foundation stone of the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-hits-delhi-meerut-expressway-work-as-several-workers-found-positive/story-7IRM0urXFO9W0L799WO9oK.html
18-08-2020||Chandigarh||Transparency officers: Ludhiana MC’s first appellate authority to appear before PSIC||The Punjab State Information Commission (PSIC) has directed Rohit Kumar, public information officer (PIO) and the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC)’s first appellate authority to appear before the commission for not coming up with a clear response to a query under the Right to Information on appointment of transparency officers in the civic body.The next hearing through video conferencing has been scheduled for September 14.City based RTI activist Rohit Sabharwal had, under RTI, sought the names of the transparency officers deputed in MC and asked for reasons if they had not been appointed.As the MC failed to provide the information, Sabharwal moved the PSIC and during its hearing on August 5, and the commission observed that the MC had failed to appoint the officer and that Rohit Kumar had submitted “a vague reply” that the commission had to deploy the officials in MC. This happened despite PSIC already issuing a letter to the department of government reforms to appoint the officers in public authorities in 2019.Directing the MC to submit a reply with the applicant, the commission ordered the PIO and the MC's first appellate authority (a copy is with the Hindustan Times) to be present during the next hearing.Sabharwal said in November, 2010, the chief information commission (CIC) had issued circular to appoint transparency officers, following which the department of state governance reforms had issued a letter on July 23, 2019, for the same. He alleged that even after 10 years since CIC had issued the circular, the transparency officer had not been deputed in MC. The role of the transparency officer is effective record management, digitisation of records, high priority and quality in disposing of RTI applications etc. It is the responsibility of the PIO of a public authority to supply correct and complete information within the specified time to any person seeking information under the RTI Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/transparency-officers-ludhiana-mc-s-first-appellate-authority-to-appear-before-psic/story-jAnaGiR5MQ62npYQHE6iEN.html

They blocked the main road outside the complex, causing inconvenience to commuters.The protesters were demanding reinstatement of retrenched employees and a work order system to be immediately started in the Barnala circle. They also pressed that contract employees should be made permanent, and job and proper compensation be given to the family members of power workers who died due to electric shock while on duty.The stir was part of a massive state-wide protest staged by the contract workers across Punjab on Tuesday. The widows and parents of the deceased employees were also present.Addressing the protesters, union vice-presidents Rakesh Kumar and Gurwinder Singh said contract employees working with complaints and maintenance had not been given salaries for the last seven months, and when they asked for the same, the Powercom started firing them.During the paddy season last year, new contractors were issued work orders, but this was not done this year.

These will benefit the city with the availability of more hospital beds/ventilators, and strengthen the medical facilities being provided here,” an official statement from Kher said.The MP told HT that she has pressed for the opening of 14 nursing homes which were closed during the Congress rule in Chandigarh. “These will help share the burden on government hospitals,” Kher said.In July this year, a panel of Badnore’s advisory council had rejected Kher’s proposal of allowing the conversion of residential plots into sites for nursing homes.Reacting to the MP’s stand, Congress councillor Devinder Singh Babla said she should take the Covid situation more seriously.“Kirron Kher is keener on starting more nursing homes in residential areas. This will create parking issues, so these should be opened in commercial areas. I request the MP to take the Covid situation seriously,” Babla said.He added that more steps should be taken against malpractices in the name of Covid-19.The councillors raised suggestions to set up a helpline at quarantine centres so that patients’ family members are able to coordinate among each other.They suggested that traffic coming from outside be monitored strictly and proper screening be done at all the entry points of the city. They pushed for imposing heavy penalty on violators for not wearing masks in public.They proposed that beggers should be banned in the city. They pressed for creating more awareness among the masses and ensuring discipline from mobile street vendors, besides proper monitoring of facilities at quarantine centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-include-pvt-nursing-homes-in-covid-fight-mp-kirron-kher-suggests-at-admn-meet/story-Rz1Ut39yHNy5zhqMoMXQaM.html

The department has invited objections through the DC till August 23.Ambala MC’s last tenure ended in 2018, when there were 20 wards – 11 in city area and nine in Sadar area. Later in 2019, the corporation was bifurcated into Ambala Municipal Corporation and Ambala Sadar Municipal Council, but the fresh polls have yet to be conducted. Rohit Jain, treasurer, Haryana Congress, said, “We had already protested against the constitution of the ad hoc committee where no opposition member was added for the delimitation process and now the party workers have presented their objections on the boundaries of wards to the DC.”The Congress, in its objection, alleged that the notification was issued on August 13, but there had been no communication or announcement for the public. It is clear that the whole process is being done in a biased manner just to help the ruling party, the party alleged.“My ward has been wrongly divided into four parts. The delimitation process has deprived the opposition members of their strongholds, while their wards have also been added to reserved category,” alleged former ward number 2 councillor Darshna Mehta. DC Sharma said after all objections were received, a meeting will be arranged with every party for further process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-objects-to-notification-for-delimitation-of-ambala-mc-wards/story-zSebUvZQiSHwKdidw1LIsK.html
18-08-2020||City||Job racket busted, five held for promising jobs at Delhi airport||New Delhi: Delhi Police on Tuesday claimed to have busted a cheating racket and arrested five persons, including the mastermind of the gang, who duped job aspirants by offering employment at the Delhi airport. One of the arrested men was working as a web designer at a private educational institute in east Delhi’s Mayur Vihar, police said.Deputy commissioner of police (IGI Airport) Rajeev Ranjan said the arrests were made following investigation into a cheating and forgery case filed on the complaint of one Deepak Kumar, who was duped of around 4.47 lakh in the name of providing a job in Airports Authority of India (AAI), insurance and income tax. Kumar is a resident of Uttar Pradesh’s Etah.“The complainant had seen an advertisement about the job on a social networking site on July 11 last year. The cheats tricked him into paying 4.47 lakh in different bank accounts by assuring the job and later switched off their mobile phones. To convince the complainant, the fraudsters even issued a fake appointment letter of AAI. A case was registered on Kumar’s complaint and investigation was taken up,” said DCP Ranjan.During the probe, DCP Ranjan said, the investigating team collected and analysed details of all mobile phones and bank accounts used by the suspects in the crime. Their efforts led them to an account holder, 40-year-old Shahzad (single name), who was arrested and interrogated.“Shahzad revealed that he had provided his bank account to Sanjay Sharma and was paid R5,000 for it. Sharma was arrested and he said he had shared the bank details with Pawan Gupta, who was working for the gang’s kingpin Shahzad Ali,” the DCP said.DCP Ranjan said Gupta’s arrest and interrogation led to the nabbing of the gang’s kingpin Sajid Ali and his key associate Sumit Upadhyaya, who worked as a web designer.The arrested persons told police they lured job-seekers through various advertisements on social media. They impersonated senior officials in AAI and tricked job aspirants into transferring money in various accounts after promising them placement at Delhi airport and issuing fake appointment letters, the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/job-racket-busted-five-held-for-promising-jobs-at-delhi-airport/story-jDpfvrrlTBIQWtV86mnyfJ.html
18-08-2020||City||Five held for Mori Gate violence, main suspect on the run||New Delhi: A day after more than a dozen masked men opened fire, vandalised vehicles and homes and assaulted women and children at Kucha Mohtar Khan in north Delhi’s Mori Gate, five persons have been arrested in connection with the violence. The alleged prime suspect Lalit aka Pongi, a habitual criminal from Model Town, is still untraceable, officials said.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Monika Bhardwaj said the arrested persons were identified by their first names -- Jatin, Vikas, Ritwik, Gaurav and Chetan. All of them are residents of north Delhi’s Gur Mandi and Rajpura villages. While four of them were caught on Monday night following raids at their possible hideouts, Chetan was arrested on Tuesday.During interrogation, the five men admitted to their involvement in the violence, police said. They told the police that they were called by Lalit and his brother-in-law, Luv, for settling a score with some residents of Kucha Mohtar Khan with whom the two had an altercation late Sunday night. Lalit was allegedly assaulted by five-six locals over some issue that is yet to be known.To take revenge, Lalit and his brother-in-law called their associates, who reached there in 15 minutes and allegedly went on the rampage in the neighbourhood for nearly 30 minutes -- firing in the air, vandalising vehicles and homes and assaulting women and children, a police officer associated with the probe said, requesting anonymity.DCP Bhardwaj said multiple teams have been conducting raids in north Delhi, Nangloi and Uttar Pradesh to nab Lalit, Luv and at least five more men involved in the rioting. At least four persons, including a woman and a girl, were injured and over two dozen vehicles were damaged.“The arrest of Lalit and Luv is important as only their interrogation would help us find the exact cause behind the fight. We spoke to the locals who said Lalit fought with them because they had stopped him from harassing some residents. We need to verify their version and for that, Lalit will have to be questioned,” said an investigator, who did not want to be named.The officer said Lalit was previously involved in seven-eight crimes, including a murder. “We have learnt that it was Lalit who had opened fire in the area,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/five-held-for-mori-gate-violence-main-suspect-on-the-run/story-ZE6WlUvD8gqO88ZE2FJe2K.html
18-08-2020||Delhi||Students’ union objects against JNU registrations for monsoon semester||The students’ union of Jawaharlal Nehru University on Tuesday objected against the administration’s decision of holding online registration for a new monsoon semester — between August 21 and 31 — stating that the evaluation from the previous semester is yet to be concluded.“We have been in touch with student representatives who have put forward their concerns. The evaluation process is not yet completed and now we are being asked to register. The provisional registration does not have any scope for grade improvement or repeating the course,” said Saket Moon, JNUSU vice president.“The University Grants Commission has said that the winter semester evaluation must be completed by September 30. In such a scenario, it doesn’t make sense to start registering for the next semester when this semester too hasn’t been completed,” Moon added.On Friday, JNU administration released a circular calling for provisional registration for the monsoon semester and asking its Schools and Centres to start online classes “where feasible.” Moon said this essentially means that students who want to opt for offline classes or a blended mode of learning will be “left in uncertainty as others progress to the next semester.”While the administration has asked students to register and pay dues like hostel and tuition fees, JNUSU in a statement on Monday said it was “inhuman” to expect students to pay the dues for hostel and registration “when fellowships have not been disbursed.” The students’ body will be holding meetings this week with various students’ groups on the matter.Registrar Pramod Kumar said “We are just doing provisional registration and not talking about academics or grade improvement. We want to get the registrations done because around 14 schools have finished their examinations and we have to get online classes started for those students. Those who have opted for blended learning will not be left behind because whenever they reach the campus, offline classes will be conducted for them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/students-union-objects-against-jnu-registrations-for-monsoon-semester/story-vZ9tjhcfaGM4DFUzuPzrNI.html

According to senior police officials, the man was killed as he tried to befriend a woman, who was the girlfriend of one of the accused. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outernorth) Gaurav Sharma confirmed the arrests of Deen Dayal, 35, and Mohit, 23 -- both residents of Ramesh Nagar, Bawana. The murder was reported to the police on August 10 at 11.30am. A police team found Kala’s body which had multiple blunt injuries on the head. The body was sent for post-mortem examination and a case of murder was registered, said a senior police officer, who wished not to be named. “It was also found that Kala has been involved in 12 criminal cases, including two murders, two cases of dacoity, two attempts to murder, a case of abduction and five cases of burglaries and thefts. He was staying alone,” the officer said. During preliminary probe, it was found that Kala had enmity with a man over his friendship with a woman. “With the help of technical surveillance and local inquiry, Dayal was detained for questioning. He initially pleased innocence but when he was confronted with his phone call records and other technical evidence, he confessed to having killed Kala,” the officer said. The official said Dayal has disclosed that he had roped in his friend Mohit and Rohit in the crime. “On the tip-off by Dayal, Mohit was also arrested but Rohit managed to escape. Dayal disclosed that Kala had befriended his girlfriend to which he had objected and warned him, but Kala, who was a criminal, didn’t listen and warned Dayal to stay away from her. In order to take revenge Dayal, along with Rohit and Mohit jumped into Kala’s house during the early hours in August 10 and bludgeoned him to death with rods and sticks,” the officer said. While Mohit had been named in a case of theft, Dayal has no previous criminal involvement, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-murdered-over-friendship-with-woman/story-hxIkDXonQkyeInMwlaV1rN.html

But the meeting was postponed and is now likely to be held on Wednesday, the chief minister’s office said.The Centre’s unlock 3 rules permit opening of hotels, gyms and yoga centres but it has not been allowed in Delhi. The Delhi government had proposed to reopen these services but lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal rejected the move, saying the Covid-19 situation continued to be “fragile” in Delhi and the threat was still “far from over”. Based on last week’s data, Delhi is getting 1,033 fresh Covid-19 cases on an average every day.A senior DTC official said the corporation in its proposal sought permission to run all state-run buses to their full seating capacity. “No standing inside the buses will be allowed and no extra passenger will be allowed beyond the allotted seats, if the SDMA approves the proposal,” the official said on condition of anonymity. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said if allowed, passenger capacity will be increased in DTC and cluster buses.“As the economy has largely opened up by now, the 20-passenger rule in DTC and cluster buses is giving a harrowing time to commuters. This is being taken up on public demand and keeping in mind law and order issues. At many bus stops, crowds are so large now that it becomes difficult for the conductor control the inflow of passengers,” Gahlot said.The minister said wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing will be not be compromised during bus journeys at any cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dtc-proposes-to-run-buses-at-full-seating-capacity/story-x2NyJRIgMP8YrZUNDKsPlJ.html

We have compiled the complaints and transferred them to respective zonal offices for further action. The department is taking all these complaints seriously and our April 18 order is effective since schools are still physically shut.”In a notice issued on Tuesday, the office of DoE zone 13 said, “As the co-curricular activities, sports activities, transportation and other development-related activities are almost nil due to the closure of the schools, these charges cannot be taken from parents/students. It’s been mentioned in this order that no fee except tuition fee will be charged from parents during the lockdown period. An annual and development fee can be changed from parents only on monthly basis after completing the lockdown period.”SK Bhattacharya, president of The Action Committee of Private Unaided Recognised Schools -- a body representing 400 schools -- said, “We had already informed the government and DoE that their April 18 order mentions that the schools cannot charge any other component during the lockdown. But now the process of unlocking has started, the schools in accordance with the order are free to charge annual fees and development charges on a pro rata basis now.”Aprajitha Gautam, president of Delhi Parents Association, said, “The DoE should take action against schools charging fees under other components despite directions. So many parents have been forced to pay full fees by schools amid the lockdown and DoE is not taking any action. These orders won’t do any good till action is taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/charge-only-tuition-fee-govt-warns-private-schools/story-HMIYYAA2QRcYg2dlWuIFMM.html

Following this, the GLADA officials, who went to the site with duty magistrate and police force, returned empty-handed after facing opposition from shopkeepers. It was the fourth attempt by GLADA to take possession of the shops, where water tanks have been installed by the shopkeepers in the market. While the GLADA officials said that the shop has been allotted to a person against a monthly rent of Rs 3,100, the shopkeepers said that the shop was allotted by GLADA for installing water tanks, when the market was established around six years ago.President of the market association, Rubal Dhall said, “The market has also filed a petition in the high court over the issue and the hearing has been scheduled to be held for October. The GLADA authorities are however forcibly trying to give this shop on rent for just Rs 3,100 per month, even when the value of the shop is over Rs 1 crore. The shopkeepers will never allow them to allot this shop. The duty magistrate also heard the grievances of the shopkeepers and asked the GLADA authorities to check the record.Despite attempts, GLADA Estate officer, Baljit Singh could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shopkeepers-protest-against-allotment-of-shop-at-ludhiana-s-pink-plaza/story-fF7HVQQko3WHmZyZAmngKL.html
18-08-2020||City||AAP criticises BJP-ruled civic bodies for hiking taxes, corruption||New Delhi: Alleging corruption in the BJP-ruled municipal corporation in Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday said the civic bodies have cheated the people by introducing new taxes and increasing others. Both the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and the North Delhi civic body had hiked property tax on rented commercial property. The SDMC had also introduced professional tax but its north Delhi counterpart postponed the proposal to charge the new tax. “Corruption is a major issue in MCDs. The BJP had promised ahead of 2017 municipal polls that they would do away with corruption in the civic bodies. But things have only gotten worse now. The BJP had also promised that the MCDs would not introduce or increase taxes. They have cheated people of Delhi on that front too,” said Durgesh Pathak, AAP’s in charge of municipal affairs.He further said, “The BJP ruled North MCD is all set to introduce professional tax, 34% increase in house tax, increase in property transfer tax and the tax element on electricity consumption from tomorrow (Wednesday)… We demand that the Delhi BJP should immediately roll back the proposals of a tax hike. The AAP will organise a demonstration at the Civic Center tomorrow (which has the head office of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation) from 1 pm, where the standing council meeting on the tax issue will take place.”Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, however, said that while proposals have been placed in the corporations for an increase in four different taxes, the party has asked its leadership in corporations to ensure that no additional financial burden is put on the people of Delhi. “These are proposals and have not been approved as of now. There will be no increase in taxes, except the one in property transactions. The corporations are facing a huge financial crisis and have a limited source of revenue. The AAP-led Delhi government is no releasing funds to the civic bodies. The civic bodies will have to take measures to boost revenue,” Gupta. He hit back at AAP for politicising the issue and said, “They are accusing us of putting the financial burden on people whereas it is the AAP government which has not waived off the fixed charges from electricity bills despite requests from people. They can’t give relief to people for even two months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-criticises-bjp-ruled-civic-bodies-for-hiking-taxes-corruption/story-5kiwu2HvHyIXQQUhywhijJ.html

Shopkeepers at the Dugri main road and Rahon road also raised a hue and cry over the potholed roads, which result in accidents.While the stretch of Dugri main road (near Dugri police station) is in a pathetic condition for a long time, a major portion of the Rahon road has been dug up for installation of sewer lines.A shopkeeper in Dugri area, Sanjay Tiwari said, “The road is in bad shape for a long time and many accidents also take place on a daily basis. The MC had also conducted repair work in the past, but the material starts peeling off a few days after the work is done.”Despite attempts MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal could not be reached for comment.

The members of the syndicate had then demanded that the documents based on which the decision had been made, which were given to them on Tuesday after a night-long dharna.Syndicate member Ashok Goyal said, “The regulation under which the polls were postponed states that the V-C can defer the elections at any stage in case of emergency, but the matter shall be reported to the syndicate.”“The V-C has no business to make [the decision] public without taking the matter to the syndicate first. The decisions are being taken somewhere else,” he said.Syndic Navdeep Goyal said, “The UT administration and their legal experts were consulted even though PU has its own legal panel.

Traders said that they were already receiving tepid response post lockdown. With this decision of the government, the business would be badly hit, they said. President of Akalgarh market garment association, Manpreet Singh Bunty said, “The wholesale garment business in the city is dependent on weekend sales. With the government imposing lockdown on Saturdays also, the business would be hit by 60% to 65% as customers from other districts/states visit the city on weekends.”President of hotel and restaurant association, Amarvir Singh and executive member, Amarjit Singh said that the hospitality sector has been the worst affected in the post lockdown period. “The restaurant owners were already receiving low footfall and only 20% to 25% of restaurants have been opened in the city after the lockdown. Further, the restaurants are also allowed to open till 8.30 pm only. The government should reconsider its decision,” he said.Traders said that many small businesses are on the brink of a shutdown due to losses and if the lockdown continues for a few more months, the owners would be forced to shut business.President of Ghumar mandi market association, Pawan Batra said, “Small traders will not be able to bear losses for a long time now and if lockdown restrictions continued for three more months, many shopkeepers will have to shut down their shops. This would also result in large scale unemployment and the crime graph would increase. Imposing restrictions on weekends will not serve the purpose.” Salon owners said that they are facing huge losses due to weekend restrictions. Owner of a beauty parlour at Mall road, Abhay Girdhar said, “Residents do not visit salons/barber shops on Tuesday and Thursday. And now the government has ordered lockdown on Saturdays and Sundays. We were already receiving around 25% response and this decision would further affect our business.”CP urges residents to stay at home at weekendsCommissioner of Police Rakesh Agrawal has urged people to venture out of their homes only when it is necessary. In a Facebook live session on Tuesday, the police chief said that according to new instructions issued by the state government, non-essential shops will remain closed on Saturdays and Sundays. He said that the CM announced weekend ‘stay at home’ in Ludhiana.He also added that the police and district administration has roped in private hospitals also for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. The city has 1,000 beds in private hospitals that have been reserved for coronavirus patients.Residents on Facebook have appealed to the government to set a limit on bills charged by private hospitals from coronavirus patients, as there are complaints of fleecing by private hospitals. The police commissioner said that the government has already set a limit for private hospitals and no hospital overcharge from patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-govt-s-decision-of-imposing-lockdown-on-saturdays-invite-criticism/story-bZ0I0TtnaJIJV4gx6HqDBO.html

In some cases, they were associated with investigating officers of the local police station for carrying out raids and further investigation of the cases,” Kundu said. The commandants were assisted by DSPs from CID and staff from Battalions and other units. They met stakeholders and enlisted important issues required for preparation of a wider road map for combating the menace of drug trafficking in the state. They also interacted with cross sections of the society, including public representatives. “Teams deployed also collected data on drug users and traffickers which will be useful for making relevant policies on prevention of drug trafficking in an organised way,” the DGP said. During the drive, 17 cases under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance (NDPS) Act and Excise Act were registered and 20 accused were arrested.

The move comes in the wake of complaints from patients and their caretakers who were being made to stand in a queue outside the Covid Care Centre to apply for home isolation.The mobile app ‘Home Isolation Ludhiana’ was launched by Fatehgarh Sahib MP Dr Amar Singh through video conferencing. He was also accompanied by deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma, additional deputy commissioner (ADC) Mr Sandeep Kumar, ADC (Jagraon) Neeru Katyal Gupta, sub-divisional magistrate Raikot Dr Himanshu Gupta, senior Youth Congress leader Kamil Boparai among others.

He said that earlier, residents who tested positive will simply have to make a video of themselves showing a separate room, attached bathroom and a caretaker. Once this video is submitted, the patient will get confirmation.After the application is submitted, the patient will be able to select a time slot on which he/she wants to visit the Covid Care Centre set up at Meritorious School, Ludhiana, for checkup, before the application for home isolation is approved. If the patient is not feeling well, their caretaker can also visit the Centre for final approval.DC Varinder Kumar Sharma said that only asymptomatic/patients with mild symptoms below 60 years of age will be eligible to apply for home isolation. He urged the residents to submit only correct information at the time of applying. “This is the second mobile app being launched by the district administration in the last few days.

It functions automatically when people place their hands under it to sanitize them." pic.twitter.com/ns5SPP3CStMaharashtra’s Covid-19 tally crossed the 6-lakh mark on Monday with the addition of 8,493 fresh cases, the state health department had said. Every year, devotees, especially in Maharashtra’s Mumbai, carry out processions while bringing the idols home and during immersions. However, with the ongoing pandemic, this year it is not allowed as people need to follow social distancing rules as a precaution against Covid-19 outbreak. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will set up seven-eight collection units in every administrative ward during the 10-day Ganesh Chaturthi festival, which falls on August 22.The units will be set up to prevent devotees from carrying out any procession or to avoid crowding during the immersion process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/artist-makes-ganesh-idols-with-in-built-hand-sanitisers-ahead-of-ganesh-chaturthi/story-XiDkhCngB3eisi7k4svGKP.html

Besides, challans where the driving licence is seized are also not included.“E-challaning is especially helpful amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Payments can be made on the spot with no need to turn up at the Traffic Lines in Sector 29, which prevents crowding,” said deputy superintendent of police (DSP, traffic administration) Kewal Krishan.He said normally appointments were given to violators to pay their fines at the Traffic Lines. But, currently they were giving these only in cases where vehicles had been impounded.Superintendent of police (SP, Headquarters) Manoj Kumar Meena, who is holding the additional charge of senior superintendent of police (SSP, traffic), said, “Challaning officials have given a thumbs up to the new system. We are now in the process of integrating it with the UPI payment system to allow violators to pay through mobile wallets as well.”The traffic police are also sending bulk SMSes to people, who have previously pending Traffic Violation Information Slip (TVIS) challans against them.

18-08-2020||City||Traffic policeman checking vehicles run over in west Delhi, critical||New Delhi: A 51-year-old assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of Delhi traffic police was critically injured after a car ran over him when he was checking vehicles for violation of rules in west Delhi’s Raghubir Nagar on Monday evening -- the second such accident involving a traffic officer in the last 20 days..The driver sped away and is yet to be identified. The ASI, identified by his first name Mahavir, is undergoing treatment at Balaji Action Hospital in Punjabi Bagh and is in a coma , police said. Deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said the incident happened when Mahavir and three-four traffic police personnel were checking vehicles near the Raghubir Nagar police booth. Around 5.30 pm, Mahavir signalled a white i20 car to stop for checking. “The car driver halted his vehicle but suddenly accelerated. The vehicle hit the ASI, who was standing in front of the vehicle. The ASI fell on the road. The car ran over his abdomen and lower part of the body, causing serious injuries and sped away,” DCP Purohit said. The injured ASI was rushed to the hospital where he slipped into a coma. A case of attempt to murder and obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions under Sections 307 and 186 of Indian Penal Code was registered at the Khyala police station against the car driver. Police officers associated with the probe said CCTV cameras of the possible routes the car driver took were being analysed. “We have some vital clues in the case and our teams are working on it,” the DCP said. Twenty days ago, a 54-year-old assistant commissioner of police (ACP) of Delhi traffic police died after he was hit and dragged for nearly 50 metres by a mini-truck near the Rajokari flyover where he was busy clearing a traffic jam. ACP Sanket Kaushik was declared brought dead at the AIIMS Trauma Centre. The truck driver was caught in Mahipalpur, four days after the accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/traffic-policeman-checking-vehicles-run-over-in-west-delhi-critical/story-ZLf4VKdu2HlApVx4OXXjFP.html
18-08-2020||Delhi||Curious case of Covid-19 in Delhi: Re-emergence seen in some cured patients||Some hospitals in the national capital have said they are seeing recovered coronavirus patients returning to them with recurrence of the infection.Earlier this month, the Delhi government-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital saw two instances of patients with relapse of coronavirus, almost one-and-a-half months after they were cured of the infection. In both the instances of relapse, the patients had moderate symptoms.Aakash Healthcare in Dwarka had also reported a case where a cancer patient recovered from coronavirus and contracted the disease again after a couple of months. The second time proved fatal for the patient who succumbed to the virus.Last month, the case of a Delhi policeman having a relapse of the novel coronavirus had emerged which had left experts baffled. In the same month, a similar case had surfaced in the national capital after a nurse employed at a civic-run dedicated Covid-19 hospital had tested positive again after recovering from the contagious disease.Also read: Over 23% of Delhi’s population exposed to coronavirus, shows sero-survey resultsAccording to Dr BL Sherwal, medical director of the Delhi government-run hospital, unless the virus is cultured or gene sequencing done, it will be difficult to determine whether it is a different strain of the virus that has infected the person the second time. “There can be a relapse. The virus can be isolated from the body particularly from the sputum. We have the evidence that after ninth or tenth day the virus becomes non-infectious and the patients are not tested again,” he said. “However, the virus has been reported to be living in patients who have recovered around 39 to 40 days back,” he added.Dr Chandragouda Dodagoudar, director of medical oncology at Aakash Healthcare in Dwarka, shared the case of a 65-year-old patient who had stage 2 lymphoma. The patient first visited the health facility in March and was advised chemotherapy but was very apprehensive due to the coronavirus disease.“The patient delayed the treatment for two and a half months and took alternative medicines and when that medication did not work and she started having pain, she visited the hospital. She had contracted Covid-19 by then and the lymphoma had progressed from Stage 2 to Stage 4. We could not administer chemotherapy while she was undergoing COVID treatment,” he said.The doctor said after the patient recovered from coronavirus, she was administered a slight dose of chemotherapy and became better and was discharged. But after a month, she had a relapse of COVID and ended up in a critical condition and succumbed last month.Also read: How Delhi crossed Mumbai in grim Covid-19 milestoneThe senior doctor said the patient did not have any other co-morbidities but called cancer a ‘‘co-morbidity’‘.Sherwal said patients with weak immunity are likely to get reinfection. “It can be there in any of the patients, cancer patients, HIV patients, etc,” he said.He added that immunocompromised patients are at more risk if they do not take precautions like wearing of masks and washing hands frequently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/curious-case-of-covid-19-in-delhi-re-emergence-seen-in-some-cured-patients/story-x6lbGYq9M8SMCfKPWoXieN.html

It has also provoked the wrath of BJP MP Maneka GandhiSharing the video of a turbaned youth placing the dog before the car and driving over it on her Twitter handle, Gandhi, who is also the chairperson of the non-governmental organisation People for Animals (PFA), wrote, “This is Gurinder Singh s/o Harbans Singh, village Dandupur, Kapurthala in Punjab. He is a breeder and seller of dogs for dog fights. This is what he does to dogs when they are no longer useful. This dog died after 30 minutes of being in excruciating pain.”The man used the animals for dog fights, Gandhi, who founded PFA said, adding, he “should go to jail,” while appealing to Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Kapurthala police for their intervention.Police has taken immediate action, said deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Sundeep Singh and registered a case under Sections 429 IPC, 11(1) of Prevention of Cruelty to Animal Act, 1960, against Gurinder on the complaint of Shalini, head of PFA Amritsar.Shalini said after she received CCTV footage on Monday of the dog being killed, her team traced Gurinder Singh through the car’s registration number.“We conducted a raid at the house along with local police and rescued 11 dogs today.

18-08-2020||Chandigarh||Who stands tall with the small business?||When the government announced that 80 crore Indians have been given food packets of lentils and rice/flour, reality hit hard. Reality that we are still a poor nation, a nation where people need to be given survival aid. So much for all the comparatives on what much of the first world is doing to support small business and employment and what India must do. I run a small business in the hospitality sector, one of the hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. What can I expect from a government busy in giving basics to 800 crore? Not much I suppose. But then, what have we ever got? Ever since the lockdown and the doom and gloom which surround us, challenges have been thrown at small business and its employees. Some have closed shop; some are on the verge of doing so, and others are struggling. Not once in this pandemic has the government or its minions deemed it fit to call or offer a word of support. Agencies that are quick to remind us of the dos and don’ts of due dates and compliances, are missing in action. Compare this with presidents, prime ministers, governors and mayors in countries such as Canada, the US, the UK, Germany, Australia and New Zealand who have come out in support of small business, local communities and jobs. These countries and governments realise that for the continuity of their economy and their way of life, it is important to support small and medium businesses. The lack of any meaningful support will lead to a destruction of small business, as by their nature they have the least depth in reserves and access to funds. However, it is the small and medium business in most countries that are among the largest employers. This holds true for India as well. DREAM SHATTERED FOR MANY The ramifications of this destruction will be felt for long and a lot of things will change permanently. Large-scale global events have had that impact historically. One has only to look back at the impact of the Spanish flu a century ago. The Indian economy was sputtering even before the pandemic hit, no matter how well the numbers are polished and presented, it will be hard to escape the fact that we have record unemployment and an unprecedented contraction in the economy. We are a consumption-driven economy; and it is the consumption story of the Indian economy which is hit hardest as the government failed in providing direct cash transfers to employers or employees. This will possibly lead to a catalyst effect in further slowing the economy, leading to closure of many businesses and resulting job losses. The number of people being pushed into penury will be huge as defaults and bankruptcies rise. Most small and medium businesses that had emerged as a result of the opening of the economy and helped countless people exit poverty and attain a higher standard of living will probably be shattered. There was a sense of self-worth and confidence which had crept into the citizens of modern India and no longer did we consider ourselves a third world nation. Today, that dream lies shattered for many. FIND BALANCE IN FIGHT AGAINST COVID The relationship of the Indian state with small business is at best that of indifference, for the most part predatory. A state that is paid for and maintained by a multitude of taxpayers through a never-ending multi-layered taxation system nips and cuts continuously. Where amid all this destruction is my promised government ‘of, by and for the people’? Public memory is short, so indulge me while I remind you how not so long ago, we queued up for a visa and the foreign job…good cheap Indian labour. Once again as the doors of opportunity close in our country, people will have to look outwards. Don’t kill the dream at home, All it will take is a bit of candour on your part, step out of your ivory towers and help rebuild what was so rudely shut, find a balance in the fight with this disease. Not as drill masters on a parade but as supporters and mentors would to a long-distance runner in a marathon.The writer is a Chandigarh-based food entrepreneur.

This policy for the first time boldly has talked about our country’s legacy. So in search of our own identity, education will play an important role in the future,” Patwardhan said. Along with Patwardhan, SPPU vice chancellor Nitin Karmalkar, pro-vice Chancellor N S Umrani, SPPU registrar Prafulla Pawar and deans of several departments of SPPU were present. Patwardhan further said, “I will not talk about the specifications or the points drafted in this policy, but it is the process of change of thoughts for all of us. SPPU is actually a miniature of UGC in Pune, we are handling more than 1,000 universities and SPPU is handling more than 1,000 colleges.”“We celebrated our Independence Day but the question is that have we become free in our mind. And education is to liberate our minds from that kind of impact of colonial times and so many invasions on our country. So we have to change our curriculum in a major way and we have started this process. The inter-disciplinary studies concept was first introduced in SPPU in the country and emphasis is given on this in the NEP. The internship has now been applied to all other subjects. So this new policy comes with so many new things and I welcome this policy.” he added. Talking on this occasion, Karmalkar said, “It has become necessary to make basic changes in the syllabus and with the NEP it would be possible now. Social development is an important aspect highlighted in this policy and it should be promoted by universities and colleges.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/ugc-vice-chairman-sppu-vice-chancellor-praise-nep/story-FOSpbSyQuNR1ssK0lMhecO.html

The civic administration and police officials have permitted small mandals to set up mandaps by getting requisite permission. Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar said, “Considering the Covid pandemic, Ganpati mandals should celebrate the festival inside their temples only. The mandals that do not have their own temples can install mandaps after obtaining permissions from PMC and other departments.” Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham said, “Only those mandals that do not have their own temples or separate areas can install small-size mandaps. These mandals should keep in mind their social responsibility and follow all necessary safety precautions during the festival. The police officials will check the mandap spot and, if possible, mandals should celebrate the festival within the temple premises.” Many Ganpati mandals had written to PMC and Pune police department seeking permission to erect mandaps. “It is not possible for smaller mandals to celebrate the festival without the mandaps. In the recent meeting that we had with the authorities, we sought permission to install mandaps,” said Shailesh Bhadai, president, Bhadai Samaj Ganpati mandal. Khadak Ganpati mandal president Sanjay Balgude said, “In Pune, many temples have a big permanent idol and a smaller one for immersion during the visarjan day. As it would not be right to worship two idols inside temple premises, small mandals should be allowed to put mandaps by following social distancing and safety precautions.” The city has around 2,500 Ganesh mandals and many unregistered mandals. Many small Ganpati mandals do not have their own temples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/small-mandals-in-pune-can-set-up-mandaps-after-getting-permission/story-dw72A3brJJadKzTCuPM1MO.html
18-08-2020||Pune||Experts raise questions about Pune administration’s handling of Covid-19 situation||Pune district in a new hotspot in the state as it has overtaken state capital Mumbai in the positive case count. Out of the 6, 04, 358 positive cases in the state as of August 17, 1, 32, 481 are from Pune district and 1, 29, 479 are from Mumbai, followed by Thane district with 1, 14, 896.Even though the administration claims that the district has been testing more, Mumbai with a population of 1.24 crore has tested 6,51,593 while Pune as a district with a population of 94 lakhs has tested close to 5,57,225. Experts have raised serious questions on the administration’s handling of the situation. According to experts some of the loopholes which have led to this situation could be poor contact tracing, while state’s average contact tracing for every positive person is about 24, Pune city’s contact tracing is now only 11. A good tracing system helps break the chain by containing the spread of the virus. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee, said, “Despite me repeating the same point in every meeting that the administration must focus 100 per cent on those who have comorbidities are also senior citizens and pick them up even at the slightest symptoms before they develop complications and put them under institutional quarantine. There has been no response.”“Also, the people have failed to follow precautionary measures like maintaining social distance, wearing masks, and immediately reporting to hospitals in case of symptoms,” he said.Meanwhile, while Mumbai came up with jumbo facilities two months ago, Pune is still scrambling to set up its jumbo facilities. Saurabh Rao, Divisional Commissioner said, “It is true that we have missed deadlines due to several reasons including rains, but we are hopeful that we could at least set up the critical care facilities at these centres for now.”Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president, Indian Medical Association (IMA), said, “In Mumbai, the peak activity of coronavirus pandemic reached at the end of July and now it on a plateau in Mumbai. In Pune, the peak period will be experienced at end of August or in early September. So it is expected to overtake Mumbai. Secondly, in Pune, the testing activity is being carried out with a higher momentum than Mumbai for last 2 weeks. That’s why the number of new cases will be more. Third, in Pune, the patients are discharged after a full treatment of 10 or more days. So the number of active cases is on a higher side. At the same time in Mumbai the patients are discharged even on 5th day if the symptoms are abated.”Dr Sanjay Dabhade, Jan Aarogya Manch, said, “I think that lockdown measures have limitations. We cannot restrict the movements of the people furthermore. Best way to contain the spread is personal safety measures. Cases are sure to rise. It is inevitable now our aim should be to check Case Fatality Rate and provide the best possible Health Care to all more attention towards high-risk patients.”Rao further said that all possible contacts are traced in the district within two to three days. “Also that the infectivity rate or the R naught is now going down for Pune and hopefully in the next 17 day, we will reach a point where Mumbai is right now.” Rao also indicated at testing out of the ICMR guidelines juts like Mumbai did to stop the super spreaders. He also hinted at the discrepancy in the number of cases being reported by the state and the PMC which will be hopefully resolved by Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/experts-raise-questions-about-pune-administration-s-handling-of-covid-19-situation/story-Nfi5oOhHOmIl8nFYiDRoPP.html

While presiding over the Apex State Level Committee for monitoring of Prakritik Kheti Khushal Kisan Yojna, the CM said natural farming is a complete paradigm shift from traditional farming which involves various cropping inputs. He said continuous use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers have increased the yield of crops but has trigged negative impact on soil as well as the environment. He said natural farming emphasizes on natural growth of various crops without use of fertilizers and pesticides.The CM said during his first budget for 2018-19, he had allocated Rs 25 crore for promotion of natural farming in the state. “The scheme envisages to increase farm income in harmony with the nature with no use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Agriculture plays significant role in economy of the state with over 67% population directly depending on agriculture,” he said.He said natural farming not only helps in providing hygienic and chemical free fruit and vegetable to farmers but also gives them remunerative price of their produce. The state government had set a target of covering 50,000 families under natural farming in 2019 but succeeded in covering about 55,000 families. The CM said the target has been fixed to cover 2 lakh farmer families under natural farming during the current year. Out of total 3,226 panchyats in the state, 2,934 panchayats have been covered under Subhash Palekar Natural Farming.“As many as 72,193 farmers have been trained for natural farming during the year 2019-20 against the target of 50,000 farmers and about 2,000 training camps were organised,” he added.The CM said actual training camps were not possible amid the Covid pandemic but regular video camps and awareness campaigns through social media were conducted to motivate farmers to adopt natural farming. He said personal contact with trained farmers and meetings with small groups of farmers adopting natural farming were also held during this period. The state government will also consider providing separate market place for farmers to facilitate them in selling their produce, he added.“The state government is also providing subsidy of 25% on purchase of indigenous breed of cows which will not only help in supplementing the income of farmers but also help in natural farming,” the CM said. He also released publications on success stories regarding achievements of farmers under Prakritik kheti Khushal Kisan Yojna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/9-61-lakh-farmer-families-to-be-covered-under-natural-farming-by-2022-jai-ram/story-z4ZjWRcDbVqf2r6l0BdmGN.html

The CPI (M) said the state government should provide necessary fungicides and pesticides in sufficient quantities to orchardists through centres of the horticulture department. Party leader Sanjay Chauhan said earlier the orchardists had also demanded action to prevent damage to the apple crop due to these diseases but the state government does not appear to be serious regarding it. “Rs 4,500 crore apple economy of the state will be wasted and orchardists will be facing employment crisis if the state government does not take concrete steps to prevent these diseases,” he added.The outbreak of these diseases have been witnessed in Shimla, Kullu, Kinnaur, Mandi and Chamba districts. “The state government is spending money on the pretext of zero budget farming but they have abolished subsidies which were provided for seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides and plants. This has increased the cost of production,” he said.Chauhan said the state government and orchardists will have to work together to fight these diseases. “In 1982-83, the state government and experts from the horticulture university and department had extended support to orchardists by visiting the affected areas. The same strategy can be applied to prevent these diseases now,” he said.The party will organise a statewide protest on August 26 to demand implementation of these ideas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/take-concrete-steps-to-prevent-damage-to-apple-crop-cpi-m-to-himachal-govt/story-dFjwzoTHU90XdIAbYeUKSN.html

Railways have been controlling the platform ticket rates in this way through the start of the corona pandemic,” the tweet read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/platform-ticket-rates-hiked-at-pune-to-maintain-social-distancing-at-station-railways/story-XJZD8zkB8s0Z02yuoweZmI.html
18-08-2020||Chandigarh||Sikhs, Hindus ‘endangered minorities’ in Afghanistan, says resolution introduced in US Congress||Washington: Describing Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan as “endangered minorities”, a resolution introduced in the US Congress has sought to resettle these persecuted religious communities from the war-torn country to America. Introduced in the House of Representatives last week by Congresswoman Jackie Speier and co-sponsored by seven others, the resolution supports refugee protection for Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan, noting the “systematic religious persecution, discrimination and existential danger” faced by members of these communities. “Sikhs and Hindus are indigenous but endangered minorities in Afghanistan, numbering approximately 700 out of a community that recently included over 8,000 members,” the resolution said. The resolution supports resettling Sikhs and Hindus from Afghanistan in the US under the United States Refugee Admissions Programme pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act. Expressing concern for the safety of Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan, the resolution condemns all terrorist attacks, religious persecution and discrimination against members of these communities in the war-ravaged country. Noting that Islamic militants attacked a gurdwara in Kabul on March 25, killing 25 worshippers, including a four-year-old girl, the resolution said that the terrorists made further attempts on the lives of the survivors before and after the funeral ceremony held for the victims. The resolution also mentioned the suicide bombing carried out by Islamic State-Khorasan in Jalalabad on July 1, 2018, which took the lives of 19 people, including leaders of Sikh and Hindu communities. “These acts of violence follow a greater pattern of targeted violence against Sikhs, Hindus, and other religious minorities in Afghanistan in recent years,” it said. According to the resolution, the Department of State and US Commission on International Religious Freedom have documented systemic discrimination against Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan, including restrictions on religious practices, illegal seizure of property, the inability to send their children to public schools due to harassment, judicial bias against religious minorities, and constitutional limitations on the political rights of religious minorities. The former Taliban-led government routinely persecuted and discriminated against the Afghan-Sikh community, restricting their funeral rites and forcing the community to publicly identify themselves by wearing yellow armbands, it said. The resolution rued that President Donald Trump has proposed resettling up to only 18,000 refugees for 2020, in contrast to the Obama administration’s proposal of 1.1 lakh refugees for fiscal year 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sikhs-hindus-endangered-minorities-in-afghanistan-says-resolution-introduced-in-us-congress/story-DolXMAEbvr6d7H0l2oBfoK.html

The Himachal Pradesh Police has set up a five-member board of officers to ensure the safety of the tunnel, which will shorten the distance between Manali and Leh by 46km. The tunnel is strategically important for the defence forces as it will provide all-weather connectivity to the frontier with China. “Police need to prepare for providing round the clock security. To work out the requirement, a board of officers has been set up,” director general of police Sanjay Kundu said on Tuesday. The board will visit Jawahar Tunnel in Banihal and the Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Tunnel at Chenani-Nashri to study the security set-up of J&K Police. The board will submit its report by September 14. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the tunnel in September-end.The board comprises Daljit Singh Thakur, inspector general, security; deputy inspector general of police, central range, Madhusudhan, Kullu superintendent of police Gaurav Singh, Lahaul and Spiti SP Rajesh Dharmani and a representative of the Intelligence Bureau. “The best practices followed in similar road tunnel projects in the Swiss Alps, China, Japan and Pakistan may be studied in-depth and replicated when it is compatible to our needs. We should also learn from the good and bad experiences of tunnel traffic management systems of Jammu and Kashmir and elsewhere,” Kundu said. Close circuit cameras will be installed not only inside the tunnel but along the Manali-Leh axis. Besides, the board will study the communication systems that could work inside the tunnel as cellular phones and ordinary wireless sets do not function in tunnels. Contingency plans will be worked out for crash evacuation, trauma management and embedded firefighting systems; tunnel-related emergencies such as cave-ins, water bursting will be tested too. The board would propose a unit with strength, gadgets and equipment that will function as a repository of all information and database related to vehicles, passengers besides scientific management of traffic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/north-south-portals-of-rohtang-tunnel-will-have-police-stations/story-pr70NXS5grcJKpLnyX3cBL.html

18-08-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab seeks re-assessment of river water share, while Haryana wants neighbour to complete SYL Canal||Chandigarh: Capt Amarinder Singh and Manohar Lal Khattar, the chief ministers of Punjab and Haryana, will be meeting for the first time to discuss the contentious Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) Canal issue under the aegis of the Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Tuesday afternoon. The meeting follows the Supreme Court’s direction to the Centre on July 28 to mediate between the two states to resolve the long-pending SYL issue. The report of today’s meeting will be submitted to the court. During the meeting, Capt Amarinder Singh is expected to compare the figures of availability of water from 1980 to 2020. “The availability of water in the Sutlej, Ravi and Beas rivers over 40 years has reduced drastically and the Centre knows that fact. We want them to start reassessment afresh,” a Punjab government officer said, requesting anonymity. The Punjab chief minister met a battery of officers, including principal secretary, water resources, Sarabjit Singh, newly appointed chairman of the Punjab Water Regulation and Development Authority (PWRDA) Karan Avtar Singh, on Monday evening to discuss the state’s stand and strategy. AVAILABILITY RELEVANT ONCE CANAL IS BUILT: HARYANA Khattar met senior irrigation department officials on Monday evening at Haryana Bhawan in Delhi, where he is camping. Haryana officials have said that completing the construction of the canal and the availability of water are two separate issues. “The water availability issue is relevant once the capacity to carry the water is in place,” a Haryana government official said. Quoting an example, the officials said that during the monsoon when there are no restrictions on water indent, the surplus Ravi and Beas waters can be used for Haryana’s parched southern districts to supplement the receding groundwater table. “Otherwise, this surplus water flows into Pakistan,” the official said. The Union water resources ministry has also recorded Punjab government’s unwillingness to complete the canal after several rounds of meetings between the Centre, Haryana and Punjab in 2019 remained inconclusive. “Punjab has clearly refused to complete the canal on the pretext of non-availability of spare water. This argument is a mere excuse to not implement the apex court orders,” a Haryana official added. LONG-PENDING DISPUTE To enable Haryana to use its share of the waters of the Sutlej river and its tributary, Beas, a canal linking the Sutlej with the Western Yamuna Canal, cutting across the state was planned. The 212-km canal was to carry Haryana’s share of water to its southern parts. While 122 km of the canal was to run through Punjab, the remaining 90km was to pass through Haryana. Haryana completed its stretch of the SYL Canal in 1980 at a cost of Rs 56 crore, while Punjab kept delaying the construction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-seeks-re-assessment-of-river-water-share-while-haryana-wants-neighbour-to-complete-syl-canal/story-9FVTqkUtv5CEjbaDDIc5DP.html

18-08-2020||Lucknow||UP is unlikely to experience winter load-shedding||Uttar Pradesh residents are unlikely to experience winter load-shedding this year with the state tipped to have substantial surplus electricity, when compared to the expected demand between October 2020 and March 2021. On the annual basis, though, it may have a marginal peak demand-supply gap.The Load Generation Balance Report (LGBR) or the power demand forecast report released by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) recently shows UP to have a peak demand-supply deficit from 0.2% in April to 7.6% in May this year. But the report forecasts that the state will have surplus power from October onwards.The state, according to the report, is expected to have a power surplus of 25% in October, 43.2% in November, 51% in December, 34.5% in January 2021, 36.8% in February and 36.7% in March, the last month of the current financial year.Overall, UP’s peak power requirement during the current financial year has been anticipated to be 24,220 MW against the expected 23,440 MW demand, the peak shortfall being of 780 MW which is 3.2% of the requirement. The country, as a whole, is expected to have a peak surplus of 18,160 MW or 9.1%.“As may be seen, 11 states/UTs are likely to experience an energy deficit and 13 States/UTs peak deficits of varying extents. Further, 23 states/UTs are anticipated to have net surplus energy and 21 states/UTs are expected to be surplus in peak on an annual basis.1 State/UT each will have ‘Nil’ surplus/deficit in Energy and Peak,” the report says, adding “All other states/UTs in the country are likely to have demand-supply gaps of varying degrees both for energy and peak.”Among the Northern states/UTs Chandigarh, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab apart from UP may have peak demand-supply gap to the tune of 20%, 9.0%, 0.8%, 11.2% and 3.2%, respectively, while three other states—Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand are expected to have extra power vis-à-vis their demand, by 82.8%,21.9% and 22.7%.UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad chairman and state advisory committee member Avadhesh Kumar Verma said it was encouraging to see that UP is expected to have surplus power in winter and only a marginal deficit in summer. “In UP, availability of power may no longer be an issue ,” he pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-is-unlikely-to-experience-winter-load-shedding/story-T5MwWar0RAyocSxhkDbXQK.html

The KIMS said in a statement that due to shortage of liquid oxygen from the manufacturing company, authorities were informed about the situation and requested for arrangements of liquid oxygen from other suppliers. “We have anticipated that low oxygen volume hypoxic crisis may occur for oxygen dependent patients,” it said. “For damage control and on precautionary measures, we plan to shift all oxygen-dependent patients to various government and private hospitals. “During this crisis, all government officials and authorities immediately responded to our call and supported us by joining hands with the management for saving the lives of the patients. We are indebted for their kind co-operation,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/patients-shifted-as-bengaluru-hospital-runs-out-of-oxygen-supply/story-9Luak8Xp4iPt8wQMUEkbiN.html
18-08-2020||Pune||13.5% decline in suicide cases during lockdown period in Pune||There has been a drop of 13.5 per cent in suicides during March-July 2020 as compared to the same period last year, says a study conducted by SNDT Arts and Commerce College for Women, Pune.According to the report, 264 suicides were reported from March-July 2020 as compared to 305 during the same period last year. Also, the majority of suicides were reported in the age group of 20-40 years, 61 per cent in 2020 and 59 per cent in 2019. As per the three-month suicide data of this year, 198 were males and 66 females. The 2019 figure was 226 males, 78 females and one gender was not mentioned.The research was conducted by professor Madhavi Kulkarni, vice-principal and associate professor of Commerce (project coordinator); Manasee Rajhans, head and associate professor of Psychology and Vasanti Joshi, associate professor of Commerce.DCP (crime branch) Bachchan Singh coordinated with the SNDT team for research and police inspector Ajit Lakade provided statistics for research and analysis.Kulkarni said, “The study was undertaken to identify the reasons behind the decline in the number of suicide cases in the city during Covid-19 lockdown. However, no association of this decline can be established with age, gender, source of income and economic status of the victims.”“The main factors or causes of suicide attempts and means used also have no significant association with the decline. By the logic of elimination, it can be inferred that the decline has a direct association with the lockdown and Covid-19 phenomenon,” she said.According to the report, the main reason for decline in the number of suicides during the lockdown period was family support which helped people overcome loneliness, depression, financial penury, loss of a job among others. Singh said, “One of the reasons is the support of family. Prima facie, proximity to family members gives people morale support and helps to fight suicidal tendencies.”Other reasons for the decline in suicides include the probable victim did not get the opportunity to attempt as all the family members were at home, the fear of pandemic engrossed all other depression generating fears and worries, tightened policing and social patrolling made it difficult to attempt suicide.“Suicide has been one of the most common causes of death in our country for a while now. Our city, our state and our country need initiatives to raise awareness about suicide prevention,” Nikunja Gujar, founder-director, psychologist, psychotherapist, Empticons India. “This study shows the results of the efforts and initiatives by police and other organisations,” she said.Findings of studyOverall there is a decline by 13.5% in suicides (264 in 2020 from March to July vs 305 in 2019)March to July 2019 -305 suicides (226 male, 78 female, 1 – gender not mentioned)March to July 2020 – 264 suicides (198 male, 66 female)Majority of suicides reported between 20 and 40 years age (59% in 2019, 61% in 2020)Majority of the victims are from middle class (53% in 2019, 51% in 2020)Domestic disputes and depression are the major reasons for suicides (both combined are the cause of 45% suicides in 2019, 30% in 2020)Cases in which more number of family members are there — joint families, saw lesser suicides while nuclear families saw more. In 2020, 72% suicides in nuclear families. (90 out of 125).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/13-5-decline-in-suicide-cases-during-lockdown-period-in-pune/story-Z9itDhTGQHc9aYZ5RQwqZI.html

Mumbai’s death rate is around 5.4%, much higher than the state’s 3.4%. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has observed that currently, private hospitals are reporting a higher death rate than civic-run hospitals. In a meeting held on Monday, the civic body asked private hospitals to take more precautionary measures to ensure a decline in the deaths. BMC has instructed the representatives of private hospitals to follow the directives of the civic body under the ‘Mission Save Lives’ initiative.As per an analysis by BMC, at civic-run hospitals, the death rate has declined from 5.8% in June to 4.8% in August. But in private hospitals, it has increased to over 40% during the same period. “Earlier, out of 100 deaths, we used to record on an average 82 deaths from civic-run hospitals and 18 from private hospitals. But now, we are recording around 59 deaths from civic hospitals and 41 from private hospitals. The death rates in private hospitals are gradually increasing,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. “We have asked to pay special focus on critical patients. They have been instructed to provide faster treatment to patients with pre-medical ailments,” said Kakani..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-deaths-in-mumbai-s-private-hospitals-seeing-rise-civic-body/story-ZlgEYfZJ6Ahr41hPIyNryK.html
18-08-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Strolling in CP during the new normal||Nothing has changed. The same white colonial-era columns. The same showrooms, with their immaculately dressed mannequins gazing by the glass displays. The same giggles of passersby. And wait, there are even two earnest-seeming young activists, boldly stopping strangers to collect funds for animal rights.The pandemic-era Connaught Place (CP) feels the same. To some extent. But as this evening walk reveals, it exudes even more intense vibes. Indeed, this is the perfect time to take a stroll about the Inner Circle arcade if you, like many people, haven’t come here since the first coronavirus-triggered lockdown began in late March. Every little familiar landmark or corner appears to be permeated with a melancholic sense of what life used to be in the much freer pre-corona era. This evening appears even more solemn due to the slight but steady drizzle. The large glass windows of an upper floor in A-block are lit up with a golden lamp, glowing palely, like a weak candle flickering under a dark cloudy sky. The arcade is almost empty except for a few stray dogs lazily lying on the dusty floor. Two girls are seen walking fast, one of them excitedly murmuring to the other, “Lets do a chakkar (round)!”Many shops are closed, but a few showrooms are open — and seem to be crowded with more masked staffers than customers. However, there’s a queue of about half a dozen shoppers outside the glass doors of a clothing shop that formerly used to be the site of two long-time bookstores. They shut down long ago. The shop window is displaying a discount of 70%.If you gaze towards Central Park on your right, you will see the familiar flag mast installed in the centre of the garden—but no flag, at least this evening. And now a little girl appears hawking a tray full of badges of Indian flag. “I always sell these when independence Day nears,” says Varsha. She is 12. (This walk was undertaken a day before 15th August). Further ahead a street seller is sitting on a bench with a basket of white flowers by his side. He is about to finish his chocolate bar. Too shy to reveal his name, he simply shrugs his shoulders, saying, “I was feeling bored... so I bought an ice cream.” Nearby, two suited male mannequins are staring out of a shop window. One of them is in a mask. The poster stuck on the glass says—“Safe Sales.”Next on the route: one of Connaught Place’s oldest restaurants. At this time, in the old normal, the tall glass windows would show blurry profiles of animated diners inside, probably feasting on buttery curries and tandoori rotis. But today the windows are cloaked in darkness. The restaurant is closed at the moment.And here’s a much-loved secondhand book stall. It, too, is shuttered. An auto is parked nearby, with no sign of its driver. The lane is completely silent for the moment.In the N-block arcade, a frail white-haired woman is walking extremely slowly, carrying a bundle. Can she be a shopper? She stops by a bench, sits down, looks around, places the bundle at one end of the bench and lies down on the bench, making the bundle her pillow. She closes her eyes and seems to fall asleep. It is still drizzling and she is getting wet.The time is only 8pm, and Connaught Place is feeling like midnight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-strolling-in-cp-during-the-new-normal/story-HPk0AUxMXlvdTviiFukLXI.html
18-08-2020||City||Central body sees no locust threat in Punjab, Haryana||As the rainy season entering the last phase in northern India, scientists have assessed a bleak chance of revival of locust attacks in the states of Punjab and Haryana in the coming few months. The evaluation based on the field input by Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), a subsidiary of the central ministry, has brought breather to cotton and paddy growers of the semi-arid districts of south Malwa belt of Punjab. Several districts of Punjab, including Fazilka, Muktsar, Ferozepur and Bathinda, were on constant alert for the last over five months for possible invasions by swarms of migratory pests that target vegetation. KL Gurjar, LWO deputy director and national coordinator on mitigating locust attacks, said on Monday that no locust swam was reported in Punjab and Haryana noticed in the last few weeks. He said after movements in the parts of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, locust swam have returned to Rajasthan to mature and lay eggs. “Locust tends to lay eggs during humid weather. The desert locusts normally live and breed in semi-arid regions and numerous egg colonies were reported in various parts of Rajasthan. But our teams have significantly contained the situation and almost entire these egg colonies have been wiped out,” said Gurjar. The expert said with the onset of winter, the locust population is expected to leave the Indian region from October onwards. Gurjar said there is no threat assessment of the pest attack in the coming months but much will depend upon Pakistan how effectively it manages the locust crisis. On February 1 this year, Pakistan had declared a national emergency to tackle the insects destroying crops on a large scale in its Punjab province. Two days later, few villages located along the Pakistan border in Fazilka district witnessed locust attack. Agriculture secretary KS Pannu said no egg-laying by locust was reported in Punjab or its adjoining areas in Rajasthan and Haryana. “Since February, Fazilka and few other districts experienced stray incidents of locust invasion but no crop loss was reported since February this year,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/central-body-sees-no-locust-threat-in-punjab-haryana/story-bDZJkaoLE5sE1IQSn90iPO.html

Last week, the civic body took many similar initiatives to prevent crowding during the immersion of Ganpati idols.“We will have three vehicles with a syntex tank attached to it and volunteers will help with the immersion process. Devotees should perform aarti at their homes and get the idols to the mobile immersion facility, where the volunteers will carry out the immersions as per rituals,” said Dr Vipin Sharma, commissioner, TMC.A similar initiative to book slots online for the immersions has also started in Thane. However, many residents found it difficult to find slots online. “We are releasing these slots in phases to avoid overcrowding at a one particular time. There might be instances during which one may not get to book the slot on a particular day. They can try doing so the next day morning,” said Manisha Pradhan, pollution control officer, TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-civic-body-introduces-mobile-immersion-facility-for-residents-in-containment-zones/story-JtAGvrgfEkjPBmgx2vVC4I.html

18-08-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana revenue dept widens ambit of probe into property registration malpractices||Widening the ambit of inquiry into the malpractices in registration of sale deeds of properties in Haryana, the revenue department has ordered that the registrations carried out from April 3, 2017 to December 31, 2019 be probed for violation of Section 7-A of Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas (HDRUA) Act. The broadening of the extent of probe was done at the insistence of deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who holds the charge of revenue portfolio. The fresh inquiry would start from the day (April 3, 2017) an amendment in Section 7-A was notified by the ML Khattar-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in 2017 to water down the HDRUA Act provision. The detection of malpractices in execution of sale deeds has cast a shadow on the functioning of the revenue department under Dushyant’s command. By widening the ambit of inquiry, the Jannayak Janta Party leader is trying to bring the functioning of the previous BJP government under scanner. In separate communications, additional chief secretary, revenue, Vijai Vardhan has asked the divisional commissioners of Ambala, Karnal, Rohtak, Hisar, Gurugram and Faridabad to conduct a fresh inquiry within next six weeks for property registrations done in all districts since April 3, 2017. “While doing so you are expected to fix the responsibility by name upon the erring revenue officers (sub-registrars, joint sub-registrars) if any, so that appropriate disciplinary action can be initiated against them as per disciplinary rules,” reads the communication. The initial inquiry which led to registration of criminal cases against six tehsil officials of Gurugram district was for the period between January and July 2020. The stipulations in Section 7-A of HDRUA pertained to grant of a no-objection certificate (NoC) by the town and country planning department (TCPD) before registration of land in notified urban areas. The 2017 amendment The 2017 amendment of Section 7-A of HDRUA Act which watered down the law was steered by the BJP government in the assembly. It led to two modifications in the provision. First, it decreased the size of notified urban area land holding for which NoC is required from less than one hectare (2.5 acres) to less than two kanals. Secondly, the definition of land for which the NoC was required was changed from vacant land to agricultural land. The agricultural land was defined as Nehri (canal irrigated), Chahi (irrigated from well), Barani (dependent on rainfall) or any other term in revenue records. “The 2017 amendment passed by the assembly ensured that the real estate developers were able to circumvent the requirement of NoC by converting agricultural land into uncultivable (gair mumkin) in revenue records. Also, the reduction of size of land from less than hectare to two kanals worked to the advantage of realtors,” said a revenue official. Officials said the registration of properties without a NoC in notified urban area land under Section 7-A led to mushrooming of unauthorised settlements. It came to the notice of Gurugram divisional commissioner that a number of naib tehsildars were executing sale deeds indiscriminately without the NoC,” said an official. 2017 amendment being undone The cabinet meanwhile has also approved an ordinance to undo the 2017 amendment in the HDRUA Act to water down Section 7-A of the Act. With the assembly session starting next week, a Bill in this regard will be brought in the House. The definition of notified urban area land and size of the holding for which the NoC was required is being modified. The land holding for which NoC is required is proposed to be less than one acre instead of less than two kanals and the notified urban area land definition will be changed from agricultural to vacant again. The requirement of a NoC stating that land transfer does not contravene any provisions of the Act was to prevent ill planned and haphazard construction in urban areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-revenue-dept-widens-ambit-of-probe-into-property-registration-malpractices/story-77NdYDKeajL9hiQXUO4qfN.html

The units will be set up to prevent devotees from carrying out any procession or to avoid crowding during the immersion process. The civic workers appointed at these units will undertake the immersions of Ganpati idols collected from devotees, as residents will not be permitted to step inside the ponds. In an advisory issued on Monday, the civic body urged citizens to get Ganpati idols three-four days ahead of the festival which falls on August 22. The corporation’s advisory further stated that only residents in the radius of up to 2km of natural ponds or the sea can carry out immersions at these natural water bodies. Devotees will have to visit the 167 artificial ponds in the city or the collection units set up in their wards where civic officials will be deployed for the immersion. These units will be set up in open grounds in every ward.Those living in containment zones have been permitted to set-up artificial ponds for immersion of idols within the zones. “Every year, devotees carry out processions while bringing the idols home and during immersions. This year, it cannot be allowed as everyone needs to follow social distancing owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. So devotees should visit the nearest artificial pond for immersion. Only few people will be allowed at the spot and social distancing norms need to be followed,” said the official.In a set of guidelines issued earlier, the height of household Ganpati idols were capped at two feet. Devotees were also directed to hold low-key celebrations as much as possible.For community idols, the height of the idols is restricted to four feet. The earlier guidelines also stated that not more than five people will be allowed while bringing the idol from the workshop to the pandal or to homes. During immersions of the idols too, only five people will be allowed without any processions. The corporation also advised children and senior citizens not to participate in the processions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ganesh-immersions-collection-units-in-all-wards-to-be-set-up-says-mumbai-civic-corporation/story-x75kZI8Eu9NLSSe4F1fYNJ.html

For starters, no one, not even lawmakers, will be allowed to enter the Vidhan Sabha until they present a Covid-19 negative report, not older than three days. Also, it will be for the first time that visitors will not be allowed to witness the House proceedings. The speaker’s as well as the visitors’ galleries will be converted into a sitting place for legislators to ensure social distancing. And every paper to be laid on the table of the House will go through the sanitisation machine. “The Covid-19 negative report must not be more than three days old from the date of first sitting of the Vidhan Sabha,” said Gupta, who on Monday held meeting of the assembly secretariat to put in place the restrictions needed to “insulate the House from Covid-19.” “We are fully geared up to meet every challenge and hold the assembly session,” he said. Though the Business Advisory Committee of the Vidhan Sabha will decide the duration of the session, there are indications that there would be two or at the most three sittings of the House. The session is being convened to meet the constitutional requirements of holding a session within six months of the previous session. Sources say that till Monday, the Vidhan Sabha secretariat had not received any business from the state government, except questions from legislators for the Question Hour. According to the speaker, a special camp will be organised at the Vidhan Sabha complex for assembly employees to undergo a Covid-19 test “free of cost.” From chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to his cabinet colleagues, and speaker, deputy speaker, officials of the security staff and the media, it is mandatory for all to carry a Covid-19 negative certificate. The MLAs and ministers, Gupta said, have been urged to not bring their staff and supporters along. If needed, the personal assistants of the ministers will be allowed entry in the assembly premises. MLAs and ministers will be provided a kit, containing masks, gloves and sanitisers. Besides, shoe covers will also be provided at the entrance of the Vidhan Sabha. Special care is being taken to ensure that all items such as sanitisers, gloves, masks, sanitising machines, shoe covers that will be used during the session are ‘Made in India’ products. “The sitting arrangements of the lawmakers have been made in such a way that social distancing norms are followed,” the speaker said, pointing out that one MLA instead of two will sit on a bench. Two days before the beginning of the session, the MLAs’ hostel will be sanitised and members will have to vacate the hostel. Every inch of the house will be sanitised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-entry-in-haryana-vidhan-sabha-without-covid-19-negative-report/story-DjdO7qa69Hj5DQJ0qQ1LhI.html

Following this, Pawar and his family members also underwent antigen tests. Their results came negative. However, as a precautionary measure, Pawar will remain in isolation for the next four days and will not meet people.“The antigen test report of Pawar sahib, conducted at Breach Candy Hospital, has come negative. He is taking all the precautions. There is no reason to worry,” state health minister Rajesh Tope said, adding that the party would request the senior leader to postpone all his visits for some days.Of the 12 staffers whose Covid-19 test results came positive on Monday, 10 are members of Pawar’s security detail, while the other two are drivers of his family members. Some other staff members also underwent tests and their reports are awaited. The security personnel have to ensure that there is a distance maintained between the NCP chief and the people who meet him. Thus, they may have come in contact with someone who was infected while ensuring security, the health minister said.“We conduct the Covid-19 testing of the family members and staff every 15 days. The samples were taken on Sunday. All the 12 staffers are asymptomatic and have been admitted to the NSCI facility at Worli,” said a close aide of the veteran leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/12-staff-at-ncp-chief-s-mumbai-home-test-positive-for-covid-sharad-pawar-kin-s-results-negative/story-f2vIqASykDrRuEGXpyXvrK.html
18-08-2020||Mumbai||Didn’t insult doctors, comments directed at WHO: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut||After the medical fraternity demanded an apology from Shiv Sena parliamentarian Sanjay Raut for a statement he made during an interview, the Rajya Sabha member stood his ground. Raut on Monday said that he did not disrespect doctors and that there is a difference between an “insult” and a “joke”. Raut faced the ire of doctors after he said that compounders know more than doctors and blamed the World Health Organization (WHO) for the spread of Covid-19 during an interview to a Marathi news channel. The Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and asked if he too has a similar opinion on the knowledge that doctors have. “They [doctors’ body] are seeking an apology, but they should first understand that I have not insulted them and had no intention to do so. Whatever I said was in reply to a question on WHO. There is a difference between an insult and a joke. I have always had respect for doctors and the medical community. The politics over the statement should stop,” Raut told reporters. The Sena leader stated that his comments were directed at WHO, which according to him has become a “political organisation more than a health organisation”. He said that that the doctor’s body should not take statements against WHO to their heart, as similar statements, against WHO, have been made by United States President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin too. “I am of the clear opinion that WHO has now become a political entity and is no longer a health organisation. Many leaders, including Trump and Putin, have said that WHO is responsible for the spread of Covid-19 across the world. Will doctors here hold protests against Trump and Putin for their statements against WHO? Will they go on a strike against it,” he questioned. The Sena Member of Parliament (MP) added that he hailed doctors and the medical fraternity for their work during the pandemic in public statements and through articles in party mouthpiece Saamana, which he edits. He also claimed that he has sided with MARD whenever they have come up with any issues against the government. Directing criticism to Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, Raut claimed that the PM had insulted Indian doctors at an event in London. “Narendra Modi went to London and insulted doctors. Somebody sent me a clip. He said how doctors in India are businessmen and are not interested in the service of the patients, but are only interested in earning money and utilising medicines. [After this] doctors there [in London] had protested, but not the ones here,” he said. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/didn-t-insult-doctors-comments-directed-at-who-shiv-sena-mp-sanjay-raut/story-5X5EMkkCfHAbFbwSdcT2yJ.html

While some have suggested this indicates a “second wave”, experts and the local administration say the increased cases are due to the infection spreading beyond the areas of Malegaon that were initially afflicted by Covid-19. Malegaon reported five cases and one death on April 10, and the local administration responded quickly. On June 10, the tally of Covid-19 cases in Malegaon was 861 and the death toll was 65. By the end of the month, on June 30, the tally had risen to 1,087 and fatalities were at 81. With 226 cases and 16 deaths in 21 days, and the number of daily new cases down to single-digit numbers, the ‘Malegaon model’ received applause from many quarters. However, in the past two weeks, there has been a rise in the number of reported cases. As of August 16, Malegaon had 623 new cases, with 35-40 new cases being recorded daily. Nitin Kapadnis, deputy commissioner of Malegaon municipal corporation, confirmed this, saying, “Cases have risen over the last few days and it will take at least four weeks to control, like we did in June.” The positivity rate in Malegaon is more than 30%, compared to the state’s rate, which hovers between 18-20%. Dr Avinash Bhondve, president of the Maharashtra chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), said Malegaon may be experiencing a “second wave”. “It is largely as per the global trend witnessed in countries like New Zealand, Spain and because of complacency. Not only Malegaon, the second wave may be witnessed in Mumbai if due precautions are not taken,” he said. Dr Amol Annadate, who has worked in Malegaon, said that after the initial success, many locals have ignored distancing norms and personal hygiene requirements, like regular hand-washing, leading to the spike in cases. “The textile town has trade exchanges with Mumbai and other cities and it leads to the rapid movement of people. This too is a major reason for the resurgence,” he added. Dr Abul Irfan Ansari, former principal of Unani Medical College in Malegaon, said the numbers may reflect the infection spreading to the outskirts of Malegaon. “It is true that the people here do not follow the norms and a large chunk even does not admit that any such virus exists. But the areas where we witnessed the outbreak three months ago have developed antibodies and are unlikely to be infected again,” he said. Kapadnis also refuted the notion of Malegaon facing a second wave of infection. “This time the surge is from the western part, where density is relatively low and now has slums. We would not call it the second wave as it has not relapsed in the eastern parts where it had spread rapidly in May. We have ramped up our infrastructure and are testing about 260 contacts a day. ”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-curbing-spread-of-covid-19-virus-maharashtra-s-malegaon-see-spike-in-cases-again/story-R7FiD6g9imetK1KyCG12LL.html
18-08-2020||City||From today, shops at Ulhasnagar can remain open on all days||The Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) on Monday announced that shops in non-containment zones can remain open on all days from Tuesday. Currently, shops are allowed to remain open as per the odd-and-even system under ‘Mission Begin Again’ phase of the lockdown, imposed in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. The decision was taken after the city witnessed a decline in the number of active cases and owing to the repeated demand made by shop owners’ associations to allow the shops to remain open on all days. At containment zones, shops will be permitted to only deliver goods at homes. “The rules for the hot spots and containment zones will continue to remain the same. Shops in non-containment zones can now open on all days between 9am and 7pm but shopkeepers have to ensure that social distancing and other measures are followed and there is no crowding at the shops,”said Yuvraj Badhane, public relations officer, UMC. Jagdish Tejwani, president of Ulhasnagar Shopkeepers’ Association, said, “We have been waiting for this decision since August 4. The civic body had assured us that a decision will be taken after August 15. Our demand was to allow shops to remain open on all days because it will help divide the crowd in the shops. With only one side shops opened, there used to be a lot of crowding outside the shops as consumers had fewer options to purchase.” Meanwhile on Monday, UMC recorded 38 new Covid-19 cases after which the total case count reached 7,401, including 185 deaths. Of these, only 303 are active cases. The civic body marked a recovery rate of 93.41%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/from-today-shops-at-ulhasnagar-can-remain-open-on-all-days/story-rAViwXzZ4j64ibR0pDgRVL.html

The 16-member syndicate is the apex executive body elected from among the senate every year.The members started the protest at the registrar’s office late Monday evening demanding that they were the members of the varsity’s executive body and hence, they should be told the reasons for postponing the elections.Syndicate member Ashok Goyal said, “We had met the V-C two days before the announcement was made, but he misled us into thinking that nothing such was in the pipeline. On Monday we again held a meeting with the V-C demanding that documents be shared with us. They showed us the documents, but refused to share them with us.”Syndicate member Navdeep Goyal said, “We will continue to protest until the administration does not share the documents with us. We have also requested the V-C to convene a special meeting of the syndicate so that discussion can be held over the matter.”Registrar Karamjeet Singh was not available for comments.The term of the present senate is scheduled to end on October 31 this year.

18-08-2020||City||After gyms, Raj Thackeray demands opening of temples in Maharashtra||After the reopening of gymnasiums, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray has now called for the reopening of temples in Maharashtra. While addressing the trustees of the famous Trimbakeshwar temple in Nashik, Thackeray said, “If malls can be opened, then why not temples? The trustees approached Thackeray for his support for their demand to reopen the temples, which are closed from the past four months owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. Last week, gym owners met Thackeray, seeking his support for the reopening of the amenity. Thackeray then appealed to the state to reopen gyms, as the Centre already gave a green signal for gyms to operate in its guidelines. Thackeray also questioned if there is a plan in place to prevent devotees from thronging temples in large numbers. “Proper SOPs [standard operating procedures] need to be in place, as this issue [of crowds] concerns all the temples in the state,” said Thackeray. He also expressed his apprehensions over devotees following the SOPs. The demand to reopen religious places is being made by several groups. Recently, the Raza Academy also sent a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, requesting the government to open mosques under the ‘Mission Begin Again’ initiative. “If marriage functions and funerals are permitted to be held, then why not open the gates of the masjids so that people can pray. We also demand the reopening of the mosques with proper SOPs,” said Saeed Noori, general secretary, Raza Academy. On Sunday, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) legislator Rohit Pawar too called for the reopening of religious places in the state to support the local economy of a place. Meanwhile, the state is taking a cautious stand on the decision. “The Covid-19 pandemic continues to exist and we cannot allow everything to open indiscriminately as we want to control the spread of virus,” said a senior bureaucrat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-gyms-raj-thackeray-demands-opening-of-temples-in-maharashtra/story-FfIhPKWWfCkqSrICS2PL1O.html

Once approved, the protocol will be sent to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for a final green nod. Last week, ICMR selected Nair and Parel-based KEM hospitals to undertake human trials to determine the efficacy of COVISHIELD, considered promising after results of phase 1 trial conducted in the United Kingdom against the novel coronavirus. “We have to decide on the age of the volunteers who want to be part of the trial along with the selection process. We cannot randomly select volunteers, and therefore we need to set out standard operating procedures before we can start the trial. Once the ethics committee of the college approves it, ICMR has to give us the final permission,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of the hospital. “It will take two-three days before the ethics committee reviews and approves the protocol.” KEM hospital dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh did not respond to calls and messages from HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-s-nair-hospital-submits-protocol-for-clinical-trials-of-covishield/story-rPxo4FVaTkrW9F708cEWnL.html

Currently, 30 beds have been added to the 200-bed facility,” said the director.In addition, 30 more beds have been earmarked for children at the Advanced Paediatrics Centre at the Covid hospital.EXTENDING FACILITY NOT AN EASY JOBThe tertiary care institute caters to the patients referred from North Indian states, and has an occupancy of around 1,300 beds at its general hospital including those in the emergency wards.“Quality care takes up a lot of our workforce. We have to maintain an adequate workforce for the patients in non-Covid areas as well. Plus, in Covid-19 hospital, healthcare workers have a shift of only six hours because it is very tough to work in PPEs that increases the number of staff that has to be posted there,” said Dr Jagat Ram.He added that only healthcare workers who had the experience to work in ICUs were called for duty in Covid-19 wards. “This in turn reduces the fatality rate and we have to train more workers for the same so that they can be assigned duties there.”BEGIN MOBILE TESTING: BADNORE TO GMSHIn the war room review meeting held here on Monday, Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore directed Government Multi-Speciality Hospital (GMSH) at Sector 16 to begin mobile testing facilities to collect samples and give test results on the spot. This will be helpful to senior citizens who are reluctant to go to hospitals for such testings.Badnore said that area volunteers or social workers could keep a watch on influx of people from outside. He added that the focus of the administration should be for early detection of the cases, particularly those of co-morbid patients, so that fatalities could be kept at minimum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/110-more-beds-to-be-added-to-pgimer-covid-19-facility/story-fvgArykE1Giw9FfBdFhRgM.html

While investigating the ₹12.07-lakh burglary at a jewellery store, police found that the shop owner had concocted the story to buy time from debtors. The man had also attempted to kill himself a few weeks ago, said police.On Friday, the shop owner, a 28-year-old Nerul resident, had approached the police claiming unknown burglars broke the shutter of his shop and robbed ₹12.07 lakh worth gold and silver jewellery. “When we investigated the case, we found a lot of discrepancies in the sequence of events. After sustained inquires and questioning, it became clear that the complainant had come up with a fake story,” said Rajendra Chavan, senior inspector at Nerul police station.The man allegedly broke the shutter to make it look like burglars broke into the shop. The valuables were not in the store, police said.Chavan added that they are filing a case under section 182 of the Indian Penal Code for submitting a false complaint against the shop owner and will submit a charge sheet in the court. Police said the man had started the jewellery store in sector 8, Nerul with his business partner, who at the time, was in his hometown. He had a debt of over ₹4.5 lakh which he was unable to repay. “When the lockdown was imposed, he attempted to end his life in July due to financial stress. He was saved back then. Then he made up the story of burglary so the debtors would give him some time,” said another officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jewellery-shop-owner-files-false-burglary-report/story-ztYLTDUxVT3YYng9kTkvUJ.html

18-08-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn’s plan to transition to electric buses deferred||The city’s bid to transition from fossil fuel to renewable sources of energy has received the corona jolt.Facing a fund crunch in the wake of the pandemic, the UT administration has stalled the shifting of the Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) bus fleet from diesel to electric for the current financial year at least.The plans, set in motion last year, to buy 40 electric buses for the CTU local fleet has been suspended for the current financial year. The medium sized (9m) battery-operated buses were planned to be procured on the gross cost-contract model.Confirming the development, Uma Shankar Gupta, director transport, said, “For the time being the project has been deferred. There were financial constraints in view of the pandemic.”The addition of electric buses to the CTU fleet is a long-term plan for a greater environmentally-friendly public transport system. The transport department plans to phase out ordinary buses after the full cycle is completed.ALL 400 BUSES TO BE MADE ELECTRICAs per the plan, all ordinary buses will be replaced with electric buses in time. There are around 400 buses, and nearly half of these are nearing completion of their operational life.The administration had even floated tenders for the buses. After failing to procure electric buses in its previous two attempts, the administration received two bids in the third tender it had floated in January this year. The new buses were to be made operational by September, but the pandemic hit.After the Union government refused to finance the buying of 40 electric buses, the department in June last year decided to procure them on the gross cost-contract model. Under the model, the successful bidder has to procure, operate and maintain the buses. All revenue is collected for the administration, and the company is paid on a per kilometre cost basis. The medium-sized (9m) battery-operated buses are to be equipped with air-conditioners and are to be used on local city routes.QUESTIONS RAISED ON PROJECT’S FINANCIAL VIABILITYThe finance department had raised questions over the financial viability of the project. In response, the transport department had contended that the department’s own revenues and the revenues generated from the project itself would finance the project.But with only 150 local buses operating from the 400-bus fleet, generating adequate revenue to make the project viable will be difficult. “Due to the pandemic, for nearly three months, all the CTU buses were off road and consequently no revenue was generated. Even now for ensuring social distancing norms, the buses are running on half of their capacity. The CTU is now under a greater financial stress,” said a CTU official, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ut-s-plan-to-transition-to-electric-ctu-buses-deferred/story-Vy2pFr7swaXoe42oVeMMFM.html

The court was hearing a petition filed by the father of Vijay Singh, who allegedly died in the custody of Wadala TT police on the night of October 27, 2019. The division bench of justice AA Sayed and justice Abhay Ahuja, while hearing the petition of Hriday Narayan Singh and others, was informed by advocate Vinay Nair that Ankit Mishra, Vijay’s friend, had gone into hiding and was not traceable as the police had threatened him. Nair also submitted that though the post-mortem report of KEM Hospital indicated that Singh had died to a concussion on his chest and that no action was taken against the police officers. Nair further submitted that though Mishra was present with the deceased while in the custody of Wadala TT police station, his statement on what happened on the fateful night was not recorded by investigators. He then added that the state was in contempt of a 2014 order of the HC wherein a bench had directed the state to have 24-hour rotating CCTV surveillance in the passages, doors and interior of police stations and to retain the cassettes of the footage for a year. Public prosecutor Deepak Thakare, however, refuted the Nair’s allegation and said the investigators had recorded Mishra’s statement soon after the case was registered against the police personnel. He also submitted that CCTV was installed in the police station, but they were not functional at the time due to some work. After hearing the submissions, the court directed the state to record the statement of Mishra and also file an affidavit explaining as to why no CCTV was installed in the police station and posted the matter for hearing after four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/why-cctv-was-not-installed-in-wadala-tt-police-station-hc-asks-state/story-bPJ81lFfhTX4cGRxNRrChN.html

The team has been ordered to try to complete the investigation within a month.“We are not at all impressed by the state of affairs,” the bench commented after noticing that the investigation was at standstill after the assistant commissioner of police of Bandra division, who was investigating the case, was found Covid-19 positive and the investigation was handed over to another police officer about a fortnight ago.“Since, prima facie, there are allegations of police excesses on the victim, we expected that the Mumbai Police would complete the investigation with utmost urgency,” said the bench.The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by lawyer and human rights activist Firdause Irani raising concerns about police excesses during enforcement of the nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19 infection.Apart from pointing out the assault on him, his wife and two sons by a team of policemen and civic staff outside his house in Goregaon (West), Irani has also highlighted a report by a human rights organisation that revealed that 15 persons had lost their lives across India due to police brutalities during the lockdown and two of them were from Mumbai. Devendra was one of them. According to the report, Devendra’s family members alleged that on March 30, when they proceeded to see a relative, a police team chased them and caught the deceased. The policemen, the report added, informed the relatives that they were taking Devendra to Juhu police station, but in the morning they were informed by the police that Raju was lying at Nehru Nagar Chowk and when they took him to a hospital, he was declared dead on arrival.Juhu police had, however, maintained that Devedra’s death was a case of mob lynching. Police said he was caught by local residents while trying to enter a house at Mutthu Swami Chawl at Vile Parle. They claimed the deceased attempted to flee by climbing the roof, but slipped and fell on the ground. When he tried to run away, the mob chased him to an open space and started beating him up, which led to him losing his consciousness.It was only after the matter reached HC, that the police admitted that the deceased was assaulted by four policemen, all of whom were suspended during pendency of departmental inquiry.During the course of hearing on Monday, petitioner’s lawyer, advocate Gopal Shakarnarayanan, brought to the attention of the court several videos showing police charging lathi on people riding bikes. “This is not what we expect from the state,” the lawyer said complaining about the use of force by police.The bench, however, refused to accept the contention. “There are black sheeps everywhere,” said the bench. “There are many among us (members of general public) who don’t care about lockdown restrictions,” it said.The judges said that if people violate law, some people will have to be dealt with strong hands. “Ultimately, police also have to safeguard the interest of the public, and we, as judges, cannot foresee when lathis and teargas etc. would be required to be used,” the judges said.HC has now posted the PIL for further hearing on September 21 with a direction to the SIT to submit copy of the charge sheet to HC if its investigation is complete by then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/juhu-police-brutality-hc-transfers-case-to-sit/story-BSDug7hZpZXG6AXA43U5bI.html

The matter was discussed on Monday at the meeting of a special committee constituted by the PU syndicate, which is headed by syndicate member Navdeep Goyal.The committee has allowed the dental college to conduct the undergraduate exams in blended mode, while for postgraduates it has permitted regular exams, subject to DCI permissions. Around 400 UG students and 17 PG students will be writing the exams.According to a committee member, “We have permitted them to conduct exams as per DCI advisory, now PU will seek permission from DCI to do so. Given the number of PG students is very small at the dental college, we have permitted them to conduct the exams physically.”DCI in its advisory of June 30, 2020, directed colleges/universities to conduct theory examinations for UG and PG strictly in accordance with the council’s norms.It said the final year BDS/MDS exams will be conducted as per existing advisory at a suitable time as and when normalcy was restored. For first to third year BDS students, the exams should be conducted at a suitable time when students would start studies for the next higher classes, the advisory read.Dr Jagat Bhushan, principal, Dr Harvansh Singh Judge Institute and Dental Science and Hospital, said, “We had written to the University to allow us to conduct the exams of UG and PG students. Timely exams are in the best interest of students and dental institutes in many states have conducted the exams.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pu-to-get-dental-council-of-india-nod-for-bds-mds-exams/story-XkcoTF1GsU6QhSwk9TL7jK.html

Abdul Munaf Shaikh, a resident of Saifi House in Andheri (West), was walking towards the mosque when an unknown person wearing a cap attacked him from behind. Juhu police have detained three suspects in the case so far, but the killer is still on the run. The police, after reviewing CCTV footage which recorded the murder, said that Shaikh, who is also a trustee of the mosque, was caught unawares when a man attacked him and slit his throat. The accused then stabbed him multiple times on his head, back, stomach and chest, said police officers. Abhishek Trimukhe, deputy commissioner of police, zone 9, said, “Soon after the incident, people from the mosque rushed him to Cooper Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.” “We have identified the killer and an offence under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at Juhu police station. The killer is still on the run. We are investigating case thoroughly,” said Trimukhe. “Being a real estate developer, he had built many buildings and had also undertaken a Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) project recently. We are probing possible angles,” added the officer.As part of the investigation, the police detained three men, including the son of a man who had sold a piece of land to Shaikh in 2010. He was allegedly unhappy that his father had sold the land at a cheap rate and had threatened Shaikh on many occasions, said a police officer.“In 2019, Shaikh was planning to develop the plot. We are questioning many and have detained three people so far,” said the police officer.Asif Ali Shaikh, a relative of the deceased, said, “Shaikh had notices someone following him when he used to go to the mosque for morning prayers. He had also filed a written complaint to DN Nagar police, but no one took cognizance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/developer-stabbed-to-death-in-juhu-three-detained/story-7i8NJgl6oTGLIYYzVnC80M.html

18-08-2020||Mumbai||Let Varavara Rao make video calls to his family: HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday directed the state to allow activist and poet P Varavara Rao contact his family using video calls, while following hospital protocol. Rao is one of the accused in the Elgar Parishad case and he is currently receiving medical treatment at Nanavati Hospital after he tested positive for Covid-19. HC also directed court officials to provide Rao’s family and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) copies of Rao’s medical report, which was submitted to the court last week. The next hearing will be held after two weeks. While hearing an appeal filed by Rao challenging a special court’s decision to deny him bail on medical grounds, a division bench of justice AA Sayed and justice Abhay Ahuja was informed by Rao’s advocate R Satyanarayan that Rao’s family was concerned about his well-being as they had been provided no information about his health status after Rao was shifted to Nanavati Hospital. In a previous hearing on July 28, a bench headed by justice RD Dhanuka had directed Nanavati Hospital to submit a report on Rao’s health to the court, which the hospital did last week. Satyanarayan submitted that Rao’s family should have access to a copy of the hospital’s report in order to make arguments for his bail plea. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing for NIA, submitted that as Rao’s bail application had been made with reference to his ill health, the petition should be dismissed as Rao was currently being provided the best available treatment. After hearing the submissions, the court sought to know the current status of Rao’s health as the report was almost two-weeks old. It also directed the state to allow Rao’s family to speak to him through video calls, as had been allowed by an earlier bench, provided all protocol required by the hospital was followed. The bench also directed court officials to give a copy of the report submitted by Nanavati Hospital to NIA and Rao’s family. On July 13, Rao, who is charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and has been under arrest since August 2018, was taken to Sir JJ Hospital from Taloja Jail after his health deteriorated. In the course of a week, Rao tested positive for Covid-19; was transferred from Sir JJ Hospital to St George Hospital, where he suffered an injury to the head; and was finally taken to Nanavati Hospital, where he is currently admitted. Rao’s family has alleged negligence on part of jail and hospital authorities. Bharadwaj appeals against denial of bail In another hearing for an appeal filed by lawyer and activist Sudha Bharadwaj, advocate Ragini Ahuja appealed against a special court’s decision to deny Bharadwaj interim bail. Ahuja informed the court that as Bharadwaj suffers from various ailments, she is susceptible to Covid-19. Bharadwaj is another accused in the Elgar Parishad case and is currently lodged in Byculla Women’s Jail. Though the state and NIA opposed the submissions, the bench of justice AA Sayed and justice Abhay Ahuja sought to know the steps being taken by the jail’s administration to safeguard inmates from contracting Covid-19. The court has also sought Bharadwaj’s latest medical report. The matter will be heard after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/let-varavara-rao-make-video-calls-to-his-family-hc/story-RGPAv2k9R7NZiCu2e9edYO.html

We fear that the Punjab government might divert Rs 150 crore of the civic body to some other head.”The civic body, he said, had failed to improve the basic amenities in the city, displaying a pitiable lack of involvement in the town’s welfare. Nothing had been done about the damaged roads, choked sewerage and non-functional street lights, he said.In response, MC executive officer Sandeep Tewari said the money had been paid on the instructions of the Punjab government. “Moreover, as per the agreement with NHAI, we are charging cess of Rs 5 lakh per project, which is coming up within 1 km of the road of MC limits. We have already collected Rs 1.75 crore from the one-time cess from any project,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-mla-to-move-hc-to-recover-rs-20-cr-paid-by-zirakpur-mc-to-nhai/story-JrHOzO523H7MJbAJKiQ31H.html

We rushed to the Sassoon General Hospital and the body, inside a bag, was handed over to us and we directly brought it to the graveyard. When we were readying the body for the burial, I finally got to see the face and realised that it was not the body of my husband. To confirm, I checked the body for marks on the leg, which my husband has. The marks were missing and confirmed my suspicion. My relatives, then, contacted my husband and found that he was alive,” said Nazneen Bagwan (35), wife of the person who was assumed dead. Sassoon Hospital authorities and Kondhwa police station have been informed about the unidentified corpse.

18-08-2020||Chandigarh||UT employees’ housing scheme: High-rise plans, costing issues likely to come up at meeting||A high-rise housing complex for the city is one of the options likely to be explored by senior UT administration officials, UT employees and the Union home secretary when they meet on August 19 to discuss the long pending UT employees housing scheme.Issues likely to be thrashed out at the meeting involve costing - whether charges will be applicable only for plotted areas instead of the total land parcel in the scheme; and that of building the 11-storey apartment blocks in Sector 56. Both options are aimed at reducing housing costs for employees since the project failed to take off earlier because potential buyers thought it was too expensive. “All the alternatives will be discussed on August 19 with UT employee representatives and Central government officials. This includes increasing the floor area ratio (FAR) for the project. The floors can go up to 11. With increase in FAR, the housing scheme will come up only in Sector 56,” said a senior UT official requesting anonymity. Currently, project plans cover three sectors and include constructions of ground plus five floors.Significantly, the meeting is to take place on the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court.A six-member committee, comprising three senior UT officials and an equal number of employee representatives, will participate in a meeting through video conferencing with the Union home secretary. The HC had directed that the issue of costs of the self-financed housing scheme be resolved through discussions between UT officials, employees and the Central government. Acting on a petition, the HC had directed the Union home secretary to convene a meeting with the UT adviser and the chairman of the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) to make efforts to resolve the issue and submit a report by the next date of hearing.Initially fixed for August 4, the meeting had to be rescheduled to August 19. The next hearing in the case has been fixed for September 1.THE SCHEMEAround 4,000 flats were to be built in Sectors 52, 53 and 56 by the CHB for government employees as part of a scheme launched in 2008.A draw of lots was held in 2010, in which 3,930 employees among 7,827 applicants were selected. They had then deposited around Rs 57 crore with CHB under the scheme.Later, the scheme was shelved and then revived after the employees took up the matter with city MP Kirron Kher. But the ministry of home affairs (MHA) allowed the administration to transfer the land to the CHB at the current collector rates.With this apartment costs shot up to Rs 50 lakh for Category D, Rs 1 crore for Category C, Rs1.64 crore for Category B and Rs2.08 crore for Category A.When the scheme was announced the rates were only Rs 34.70 lakh for Category A, Rs24.30 lakh for Category B, Rs13.53 lakh for Category C and Rs5.76 lakh for Category D.The employees then moved the high court alleging that the CHB was charging five times the initial price for land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ut-employees-housing-scheme-high-rise-plans-costing-issues-likely-to-come-up-at-meeting/story-n25g1J20pyTio6hXzPsbhJ.html

18-08-2020||Mumbai||State to appoint international architect to revamp SGNP as ecotourism destination||The state will appoint an international architect to draw up a plan for a facelift and to develop amenities to improve tourism at the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), Borivli.State forest minister Sanjay Rathod laid out his plans for improving the green cover in urban areas during a review meeting held by Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar with all states through videoconference on Monday.Rathod said, “As per directions of the CM, a proposal to develop the 103 sq. km SGNP as an international ecotourism destination is being formulated. A tender has already been floated to appoint an international architect who will study features of SGNP and suggest ways of revamping without interfering with the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980,” said Rathod. In 2017, a similar proposal for the park’s revamp (signed between Belgiium and state) was stalled due to ‘technical difficulties and pending clarifications’. The plan included a mini zoological park and leopard safari.Rathod said despite repeated requests to transfer endangered Asiatic lions from the Gir National Park were turned down over three years, the forest department will submit a proposal before CM Uddhav Thackeray to request Gujarat and the Centre that at least one lion, preferably a female, be transferred to SGNP to enhance breeding.SGNP currently has three lions — a male, Ravindra, 17; brother and sister Jespa and Gopal, both nine years old. “These are hybrid lions (a cross between Asiatic and African lions) and their parents were brought to the park from abandoned circuses. The Central Zoo Authority has issued clear instructions to ensure there is no inbreeding and phase out breeding of hybrid and Asiatic lions. But the park needs both male and female Asiatic lions to increase their numbers,” said Vijay Barabde, superintendent (lion and tiger safari), SGNP.Meanwhile, the minister added that a state-wide policy to enhance green cover for urban cities, towns and districts was being prepared. “Plans similar to SGNP will be replicated for 50 locations across 26 municipal corporations under our City Forest Park scheme (Nagar Van Udayan). These locations would have either eco-tourism destinations of international standards, reserved forests or conservation reserves admeasuring 25 to 100 hectare range either within the city or in its periphery. Maximum of Rs2 crore will be provided for each city forest, but funding share (between Centre and state) is yet to be decided,” said Rathod adding that the policy will be submitted before the state cabinet during the first week of September. “A panel of architects from within the country will be appointed to come up with individual proposals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-to-appoint-international-architect-to-revamp-sgnp-as-ecotourism-destination/story-PnoxaJLbWuAvIfkckqaxyL.html
18-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 tally goes from 500K to 600K in just 9 days||One-hundred and sixty-two days since Maharashtra’s first Covid-19 case was reported on March 9, the state crossed another grim milestone of 600,000 infections with 8,493 new cases on Monday. The case count stood at 604,358.The number of days for completing one lakh cases is reducing with the state taking only nine days to move from 5 lakh cases to 6 lakh cases. The state’s first lakh cases took 96 days, the second took 22 days, third 14 days, fourth 11 days and the fifth lakh took just 10 days, indicating a surge in daily caseload.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The state’s active cases tally stood at 155,268, accounting for 25.69% of the total cases reported so far. The state recorded its highest single-day spike with 12,822 cases on August 8. The daily caseload dipped to around the 8,000-mark after a gap of 13 days. It had reported 8,968 cases on August 3.Death toll of the state reached 20,265 after 228 deaths were reported on Monday. Of them, 172 were reported in the last 48 hours, another 36 deaths were from last one week, while the rest 20 deaths were from the period before that, health officials said. Highest toll in a day was reported 413 on August 13.It can be further understood with the fact that in the past 17 days of this month, the state has reported 182,834 cases. On an average, it came to 10,754 a day. This is against 247,392 cases recorded in July, 102,172 cases in June, 57,157 cases in May, 10,196 cases in April and 302 cases in March.The major reason for the surge is that cases are rising in semi-urban and rural areas. Two months ago, majority of the cases were coming from 19 cities that were declared as red zones, but the situation has changed ever since the lockdown was eased with ‘Mission Begin Again’, starting from June 3. This can be explained in numbers as all 34 districts had contributed only 6,165 cases on June 3 (8.23% of the total cases), which has increased to 163,377 cases (27.03% of the total cases) on August 17.The 19 cities were Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli, Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Mira-Bhayander, Vasai-Virar, Pune, Solapur, Aurangabad, Nashik, Malegaon, Dhule, Jalgaon, Akola, Amravati and Nagpur.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, public health expert, who is also heading the communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state, said cases are rapidly rising in rural areas, which started after lockdown restrictions were relaxed. “Distribution of cases started soon after the state opted for unlocking of restrictions. Before that, cases used to come only from urban areas, but now it has spread to rural areas. The cases are also increasing in an accelerated fashion at present,” Dr Salunkhe said.He sees two major reasons for surge in cases, one unlocking and second, in general the careless attitude of people. “Easing out the lockdown restrictions has given the virus opportunity to spread. It is also an impact of careless or non-serious attitude of the people, which is making the situation difficult in the state,” he added.The surge in small cities and rural areas is also a cause for concern, given the limited capacity of the existing health infrastructure. The state government is augmenting health infrastructure in each and every district along with the cities to cope up with the situation, officials said.Shortage of health staff that includes doctors, nurses, para medical staff etc. is another problem the state is facing with, the officials informed.On Monday, Mumbai recorded 753 cases, taking its tally to 129,479. Of them, active cases are 17,704This is for the third time daily caseload in the city dipped to 700-mark in the last one month. On July 28 and August 4, it has recorded 700 and 709 cases respectively.On June 27, Mumbai has reported highest single-day spike with 2,077 cases. City toll stood at 7,173 after 40 deaths were reported on Monday.Pune city continued to contribute maximum infections in the daily caseload as it recorded 919 cases on Monday. Its tally stood at 80,407 cases. Pimpri Chinchwad, satellite city in Pune Metropolitan Region, recorded 615 cases, third-highest contributor in the state. Its tally went up to 35,194One more problem the state is struggling with is high number of deaths. Maharashtra still has highest number of deaths across states in the country.As many as 5,271 deaths have been reported in 17 days of this month as against 6,988 deaths in July, 5,638 in June, 2,286 deaths in May, 449 in April and 10 deaths in March. With 20,265 deaths, the case fatality rate (CFR) of the state was recorded at 3.35% on Monday. It continued to be second highest in the country after Gujarat, where the CFR was 3.54% with 2,785 deaths (78,680 cases) till Sunday, according to the statistics shared by the state medical education department.Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, public health expert, said the government doesn’t have resources in terms of specialised staff and health infrastructure to deal with the situation especially in rural areas. “Tertiary care treatment can only prevent Covid-19 casualties. We need specialised staff to treat critical patients. Both the state and the Central government could not provide that quality of trained health staff and infrastructure in rural and semi-urban areas,” said Dr Pattiwar.He also said that the state needed to train its doctors and health staff in these areas. Further, there should be a system for regular interaction between doctors from semi-urban and rural areas with the members of task force formed to reduce Covid-19 casualties, which is not happening at present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-s-covid-tally-goes-from-500k-to-600k-in-just-9-days/story-7xguXQdTd0ACNcGAh9YN3L.html
18-08-2020||Chandigarh||50 cases of illegal sand mining in Mohali in 3 years, but trials still on||The Mohali district mining department on Monday lodged a police complaint in Kharar against the sarpanch of Majat village Harminder Singh for illegal sand mining, but how far the case progresses is anyone’s guess as 50 FIRs have been lodged to cope with the problem – but trials are still continuing.Illegal mining is rampant here despite 17 cases being registered in 2018; 21 in 2019 and 12 in 2020, when 20 other cases are being investigated, police records state. Around 50% cases in the past three years were registered in Mubarakpur, Dera Bassi. According to district mining officer Gurpreet Pal Singh Sandhu, “We have lodged a complaint against the sarpanch of Majat village for illegal mining in the village as during our investigation we found that he had started digging in a 2.5 feet by 5.5 feet area in the village.” Sandhu also claimed that swift action was taken when complaints were received, the police informed and FIRs registered. “On August 6, an FIR was registered against Sukhveer Singh of Shekupura village in Kurali for illegal mining... even machinery was seized,” he said. He added that fines of Rs 60 per tonne for sand and gravel and Rs10 per tonne for ordinary earth would be imposed on the offenders. On July 16, the mining department conducted a raid at Gocher village and found that 5,000 cubic feet gravel had been extracted from privately owned land in the area. A stone crusher was also seized during the raid, but the revenue department claimed it had not identified the landowners even after a month. On July 6, Majri Police had booked former director general of police (DGP) Paramdeep Singh Gill and 44 farmers of Saini Majra under Section 21 of the Mine and Minerals (Regulations and Development) Act for allowing illegal mining on their land. A fine of Rs 11 crore was imposed on them by the mining department. Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said he had directed officials to take strict action against offenders. Action will also be taken against people who owned land where illegal mining was carried out, he said. In July last year, the mining department had imposed a penalty of Rs 52 crore on 193 landowners in three villages of Mohali — Mianpur Changar, Kubaheri and Abhipur— for allowing illegal mining on their land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/50-cases-of-illegal-sand-mining-in-mohali-in-3-years-but-trials-still-on/story-HmzHo0iVtmm9SpbF4YobNI.html

The police said the two were caught from different locations traced through technical surveillance, while the remaining eight suspects have also been identified. According to the police, raids are currently underway in at least two sectors to nab them. Police commissioner KK Rao said that five of the 10 suspects involved in the case are minors. One of the two suspects has been identified as 21-year-old Vishal Yadav, a resident of Wazirabad village in Sector 52. The other suspect is a 17-year-old boy from a nearby area. Both were caught from their respective localities.Bijender Singh, station house officer(SHO) of Sushant Lok police station, said Yadav is the main suspect who had a tiff with the victim on a mobile application on house parties. This prompted him to enlist his friends in taking revenge on the victim. “In July, the victim and Yadav had met on an application named House Party. Later, they had a tiff , which ended in both of them verbally abusing each other. The suspect said that this upset him and prompted him to ask his friends to take revenge on the victim. They finally got a chance on the night of July 23, when the victim was going to a house party in a residential society in Sushant Lok-1,” he said. The police said that the suspects had chatted with the victim using fake profiles and during one of the conversations, the victim had informed them that he would be visiting his friend’s house in Sushant Lok-1 to attend his birthday party. “The suspects had created several fake accounts and often signed into the application to keep a a tab on the victim. They chatted with him to know his whereabouts,” said Singh. On night of July 23, as soon as the victim’s father dropped him outside the gate of the residential society,the suspects surrounded the victim and started thrashing him. They also sexually assaulted him and recorded four videos of the act, which were shared on social media to defame the victim, said the police. During the assault, the victim was repeatedly asked to “say sorry” on camera, the footage of which was shared across social media. The video went viral, following which the peer group came to know of the incident. The victim narrated his ordeal before his parents last Saturday, following which a case was registered against the suspects, said the police. In one of the four videos circulating online, the suspects can be seen assaulting the boy, tearing his T-shirt, beating him up, and seemingly asking him to apologise to Yadav. There are four videos that were shot and uploaded by the suspects on social media, police said. Rao said that they have recovered a CCTV footage from the residential society and have recorded the statements of the security guards who had witnessed the assault. “We have collected the evidence and remaining suspects will soon be nabbed. We have questioned the suspects separately to know the sequence of the incident. At least five suspects are minors and will be sent to an observation home in Faridabad,” he said. Police said that the incident came to light last Saturday, after the family discovered that the boy had started missing his online classes and was not talking to them properly. During investigations by the police, it was revealed that the suspects had sexually assaulted him. A case under sections 147(rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimation) of Indian Penal Code and sections 6 and 10 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act(POCSO) has been filed at Sushant Lok police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-held-for-sexually-assaulting-a-17-year-old-british-national-of-indian-origin/story-X7cudQvHJ0Z0IhtyVrKMPI.html

After that, we will finalise the agency in a week’s time,” said Mukesh Vaish, project engineer with the Noida authority.The authority is expected to start work at this project next month if all goes as per the plan.“We have fixed September 15 as the date to start work at the site. This project will ease traffic pangs on this road that connects Noida with Greater Noida West also known as Noida Extension,” said Vaish.Around 18,000 motorists use the stretch at Parthala Chowk, where Master Plan-III road meets Faridabad-Noida-Ghaziabad Expresswa,during the morning and evening peak hours, according to a survey conducted by the Noida authority’s traffic cell. The six-land flyover will be 650 metres long and will be built on Master Plan-III road that connects Noida with Greater Noida West. It is expected to cost ₹83 crore and benefit those who travel from and to Noida to Greater Noida West, Ghaziabad, Meerut and other areas. The work will be completed in 18 months from the day work begins, as per the deadlines set, said officials.As the flyover will be built on Master Plan-III road the motorists will not have to face any traffic signal on this to reach Greater Noida’s Kisan Chowk located in sector 1. The commuters, who use FNG Expressway will also not have to face any traffic signal at Parthala, said the officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/three-agencies-apply-for-parthala-flyover-project-work-may-begin-next-month/story-7Ld9KN48ugXlbRU3tw23OO.html

I considered taking her to a neighbourhood hospital but she refused because that facility was treating Covid-19 patients. We came home but that night, her pain and uneasiness got worse and her blood pressure began fluctuating, I kept checking it throughout the night. The next morning, when we went to a hospital, they said she had had a severe heart attack and there was some damage to the heart. We were asked to rush her to a bigger hospital,” said Batra’s husband Bal Kishan Batra, who works as a consultant in a private company. Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayBatra was then taken to Indraprastha Apollo hospital’s emergency department. “By the time the patient came to us, she had a ruptured septum (heart wall that separates the left and the right side). When a person has a heart attack, there is a 1% chance of complications such as a leakage of the heart valve or rupture of a chamber wall, but if they delay treatment the risk increases to 5%,” said Dr Mukesh Goel, senior cardiac surgeon at Indraprastha Apollo hospital who treated her. “Because of the delay, she had to undergo a complex surgery instead of a simple angioplasty (a procedure where a tube is inserted through the blood vessel to remove the arterial blockage). The surgery that had to be performed was also very risky as the tissue around the heart became friable and the stitches wouldn’t hold,” he said. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Since the onset of the pandemic, many like Batra have been missing out on crucial treatment for fear of contracting Covid-19 at hospitals. A Delhi-based doctor, not wishing to be named, says half of his patients have been coming in with complications resulting from delays in treatment. Dr AK Singh Rana, medical superintendent of Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, said, “With hospitals flooded with Covid-19 patients in June and July and public transport not being available, the general tendency among people to was to wait for symptoms to resolve themselves -- patients were not coming to hospitals even they needed to. Even after the lockdown has been lifted, the number of patients in the OPD is a fraction of what we got before March. This is leading to people needing life-saving emergency surgeries that could have been avoided with timely treatment.” Open surgeries, longer hospital stays Initially, it was on account of the lockdown and then out of fear that patients were postponing elective surgeries resulting in further complications and longer hospital stays. In the last three months, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital has seen at least 31 such cases in the emergency, including those of ruptured gall bladders, intestines and appendices. Also read: Govt kick-starts talks to explore Covid-19 vaccine deal“The number of such cases that we have had to perform in the last three months is probably what we would have done over two years pre-panedmic. When we say a procedure is elective, it means that it can be planned in advance, but it cannot be postponed indefinitely. Some of the procedures were cancelled when the lockdown happened but even after restrictions were lifted, patients are reluctant to come in because of the fear of Covid-19. This results in complications such as gall bladder ruptures, or blockage of the intestine, or the appendix bursting,” Dr Vinod Bindal, vice-chairman of minimally invasive surgery, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said. He narrated the case of a patient who had initially been diagnosed with gall stones and insisted on just tele consultation thereafter. Bindal said, unfortunately, the patient had gall bladder cancer that had already metastasised and could not be removed surgically. Many patients also had to undergo open surgeries. “All these procedures are fairly simple and can be done using minimally invasive techniques. But because of complications, at least 10 patients had to undergo open surgery. The complications also led to a longer hospital and ICU stay,” Dr Bindal said. Delays in reaching the emergency Patients with routine problems such as high fever and stomach ache have vanished from the hospital emergencies these days and have been replaced with complicated cases. “In the emergency, we categorise patients as priority 1, 2 and 3 – with priority 3 patients being those who come in with fever, headache, tummy ache, gastroenteritis and suchlike and can wait till we manage the more severe cases. This category of patients is completely missing right now. Earlier, even with a full out-patient clinic running, we used to see these cases in the emergency department,” Dr Priyadarshini Pal Singh, head of emergency department, Apollo Hospitals, said. Instead, they have been seeing patients with complications arising out of not coming to a hospital sooner. “Patients with fever had waited till they got pneumonia and were breathless. Diabetes patients who were not able to regularly monitor and maintain their blood sugar levels ended up with diabetic ketoacidosis (a severe complication where the body starts releasing high levels of blood acid called ketones),” Dr Pal Singh said. “With a person suffers a stroke, we need the patients to come to a hospital as soon as they see some slurring of speech or facial deviation or something as simple as dizziness. In case of a stroke, we need to act fast to prevent further damage. But now we get cases that come in only after half the body is paralysed,” she said. Patients also come in with fractures days after the injury. “Usually, in cases of orthopaedic injuries, people tend to reach hospitals immediately because of the severe pain. But we have seen a few cases wherein patients waited days before coming to the emergency -- a fracture needed surgery or resulted in embolism (a clot formed because of the bone fragment getting lodged in a blood vessel),” Dr Pal Singh said.Doctors advise patients that if they are wary of going to a hospital, then they must consult doctors online in a timely manner. Dr Pal Singh said, “A simple rule is that if you considered going to a hospital or a doctor for any discomfort or ailment and don’t want to, then at least get an online consultation. And please follow the advice of the doctor. If the doctor thinks you need to go to a hospital, please do so.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/many-delaying-treatments-for-fear-of-covid-putting-their-lives-at-risk-say-doctors/story-k5x7qV219rNl3OCv8ckuNI.html
18-08-2020||Delhi||DMRC begins work on Aerocity-Tughlaqabad Metro corridor||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has started construction work on the Aerocity-Tughlaqabad corridor, part of its Phase-4 expansion plans. The 22km-long corridor will have a double-decker viaduct –with Metro tracks on the upper deck and a flyover for vehicular traffic beneath — on a 2.5km-stretch between Sangam Vihar and Ambedkar Nagar.The six-lane flyover, as well as an underpass at Saket-G station (in the south Delhi neighbourhood’s G Block), on the corridor will help decongest the busy Mehrauli-Badarpur (MB) Road, a DMRC official said.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC, said, “MB Road will become signal-free between Sangam Vihar and Saket, after the flyover and underpass are complete. A ramp will help traffic move uninterrupted from Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg to MB Road, and an underpass will aid movement from MB Road towards Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg.”This is the second double-decker viaduct the DMRC has planned in the Capital, after a similar move in the works for the Metro’s Majlis Park-Maujpur corridor, though the section will be shorter than the one on Aerocity-Tughlaqabad corridor.The Aerocity-Tughlaqabad corridor will have 15 stations, and will connect border areas in south Delhi such as Tigri, Khanpur, Tughlaqabad, and others, to the Indira Gandhi International airport.On Monday, the DMRC started casting U-girders to be installed on a 4.2km elevated section between Sangam Vihar and Saket-G. “This stretch includes four elevated stations — Sangam Vihar, Khanpur-Devoli, Ambedkar Nagar and Saket-G — of the corridor. Casting work is being done at the yard in Pushp Vihar,” Dayal said.U-girders are precast pre-tensioned, U-shaped girders on which tracks can be layed immediately. These are prepared in casting yards and brought to the sites.While the Metro corporation had started work on the Phase-4 in December last year, work was stalled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “Construction work on all three priority corridors of Phase-4 has gained pace, despite a severe workforce crunch due to the ongoing pandemic, and other lockdown-related constraints,” Dayal said.Aerocity-Tughlaqabad is one of the three priority corridors under Phase-4. Work on the RK Ashram - Janakpuri West Metro corridor started in December last year, while work on Majlis Park-Maujpur corridor started on Sunday. As per the expansion plan, 61.6km of new Metro lines will be constructed across three different corridors, to comprise 45 stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dmrc-begins-work-on-aerocity-tughlaqabad-metro-corridor/story-FyYIvyYxGiEJs8uiGyh2eI.html

18-08-2020||Delhi||Masked men open fire, barge into houses in Delhi’s Mori Gate, case lodged||Tension ran high in the Kucha Mohtar Khan neighbourhood in north Delhi’s Mori gate on Monday morning after nearly a dozen masked men, all armed, allegedly went on the rampage for nearly 30 minutes — firing in the air, vandalising vehicles and homes and assaulting women and children.Senior police officers said Monday’s violence was the fallout of a tiff that had happened on Monday morning between a habitual criminal from northwest Delhi’s Model Town and five-six locals from Kucha Mohtar Khan over an unknown issue. The fight and the subsequent violence lasted for nearly half-an-hour, with the assailants fleeing before police could reach the spot, they said.While locals alleged that at least six rounds were fired by the miscreants, the police said that they had found just four empty bullet shells from the spot. At least four persons, including a woman and a girl, were injured while more than two dozen cars, auto-rickshaws and two-wheelers were damaged in the violence, police said. Locals told the police that one of the alleged assailants had put a knife on the throat of a 13-year-old boy and threatened to kill him in front of his family members.The alleged assailants forcibly barged into a few houses, misbehaved with the residents and vandalised items inside, locals said. The sudden firing and violence left locals shocked and scurrying for cover, residents alleged. As many as 50 police personnel were deployed in the neighbourhood later to maintain law and order and avoid a rerun of violence.Some videos of the violence were captured on mobile phone cameras and uploaded on social media websites. The videos show several bikes and scooters toppled on both sides of narrow lanes, as residents narrated how the men had allegedly barged into their houses and threatened and misbehaved with women and children. A case of rioting, attempt to murder, house trespass and firing has been registered against Lalit alias Pong, a man with criminal antecedents, at Model Town police station for Monday’s violence, deputy commissioner of police (north) Monika Bhardwaj said.DCP Bhardwaj said around 1am, the police control room received information regarding a “quarrel between two groups” in Mori Gate. But when a police team reached the spot, they found several vehicles damaged and some bikes and scooters lying overturned in the lanes. Scores of residents were present outside and they told the police about the firing and rioting by 10-15 unidentified masked men.During preliminary enquiry, the DCP said, it was learnt that Lalit, who had previously been arrested in a murder case, had come to his in-laws home in Mori Gate. Around 1am, Lalit had an altercation with two locals over some issue. Three-four locals joined the duo and they together assaulted Lalit, she said.“Lalit then called some of his associates to the spot . Within 15 minutes, Lalit’s associates arrived at the spot and seeing them, the locals fled. The assailants,however, followed them and fired in the air, damaged vehicles, and barged into some houses,” said DCP Bhardwaj, adding that multiple teams have been formed to identify and nab the assailants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/masked-men-open-fire-barge-into-houses-in-mori-gate-case-lodged/story-TRk453X6Ueu09P8sBQ7gVN.html

It also accused the BJP of engineering the communal violence later that month in northeast Delhi that left 53 people dead and around 400 injured.At a digital press conference, AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj questioned the BJP, which heads the Central government, and Delhi Police, which reports to the Centre, as to how they allowed the Shaheen Bagh protest to continue for 101 days when other protests in the city -- by farmers, students, doctors or the differently abled -- are not allowed to last even three hours.Also read| Tahir Hussain was given task of collecting glass bottles during Delhi violence: Report“It was because the BJP planned and executed the Shaheen Bagh protests that its vote percentage rose from 18% to 38% in the recently concluded Delhi elections. The BJP used the protest to polarise the north-east Delhi region and it won some seats there as well. After that, it engineered a riot there. Today, the people who raised anti-national slogans or pro-Pakistan slogans or talked about dividing India during the protests are part of the BJP,” Bhardwaj alleged.The BJP denied AAP’s allegations and said the party led by Arvind Kejriwal was making baseless claims to garner support from the minority communities ahead of the municipal elections in the capital. due to take place sometime in April 2022. The last municipal elections in Delhi took place on April 23, 2017 and the BJP managed to win a majority in all three civic bodies. “The AAP has misled people in Delhi, especially the Muslim community, for its political gains. Their allegations have no meaning as the Muslim community supports the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Now, with the municipal elections scheduled in 2022, the AAP is nervous about losing its support base in the community,” said Delhi BJP chief.Adesh Gupta.AAP’s attack came a day after the BJP announced that several Muslim residents of Shaheen Bagh, which was the epicentre of anti-CAA protests for months, have joined the party. While taking them into the party’s fold on Sunday, the Delhi BJP chief had said it was a result of the Prime Minister’s efforts to reach out to every section of the society and end the triple talaq practice.

The protest was technically happening only at the GD Birla Road, but the Delhi police closed all the connecting roads and kept it shut for 101 days giving a harrowing time to lakhs of commuters. The high court had also noted that it was completely a law and order issue. But still, the police did not do anything and remained a silent spectator of these violations,” the AAP said in a statement.(ends)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-inducting-shaheen-bagh-protesters-part-of-election-plan-says-aap/story-nNvjC7jqBx7QCtog7OuiVM.html
18-08-2020||Delhi||Drive against trespassers at Delhi’s Asola wildlife sanctuary, 21 fined||As trespassing becomes a major problem in the Asola wildlife sanctuary, considered the green lungs of the national capital, the state forest department has launched a drive against the unregulated movement of people and vehicles that pose a threat to the critical wildlife habitat in the protected forest area. During the drive that has been under way over the past 20 days, the department has so far seized 21 motorbikes from within the area and fined violators under the Wildlife Protection Act. There is a provision of a fine of ₹ 5000 for trespassing under the Act.The sanctuary, a precious green belt, is located in the Southern Ridge and is spread across an area of 1,960 hectares. It is part of the northern terminal of the Aravallis, one of oldest mountain ranges in the world. It serves as a carbon sink for the Capital and is a potential shelterbelt against desert storms. According to officials, intense patrolling is being conducted throughout the day as well as during night. Also, 32 security personnel have been deployed in the problem areas that have been identified for trespassing. Earlier, security guards were deployed only at the entry and exit gates. “A number of people from the nearby villages and clusters, including Sangam Vihar, Deoli and Bhati among others, venture into the sanctuary on motorcycles illegally from the gaps made in the boundary wall. Many of them were using the area as a thoroughfare to go to neighbouring Gurugram. Many anti-social elements too venture inside to engage in gambling and substance abuse. The deployment of security personnel has helped curb the movement,” said Amit Anand, deputy conservator of forests (DCF) South. Anand said the boundary walls that has been broken at several locations is being restored. “The aim is to protect the wildlife habitat that is threatened by illegal activities such as continuous trespassing. Vehicular movement disturbs the habitat as well as breeding patterns of the animals. It also harms the growing vegetation. The activities came to fore while we were working on constructing check dams in the forest near the Sangam Vihar side,” he said. According to officials, the department may take help from the Eco Taskforce (ETF), a wing of the territorial army, which was set up by the city government in 2000-01 to fight environmental degradation of the Asola-Bhati area. “We plan to take ETF’s help in planting thorny bushes around the boundary wall in order to discourage trespassing,” said a senior official, who did not wish to be named. The official said they are working out a system to regulate the entry of visitors such as morning walkers and joggers. “People wanting to visit the forest will now have to get a permit issued by the DCF. Visitors are allowed only during a specific time and only within an earmarked area so that the wildlife remains protected,” the official said.According to experts, unregulated human and traffic movement in the sanctuary can adversely affect the flora and fauna and needs to be under constant vigil. The sanctuary is home to wild animals such as golden jackals, porcupines, monitor lizards, neelgais and a diverse variety of birds among other species. Sohail Madan, centre manager of the Conservation Education Centre at the Asola sanctuary, maintained by the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) said that trespassing and even dumping of waste has been an issue, to tackle which the forest department has been making efforts. “Trespassing has a profound impact on the wildlife as well as the growing plants, as it fragments the habitat. It is a critical habitat for so many animals such as golden jackals and porcupines. Also, it is a typical habitat for ground nesting birds, for which it is breeding time at present. Vehicular movement and human intervention can damage their habitats, cause undue stress to the wildlife, badly affect breeding and disturb their mobility through the forest corridors. The new security regime will help restrict such activities,” said Madan. Surya Prakash, a biologist at the School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) said that vehicular traffic causes both air and noise pollution, which is highly damaging for a wildlife habitat. “It disturbs the animals and causes anthropogenic stress in them, which adversely impacts their breeding and behavioural patterns. It is crucial to curb such activities to protect wildlife habitats.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/drive-against-trespassers-at-delhi-s-asola-wildlife-sanctuary-21-fined/story-gjxsCyE2AmSxE8oW37yC9N.html

18-08-2020||Delhi||SDMC deseals residential properties after Supreme Court order||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Monday night desealed residential properties in Vasant Kunj and Rajokri following the Supreme Court’s ruling that the monitoring committee had no powers to act against private residential properties violating rules, including unauthorised construction. Civic officials said the process was started in the morning and an order to deseal the properties was issued on Monday afternoon.The development comes after the top court on Friday had said the court-appointed monitoring committee, formed in 2006 to check the illegal use of properties, can act only against commercial properties flouting laws, and not residential ones. The Supreme Court has given three days to unlock these properties in Vasant Kunj and Rajokri, which were sealed in March 2019 for unauthorised construction on their premises.“We have complied with the SC orders and desealed all the 11 residential properties in Vasant Kunj and Rajokri. Today (Monday) late evening, our teams visited these properties and unsealed them,” a senior SDMC official said, who wished not to be named.The sealing was conducted on a complaint by revenue department officials. On February 22, 2019, the area SDM wrote to the monitoring committee regarding “large-scale” unauthorised construction in Green Avenue, Pocket D-3, of Vasant Kunj.In March 2019, acting on the complaints, the committee, along with officials of SDMC, the revenue department and the police, sealed at least 11 residential properties, some of which are farmhouses, over a period of two days. The court had on Friday specified that the monitoring committee could take action only against commercial units operating in residential areas and encroaching on public land. It said the committee is “not authorised” to take action against unauthorised constructions in residential premises situated on private land. The municipalities will have the authority under law to take action against illegal construction, it said.A member of the monitoring committee said, “We are aware of the Supreme Court order on desealing of residential properties and farmhouses in Vasant Kunj. We will follow the apex court’s directives and all these properties will be desealed in the given time frame of three days. We have conveyed this (to deseal farmhouses) to the SDMC.” Another senior SDMC official said that now efforts would be made to determine the action that can be taken by the civic body against the property owners for illegal construction.“There are properties where unauthorised constructions were being done without any sanctioned plan or approval from SDMC. After desealing, the property we will determine if a penalty has to be slapped against the owners or demolish the unauthorised construction in the premises,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sdmc-deseals-residential-properties-after-sc-order/story-r31ufj0UAdTxc7vxLTzPLK.html

They will distribute pamphlets to the people. If a person shows Covid-19 like symptoms, they must be guided to the nearest government Covid-19 testing centre to get themselves tested for Corona. But in some states, test results take time. In such cases, their oxygen levels must be measured. If their oxygen levels are lower than 95, they should be immediately transferred to hospitals. In this way, AAP will be able to save more and more lives,” Kejriwal said in his address.

Fire dousing process is still on,” said senior inspector Pradip Kasbe of Boisar, MIDC police station. Five fire tenders from different areas rushed to the spot. The fire dousing process was still on till the time of going to press. The four injured persons - Pramod Mishra, 35; Dilip Gupta, 28; Umesh Kushwaha, 21; Mohammed Mohsin Altaf Ansari, 31, are undergoing treatment at the Thunga Hospital in Boisar, while Sandeep Kushwaha, 28, and Brijesh Maurya, 25, succumbed to injuries. The 11 other who were at the unit at the time of the blast managed to escape safely.“We will file a first information report (FIR) only after we receive a report from the director of industrial safety and health (DISH), Vasai. We have registered a case of accidental death for now,” said Kasbe. A civic body official said, “Our priority is to rescue any workers who may have been stuck inside the unit the said. We are contacting the owners who reside in Jogeshwari.”On April 13, three workers were killed and 2 others were injured in a blast at a soap and sanitiser manufacturing unit in Tarapur Chemical Zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-worker-dead-four-injured-in-chemical-plant-blast-in-palghar/story-xx2DASN4CAgP0LCbmX4ZzH.html
18-08-2020||Pune||Pune’s first sero survey reports 51.5% seroprevalence of antibodies against Sar-Cov-2 virus||At least 51.5 per cent residents from five highly-affected areas in Pune have seroprevalence of antibodies against Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection, data from the first sero survey, released on Monday, shows.The sero surveillance had 1,664 respondents (all above 18 years) from the city’s 35 lakh residents. Sero surveys are being conducted to detect how many people have developed immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies to the coronavirus disease and to gauge the extent of infection through random sampling.According to the findings, an extensive spread of the infection -ranging between 36.1% and 65.4%- in five areas of the city, has been found. Of the five sampled areas (wards), Lohiyanagar (Kasewadi) in Bhavani peth accounted for the highest 65.4 per cent of seropositivity. Navi peth (Parvati) accounted for 56.7%; Yerawada 56.6%, Rasta peth 45.7% while Kasba peth (Somwar peth) stood at 36.1%.Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said that the first survey was not comprehensive and two more sero surveys will be conducted with a larger sample size. One will be conducted by BJ Medical College focused on Pune city and another for PCMC area will be undertaken by DY Patil College.The first sero survey was conducted by the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) in collaboration with Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC); Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU); Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), Faridabad; Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore and funded by Persistent Foundation.Dr Aurnab Ghose, associate professor, IISER, said that 52.8 per cent men and 50.1 per cent of women were found to have seroprevalence of antibodies, as per the report. He added that blood samples were collected from people who were asymptomatic or symptomatic, but undetected from high-incidence wards of PMC and collective population of these five wards stands at 3.66 lakh.The study stated that 51.5% of the people tested did not know that they were infected and so, most in the city could now be infected without them realising it. While Delhi’s sero survey prevalence was 23% which was conducted in early July, Mumbai showed a prevalence of 36.5% when surveyed in July.The city survey states that while there is no difference in infection between genders, or age groups, more number of people living in slums were infected as compared to those living in bungalows. Also, those living in congested homes were highly prone to be infected as against those living in spacious homes. About 62.3% of those tested and who shared a toilet, were found with antibodies as compared to the 45.3% of those tested with an independent toilet. “This study does not prove that those with antibodies are immune to the virus. For that we need a separate study which is more expensive and time consuming. The study definitely proves that the spread of the virus is across all socio-economic strata. Serological testing for antibodies against Sars-Cov-2 virus in a representative sample population can estimate the cumulative incidence of infection in the population,” said Dr Aurnab Ghose from IISER who was part of the study.The study will now help the administration take necessary steps to contain the spread, said Rao. “This study will help us draw measures to reduce the spread of the virus. Pune city’s testing has been ramped up and contact tracing is completed in two-three days,” he said.However, according to Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee, despite such high prevalence of antibodies, the number of cases keep rising, which means that we cannot depend on herd immunity now.“Why is it that if 51% of the population was infected once that we keep reporting more number of cases? Clearly, antibodies do not guarantee herd immunity. We need to focus more on case fatality now for which our aim should be senior citizens with comorbidities. We should put them on institutional quarantine before they develop any complications. The new drugs are supportive drugs, not curative. Contact tracing, home quarantine and institutional quarantine needs to continue,” said Salunkhe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-s-first-sero-survey-reports-51-5-seroprevalence-of-antibodies-against-sar-cov-2-virus/story-3T8blj0BrEdMfDrJW87NoL.html

Pt Jasraj was a regular performer for years. The doyen of Indian classical music and a Padma Vibhushan-awardee known for his ‘Kann ki Gayaki’ was a star attraction at Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Mohotsav, the yearly festival started by late Pandit Bhimsen Joshi around 67 years ago and has most prominent platform for classical music across the country. “Sangeet Martand Pandit Jasraj will be missed. A musical doyen who created his own style in classical music and has left a legacy of three generations of disciples, was a regular at Sawai,” said Arya Sangeet Prasarak Mandal executive president Srinivas Joshi adding that it was a love affair with our family that began in 1983 in Sawai. “My mother Joshi could not come because she was ill during one such concert in 1998, so Panditji came to our house, performed for my mother and became a regular,” he said. Pandit Jasraj’s disciple Sanjeev Abhyankar described him as an artist of the millennium. “His passing will affect the entire music scene, he was much bigger and had followers across the world. For me he was god as my guruji, and became guru for thousands who came to listen to him sing. He is a creative genius who is born once in a century. His style of singing was very appealing and that ‘gayaki’ influenced four generations. He created history for till the age of 90, music lovers wanted him to be performing on the stage, especially the audience of Sawai Gandharva as well as those across the world.” Satish Paknicker, photographer and a music lover, remembering Pandit Jasraj said, “I have clicked a lot of photos while he was singing right from his first time in Sawai in 1983 until his last performance in 2019. He would hold not just the audience, but also versatile singers in his trance, like when he sang in Hubli for the 75th birthday of Gangubai Hangal and he brought tears to her eyes as he mesmerised her with his gayaki.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pandit-jasraj-s-mewati-gayaki-will-be-missed-at-sawai/story-hYULvaNZ4DvNL7bPsEZoeL.html
18-08-2020||World||US Postal Service suspends USPS change until after 2020 election||Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said he is suspending changes to mail service that raised concerns over slow delivery of ballots in the fall election after President Donald Trump criticized the vote-by-mail process.DeJoy, in an emailed news release Tuesday, cited “some longstanding operational initiatives” that predate his arrival “that have been raised as areas of concern as the nation prepares to hold an election in the midst of a devastating pandemic.”“To avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail, I am suspending these initiatives until after the election is concluded,” DeJoy said.DeJoy said that mail processing equipment and blue collection boxes will remain where they are, and no mail processing facilities will be closed. Overtime work will “continue to be” approved as needed, he said.The announcement follows concerns from Democrats and others over apparent mail slowdowns. They also pointed out that DeJoy was a campaign donor before taking office in June.Speaker Nancy Pelosi is calling the House back on Saturday to vote on legislation to halt post office cutbacks and give the agency $25 billion in additional funding.“The post office in these times of coronavirus is really election central,” Pelosi said during an event with Politico Tuesday. “Well, he should,” she said, when suddenly handed a note about a news report on DeJoy’s announcement he is suspending changes.Meanwhile, the attorneys general for Washington and Pennsylvania were briefing reporters on Tuesday on plans for separate, multistate lawsuits that would seek to halt operational changes at the Postal Service. More than a dozen other states had signed onto the effort, including California, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Nevada. No Republican attorneys general had signed onto the suits.“By interfering with the Postal Service, President Trump is putting both our democracy and people’s health at risk,” Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement Tuesday. “We are suing to ensure the integrity of our electoral process and to make sure each and every vote is counted during this election.”Recent media reports have pointed to the removal of mail sorting machines in various cities, as well as the taking of mailboxes off the streets. Post office operating hours have been reduced and overtime work cut. The agency’s inspector general is investigating those moves.DeJoy said Tuesday that the Postal Service “is ready today to handle whatever volume of election mail it receives this fall.”“Even with the challenges of keeping our employees and customers safe and healthy as they operate amid a pandemic, we will deliver the nation’s election mail on time and within our well-established service standards,” he said in the statement. “The American public should know that this is our number one priority between now and election day.”Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said Trump and DeJoy had recklessly made changes in a way that was illegal.“There is a process for changes like this one that requires going before the postal regulatory commission and holding public hearings,” Shapiro told reporters. “DeJoy opted to do just what he and Trump wanted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-postal-service-suspends-usps-change-until-after-2020-election/story-3subv5bVpq4eSkm1FZnXkJ.html

At the current pace, fires could approach the all-time record for any month since records began in 1998.“It is extremely difficult to combat, control and combat again a fire with the dimensions that we have seen here in the Pantanal,” said Paulo Barroso, president of the local firefighting committee.Firefighters in the area worked to douse smoldering earth that was charred black as clouds of smoke billowed hundreds of feet into the air.Roughly 8,500 square kilometers, or nearly 6% of the Pantanal, has already burned in January to July, according to government data.The Pantanal is 10 times the size of the Everglades wetlands in the U.S. state of Florida. The region is one of the most biodiverse places on the planet with more than 4,700 plant and animal species, including threatened ones like the jaguar, according to advocacy group WWF.Most of the largest sanctuary for the blue Hyacinthine Macaw parrots has gone up in flames this year, Brazil’s Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported.The region has been suffering from below-average rainfall and higher-than-average temperatures in the past 30 days, according to data provider Refinitiv.The blazes in the Pantanal come amid rising concerns about fires in the Amazon, its much larger neighbor to the north. Fires spiked in the first few days of August in the Amazon, but were down by 17% for Aug. 1-15, compared with the same period a year ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/surging-fires-threaten-world-s-largest-wetland-in-brazil/story-ZSLJc4HlhoECh6bhfIQwuL.html
18-08-2020||World||Belarus president remains defiant as strikes widen||More workers in Belarus joined a widening strike Tuesday as they press for the resignation of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has extended his 26-year rule in an election the opposition says was rigged.Lukashenko has bluntly rejected the demands to step down following a harsh police crackdown on peaceful protesters in the days after the Aug. 9 vote. In a move intended to secure the loyalty of law enforcement agencies amid the swelling demonstrations and strikes, he signed a decree honoring over 300 police officers for their service.The opposition denounced the awards as a national insult following the suppression of protests with rubber bullets, stun grenades and clubs. Nearly 7,000 people were detained, hundreds were injured and at least two people died.The Interior Ministry that oversees police insisted the awards weren’t linked to the crackdown that has galvanized public anger and drawn international criticism.Lukashenko’s actions prompted thousands — including workers at state-controlled factories and plants, actors and broadcasters — to walk off the job.The prospect of a massive nationwide shutdown was an unprecedented challenge to Lukashenko, who has relied on blue-collar workers as the core of his supporters. During Monday’s visit to a factory in Minsk he was heckled and jeered by workers shouting “Go away!”“The authorities should understand that they are losing control,” head of an independent miners’ union Yuri Zakharov told The Associated Press on Tuesday. “Only Lukashenko’s resignation and punishment of those in charge of rigging and beatings can calm us down. “The strike will continue and grow until he steps down.”The labor action that began Monday quickly grew to several major industrial plants, including a huge factory that accounts for a fifth of the world’s potash fertilizer output.In the city of Soligorsk, home to the giant Belaruskali potash factory, strike organizer Anatoly Bokun said workers at all potash mines have halted work. The factory, which employs 16,000, is Belarus’ major cash earner.“They are putting pressure on us and threatening us with mass dismissals, but we will not return to work until Lukashenko steps down,” Bokun said as thousands of workers joined a protest rally.“They have stolen our choice,” said one striking worker, 32-year-old Gleb Sandros. “What else can we do to stop the authorities’ arbitrary and lawless action?”Belarus’ ambassador to Slovakia, Igor Leshchenya, became the first government official to challenge Lukashenko on Saturday when he posted a video in support of the protests before handing in his resignation.He was joined Tuesday by Belarus’ ambassador to Spain, Pavel Pustavy. In a statement posted on Facebook, he urged authorities to recount the vote and prosecute those who beat peaceful protesters.Workers at state-controlled television and the nation’s most prominent theater also have joined protests.Nearly 1,000 people gathered in front of the Janka Kupala National Theater in Minsk to support members of its troupe who gave notice en masse after its director, Pavel Latushko, was fired for siding with the protesters.Culture Minister Yuri Bondar visited the theater to try to assuage concerns. The actors demanded he reinstate Latushko, a former diplomat and a former culture minister himself, but Bondar refused. He left after being heckled and jeered by the performers, who threw a stack of resignation letters at his feet.“It’s important to speak out, important not to stay silent,” prominent actor Kristina Drobysh told supporters outside the theater. “We’ve overcome our fear, our society has overcome its fear. Belarusians have changed — which means Belarus will change, too.”Several hundred demonstrators also gathered in front of a detention center in Minsk where the husband of Lukashenko’s top challenger in the vote, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, was being held to cheer him on his 42nd birthday. Tsikhanouskaya joined the race after the jailing of her husband, Sergei, a popular opposition blogger who had wanted to run for president.Last week, Tsikhanouskaya left the country for Lithuania in a move her campaign said was made under duress. On Monday she declared her readiness to act as a national leader to facilitate a new election. Her top associate, Maria Kolesnikova, said that members of an opposition “coordination council” being formed to negotiate the transition of power would meet Tuesday.“Our goal is to unite society, all of Belarus, so that the Belarusian society has a legitimate institution to negotiate and make demands,” Kolesnikova told the AP.Lukashenko, a 65-year-old former state farm director who has been in office since 1994, described the opposition council’s meeting as an attempt to grab power and warned that the government will take “adequate” steps to “cool those hotheads.”Western officials refused to recognize the election as free or fair and criticized the violent crackdown.The U.N. Security Council scheduled a closed-door discussion of Belarus on Tuesday, and European Union leaders are to discuss it on Wednesday.The EU has anxiously watched a response from Russia, which has a union agreement with Belarus envisaging close political, economic and military ties. Lukashenko spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin twice over the weekend and said that the Russian leader promised him security assistance if Belarus needs it.Russia has remained tight-lipped and said nothing about possible security assistance. Putin on Tuesday had phone calls with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Council President Charles Michel to discuss developments in Belarus.Merkel’s spokesman Steffen Seibert said she “underlined that the Belarusian government must refrain from violence against peaceful protesters, immediately release political prisoners and enter into a national dialogue with the opposition and (civil) society to overcome the crisis.”According to Macron’s office, he underscored the EU’s “determination to play a constructive role at the side of Belarus people so that the violence toward the population stops immediately” and try to help expedite a political solution.Terse readouts from the Kremlin said Putin underlined the need to refrain from foreign interference in Belarus’ affairs.Asked about developments in the country, President Donald Trump said “it doesn’t seem like there’s too much democracy there in Belarus.”“But we are speaking to lots of people and we’ll be speaking at the appropriate time to Russia and we’ll be speaking to other people that are involved,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/belarus-president-remains-defiant-as-strikes-widen/story-LLrSs1892O6AgKFzvMBfoM.html
18-08-2020||World||Donald Trump floats idea that fraud could lead to re-do of November election||US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said a massive shift to mail-in voting in the November presidential election could cause so many problems officials might have to re-do the vote.Trump has said repeatedly and without evidence that a shift to universal mail-in voting - something most states have not proposed doing - will lead to fraud in the Nov. 3 election, when he faces Democratic challenger Joe Biden who currently holds a substantial lead in public opinion polls.Trump does not have the authority to reschedule an election. A national election “re-do” has never occurred in the more than 200 years the U.S. has held elections, including during the Civil War, the Great Depression and two world wars.“It will end up being a rigged election or they will never come out with an outcome,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday. “They’ll have to do it again, and nobody wants that.”As much as half the ballots in the November election could be cast by mail due to America’s coronavirus crisis, election experts say. That is up from about one in four ballots that were cast by mail in 2016.Trump himself votes by mail.As with other forms of voting, documented cases of mail-ballot fraud are extremely rare. But Trump on Tuesday repeated an allegation he has made in recent months that mail-in voting will lead to massive ballot fraud.U.S. states run presidential elections and most only plan to mail absentee ballots for November’s election to voters who request them.A handful of states regularly hold elections with what is known as universal mail-in voting, in which every voter receives a ballot by mail. A few other states, including California and Nevada, plan to mail ballots to all voters for the November election due to the health crisis.“Absentee is great but universal is going to be a disaster,” Trump said.Trump late last month floated the idea of delaying the election, a notion that was immediately dismissed by both Democrats and his fellow Republicans in Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-floats-idea-that-fraud-could-lead-to-re-do-of-november-election/story-ZcYeyWbYzTMTWSgPTeTqAN.html
18-08-2020||World||Officials say Israel, Sudan close to peace agreement||Israel and Sudan on Tuesday said they are close to reaching a peace agreement — setting the stage for a second dramatic diplomatic breakthrough for Israel with its Arab neighbors in a matter of days.A Sudanese Foreign Ministry official announced that his government is “looking forward to concluding a peace agreement with Israel,” drawing a promise from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “do all that’s needed” to wrap up a deal.The announcements came days after Israel and the United Arab Emirates announced an agreement to establish formal diplomatic ties.While Sudan does not have the resources and influence of the UAE, it has a far more hostile history toward Israel.Sudan hosted the landmark Arab conference after the 1967 Mideast war where eight Arab countries approved the “three no’s: no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel and no negotiations.In 1993, the U.S. designated Sudan a state sponsor of terrorism for its support of a number of anti-Israel militant groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah.But in recent years those hostilities have softened, and both countries have expressed readiness to normalize relations.Sky News Arabia quoted a Sudanese Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying his government looked forward to a peace agreement “based on equality and Sudanese interests.”“There is no reason to continue hostility between Sudan and Israel,” the spokesman, Haidar Badawi, was quoted as saying.“We don’t deny that there are communications” with Israel, he added, saying both countries would gain much from a deal.In a statement, Netanyahu said Israel, Sudan and the entire region will benefit. “We will do all that’s needed to turn this vision into a reality,” he said.After Thursday’s announcement with the UAE, Netanyahu predicted that other Arab countries would soon follow suit.In February, Netanyahu met Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, the head of Sudan’s transitional government, during a trip to Uganda where they pledged to pursue normalization. The meeting was held secretly and only announced after the fact.An Israeli deal with Sudan would mark a new setback for the Palestinians, who have long counted on the Arab world to press Israel to make concessions to them as a condition for normalization. They have condemned the Emirati decision as treason.But with Mideast peace efforts frozen for over a decade and with encouragement from the Trump administration, Arab countries have increasingly put their own interests first.Sudan is desperate to lift sanctions linked to its listing by the U.S. as a state sponsor of terror — a key step toward ending its isolation and rebuilding its economy after the popular uprising that toppled longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir last year.A Sudanese official had acknowledged in February that the meeting with Netanyahu was orchestrated by the United Arab Emirates and aimed at helping to remove the terror listing, which dates back to the 1990s, when Sudan briefly hosted Osama bin Laden and other wanted militants.Under al-Bashir, Sudan was also believed to have served as a pipeline for Iran to supply weapons to Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip. Israel was believed to have been behind airstrikes in Sudan that destroyed a convoy in 2009 and a weapons factory in 2012.Last week’s announcement made the UAE the third Arab country to establish full diplomatic ties with Israel.Egypt was the first, in 1979, followed by Jordan in 1994. Unofficial ties with Gulf Arab nations have also grown in recent years, fueled by shared enmity toward Iran.A deal with Sudan could also give Netanyahu a boost at home.Netanyahu has seen his personal popularity drop due to the coronavirus crisis, which has ravaged the Israeli economy. He also faces widespread criticism while on trial for charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.Israel has long courted African support. In exchange for its expertise in security and other fields, Israel wants African states to side with it at the U.N. General Assembly and other international bodies that have long favored the Palestinians.Israel renewed diplomatic relations with Guinea in 2016. After Netanyahu visited Chad for a renewal of ties in 2019, it was reported that Israel was working to formalize ties with Sudan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/officials-say-israel-sudan-close-to-peace-agreement/story-XdV6LzS2w3oJVYQJfJDX2O.html
18-08-2020||World||France mandating masks at all workplaces as virus reawakens||France is now mandating masks in all workplaces, from the Paris business district to factories in the provinces, as it tries to contain growing virus infections but avoid shutting down the economy.Tuesday’s announcement by the Labor Ministry makes France one of relatively few countries in the world that’s universally requiring workers to wear masks on the job, though they’re routinely worn in many Asian countries and increasingly required in public places beyond.The move came after France’s daily infection count jumped past 3,000 over the weekend, for the first time since May, and as the number of virus patients in hospitals, intensive care units and nursing homes is starting to inch up again. France currently has among the highest infection rates in Europe, and already requires masks in public indoor spaces like restaurants and in many areas outdoors.As of Sept. 1, masks will also be required in all shared, enclosed work spaces, including open-plan or shared offices, corridors, meeting rooms, and changing rooms, according to the new government rules. They can only be removed when someone is alone in an individual office.“The latest scientific knowledge about the possible risk of transmission of the virus via aerosols leads us to adopt a general principle of the systematic wearing of masks in indoor, shared workspaces,” said Laurent Pietraszewski, secretary of state for worker health.About a quarter of the 1,013 virus clusters that have emerged since France ended its strict virus lockdown in May were traced to workplaces, according to the national health agency. Family vacation gatherings, dance parties and other summer events have also led to outbreaks, raising new concern in a country that has already seen more than 30,000 virus-related deaths.Labor Minister Elisabeth Borne said the new measures are needed to ensure “the protection of workers’ health and the continuity of our economic activity.” She and Pietraszewski met with unions Tuesday before announcing the rules.Unions have pushed for more virus protections, and workers at the Louvre Museum, Amazon France and other sites walked off the job earlier this year out of concern that their employers weren’t doing enough to protect them.The requirements will come into effect Sept. 1, when workers around France come back from summer holidays, after details of how to impose and enforce them are worked out with unions and the High Council on Public Health.Some workers are reluctant to wear a mask all day, particularly in professions that require heavy physical activity or phone discussions where masks can make it complicated to communicate. And employers worry about how to enforce eventual mask requirements and provide enough masks.Already France has seen scattered incidents of violence by people refusing to don masks, and the government sent riot police to the Marseille region Tuesday to enforce new outdoor mask requirements at farmers’ markets and several neighborhoods.The French government is also recommending — but not requiring — that employees work from home if they can, and advises that individual lodging be used for itinerant workers instead of collective housing.Many governments encourage masks at work but don’t require them everywhere. Among the few countries that mandate them are India and the Philippines, but enforcement varies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-mandating-masks-at-all-workplaces-as-virus-reawakens/story-jlw3dQUx3AATvyuS4z0rUL.html
18-08-2020||World||Apple expands independent repair shop program to Mac computers||Apple Inc said on Monday it had expanded a program that provides parts and training to independent repair shops to cover its Mac computers.Apple initially launched the program last year, but it only covered iPhones, the company’s biggest-selling product. Mac users previously either had to use Apple or an authorized warranty service provider to get fixes with parts directly from Apple.Apple last month reported an uptick of 21.6% in quarterly Mac sales to $7 billion, as many employees shifted to working from home. Its market share grew to 7.3% in the second quarter from 6.3% a year earlier, according to research firm IDC.“When a device needs repairs, we want people to have access to a safe and reliable solution — this latest expansion joins the thousands of repair locations we’ve added over the past year,” Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, said in a statement. “We’re looking forward to bringing that convenient and trustworthy repair experience to our Mac users.”Apple’s shift in repair practices came after years of calls from right-to-repair groups who had criticized the company for, among other things, only providing genuine parts and training manuals to firms such as Best Buy Inc

Helpline calls have risen in Argentina, Colombia and Mexico, but the real extent of domestic violence during the Covid-19 pandemic is likely under-estimated, as survivors are stuck at home and outreach services are interrupted, Etienne said. “With reduced contact to friends and family or barriers in access to services and shelters, we are leaving survivors with nowhere to go,” she warned. Coronavirus cases in the Americas have reached almost 11.5 million and more than 400,000 people have died as a result of the pandemic, the WHO regional director said.The region continues to carry the highest burden of the disease, with 64% of officially reported global deaths despite having 13% of the world’s population. The biggest drivers of the case counts are the United States and Brazil, she said. But there are increasing cases in the Caribbean, and new infections are rising in Peru, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, the Bahamas and Trinidad and Tobago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-causing-mental-health-crisis-at-a-never-seen-before-scale-in-america-who/story-t4d7SHtxYCvQUcPaNnXq6N.html

There’s some evidence that a specific mutation called D614G may have made it easier for the virus to be transmitted between people. But not all scientists are convinced, and it’s hard to say how strong any such effect might be.The D614G mutation, which appeared quite early in the pandemic, has since become so common that most outbreaks are caused by strains that carry it.It’s normal for viruses to mutate over time, but most genetic changes don’t affect their behavior.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/has-the-coronavirus-mutated-in-any-significant-way/story-ZI8YesVXreldnzGnYFxGUJ.html
18-08-2020||World||Donald Trump to pardon women’s suffrage leader Susan Anthony||As he works to curry favour with women voters, President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he will pardon Susan B. Anthony, a women’s suffrage leader arrested for voting in 1872 in violation of laws permitting only men to vote.Trump’s support has been eroding among suburban white women in battleground states since his last campaign, in part because of his harsh rhetoric.Trump held a White House event to announce the pardon and sign a proclamation declaring August 2020 as National Suffrage Month. But he and the women assembled for the event quickly pivoted to the upcoming election and the outcry over Postal Service disruptions that Democrats say endanger the voting rights of millions of Americans who would vote by mail in November during the coronavirus pandemic.“Win, lose or draw, we have to get it right,” Trump said of the November vote count, leveling a fresh offensive against mail-in voting.“You can’t have millions and millions of ballots sent all over the place, sent to people that are dead, sent to dogs, cats, sent everywhere,” Trump said.In fact, voter fraud has proved exceedingly rare. The Brennan Center for Justice in 2017 ranked the risk of ballot fraud at 0.00004% to 0.0009%, based on studies of past elections.Only nine states currently have plans for “universal” mail-in voting, where ballots are sent automatically to registered voters. Five of those states relied on mail-in ballots even before the coronavirus pandemic raised concerns about voting in person.Trump said he would sign “a full and complete pardon” for Anthony later Tuesday, the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which ensured women the right to vote. It’s also known as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment.In recent weeks, Trump has been trying to build support within the pivotal female voter constituency and has stepped up his events aimed at women. His campaign has launched a “women for Trump” bus tour and the president has embraced a “law and order” message with renewed vigor.Anthony was arrested for voting in her hometown of Rochester, New York, and convicted in a widely publicized trial. Although she refused to pay the fine, the authorities declined to take further action.The 19th Amendment states that “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.” Congress passed it in 1919, and the amendment was ratified 100 years ago on Aug. 18, 1920.Visiting Anthony’s grave site in Rochester on Election Day has become a popular ritual in recent years. Thousands turned out in 2016 for the presidential match-up between Trump and Hillary Clinton. In 2018, voters showed up by the dozens to put their “I Voted” stickers on her headstone.Not everyone was enthusiastic about the pardon.Democratic New York Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul demanded that Trump rescind it. “She was proud of her arrest to draw attention to the cause for women’s rights, and never paid her fine,” Hochul tweeted. “Let her Rest In Peace.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-pardon-women-s-suffrage-leader-susan-anthony/story-tczy2BwEEbugn184QcpyIO.html

The biggest drivers of the case counts are the United States and Brazil, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-in-america-reach-11-5-million-deaths-400-000-who-director/story-TfHJRT3ZouvpHLMhJduT3L.html

He pointed at 10 instances in which Trump may have attempted to impede his investigation but did not say whether this amounted to obstruction of justice. Trump and his supporters have consistently bristled at suggestions foreign interference helped his upset 2016 victory and sought to discredit the intelligence agencies’ findings as the politically charged work of a “deep state.” Founded by Julian Assange, WikiLeaks published thousands of emails hacked from Clinton’s campaign and a top campaign aide in the weeks before the 2016 election, yielding a drum beat of negative coverage about the Democrat.“WikiLeaks actively sought, and played, a key role in the Russian campaign and very likely knew it was assisting a Russian intelligence influence effort, the report said, saying the panel found “significant indications that Julian Assange and WikiLeaks have benefited from Russian government support.”As Russian military intelligence and WikiLeaks released the hacked documents, the report said Trump’s campaign sought advance notice, devised messaging strategies to amplify them “and encouraged further theft of information and ... leaks.”“The Trump campaign publicly undermined the attribution of the hack-and-leak campaign to Russia and was indifferent to whether it and WikiLeaks were furthering a Russian election interference effort,” the report added.The committee could not establish the extent to which Trump campaign advisor Roger Stone had real inside access to WikiLeaks materials, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-used-manafort-wikileaks-to-boost-donald-trump-in-2016-us-senate/story-VobnOOBWQUwBZxYMaHSZYK.html

18-08-2020||World||National Zoo awaits birth of pandemic panda cub||Zookeepers at Washington’s National Zoo are on furry black-and-white baby watch after concluding that venerable giant panda matriarch Mei Xiang is pregnant and could give birth this week. It’s a welcome bit of good news amid a pandemic that kept the zoo shuttered for months.“We need this! We totally need this joy,” said zoo spokeswoman Pamela Baker-Masson. “We are all in desperate need of these feel-goods.”Although so-called “phantom pregnancies” are common with pandas and other large bears, Baker-Masson said an ultrasound scan revealed a “really strong-looking, fantastic fetus” that could be delivered this week.“The image was great. She is absolutely pregnant. But things could still happen, just like in a human pregnancy,” Baker-Masson said.The zoo posted a video from the ultrasound on Instagram. “Keep your paws crossed!” the zoo posted, reporting that the fetus was “kicking and swimming in the amniotic fluid.”The announcement of the pregnancy has already touched off a fresh round of panda-mania for one of the zoo’s feature attractions. Viewership on the zoo’s panda-cam has increased 800%.The zoo reopened on a limited basis July 24, with restrictions in place to keep the crowds down. However, all indoor exhibits, including the extremely popular panda house, have remained closed. Visitors can still view the outdoor panda enclosure, but Mei has mostly been staying indoors, creating a nest out of branches. She can still be viewed on the panda cam.Panda births are inherently tricky, with stillbirths and miscarriages happening frequently. There is also a phenomenon called “resorption” whereby the fetus is unexpectedly absorbed back into the mother’s body. Baker-Masson said that is rare with a fetus this well-developed.Another potential complication is the age of the mother. Mei, at 22, would be the oldest giant panda to successfully give birth in the United States. The oldest in the world gave birth in China at age 23.“Reproductively speaking, she is an older bear,” Baker-Masson said. “But she has been a great mother in the past.”Mei Xiang has successfully given birth to three cubs: Tai Shan, Bao Bao and Bei Bei. All were transported to China at age 4, under terms of the zoo’s agreement with the Chinese government.Mei was impregnated via artificial insemination, a process which was heavily affected by precautions over the COVID-19 pandemic. The procedure was conducted shortly after the entire zoo shut down on March 14.Normally, zookeepers would have used a combination of stored frozen sperm and fresh semen extracted from male panda Tian Tian. In order to minimize the number of close-quarters medical procedures conducted, zoo staff decided to skip the extraction and inseminate Mei only with thawed out semen from 2016. If successful, it would be the first of its kind in the U.S. using only frozen sperm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/national-zoo-awaits-birth-of-pandemic-panda-cub/story-DLtTHFZhnoWmnuHwJ577uN.html

The reductions represent about 9% of the company’s workforce.Marks & Spencer said group revenue fell 13.2% in the quarter ended August 8, driven by a 38% drop in in-store sales of clothing and housewares.Like other retailers, the company has seen a surge in online sales as customers avoid in-store shopping the pandemic. Marks & Spencer said 68% of its orders were delivered to customers’ homes during the quarter, compared with 29% in the previous year.The company said “there remains substantial uncertainty about market conditions and the duration of social-distancing measures, and we are retaining a cautious approach to planning for the balance of the year.″||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-retailer-marks-spencer-cuts-7-000-jobs-due-to-pandemic/story-3Bt0BU5uQkV1l97lgkP8CL.html
18-08-2020||World||China considers imposing tariffs on Australian wine||China on Tuesday began investigating whether Australia is dumping wine in a trade dispute that further strains relations between the countries and could shut the biggest export market for Australian wine.The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said the anti-dumping investigation involved wine in containers of 2 liters (68 fluid ounces) or smaller imported from Australia from Tuesday.The Australian government denied subsidizing exporters.“We do find this deeply troubling, concerning and perplexing given Australia’s wine industry is not subsidized to export and it’s certainly not dumping product on the world market,” Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said. “Now it’s for China and Beijing to explain the rationale behind these actions and why they have moved to that stage of an investigation.”China’s only other anti-dumping investigation of Australian products effectively closed the China market to Australian barley in May through crippling tariffs. Australia is appealing that decision.The investigation of Australian wine exports, which made 1.1 billion Australian dollars ($795 million) from the Chinese market last year, could take between a year and 18 months.Birmingham said he hopes China will not impose interim trade measures during the investigation.China’s decision to shut out Australian barley a week after it banned beef exports from Australia’s four largest abattoirs over labeling issues has been linked to Australian calls for an independent investigation into the source of the coronavirus as well as responses to the pandemic.Chinese Ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye warned in an Australian newspaper interview in April that Australian wine could be targeted in a Chinese consumer boycott if the government persisted with its call for a coronavirus inquiry.Asked if the wine investigation was a political tactic, Birmingham told reporters, “That’s really a question for China.”“Our hope and expectation is that these matters should be considered and addressed on their merits and that means that Beijing and Chinese authorities should look at the evidence,” Birmingham said.Graeme Shaw, owner of Shaw Wines outside Canberra, said Chinese tariffs would have a considerable effect on large Australian wine producers.“I think the industry should have been expecting something from the comments from the Chinese ambassador,” Shaw told Nine Network television news.Weihuan Zhou, a University of New South Wales international trade expert, suspected the wine probe was part of separate, decadelong trade dispute between the countries over anti-dumping rules, particularly over Australia’s allegations of Chinese dumping of steel products.Bilateral relations had shown improvement since the pandemic after Australia distanced itself from U.S. security concerns over popular Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat, Zhou said.“I don’t think it’s part of the previous political fight between Australia and China” over the coronavirus, Zhou said. “There have been positive signs of political improvement of the bilateral relationship.”Shares in Australian wine exporter Treasury Wine Estates plunged as much as 17% on the Australian stock market on Tuesday on news of the Chinese investigation.The Melbourne-based company reported to the Australian Securities Exchange in 2018 that it was one of several Australian wine exporters experiencing delays in getting wine through Chinese customs.The company said in a statement to the exchange on Tuesday that it will “cooperate with any requests that we receive for information from Chinese or Australian authorities.”Birmingham said Australian wine was the most expensive on the Chinese market after New Zealand wine. He said he had been unable to speak to his Chinese counterpart about the mounting trade disputes since last year.“Australia is certainly not engaging in any type of war,” he said.Australia has had a free-trade deal with China, its biggest export market, since 2015. Australia is regarded by some as the Western country most susceptible to Chinese economic pressure because of their close economic ties.Zhou said he had long doubted that China would target Australian wine in its diplomatic dispute with Australia because Chinese investors would be harmed.“The Chinese investors are trying to secure a production base in Australia so that they can provide sufficient supply back to the Chinese market,” Zhou said.“That means that if China’s government decides to impose anti-dumping duties against Australian wine, that will hurt the Chinese investors as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-considers-imposing-tariffs-on-australian-wine/story-LJEe8sdHGASbvPWETohTyN.html
18-08-2020||World||Lebanese customs chief arrested over Beirut blast||The head of Lebanon’s customs authority was formally arrested on Monday after being questioned over the massive explosion in Beirut earlier this month, the state-run National News Agency reported. The investigation is focused on why nearly 3,000 tons of explosive ammonium nitrate was being stored at the city’s port. The ignition of the stockpile caused an explosion that tore through the capital, killing at least 180 people and wounding 6,000. Thirty people are still missing after the August 4 blast, which caused an estimated USD 10 billion to USD 15 billion in damage. More than 70,000 workers are believed to be unemployed due to the explosions, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Monday, on top of 220,000 people estimated to have lost their jobs as a result of the ﬁnancial crisis that began last October last year and those left jobless by the Covid-19 pandemic. Dujarric said some 40,000 buildings were damaged, with 3,000 residential structures severely damaged, and at least 2,000 doctors were either injured or had their clinics destroyed. Documents that surfaced after the blast, the single most destructive in Lebanon’s history, showed that officials have known for years that 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate were stored in a warehouse at the port and knew about the dangers. Judge Fadi Sawwan questioned customs chief Badri Daher, who was detained days after the blast, for 4 1/2 hours in the presence of his two lawyers before issuing the arrest warrant, the agency said. Daher will remain in custody as the investigation continues. NNA said that after questioning Daher, Sawwan headed to the scene of the blast to survey the damage and will later return to question Hassan Koraytem, who was the top port official until the day of the blast. Lebanese President Michel Aoun said the probe into the devastating blast is “very complex” and would not be finished quickly. Aoun said the probe is divided into three parts. The first aims to determine the circumstances surrounding the cargo, the second where it came from and who shipped it, and the third to find who was responsible for handling and securing it. Aoun said the FBI and French investigators were helping because “they, more than us, have the capability and ability to find out the details of what got the ship here, what is the source and who owns it.” A nine-member team of FBI investigators landed in Beirut on Sunday, according to a Lebanese aviation official, and were believed to have joined the investigation. French investigators have been active for days at the port. Popular anger has swelled over the ruling elite’s corruption and mismanagement. Lebanon’s government, which is supported by the militant Hezbollah group and its allies, resigned on Aug. 10 and continues to serve in a caretaker capacity. There are no formal consultations underway on who will replace Hassan Diab as prime minister and no likely candidate has emerged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanese-customs-chief-arrested-over-beirut-blast/story-7l6xQLbBHZ8xa7yJWAVPBK.html
18-08-2020||World||Belarus gives the EU a chance to show geopolitical relevance||The massive protests in Belarus are a chance for the European Union to try and flex its rarely used foreign-policy muscle in what could be a defining historical moment.The bloc’s 27 leaders will hold an emergency conference call on Wednesday to discuss the violent aftermath of Belarus’s presidential election, which the EU said was neither “free nor fair.” And while options are limited, timely action could sway the outcome while also redefining the EU’s international role.Since emerging from a decade of internal crises -- from euro-area debt chaos to the UK becoming the first country to leave the bloc -- the EU has found itself caught in a struggle between the US and China, and with its old foe Russia still causing trouble. No longer able, and in some cases willing, to piggyback onto American power, the EU wants to strike out on its own.“What we have witnessed in Belarus is not acceptable,” European Council President Charles Michel, who will chair the video conference, said in a letter to the leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.But aside from symbolism, there’s a ceiling to what they can do and toughening the rhetoric remains their main arsenal. The bloc’s foreign ministers have already agreed to start working on sanctions -- though leaders may push to expedite them.Russia’s RoleThe EU’s leadership believes the response to the situation has been too muted, in particular on the role that Russian President Vladimir Putin might play in shoring up Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, according to an EU official in Brussels. “There should be no outside interference,” Michel made a point of saying in his letter.Eastern European countries geographically close to Belarus such as Poland and the Baltic states pushed for the call, arranged for noon Brussels time on Wednesday, but Michel needed little persuasion, EU officials said.He and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen started their mandates at the end of last year with teams that reflected a new-found focus on international issues and although the coronavirus pandemic has stymied their plans, that vision hasn’t altered. And the EU’s foreign-policy chief, Spain’s Josep Borrell, has shown a willingness in the past to speak his mind even though he has limited powers.“These peaceful demonstrations had clear demands: the release of all unlawfully detained people, the prosecution of those responsible for police brutality, and holding of new presidential elections,” Borrell said in a statement on Monday. “The sheer numbers clearly show that the Belarusian population wants change, and wants it now. The EU stands by them.”The call will be as much about showing how the EU can act when it believes a line has been crossed, one EU official said, and its willingness to directly take on Putin.Another added that while the outcome needs to be more than a mere statement, there’s a balancing act between taking measures that sends a strong signal and steps that are counter-productive and make a negotiated solution harder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/belarus-gives-the-eu-a-chance-to-show-geopolitical-relevance/story-pUQUHzdxFLjN5BsuiVJ7tO.html

18-08-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine turns into a shot at redemption for Britain||At the Global Vaccine Summit he hosted in June, Boris Johnson was keen to remind the audience that it was a British doctor, Edward Jenner, who pioneered vaccinations. Now it’s the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford that’s leading the drive for an inoculation against coronavirus.The pandemic has blown every leader off course, but Johnson has been among the hardest hit. The UK recorded the worst death toll in Europe and the biggest economic meltdown mere months after leaving the European Union. Johnson concedes there will have to be an inquiry into his handling of it.That’s why the UK coming up with the first universally recognized barrier against Covid-19 is the ultimate prize for a government that after another humiliating policy U-turn needs to redeem itself somehow. Brexit, after all, was about showing the world the UK was better off alone even during a crisis.Johnson is the eternal optimist, Covid-19 vaccine is the modern-day Holy Grail and the UK finds itself the knight leading the quest for a globally accepted inoculation. The reason why, despite missteps over procuring personal protective equipment for health workers and testing for the virus, is because of its history of medical research.It explains why ministers moved quickly to take control of the push, according to conversations with scientists, company officials, and government advisers.“The UK is looking for a place in the world as an independent entity and has an opportunity to show real leadership in the vaccine space,” said John Bell, professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, who is working with the government on its vaccine program.Given the government’s track record during the pandemic, the risks are high. There has been little sign of public backslapping since the team at Oxford—the alma mater of Johnson and his two Tory predecessors—became a clear frontrunner in July, a month after the prime minister’s reminder of the UK’s scientific pedigree.Read More: Covid Vaccine Front-Runner Is Months Ahead of Her CompetitionThe Jenner Institute was well positioned to start work on a shot after years of work on a related coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.So when Johnson’s government found the university was talking with U.S. pharmaceutical companies about manufacturing the potential vaccine they balked at the idea and began to plot a strategy to keep it British.GlaxoSmithKline Plc and AstraZeneca Plc were the obvious onshore manufacturers. Glaxo was conflicted, but a partnership with Astra was quickly agreed over one weekend in April. By the end of that month, the UK drugmaker and Oxford announced a deal that would see Astra take on the manufacturing and large-scale distribution. The government reviewed all the paperwork before it was signed.But betting the house on one vaccine against a virus that has killed over 775,000 people and sickened more than 21 million wouldn’t be enough if the UK was going to ensure it had access to a successful jab.Health Secretary Matt Hancock called Kate Bingham, a venture capitalist in the health industry who had been helping the government look for new drugs and vaccines, to see if she would lead the effort.Bingham was largely on board with chairing an official UK Vaccine Taskforce, but wanted one thing made clear: it doesn’t matter how many deals the UK does, there still might not be a vaccine at the end of it. In a call with Johnson on the afternoon of May 6, Bingham agreed to take up the gig.“I really wanted him to understand that this was a heroic uphill struggle,” Bingham said in an interview. “Even pathogens we know lots about—HIV and malaria—we still don’t have vaccines for. So I had to make sure that there weren’t unrealistic expectations of how doable it would be.”There are broadly four main approaches being taken to producing a Covid-19 vaccine. The UK strategy is to ensure Britain has enough potential doses from each bucket in the hope that one will be successful, but not to hoard supplies. On the contrary, part of the “Global Britain” brand is to share its success with the world.So far, Bingham’s taskforce has bought a medley of 340 million doses from the four groups after two more deals on Friday.Britain’s desire to respond to the pandemic on its own terms has been clear from the start. The country opted out of joint EU procurement programs for PPE and ventilators, which led to outcries from National Health Service workers. Ministers have repeatedly said the EU programs yielded little benefit to participants.In a call with health ministers from Germany, France and Italy in early June, Hancock made clear the UK wasn’t interested in joining the group’s alliance to procure shots either, with the Netherlands taking its place. A few weeks later, the UK also ruled out joining the EU’s 2 billion-euro ($2.4 billion) vaccine program, because it would have prevented Britain from having a direct hand in negotiating deals.In Brussels, the move was seen in keeping with the UK’s belief it could perform better than the EU when acting alone, according to two EU officials with knowledge of discussions between the two sides.“It seems we’re putting ourselves in danger of continuing to do the same thing and getting the same result: not what we wanted,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “Maybe you get lucky and they just happen to get all the aces turning up.”If the Oxford-Astra vaccine is approved before other credible alternatives, it will give Britain a much-needed shot in the arm to its reputation. With no guarantees, the best the UK can do is be prepared should things go wrong, said Bingham.Indeed, Johnson promised in his New Year message a month before Brexit that the UK would be the “the best place on Earth” for “quality education and cutting-edge science.” Much is riding on that second pledge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-turns-into-a-shot-at-redemption-for-britain/story-VuuMiWA7REPOfd1yCnJm6M.html
18-08-2020||World||Roger Stone drops appeal of conviction for lying to Congress||Roger Stone is no longer appealing his conviction, weeks after President Donald Trump commuted his sentence.In a five-page court filing late Monday, Stone asked to withdraw his appeal, ending a case that had stirred controversy from the start, with his televised arrest. The Republican operative and backer of Trump was convicted in November of lying to Congress during a probe of Russian interference in the 2016 US election.Stone gave no reason for his decision to drop the appeal.All the prosecutors withdrew from the Stone case after the Justice Department reduced its original sentencing recommendation. The judge eventually sentenced him to more than three years in a federal prison in Georgia. Last month, the president commuted the sentence, meaning Stone wouldn’t be incarcerated but would remain a convicted felon, unless he successfully appealed.Stone, 67, had said he was eager to clear his name and overturn a conviction that he says was the result of a politically biased judge and jury -- claims frequently echoed by Trump. “A pardon includes acceptance of guilt and ends the appeals process. The commutation allows me to go forward with the appeals,” Stone said in a July text message.“Roger Stone was treated horribly. Roger Stone was treated very unfairly. Roger Stone was brought into this witch hunt, this whole political witch hunt, the Mueller scam,” Trump said on July 11. “I’m very happy with what I did.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/roger-stone-drops-appeal-of-conviction-for-lying-to-congress/story-rxqkOkuwDudvm2nl0E0frJ.html

The US Justice Department has sought to dismiss the case against Flynn following pressure from Trump and his allies.Last month, Trump used his presidential power to commute the sentence of longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying under oath to lawmakers investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-will-pardon-a-very-important-person-on-tuesday/story-1M94AFTCcogk4aBTuX8j1H.html

The ministry, quoting Xi, said China will “resolutely” safeguard China’s “...sovereignty, territorial integrity, and maritime rights and interests, steadily advance the consultation process of the ‘Code of Conduct in the South China Sea’, stabilise the maritime situation, properly handle border disputes between China and India, and maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas.”Published by the Chinese foreign ministry’s Communist party committee in Mandarin in the party mouthpiece, People’s Daily, the analysis claimed that China’s relation with “regional powers” like India has improved.“Relations with neighbouring countries continue to improve. For regional powers, the leaders of China and India have created a new model of bilateral exchanges at annual informal meetings, leading the two countries to deepen strategic mutual trust, properly manage differences, and stably develop bilateral relations,” the analysis said.It was referring to the two informal summits between Modi and Xi held in Wuhan in 2018 and in Chennai in 2019.The Chinese government analysis avoided referring to the ongoing discussions between India and China to resolve stalemate in the troop disengagement process in eastern Ladakh.India had rejected China’s contention that disengagement has been completed at most locations along their disputed border, and called on Beijing to work sincerely for complete de-escalation and full restoration of peace along the LAC.The new analysis comes a week after the foreign ministry had said in a statement that maintaining peace along the disputed boundary and deepening strategic trust with India is one of China’s diplomatic priorities.“For the China-India relationship, the two sides should jointly safeguard peace and security in the border areas and maintain a steady and sound development of bilateral ties,” spokesperson Zhao Lijian had said.Responding to a query about China’s future diplomatic priorities as the Covid-19 pandemic impacts the world, Zhao was briefly outlining Beijing’s plans for the way ahead in bilateral ties with the US, Russia, EU, Japan, and India.The current analysis also looked at Beijing’s ties with the US, Russia, the European Union, Japan, South Korea besides Latin America, Africa and Central Asian countries.The ministry said that since the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, held in October 2017, Xi had travelled for 2,15,000 km and visited 27 countries.“In the direction of Northeast Asia, General Secretary Xi Jinping made a historic visit to North Korea. The top leaders of China and North Korea met 5 times,” it said.In context of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, China, under Xi’s guidance as per the ministry, provided or is providing medical material assistance to more than 150 countries and international and regional organisations, and has sent 32 medical expert teams to 30 countries.Last month, the Chinese foreign ministry had inaugurated the Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy research centre, which aims to coordinate resources to conduct “comprehensive, systematic, and in-depth study, interpretation, and promotion of Xi’s thinking.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/properly-handling-border-dispute-with-india-part-of-xi-jinping-doctrine-says-chinese-foreign-ministry/story-l6Cdk9m6rmn5ccZqIVJNtK.html

It has entered a late-stage human test in the United Arab Emirates to gather proof of efficacy for final regulatory approvals.“It will not be priced very high. It is expected to cost a few hundred yuan for a shot, and for two shots it should be less than 1,000 yuan,” Liu told the Guangming Daily newspaper.Governments and drugmakers around the world are in a frenetic race to develop a Covid-19 vaccine. More than 200 candidates are in development, including more than 20 in human clinical trials.Moderna Inc said earlier this month that smaller volumes of its experimental vaccine have been priced at $32-$37 per dose.Last month, the U.S. government struck a deal for an experimental vaccine being developed by Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE that secures enough to innoculate 50 million Americans for about $40 a person.Sinopharm’s Liu did not mention whether China’s state-backed nationwide insurance program would cover some of the vaccine costs for consumers, or whether it could be included in the country’s free vaccination scheme.China National Biotec Group (CNBG), a Sinopharm unit, has moved two vaccine strains using the same method into human trials. Its plants in Wuhan and Beijing combined could make over two million doses of the drug annually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sinopharm-chief-rules-out-high-price-for-coronavirus-vaccine/story-5Prn8E9WAXw8pXvP41T45M.html

She read out from a scathing obituary blaming failed leadership for his death.“My dad was a healthy 65-year-old. His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump, and for that, he paid with his life,” Urquiza said.“One of the last things that my father said to me was that he felt betrayed by the likes of Donald Trump. And so when I cast my vote for Joe Biden, I will do it for my dad,” she added.In her brief three-minute appearance, Urquiza, who lives in San Francisco, said that Trump may not have caused the coronavirus, but his dishonesty and irresponsible actions made the tragedy worse.She also accused the US president of being disconnected with the reality.Urquiza gained national attention in July when an obituary she wrote for her father, Mark Anthony, blamed “the carelessness of the politicians” who did not acknowledge the severity of the virus.There are 78 days until the presidential election in the United States and the Democrats used the opportunity on Monday to attack Trump on the coronavirus pandemic, racial justice and the shattered economy.Former rival Bernie Sanders and prominent Republican John Kasich also joined forces at the event in a display of unity for Biden.The convention will continue till Thursday at the end of which Biden will accept his party’s presidential nomination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/his-only-pre-existing-condition-was-trusting-donald-trump-woman-who-lost-father-to-covid-19-says-at-democratic-convention/story-77rynlCFqb59teEMeU8yJP.html
18-08-2020||World||Coronavirus forces Malaysian palm industry to rethink reliance on foreign labour||Malaysia’s palm oil producers are embarking on a rare recruitment drive to hire locals and accelerating industry mechanisation as they grapple with a severe shortage of foreign labour due to the coronavirus pandemic.As the September-November peak production season approaches, companies are erecting banners near plantations and posting online job advertisements boasting free housing, free water and other perks of estate life in a bid to lure workers to do everything from driving tractors to harvesting. Already, travel and movement restrictions have left the world’s second-largest palm oil producer grappling with a shortage of 37,000 workers, nearly 10% of the total workforce. The Malaysian Palm Oil Association (MPOA) believes this could blow out to 70,000 workers once borders reopen.“This is the first time we are making such a big effort to hire Malaysians, but it is also the first time we are facing Covid-19,” Imran, an estate manager with Sime Darby Plantation, told Reuters after interviewing potential applicants at a recruitment day near Kuala Lumpur.The industry fears the labour crunch will hurt palm oil production this year by delaying the harvest of perishable fruit, giving an edge to bigger rival Indonesia which has no such labour problems. Malaysia’s average cost of production is already slightly higher at about $406-$480 a tonne, according to analysts, compared with Indonesia at $400-$450 a tonne. Countries like Indonesia and Bangladesh provide nearly 85% of plantation workers for palm companies such as Sime Darby, IOI Corp and United Plantations.While employing more Malaysians could save on recruitment fees and levies needed to fly in foreign workers, planters worry that local workers, who typically shun plantation work as dirty and dangerous, won’t commit to the industry or take on the most difficult jobs.“It’s possible that recruiting more locals could bring down the cost of production, but provided these locals are also as productive as them (migrant workers),” said MPOA chief executive Nageeb Wahab. “That is a big question mark.”Despite a rising unemployment rate, Imran said most of the interest at the recruitment day was for general duties, such as driver or mechanic, rather than the taxing and crucial task of harvesting.With more foreign workers leaving, some severely understaffed smaller firms, which are less able to retain migrant labour, have resorted to poaching workers from competitors. “It is bad, but I need to do this to survive,” said an official of a mid-sized estate in Sarawak who declined to be named.ADVANCING MECHANISATIONThe labour shortfall is adding urgency to long-standing plans for industry mechanisation.Sime, the world’s biggest palm oil company by land size, told Reuters it is quickening development and trials to deploy “light machines” that will aid in field upkeep, removing harvested crops and applying fertiliser.It’s also turning to remote sensing and artificial intelligence to drive “precision farming”, making the most efficient use of farm inputs and field workers.IOI said it has a “revitalised mechanisation plan”, and aims to mechanise fertilising and pesticide spraying as well as automating mill operations, while FGV Holdings plans to mechanise an extra 30,000 hectares over the next three years.Malaysia on average allots one worker for every 8 hectares, but the MPOA wants a “quantum leap” in technology that would double the land area for each worker to 16 hectares. This would reduce reliance on labour, which accounts for around 30% of production costs.“Imagine inventing a drone that can fly under the canopy of palm trees, with a scanner to detect ripe fruit bunches and a laser attached to cut the bunch,” said M.R. Chandran, a veteran industry official turned consultant.“By totally modernising plantations with drones, artificial intelligence and robotics, we can also make plantation work more attractive for locals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-forces-malaysian-palm-industry-to-rethink-reliance-on-foreign-labour/story-9wTx1OBowG1wkr5durHCDN.html

If they are not willing to play that role, then I will ask Prime Minister Imran Khan to go ahead with or without Saudi Arabia.”Saudi Arabia was not the only country Qureshi was upset with. He also expressed his consternation with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for not having supported Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir.As a retaliation, Saudi Arabia issued a statement that loans or oil supply will no longer be given to Pakistan.Islamabad was also made to pay back $1 billion to Riyadh, which was part of a $6.2 billion package announced by Saudi in November 2018, which included a total of $3 billion in loans and an oil credit facility amounting to $3.2 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-army-chief-meets-saudi-counterpart-in-attempt-to-smoothen-strained-ties/story-TbJ6m5RgfUxlTz1GW1zUgI.html
18-08-2020||World||29 wildfires raging across California amid heatwave, world temperature record||One of the hottest air temperatures recorded anywhere on the planet in at least a century, and possibly ever, was reached on Sunday afternoon at Death Valley in California’s Mojave Desert where it soared to 130 Fahrenheit (54.4 Celsius).The temperature was recorded in the Valley’s sparsely populated Furnace Creek.It was a dry heat: Humidity fell to 7%. But it felt “insanely hot” all the same, according to meteorologists.Tourists on Monday took selfies by an outdoor thermometer at the Death Valley visitor centre while avoiding touching metal surfaces with bare skin.The US state is also witnessing wildfires, 29 of them, according to California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The department has been posting maps of places which are affected by the fires and evacuations operations being carried out. UPDATE: 8/17/20 AT 4:10PM:NEW EVACUATIONS ORDERS for the North Side of Newtown Rd to include:• Lois Lane• Monte Vista• Jones Bar• Empress Cross• Personeni• ElizabethThe wildfires have already blackened more than 1,20,000 acres of land, according to authorities. And excessive heat warning is also in place till Wednesday in may parts.And then there is a risk of 10 million people being plunged into darkness as California’s grid operator works to keep the region’s power system from collapsing under the strain of one of the worst heat waves in generations.The California Independent System Operator has imposed rolling blackouts to manage overwhelming energy demands caused by an extreme heatwave.Officials estimate that peak electricity consumption on Monday would likely exceed available supply statewide by as much as 4,400 megawatts. A lapse of that magnitude would mark the most severe shortfall to strike California’s grid since 2001, the last time utilities in the state essentially rationed energy in the form of rolling blackouts.The controlled power disruptions, with alternating blocks of utility customers losing electricity for one or two hours at a time, are designed to prevent excess demand from triggering a more widespread collapse of the grid that could last days.The current heat wave, which has roasted parts of Southern California in triple-digit temperatures since Friday, was attributed to an enormous high-pressure system over much of the Western United States, and was expected last through Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/29-wildfires-raging-across-california-amid-heatwave-world-temperature-record/story-9QP1mZSyXKHGCwP4wVR1II.html

18-08-2020||World||North Korea calls party meeting to discuss ‘crucial’ issue||North Korea’s ruling Workers’ Party will discuss a “crucial” matter at a meeting on Wednesday that comes as the state is battling catastrophic flooding and trying to head off a coronavirus crisis.Top party leaders will meet to “to discuss and decide on an issue of crucial significance in developing the Korean revolution and increasing the fighting efficiency of the Party,” the state’s Korean Central News Agency said in a Tuesday report, without providing further details.Leader Kim Jong Un last week sacked the premier he appointed a little more than a year ago, removed the southern border city of Kaesong from a virus lockdown and said his state would not accept foreign food aid because of the coronavirus risk.The announcement on state media comes on the same day that the US and South Korea began a set of joint military drills. Even though the exercises have been scaled down due to the coronavirus, North Korea has previously denounced joint drills as a prelude to nuclear war.North Korea has been hit by flooding since earlier this month, as torrential rains threaten to wipe out farmland and the economy heads for what might be its biggest contraction in more than two decades. The flooding has also impacted its Yongbyon nuclear facility, with waters reaching pump houses for mothballed reactors, the 38 North website said based on an analysis of satellite imagery.North Korea has boasted that it doesn’t have any confirmed cases of Covid-19, a claim doubted by officials in the US and Japan. The pandemic brings large risks to the impoverished state because its antiquated medical systems could be overwhelmed if the virus arrived with force.Agricultural production is a key element of North Korea’s economy and flooding in its summer months has led to diminished harvest, putting strain on Kim as he battles global sanctions put in place to punish the state for its nuclear and ballistic missile testing. The United Nations World Food Program, which has operations in North Korea, has said about 40% of the population is undernourished, adding “food insecurity and malnutrition are widespread.”The premier serves in a role as a steward of economic policy, and Kim’s decision to oust Kim Jae Ryong from the post could help deflect blame for any hardships coming from a poor harvest.In addition to damage to farmland, Kim Jong Un’s decision to shut borders in January due to the coronavirus slammed the brakes on the little legal trade the state has, and could send the economy this year into its biggest contraction since 1997, according to Fitch Solutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-calls-party-meeting-to-discuss-crucial-issue/story-Z4MdmNBRAm6QytryqfvStO.html

It’s also lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms each year, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.A magnitude 7.7 quake killed nearly 2,000 people in the northern Philippines in 1990.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-5-magnitude-earthquake-jolts-central-philippines-some-damage-seen/story-9I5SpBmo3NWhan5MDPF6BP.html
18-08-2020||World||Ten million Californians risk going dark in massive blackout||As many as 10 million people across California may take turns being plunged into darkness on Monday evening as the state’s grid operator works to keep the region’s power system from collapsing under the strain of one of the worst heat waves in generations.The outages, which were expected to hit as soon as 4 p.m. in California, would mark the third time in four days that the state’s utilities deliberately cut power to protect a grid that’s been pushed to the brink of failure as people blast their air conditioners and fans to keep cool. The state is facing an electricity shortfall on Monday of about 4.4 gigawatts, according to California Governor Gavin Newsom. That’s the equivalent of about four nuclear power plants.“Let me just make this crystal clear: We failed to predict and plan these shortages -- and that’s simply unacceptable,” said Newsom, who called for an investigation into why officials failed to anticipate the need for blackouts.Shortly after 3:30 p.m, the state’s grid operator declare a stage-two grid emergency -- one step away from a blackout order.Since Friday, millions of Californians have been abruptly plunged into darkness with little notice, reminiscent of the mass blackouts that the state’s utilities carried out less than a year ago to keep their electrical lines from sparking fires during unusually strong windstorms -- all extreme weather events made more frequent by climate change. But even last year’s outages pale in comparison to the one planned for Monday. Rarely if ever have 3.3 million homes and businesses across California, or roughly 10 million people based on the average size of a household, been affected by a planned shutdown of this kind.And it couldn’t be hitting California at a more vulnerable time, with the pandemic forcing people into lockdown, leaving them with little choice but to endure the heat indoors.The rotating blackouts will last for about an hour each, according to the state’s grid operator. This month is the first time California has resorted to rotating outages since the 2001 energy crisis, when hundreds of thousands of customers lost power, electricity prices surged to record levels and the state’s largest electric utility went bankrupt. (It went bankrupt a second time last year in the face of crippling wildfire liabilities.)Part of the problem is California’s rapid shift away from natural gas. About 9 gigawatts of gas generation, enough to power 6.8 million homes, have been retired over the past five years as the state turns increasingly to renewables, according to BloombergNEF. That leaves fewer options when the sun sets and solar production wanes.Normally, California can import enough power from neighboring states when supplies are tight. But the sprawling heat wave blanketing the U.S. West is pushing power plants to the hilt across the region.“California is in a tight spot,” BNEF analyst Brian Bartholomew said. “It’s retired a lot of gas. And the storage that’s supposed to help hasn’t yet come online.”Tonight could be the grid’s biggest test yet, with temperatures expected to soar as high as 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 Celsius) in some parts of the state. Heat in some parts of the region has already broken records.“We don’t have enough resources,” John Phipps, director of real time operations at the California Independent System Operator, said on a conference call. “We’re going to have to” call for blackouts.Newsom, a Democrat, signed an order that will temporarily allow users and utilities to use backup generators to ease the need for blackouts.By 3 p.m. local time, it was already 102 degrees in Sacramento. With temperatures climbing, demand for power in the state is expected to reach more than 49,700 megawatts Monday afternoon, just shy of the all-time record set in 2006. Power prices more than doubled, to the highest in five months.The relentless heat is starting to take a physical toll on California’s power system. Transformers -- the metal cylinders sitting atop power poles -- can malfunction and catch fire if they don’t cool off at night. And temperatures in some parts of Southern California are expected to remain in the low 80’s overnight. During a deadly, 10-day heatwave in 2006, the state’s utilities lost more than 1,500 of these devices, with each knocking out service to one neighborhood in the process.The heat wave gripping the West Coast stems from a stubborn, high-pressure system that has parked itself across the Great Basin spanning Nevada and other western states. It essentially acts as a lid trapping hot air, and there aren’t any indications it’s going to budge soon.Such phenomenons, sometimes called heat domes, are getting worse because the Earth’s climate is changing. As the planet warms, the contrast between the heat at the equator and the cold at the pole decreases. That saps the strength of the jet stream, which otherwise would be able to shove the ridges out of the way. It explains in part why extreme heat has blanketed regions around the world in recent weeks.Extreme weather has taken a profound toll on electrical grids in recent weeks. Earlier this month, millions of people lost power across the US Midwest after a wall of lightning, hail and deadly winds tore a path of ruin from central Iowa to Chicago. Days earlier, Tropical Storm Isaias darkened millions of homes from the Carolinas to Connecticut.Soaring temperatures have already shattered records across California. According to the National Weather Service, Los Angeles International Airport hit a daily record of 93 degrees, breaking a previous high of 85 set in 1994. Death Valley reached 130 degrees for the first time since 1913. If validated, the weather service said, it will go down as the hottest August temperature there ever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ten-million-californians-risk-going-dark-in-massive-blackout/story-7r5bsMGU1ihYdPvxpRouBM.html
18-08-2020||World||Canadian foreign minister resigns over differences with Trudeau||Canada’s finance Minister Bill Morneau has resigned amid a series of reports of differences between him and the country’s prime minister Justin Trudeau over the handling of the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Morneau formally announced he was leaving the post as well as the House of Commons as he told reporters during a press conference that “the right time for a new Finance Minister to deliver” on a “plan” towards recovery from the havoc caused by the impact of the coronavirus crisis. According to multiple reports, Morneau had been deeply unhappy over the deficit the Government was running in and believed that policies announced by Trudeau were not carefully considered.Morneau met Trudeau in Ottawa on Monday morning before the announcement was made later in the evening. A statement issued by Trudeau’s office said he had accepted Morneau’s resignation. The statement was laudatory about Morneau’s contribution to the Government and ignored any explanation as to why the finance Minister’s departure was precipitated.However, it did mention that Morneau “will put forward his name as a candidate to be the next secretary general of the OECD” and that “Canada will vigorously support his bid to lead this important global institution.”Speculation over Morneau ouster grew in recent days as former governor of Bank of Canada and Bank of England Mark Carney returned to Toronto from London and has been playing a role as an informal advisor to Trudeau on the plan for recovery from the economic devastation caused by Covid-19 related restrictive measures. Carney and deputy PM Chrystia Freeland are among the leading contenders to replace Morneau.During the course of his media interaction Morneau said that it had “never been” his “plan to run for more than two federal election cycles.” The 57-year-old was an MP from Toronto Center and was first elected in 2015. He was appointed Finance Minister in October 2015 and remained in that post till the resignation.Both Trudeau and Morneau have also been embroiled in the controversy over the grant of a near billion dollar contract to a charity with links to them and their families. While that contract was cancelled following the controversy it resulted in, both of them are also being investigated by the country’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner as well as a couple of Parliamentary panels.The acrimonious exit, which is likely to jolt Bay Street, Canada’s equivalent of Wall Street, and have economic repercussions given its timing, was not reflected in Trudeau statement, as he said “I want to thank Bill for everything he has done to improve the quality of life of Canadians and make our country a better and fairer place to live.

He is a profoundly decent man guided by faith,” she said.“He knows what it takes to rescue an economy, beat back a pandemic and lead our country,” the former First Lady said.“He will tell the truth, and trust science,” she said in a jab at Trump, who has been accused of repeatedly ignoring the advice of his scientific advisers on how to deal with the Covid-19 epidemic.“He will make smart plans and manage a good team,” Obama said. “And he will govern as someone who’s lived a life that the rest of us can recognize.”Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who challenged Biden for the nomination from the progressive left, was also scheduled to address the convention, which is being live-streamed.“This election is the most important in the modern history of this country,” Sanders said in remarks released ahead of his appearance.“The future of our democracy is at stake,” he said. “The future of our planet is at stake.“We must come together, defeat Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as our next president and vice president,” Sanders said. “My friends, the price of failure is just too great to imagine.” ‘Another Venezuela’ Trump flew on Air Force One meanwhile to Mankato, Minnesota, and Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and delivered remarks to supporters gathered on the airport tarmac.Speaking in Oshkosh, Trump accused Biden and his running mate Harris of seeking to enact “crazy socialist policies.”“This is the most dangerous election we’ve ever had,” Trump said. “It’ll be another Venezuela. This will be a very large-scale Venezuela if they win.”“The only way we’re going to lose this election is if the election is rigged,” he said.The Democratic convention is taking place amid a furor over Trump’s own efforts to limit mail-in voting.Insisting without proof that it fosters fraud, Trump has threatened to block extra funding that Democrats say is urgently needed to allow the US Postal Service to process millions of ballots.Democratic Party chairman Tom Perez said the convention would push back against Trump’s “assault on our democracy” by highlighting efforts to protect voting by mail.“This president can’t win on the merits and so he has to cheat. And it’s shameful,” Perez told a Washington Post webcast.Oshkosh, where Trump was speaking, is about a 90-minute drive north of the Milwaukee arena where Democrats had intended to gather in a sign of eagerness to win back Wisconsin, one of multiple Democratic strongholds which flipped to Trump in 2016.But the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed some 170,000 people in the United States, upended election campaigning.The Democratic convention and the Republican event, which begins on August 24, will be held virtually, without the usual roaring crowds and confetti.“We may be physically apart, but this week Democrats are coming together from across the nation to put forth our vision for a better America,” Biden tweeted.Live and curated content The experimental convention format will allow speakers to address American voters unfiltered -- largely shorn of the usual overwrought stagecraft and screaming delegates.Biden and Harris will address the convention live via videolink, while other speeches will be “a mix of live and curated content,” the campaign said.Biden enters the week with significant but tightening poll leads over Trump, and hoping his pick of Harris -- the first woman of color on a major party’s presidential ticket -- will invigorate Democrats.The California senator, former prosecutor and daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants is 55 and brings relatively youthful energy to the ticket.Tuesday will see addresses from former president Bill Clinton and Jill Biden, the nominee’s wife.On Wednesday, Barack Obama will speak, and Harris will have her spotlight moment before the convention culminates Thursday when Biden formally accepts the Democratic nomination and delivers his acceptance speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-president-biden-will-trust-science-says-michelle-obama-at-democratic-national-convention/story-dMLQQeUx9VPZHnuA85LMaO.html
18-08-2020||World||Donald Trump’s rule on transgender health blocked at the 11th hour||A federal judge blocked the Trump administration on Monday from enforcing a new regulation that would roll back health care protections for transgender people.Finalized days after the Supreme Court barred sex discrimination against LGBT individuals on the job, the regulation from the federal Department of Health and Human Services was to have taken effect Tuesday.Monday’s preliminary injunction from U.S. District Court Judge Frederic Block in Brooklyn bars the administration from enforcing the regulation until the case can be heard in court and decided. Block indicated he thought the Trump administration’s so-called transgender rule is invalid in light of the Supreme Court ruling in June on a case involving similar issues in the context of job discrimination.Also read: US Supreme Court rules gay and lesbian people can sue for workplace bias“When the Supreme Court announces a major decision, it seems a sensible thing to pause and reflect on the decision’s impact,” Block wrote in his order, suggesting the agency may want to reconsider. “Since HHS has been unwilling to take that path voluntarily, the court now imposes it.”The HHS health care rule was seen as a signal to President Donald Trump’s social and religious conservative supporters that the administration remained squarely behind them after the shock of the Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision, written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was nominated by Trump.“An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex,” Gorsuch wrote. “Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what (civil rights law) forbids.”In a tweet, Trump called that “horrible & politically charged” and compared it to a shotgun blast in the faces of conservative Republicans.The HHS rule sought to overturn Obama-era sex discrimination protections for transgender people in health care. Similar to the underlying issues in the job discrimination case before the Supreme Court, the health care rule rests on the idea that sex is determined by biology. The Obama-era version relied on a broader understanding shaped by a person’s inner sense of being male, female, neither or a combination.Also read: ‘Accept us for who we are’: Transgender children deprived of normal school lifeThe lawsuit against the Trump administration rule was brought by an advocacy group, the Human Rights Campaign, on behalf of two transgender women. One of the plaintiffs is an Army veteran, and the other a writer and activist.Judge Block dismissed as “disingenuous” arguments from HHS that its rule was legally valid, and he wrote that the agency acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” in enacting it.HHS said it was disappointed by the judge’s decision.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it a “victory for the LGBTQ community and the rule of law.”The judge “was unambiguous in ... ruling that the administration’s actions were in blatant violation of the Affordable Care Act’s protections and the Supreme Court’s recent ... decision, which affirmed that discrimination ‘on the basis of sex’ included sexual orientation and gender identity,” Pelosi said in a statement.Judge Block was nominated to the federal bench by former President Bill Clinton.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-rule-on-transgender-health-blocked-at-the-11th-hour/story-DdaAOZRIPFllF4DaOzxP9J.html
18-08-2020||World||Former CIA officer charged with giving China classified info||A former CIA officer and contract linguist for the FBI has been charged with spying for China, including by disclosing tradecraft and information on sources to Chinese intelligence officers who had co-opted him, according to documents unsealed Monday.Alexander Yuk Ching Ma, 67, was arrested last week after an undercover operation in which prosecutors say he accepted an envelope with $2,000 in exchange for his past espionage activities. He told a law enforcement officer who was posing as a Chinese intelligence officer that he wanted to see the “motherland” succeed, prosecutors said.Also read: Why the CIA doesn’t spy on the UAE“The trail of Chinese espionage is long and, sadly, strewn with former American intelligence officers who betrayed their colleagues, their country and its liberal democratic values to support an authoritarian communist regime,” Assistant Attorney John Demers, the Justice Department’s top national security official, said in a statement.An FBI affidavit accuses Ma, who worked for the CIA from 1982 to 1989, of revealing government secrets to at least five Chinese intelligence officers in a Hong Kong hotel room over a three-day period in March 2001. Those secrets included information about CIA sources, international operations, staffing practices and operational tradecraft.Prosecutors say Ma’s meeting with the Chinese officers included a relative and fellow CIA employee who was not named in court documents and who is not being charged because, officials say, the now 85-year-old suffers from advanced and debilitating cognitive diseases.A video recording of the hotel meeting shows the men receiving payments of $50,000 for the information they provided, the authorities said.By that point, the FBI says, Ma had become a compromised asset of China’s Ministry of State Security, which collects intelligence information of value and interest to the Chinese government — a relationship that endured for years and carried over into Ma’s next job.Ma remained in touch with the Chinese intelligence officers after he joined the FBI as a contract linguist in 2004, at which point he used his work computer to copy images of documents related to missiles and weapon system technology research. Over the next several years, he brought a digital camera into a secure FBI work area and photographed translation documents, and also stole secret records that he took with him to Asia, it was alleged.Some of Ma’s travel drew scrutiny, prosecutors said. In 2006, he returned home from Honolulu after a trip to Shanghai and was found to be carrying $20,000 and a set of golf clubs that he did not previously own.The Justice Department alleges that Ma and his co-conspirator also helped Chinese intelligence officers identify suspected human sources. At one point, according to an FBI affidavit, Ma received an email message from a Chinese intelligence contact that had as an attachment a photograph of five puppies sitting on a park bench. The FBI believes the photo was meant to prompt Ma to arrange for his former CIA colleague to provide information on five people who were suspected of being informants.The FBI undercover investigation took shape in January 2019 when an official posing as a Chinese intelligence officer met with Ma in his Honolulu office and showed him a video recording of the 2001 meeting in Hong Kong and asked for help identifying people who were present.Ma, apparently convinced that the undercover officer was an actual intelligence officer, provided the help and met again with the officer two months later, when he accepted $2,000 for his work on China’s behalf, according to court papers.He offered to do more work for China, prosecutors said, and met again last week with the undercover officer, accepting a red envelope with $2,000 and saying that he wanted “the motherland” to succeed.A naturalized U.S. citizen born in Hong Kong, Ma was charged in federal court in Honolulu with conspiring to gather and communicate national defense information for a foreign nation. He faces up to life in prison if convicted, and is due to make his first court appearance Tuesday.A phone message left for a lawyer listed as Ma’s federal defender was not immediately returned Monday.Another former CIA officer, Jerry Chun Shing Lee, was sentenced to 19 years in prison last November for an espionage conspiracy in which prosecutors say he received more than $840,000 from China to divulge the names of human sources and his knowledge of spycraft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-cia-officer-charged-with-giving-china-classified-info/story-dwb9He0djkXf2Cn8gyAtXM.html

18-08-2020||World||Virus clusters erupt at US universities as semester begins||From the dorms at North Carolina to the halls of Notre Dame, officials at universities around the US scrambled on Monday to deal with new Covid-19 clusters at the start of the fall semester, some of them linked to off-campus parties and packed clubs.At Oklahoma State in Stillwater, where a widely circulated video over the weekend showed maskless students packed into a nightclub, officials confirmed 23 coronavirus cases at an off-campus sorority house. The university placed the students living there in isolation and prohibited them from leaving.“As a student, I’m frustrated as hell,” said Ryan Novozinsky, a junior from Allentown, New Jersey, and editor of the student newspaper. “These are people I have to interact with.” And, he added, “there will be professors they interact with, starting today, that won’t be able to fight this off.” OSU has a combination of in-person and online courses, and students, staff and faculty are required to wear masks indoors and outdoors where social distancing isn’t possible.Outbreaks earlier this summer at fraternities in Washington state, California and Mississippi provided a glimpse of the challenges school officials face in keeping the virus from spreading on campuses where young people eat, live, study — and party — in close quarters.The virus has been blamed for over 170,000 deaths and 5.4 million confirmed infections in the US.A cluster of Covid-19 cases in a dorm was announced Sunday by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The disclosure marked the fourth such outbreak since the semester began Aug. 10 at the state’s flagship public university campus. The three others were at a dorm, private student housing and a fraternity house.A faculty committee that advises the administration was scheduled to meet Monday to discuss the situation. The head of the panel warned that the school may have to rethink its decision to hold classes on campus.“We knew there would be positive cases on our campus. But clusters, five or more people that are connected in one place, are a different story,” Mimi Chapman wrote to the university system’s board of governors. “The presence of clusters should be triggering reconsideration of residential, in-person learning.” The University of Notre Dame reported 58 confirmed cases since students returned to the South Bend, Indiana, campus in early August. At least two off-campus parties over a week ago have been identified as sources, school officials said.At the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, where some in-person classes began Monday, school and county health officials announced over the weekend that they are trying to identify people who may been exposed to Covid-19 earlier this month from members of a fraternity and a sorority.In Alabama, officials were frustrated by scenes of crowded entertainment districts and bars on the first weekend many students returned to campus at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa. Mayor Walt Maddox warned that such behavior could put the treasured football season in danger.“If you don’t want to protect yourself and you don’t want to protect your family and you don’t want to protect your friends and thousands of jobs, maybe, just maybe, you would want to protect football season so we can have it this fall,” Maddox said in an interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virus-clusters-erupt-at-us-universities-as-semester-begins/story-xgM45axzDixLKPgfEzKv0N.html
18-08-2020||World||Israeli forces shoot, wound deaf Palestinian at checkpoint||Israeli security guards on Monday shot and wounded a Palestinian who is deaf and couldn’t hear their commands to stop at a West Bank checkpoint, police said, while a suspected Palestinian attacker was shot and killed in a separate incident in Jerusalem.Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the 60-year-old man was walking in an area of the Qalandia Crossing north of Jerusalem where only vehicles are permitted. Rosenfeld said security guards called upon the man to stop but he continued to “approach them suspiciously.” They then opened fire toward his legs, moderately wounding him. Only after did the guards discover that the suspect did not respond because he “cannot hear or communicate,” Rosenfeld said.Rosenfeld said later Monday that a guard involved in the shooting was detained as part of an investigation into the incident.The incident comes less than three months after Israeli police shot and killed a 32-year-old Palestinian with severe autism. Israeli border police forces chased the man into a nook in Jerusalem’s Old City and fatally shot him as he cowered next to a garbage bin after apparently being mistaken for an attacker.The shooting sparked criticism and calls for police to amend their open fire guidelines to take into consideration those with disabilities.Later on Monday, police said one person was lightly wounded in a suspected stabbing attack in Jerusalem’s Old City. Rosenfeld said the alleged attacker was shot and killed.In recent years, lone Palestinian attackers have carried out a series of stabbings, shootings and car-rammings. But Palestinians and Israeli rights groups say Israeli forces often use excessive force and at times kill suspected attackers who could have been arrested.Heba Yazbak, an Israeli lawmaker of Palestinian origin, said Monday’s incident at the crossing exposed trigger-happy Israeli forces.“First they shoot and then they check,” she said. “The shooting of an innocent deaf Palestinian is just another example of the ease in which Israeli security forces can harm human life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-forces-shoot-wound-deaf-palestinian-at-checkpoint/story-xW9TzZKmf09ZOxLnojTfZJ.html
18-08-2020||World||Google fights ‘pay for news’ plan with threat to Oz users||US technology giant Google went on the offensive on Monday against an Australian plan forcing digital giants to pay for news content, telling users their personal data would be “at risk”.Australia announced last month that firms such as Google and Facebook would have to pay news media for content.The measures will include fines worth millions of dollars for non-compliance and force transparency around the algorithms that the firms use to rank content.Google is fighting a rearguard action to prevent the measures from kicking in - and been accused by Australia of spreading “misinformation”. On Monday, it told users in a new homepage pop-up that “the way Aussies use Google is at risk” and their search experience “will be hurt” by the changes.Google, in an open letter, claimed it would be forced to hand over users’ search data to news media companies and give them information that would “help them artificially inflate their ranking” above other websites. Google says it already partners with Australian news media by paying them millions of dollars each year, suggesting the changes could put its free services “at risk”.“Rather than encouraging these types of partnerships, the law is set up to give big media companies special treatment and to encourage them to make enormous and unreasonable demands that would put our free services at risk,” the letter states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-fights-pay-for-news-plan-with-threat-to-oz-users/story-VYHnRYINFbB5EmCvgQPGPP.html
18-08-2020||World||National security US’ excuse to bring down non-American firms, alleges China||The US has been using national security as an excuse to bring down non-American companies, China said on Monday.“TikTok has met almost all US demands, but still cannot be spared. Such bullying practice deviates from international trade rules and fair competition. It will also hurt US’ own interests,” Chinese Foreign Ministry said.US President Donald Trump issued an executive order on August 14, requiring ByteDance to divest its interests in video-sharing app TikTok’s operations in the US within 90 days.“There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that ByteDance ... might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States,” the US President said in the order.The new order came after an earlier executive order was signed by Trump. The previous order could have forced US-based app stores to stop distributing the TikTok app if ByteDance did not reach a deal to divest from it in 45 days.Under the latest order, ByteDance is expected to destroy all its copies of TikTok data attached to American users.Earlier this month, US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said that the Trump administration is “working hard” to protect Americans from the threats of “untrusted vendors” such as TikTok and WeChat, which it wants to remove from US app stores like those operated by Apple and Google.US politicians have repeatedly criticised TikTok, owned by Beijing-based startup ByteDance, of being a threat to national security because of its ties to the Chinese Communist Party.China and the US are at loggerheads on a variety of issues including Hong Kong national security law, the South China Sea, coronavirus and trade. Last month, India’s ministry of electronics and information technology (MEITY) banned 47 apps, which were variants and cloned copies of the 59 apps banned earlier in June.These banned clones include Tiktok Lite, Helo Lite, SHAREit Lite, BIGO LIVE Lite and VFY Lite.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-using-national-security-as-excuse-to-bring-down-non-american-companies-china/story-l0fqpvT6kMI8VGw16kTZOJ.html
18-08-2020||World||Kim Jong Un stirs suspense with rare meeting on mystery issue||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is convening a key ruling party body on Wednesday for the first time in eight months to address a “crucial” mystery issue. He’s got plenty of tricky situations to choose from.The state’s official Korean Central News Agency offered few clues about the gathering of the Central Committee, saying it will “discuss and decide on an issue of crucial significance in developing the Korean revolution and increasing the fighting efficiency of the Party.” It didn’t elaborate.Kim is facing difficulties on various fronts, both at home and abroad. Floods have wiped out farmland to deal another blow to the virus-hit economy, while a reported health scare earlier this year raised questions about succession. His nuclear discussions with President Donald Trump have also ground to a halt without him winning any sanctions relief, and the U.S. and South Korea this week kicked off joint military drills.“The unusual succession of party meetings in recent months -- and possibly even the lack of much North Korean activity on the foreign policy front of late, for example weapons testing -- suggest the quarantine measures and the global pandemic have had serious ramifications for the economy and the people’s living standards,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a former U.S. government analyst specializing in North Korea.North Korea has boasted that it doesn’t have any confirmed cases of Covid-19, a claim doubted by U.S. and Japanese officials. The virus brings large risk to the impoverished state, whose antiquated medical systems could be overwhelmed by a large outbreak.The meeting will be the first time the Central Committee has convened since a four-day marathon session in late December, when Kim called for a “frontal breakthrough” to build up the economy and state security. He also warned Trump that North Korea was no longer bound by his pledge to stop major missile tests.Key party meetings often lead to a shake up of cadres, which could mean new powers for his prominent sister Kim Yo Jong and a purge of those seen as falling down on the virus or the economy. At a politburo meeting last week, Kim sacked the premier he appointed a little more than a year ago, removed the southern border city of Kaesong from virus lockdown and said he would not accept foreign food aid because of the risk posed by the pandemic.North Korea has been hit by flooding since earlier this month. It has also impacted its Yongbyon nuclear facility, with waters reaching pump houses for mothballed reactors, the 38 North website said based on an analysis of satellite imagery.Kim needs to urge his officials to help boost the economy before the 75th anniversary of the ruling Workers’ Party on October 10, said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul who has advised the South Korean government over the years. Kim has promised to make great achievements at home to honor the spirit of the revolution, such as opening a huge new hospital in Pyongyang.“Kim may reshuffle his bureaucrats during the meeting in a bid to speed up the restoration of damages by the recent flood and Covid-19 before the October 10,” Yang said. “The meeting is likely to emphasize issues surrounding internal politics, mainly economy.”Kim’s decision to oust Kim Jae Ryong as premier could help deflect blame for any hardships instigated by a poor harvest. The country’s economy was already under pressure from his decision to shut borders in January due to the coronavirus, which slammed the brakes on North Korea’s miniscule legal trade. This year, it could send the economy into its biggest contraction since 1997, according to Fitch Solutions.Agricultural production is a key element of the economy, putting strain on Kim as he battles global sanctions put in place to punish the country for its nuclear and ballistic missile testing. The United Nations World Food Program, which has operations in North Korea, has said about 40% of the population is undernourished.Trump LeverageA weaker economy could decrease Kim’s leverage in nuclear negotiations that started with Trump in 2018, making it more difficult for him to achieve the sanctions relief he wanted in exchange for scaling back his nuclear weapons program. With the U.S presidential election coming up, Kim may be playing a waiting game, churning out fissile material and missiles that make his regime more of a threat for whoever wins.The announcement of another meeting came on the same day the U.S. and South Korea began a set of joint military drills, scaled down due to the virus. North Korea so far hasn’t unleashed its typical torrent of rhetoric denouncing joint drills as a prelude to nuclear war.“North Korea’s reticence on the drills thus far tracks with a drop in North Korea’s commentary and statements on foreign policy writ large since late last year,” said Lee, the former U.S. analyst. “The main reason seems to be that North Korea needs to focus on domestic issues for now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-stirs-suspense-with-rare-meeting-on-mystery-issue/story-v0QBBEXpc1htUNLOkMhk1I.html

The annual rate shows what the number would have been if continued for a year.Japanese media reported the latest drop was the worst since World War II. But the cabinet office said comparable records began in 1980. The previous worst contraction, a 17.8% drop, was in the first quarter of 2009, during the global financial crisis.The world’s third largest economy was already limping along when the virus outbreak struck in China late last year.

18-08-2020||India||Punjab CM warns against SYL, says state will burn||Chandigarh Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh warned on Tuesday that his state would burn and pose a national security threat if the Centre pushed to complete the Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal, which has been hanging fire for almost four decades because of an intractable dispute with Haryana over river water sharing.Singh made the comment at a virtual meeting with Union water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar.“If you decide to go ahead with SYL, Punjab will burn and it will become a national problem, with Haryana and Rajasthan also suffering the impact,” he said, saying the issue could destabilize a state already plagued by Sikh extremism and Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. “You have to look at the issue from the national security perspective,” he told Shekhawat, according to a Punjab government statement.Khattar said he was open to dialogue but maintained that the canal should be completed at the earliest. “We are open for dialogue and discussion on the subject but with a clear stipulation and condition that construction of SYL must be completed as per decree of the Supreme court at the earliest. Not doing so is gross injustice to the people of water deprived areas of Haryana,’’ the chief minister said.Both states stuck to their stands at the meeting convened on the directions of the Supreme Court (SC), which asked the Centre on July 28 to mediate between the two states. The two CMs described the interaction – the first such meeting between them on the SYL project – as “cordial” and agreed to talk again.“Detailed discussion was held in a positive and cordial atmosphere. Both chief ministers expressed their views in the first round of talks. Another meeting will be held in a week or so to take things forward,” Shekhawat told reporters after the meeting.The decades-old dispute over the canal, which is to carry water from Punjab to Haryana, is rooted in a disagreement over sharing of Ravi-Beas water. Haryana is seeking its “rightful” share, and Punjab is refusing to complete the canal, saying low volume of water mean it has nothing to spare. The canal is finished on the Haryana side.In its 2002 and 2004 judgments, the SC ordered the completion of the canal in Punjab. In July 2004, the Punjab assembly passed a law annulling all inter-state agreements related to the sharing of Ravi and Beas waters, including the December 1981 tripartite agreement signed by chief ministers of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan to set up the SYL canal. In November 2016, the top court struck down this law.Currently, Haryana says it receives about 1.62 million acre feet (MAF) of its share of 3.5 MAF of Ravi-Beas waters. Punjab says it was unfairly deprived of Yamuna river water when the state was reorganized in 1966 to create Haryana. At the meeting, Singh argued for a tribunal to adjudicate water availability and said availability of Ravi-Beas water decreased from 17.17 MAF in 1981 to 13.38 MAF in 2013. “Trans-basin transfer of water can only be allowed from a surplus basis to a deficit basis, and, as of today, Punjab is a deficit state and could not therefore be asked to transfer water to Haryana…why would I not agree to give water if we had it,” he asked.Khattar said Punjab should build infrastructure capacity to harness river water. “There is clear evidence that surplus, un-channelized water from Ravi, Sutlej and Beas has been flowing to Pakistan for the last 10 years resulting in colossal national waste. In fact, Central Water Commission (CWC) quantified this flow from Ravi river at 0.58 MAF, advocating construction of a second Ravi Beas link at Dharamkot…such surplus water can be harnessed for drinking water starved areas of south Haryana and for ground water recharge instead of allowing it to flow to Pakistan,’’ the Haryana CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-warns-against-syl-says-state-will-burn/story-z3f8Bg7Z1eYUmFXVXsoI0J.html
18-08-2020||India||Handling border dispute part of Xi Jinping’s doctrine: China||: Properly handling the boundary dispute with India but safeguarding China’s territorial integrity is part of President Xi Jinping’s blueprint for Beijing’s “major country” diplomacy, the Chinese foreign ministry has said.In an analysis of “Xi Jinping on Governance and Politics”, the ministry indicated that maintaining peace and tranquillity along the boundary with India is as important as stabilising the “maritime situation” in the South China Sea (SCS), where Beijing is entangled in disputes with multiple littoral states over the ownership of islands, reefs and the surrounding seas.The analysis by the ministry also hailed the “new model” of informal meetings between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Xi.There was no mention of the ongoing friction with India along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, which has plunged bilateral ties to the worst low in decades. The ministry, quoting Xi, said China will “resolutely” safeguard China’s “…sovereignty, territorial integrity, and maritime rights and interests, steadily advance the consultation process of the ‘Code of Conduct in the South China Sea’, stabilise the maritime situation, properly handle border disputes between China and India, and maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas.”Published by the Chinese foreign ministry’s Communist Party Committee in Mandarin in the party mouthpiece, People’s Daily, the analysis claimed that China’s relations with “regional powers” like India have improved.“Relations with neighbouring countries continue to improve. For regional powers, the leaders of China and India have created a new model of bilateral exchanges at annual informal meetings, leading the two countries to deepen strategic mutual trust, properly manage differences, and stably develop bilateral relations,” the analysis said.It was referring to the two informal summits between Modi and Xi held in Wuhan in 2018 and in Chennai in 2019.The Chinese government analysis avoided referring to the ongoing discussions between India and China to resolve stalemate in the troop disengagement process in eastern Ladakh.India has rejected China’s contention that disengagement has been completed at most locations along their disputed border, and called on Beijing to work sincerely for complete de-escalation and full restoration of peace along the LAC.The new analysis comes a week after the foreign ministry said in a statement that maintaining peace along the disputed boundary and deepening strategic trust with India is one of China’s diplomatic priorities.“For the China-India relationship, the two sides should jointly safeguard peace and security in the border areas and maintain a steady and sound development of bilateral ties,” spokesperson Zhao Lijian had said. Responding to a query about China’s future diplomatic priorities as the Covid-19 pandemic impacts the world, Zhao was briefly outlining Beijing’s plans for the way ahead in bilateral ties with the US, Russia, EU, Japan, and India.The current analysis also looked at Beijing’s ties with the US, Russia, the European Union, Japan, South Korea besides Latin America, Africa and Central Asian countries.The ministry said that since the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, held in October 2017, Xi had travelled for 215,000km and visited 27 countries.“In the direction of Northeast Asia, General Secretary Xi Jinping made a historic visit to North Korea. The top leaders of China and North Korea met five times,” it said.In context of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, China, under Xi’s guidance as per the ministry, provided or is providing medical material assistance to more than 150 countries and international and regional organisations, and has sent 32 medical expert teams to 30 countries.Last month, the Chinese foreign ministry inaugurated the Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy research centre, which aims to coordinate resources to conduct “comprehensive, systematic, and in-depth study, interpretation, and promotion of Xi’s thinking”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/handling-border-dispute-part-of-xi-jinping-s-doctrine-china/story-zFAg1zIG1R9dUXU3iHvcgL.html
18-08-2020||India||SC reserves order on petition over final-yr exams in varsities||New Delhi The Supreme Court on Tuesday reserved its verdict on a decision by the University Grants Commission (UGC), the higher education regulator, to hold examinations for final-year students across 900 universities in the country by the end of next month even as the nation battles the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The UGC on July 6 directed all colleges to conduct tests either online/offline or through a mix of both modes before September 30. The decision was opposed by some students and teachers who demanded cancellation of the examinations and award of degrees on the basis of an internal assessment. With some states objecting to the holding of examinations amid the Covid-19 pandemic and others like Maharashtra and Delhi ordering an outright cancellation of examinations for final year students, a three-judge bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan was asked to determine whether the states will have power under the National Disaster Management Act (NDMA) to defy a UGC directive. In other words, given the current situation, the court has to decide whether the UGC Act will prevail over the NDMA or the vice versa. Students in this case were represented by top lawyers Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Shyam Divan. Maharashtra and Delhi were represented by legal heavyweights Arvind Datar and KV Vishwanathan to lay down the edifice for a legal challenge to UGC’s defence of its July 6 directive, argued by solicitor general Tushar Mehta. Additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju put forth the case of the Centre while senior advocate PS Narasimha supported the Centre by representing a bunch of students in favour of holding the examinations. Objections posed by the petitioners were both factual and legal. Singhvi stated that conditions prevailing across the country were not uniform for the UGC to lay down a “one-size-fits-all” decision to hold examinations. Moreover, he said the lockdown enforced on account of the Covid-19 pandemic had imposed severe restrictions on communication, transportation across cities and even within a town. To conduct an online examination in such a scenario is impossible as many students have returned to their hometowns situated in rural pockets where internet connectivity and digital infrastructure remains a challenge. On Tuesday, senior advocate Datar put forth the Maharashtra government’s submissions that holding of examinations was the prerogative of the states and not the Centre. Maharashtra has 13 state universities and most colleges and hostels have been converted into Covid testing centres or quarantine facilities. Further, no university or state authority was consulted by UGC’s team of experts, which lacked a medical or health expert, Datar said. The Delhi government argued that holding examinations only for final year students was discriminatory as students of other semesters/years were being assessed internally based on their past performance. Odisha and West Bengal also opposed the UGC’s decision to hold examinations before September 30. Datar gave the example of the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) which have suspended their final semester examinations. He said it was possible to award degrees to students based on their past semester scores and internal assessment based on the final semester, which is already over. One aspect troubled the bench after it heard all sides. “Can states say they won’t conduct examinations. This affects standards of education which comes under the domain of UGC. It is the UGC which has fixed standards of holding examinations. Can the universities be permitted to dilute this? Then every university will evolve a different system of passing students,” observed the bench, also comprising Justices R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah. Solicitor general Mehta responded to the petitioners by stating that the matter should not be seen as a “Centre versus State superiority” as there is no question of the statutory supremacy of the NDMA. But he maintained that once the UGC, being a Central authority, directs that examinations be held, the State Disaster Management Authority cannot override||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-reserves-order-on-petition-over-final-yr-exams-in-varsities/story-nPeYXqJXAWZFGoXSwE7SoJ.html

He is also the co-promoter of Sunburn, the biggest dance music festival that returned to Goa last year with the ‘Sunburn Klassique’ avatar in December.Among those arrested at the party was Kapil Jhaveri, a Bollywood actor who the police say is the main accused in the case as he had organized the party. A few foreigners were also among the arrested. The seized drugs included cocaine, MDMA, charas, etc.Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday clarified that a photograph circulating on social media of him being greeted by Jhaveri was only a courtesy visit. “The picture may have been of a courtesy call last year by Kapil Jhaveri after the Chief Minister had taken over. A large number of persons had called on the CM then,” the Chief Minister’s Office said in a statement. It said the government has a zero tolerance to drug trafficking.“The chief minister in a tweet had complimented the police for their swift action in cracking down on this illicit drug trafficking. The action of the Goa Police is a manifestation of the Government’s resolve to end the menace of drug trafficking in the state,” the statement said. The state government is also collaborating with Sunburn to raise funds for the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sunburn-co-promoter-arrested-for-helping-organize-rave-party-in-goa/story-duKVhl9UumoGKmdtFfCd8M.html

18-08-2020||India||IAF deploys Tejas jets in western sector||The Indian Air Force has moved some of its Tejas light combat aircraft from their home base in Sulur in Tamil Nadu to the western sector to strengthen its operational readiness against Pakistan amid border tensions with China in eastern Ladakh, people familiar with the developments said on Tuesday. The IAF had earlier moved some of its frontline fighters such as Sukhoi-30s and upgraded MiG-29s to the Ladakh sector from other bases as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region where heightened tensions between India and China have upset the bilateral relationship, they said. In July, defence minister Rajnath Singh had asked the IAF to be prepared for any eventuality, saying the rapid deployment of aerial assets at forward locations in eastern Ladakh had sent a strong message to the adversary. IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria then said his force was poised to counter any aggressive action by the adversary. The IAF has so far ordered 40 LCAs split in the initial operational clearance (IOC) version and the more advanced and final operational clearance (FOC) configuration. The Tejas jets moved to the western sector are from the first LCA squadron consisting of IOC aircraft. The IAF’s first Tejas squadron was raised at the Sulur air base in 2016 with two aircraft and more planes joined the fleet progressively. The raising of the second LCA squadron in Sulur began this May. The Tejas LCA jets from Sulur had taken part in Gaganshakti-2018 exercise that sought to test the IAF’s readiness and stamina for a two-front war with China and Pakistan. In March, the defence ministry gave a green light for the purchase of 83 LCA Mk-1A advanced Tejas jets from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. The deal worth Rs 38,000 crore is expected to be signed by the year-end. The LCA Mk-1A will come with additional improvements over the FOC aircraft, making it the most advanced Tejas variant so far. The Mk-1A variant is expected to come with digital radar warning receivers, external self-protection jammer pods, active electronically scanned array radar, advanced beyond-visual-range missiles and significantly improved maintainability. HAL is expected to deliver the first Mk-1A jet to the IAF three years after the deal is signed....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-deploys-tejas-jets-in-western-sector/story-h0uaVeb7TZdfi4loi95YAP.html

People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Shringla had carried a personal message from PM Modi which he handed over during a one-on-one meeting with Sheikh Hasina at her official residence on Tuesday afternoon.The Bangladeshi premier “greatly appreciated” PM Modi’s gesture of sending a senior official to “touch base, convey his message and see how the two sides could take their relationship forward”, said one of the people cited above. The people described the meeting as “excellent” and said the issues discussed were enhancing connectivity, revival of the economy in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, cooperation on countering the virus, including joint work on therapeutics and a vaccine, and the joint commemoration of “Mujib Barsho” or the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founder of Bangladesh and the father of Hasina.There was a proposal to convene a virtual meeting of the joint consultative commission at the level of the foreign ministers to oversee the relationship, especially bilateral projects. A proposal for creating a travel bubble for business, official and medical travel was also discussed, the people said.Security-related issues of mutual interest also came up at the meeting, and Sheikh Hasina spoke about the issue of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar and their possible safe repatriation, the people added. Bangladesh has called on India several times in recent years to use its influence with Myanmar to facilitate the repatriation of Rohingya refugees. Bangladesh currently hosts almost one million Rohingya, who fled a crackdown by the Myanmar military.This is Shringla’s first trip abroad since the Covid-19 outbreak. It is also the first visit to Bangladesh by a senior Indian official since travel restrictions were put in place due to the pandemic.On the Bangladeshi side, Hasina has not met anyone from abroad in the past few months. She has also held meetings with very few people within the country. Harsh Shringla, who earlier served as the Indian envoy in Dhaka, is also expected to meet foreign minister AK Abdul Momen and minister of state for foreign affairs Shahriar Alam. He will meet foreign secretary Masud Bin Momen on Wednesday.Also Read: Sheikh Hasina at helm, India-Bangladesh economic cooperation sets a new milestoneThe visit comes at a time when India is shoring up relations with key neighbours amid a dragging border standoff with China. In recent weeks, India has unveiled a $750-million aid package for the Maldives, extended a $400-million currency swap facility to Sri Lanka and handed over 10 railway locomotives to Bangladesh as part of efforts to strengthen connectivity.Hasina expressed her gratefulness for the supply of the locomotives, the people said. Foreign secretary Momen told the media in Dhaka that he intends to discuss the conducting of trials in Bangladesh of a Covid-19 vaccine expected to be produced by India.The Serum Institute of India plans to produce the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine if ongoing trials are successful. Momen said he will make an offer to Shringla about conducting trials for the vaccine in Bangladesh when they meet on Wednesday. He said a similar offer had already been made to Britain’s AstraZeneca.The Oxford University vaccine is seen as one of the most advanced and promising in the world, and has entered its third phase of trials, during which it is being tested on thousands of volunteers.“Different producers in India are dealing with the commercial side of the vaccine. We have been discussing with everyone about the availability of probable Covid-19 vaccines…so we will also discuss it with the Indian side,” Momen said.Shringla’s visit also comes against the backdrop of reports that China is set to provide a loan of nearly $1 billion to Bangladesh for a project to maintain the level of the Teesta river during the dry season. Reports have cited Bangladeshi officials as saying that China has agreed to finance the Teesta river comprehensive management and restoration project. Ties between the two sides have been under strain since last year, when Bangladeshi leaders were irked by comments from BJP leaders about deporting illegal migrants from Assam. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the implementation of the National Register of Citizens also hit ties. Bangladesh PM Hasina had questioned the need for CAA during an interview earlier this year. Hasina visited India last October, while Modi’s planned visit to Bangladesh in March to participate in events marking the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was called off due to the pandemic. The two leaders have spoken on phone several times this year, most recently in May.After taking over as foreign secretary in January, Shringla visited Dhaka in March. Shringla had met Hasina during his last visit to Bangladesh. Bangladesh foreign minister Momen recently described bilateral ties as “rock solid” and said they couldn’t be compared with the relations with China. “We must not compare the relationships...our ties with India are historic, rock solid. It is a blood relation, while economic issues mainly [determine] our relations with China,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-mission-dhaka-foreign-secretary-hands-over-pm-modi-s-message-to-sheikh-hasina/story-bBS1u6ZJsz8rfn7jysGQrJ.html

The worst-affected state in the country had crossed the six lakh-mark a day earlier. With ever-increasing infections, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray appealed to people to follow Covid-19 guidelines during the forthcoming Ganeshotsav festival. There are 615,477 Covid-19 positive cases now including 1,56,608 active cases, according to the state health department. With 422 more deaths reported on Tuesday, the toll has risen to 20,687. With 9,356 patients declared cured of the coronavirus disease during the day, the total number of recoveries in the state have risen to 437,870 while the number of those tested has gone up to 32, 64, 384.After crossing the grim six lakh-mark, the state has overtaken South Africa, the fifth worst-hit country globally. South Africa had 589,886 cases as on Tuesday evening, according to the website worldometers dot info. India is at number three spot with only USA and Brazil ahead of it in terms of the total number of virus cases. Maharashtra had reported its first Covid-19 case on March 9 and it took 162 days for the infections to cross the 600,000 mark. According to health experts, the main reason for continuing surge in infections is the rise in cases in semi-urban and rural areas since the easing of lockdown restrictions. “Distribution of cases started soon after the state opted for unlocking the restrictions. Before that, cases used to be reported only from urban areas but now it [infection] has spread to semi-urban and rural areas. The overall cases are also increasing in an accelerated fashion,” said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, a public health expert who heads the state government’s communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee. Meanwhile, state capital Mumbai recorded 931 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, taking its count to 1,30, 410 while the death toll rose to 7,222 with 49 more fatalities reported. Keeping in view the continuing rise in infections, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has appealed to the people to avoid crowding during the forthcoming Ganeshotsav festival and follow guidelines on the height of idols and their immersion. The festival will begin on August 22.“The forthcoming Ganeshotsav which comes against the backdrop of Covid-19 crisis should be celebrated peacefully, keeping social responsibility in mind,” Thackeray was quoted as saying in an official statement, reports PTI.He also instructed the authorities to increase testing for the disease, control test charges and ensure that test reports are made available at the earliest.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-tally-past-6-15-l-mark-cm-asks-people-to-avoid-crowding-during-ganeshotsav/story-pufrOhlC91iwL63z7e04IJ.html

He cautioned that the river might rise in days to come along its course in Bihar.Heavy discharge in the Sone river in the range of 57,000-60,000 cusec from Indrapuri barrage at Dehri is fuelling the surge in the Ganga which is also being fed heavily from north Bihar rivers like Gandak, Burhi Gandak, Bagmati, Kosi and Mahananda at different points.“Bihar is facing unprecedented discharge of water from Nepal side due to heavy rains in catchment areas of Ganga’s tributary. Sustained heavy release of water in Burhi Gandak has rendered its left embankment at Bela Chamrahi in Begusarai vulnerable. Teams of engineers along with local people are working overtime to protect it,” said water resources development minister Sanjay Kumar Jha.Lauding the role of the locals in helping the department to carry out flood fighting work, the minister said that a timely alarm from local people about a breach in the embankment at Kaluaghat on the Bagmati river had prevented the embankment from being washed away.“We have deployed an early warning system to take preventive steps on embankments,” said Jha.The minister also said that the officials failed to understand the gravity of the situation on Gandak and hence the embankments were damaged.Citing chief minister Nitish Kumar’s demand for a national-level policy on silt management, which was also taken up during PM Narendra Modi’s meeting with the chief ministers, Jha said that heavy release of silt in Ganga and its tributaries had exposed Bihar to recurring floods.“Although we have proposed a lot of measures to check silt in various rivers by resorting to heavy plantation on their banks, a national-level approach for silt management is the need of the hour,” he said.Jha said various studies carried out on the problem of silt in the Ganga basin have abundantly made it clear that the state would continue to grapple with floods until the Farakka barrage is rebuilt with new technology to deal with heavy deposit of silt in the river.“Ganga water takes around 8-9 days to reach Farakka from Patna, which earlier took three days,” said Jha.Meanwhile, rivers like Bagmati, Burhi Gandak, Khiroi and Ghagra continue to flow above the danger level at different places in Sitamarhi, Samastipur, Darbhanga and Siwan.So far, more than 81.59 lakh people in 1,312 panchayats of 130 blocks of 16 districts have been hit by the floods. The current spell of floods has claimed 25 lives across the state, the disaster management department said in a press note.The floods in Bihar have impacted Darbhanga and Muzaffarpur districts the most, with 20.61 lakh people and 19.18 lakh people affected, respectively. In East Champaran district, over 10 lakh people were hit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ganga-crosses-danger-mark-in-bihar-minister-seeks-policy-on-silt-management/story-3DaJGmXKkB8T90ehGp5GuJ.html

Last week the Malappuram district collector, police superintendent and 23 senior officials tested positive for the virus. Later, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and seven of his cabinet colleagues had gone into quarantine because they interacted closely with district officials during their visit to the crash site. Civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri had lauded the timely intervention of the local people who took more than half of the 190 passengers to hospitals.Tuesday’s spike of 1,758 cases took Kerala’s Covid-19 tally to 47,827 while six more casualties took the death toll to 176. Amid rising cases, the Kerala government has decided to strengthen surveillance but many experts said the state has to concentrate more on mitigation now.

What the Supreme Court said||The PM Cares Fund is a voluntary fund registered as a public charitable trust necessitated due to the emergent situation borne out of Covid-19 pandemic, the Supreme Court said on Tuesday, ruling that it is not open for the petitioner to question the government on the wisdom to create PM Cares Fund.Any individual or institution can contribute to PM cares. It does not get any budgetary support and no government money is credited in the PM Cares Fund.How is it different from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF)?The nature of NDRF and PM CARES Fund are entirely different. The NDRF is a statutory fund created under the Disaster Management Act (DM Act).Does PM Cares require audit by the Comptroller & Auditor General of India (CAG)?Since it is a public charitable trust with voluntary donations and does not receive any government support, no CAG audit is required.In case of NDRF, the guidelines issued by the central government as per DM Act specifically provide for audit of the NDRF by CAG.Is existence of PM Cares a bar on making contributions to NDRF?The existence of PM Cares fund is not a bar to contribute to NDRF. Any contribution, or grant of any individual or institution is not prohibited to be credited into the NDRF and it is still open for any person or institution to make contribution to the NDRF in terms of Section 46(1)(b) of the DM Act. The guidelines for administration of NDRF framed by the Centre in 2010-11 and modified in 2015-16 provide that any grant that may be made by any person or institution for the purpose of disaster management shall be credited into the NDRF.Can NDRF be used for providing assistance in the fight of Covid-19?The Centre can very well utilise NDRF for providing assistance in the fight of Covid-19 pandemic by way of releasing fund on the request of the States as per new guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/does-the-pm-caresfund-require-an-audit-by-the-cag-what-the-supreme-court-said/story-Dz3gs18ALS9uXMGk6Kuq0N.html

Last week the Customs had asked the protocol officer to furnish details of all diplomatic consignments that had arrived at the Thiruvananthapuram international airport in the past year, days after Kerala higher education minister K T Jaleel acknowledged that he had received some parcels of the Quran from the UAE consular office and that he took them to his constituency.As a local arrangement in Kerala, exemption certificates for diplomatic bags are issued by the state protocol officer after obtaining details of the goods. After the gold smuggling racket came to light with the seizure of 30 kg of yellow metal on July 5 from a bag that came in the name of an employee of the UAE consulate, Jaleel claimed that the consulate had donated copies of Quran and he took them to his constituency in Malappuram. He also said the consular office had arranged free food kits during Ramzan which he distributed in his constituency.“Many questions remain unanswered. We are not ready to go by the version that the consignment carried only holy books. We need more clarifications. Who cleared this, exact contents and where these boxes were taken? We will have to question many including the minister,” said a senior official who is part of the multi-agency probe.He also said the protocol officer’s explanation was not convincing. Jaleel, under quarantine after the Kozhikode air tragedy, said he was not worried and was ready for any probe. “Out of 31 packets came only one packet was opened. Rest are lying idle in two religious places in my constituency. Let any agency probe, my hands are clean,” the minister said in a Facebook post criticising what he called a media trial. But former diplomats and others said no country usually exports religious books and special permission was needed for such imports.During the investigation the Customs found that a heavy consignment had come on March 4 in 31 bags weighing more than 4,000 kg and they were taken to Malappuram. Jaleel later said he took these packets to his constituency. The Opposition Congress and BJP alleged that some consignments carried gold and Jaleel was aware of the smuggling activity. The minister acknowledged that he took holy books to his constituency a week after Customs questioned employees and a driver of the C-Apt (Kerala Centre for Advanced Printing and Training), a government body under Jaleel’s ministry Jaleel came under a cloud after his name figured prominently in the call list of Swapna Suresh, the second accused in the gold smuggling racket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-probe-no-exemption-certificate-issued-for-baggage-from-uae-says-protocol-officer/story-Ri3PKVND8Z9EQ2BrRtz8oN.html
18-08-2020||India||Top naval commanders to meet amid border row with China||India’s top naval commanders will discuss important operational issues during a three-day conference in New Delhi from August 19 amid the ongoing border tensions with China in the Ladakh sector, a navy official said on Tuesday. Defence minister Rajnath Singh will address the navy brass on the opening day of the conference. The navy has been on an operational alert in the Indian Ocean region (IOR) where scores of warships are ready for any task in the aftermath of the border row. It has stepped up surveillance and activities in the IOR, which, it believes, China will inevitably try to enter in its quest to become a global power, just as it has laid claim to large portions of the disputed South China Sea, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 29. The commanders’ conference, to be chaired by navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh, assumes greater significance against the backdrop of recent events along India’s northern borders as well as the unprecedented challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, a navy spokesperson said. “It would provide the higher naval leadership a forum to discuss conduct of operations, sustenance and maintenance of assets, procurement, infrastructure development and human resource management issues within the ambit of the new normal established by the pandemic,” the spokesperson said. “A commanders’ conference is important at any time, but this one might especially look at various matters that the navy’s commanders would carefully consider in the backdrop of China’s growing belligerent attitude,” said maritime affairs expert Rear Admiral Sudarshan Shrikhande (retd). The commanders will also discuss ways to optimise joint planning, tri-service synergy, operational readiness and functional reorganisation within the navy to enhance efficiency, the spokesperson said. Deliberations will also cover larger security imperatives in the Indo-Pacific region, he said. The navy has deployed warships along critical sea lanes of communications and choke points in the Indian Ocean region under its mission-based deployment model and the vessels can be diverted for any mission. Indian warships are deployed across a large expanse from the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait and northern Bay of Bengal to the southeast coast of Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-naval-commanders-to-meet-amid-border-row-with-china/story-P1TIYuXU9R9s7WxfVhpvJP.html
18-08-2020||India||Railways to deploy ‘Ninja UAVs’ for surveillance||Indian Railways has started deploying “Ninja UAVs” (unmanned aerial vehicles) for establishing a drone-based surveillance system in a bid to intensify its security mechanism across its network, according to officials aware of the development. NINJA UAVs are lightweight and economical micro contraptions built for mapping and surveillance. Drone beats have been designed based on railway assets, the sensitivity of the area, and its criminal infestation, the officials said. “Drone surveillance technology has emerged as an important and cost-effective tool for security surveillance over large areas with limited manpower. On a pilot basis, we have started with the Mumbai Division of Central Railway (CR). We have recently procured two Ninja UAVs for better security and surveillance in areas such as station premises, railway tracks, yards, workshops, etc. A team of four staff of RPF (Railway Protection Force), Mumbai, has been trained for flying drones, surveillance, and maintenance. These drones are capable of real-time tracking, video streaming and can also be operated on an automatic fail-safe mode,” said an official. A drone camera can cover a large area, which may require up 10 RPF personnel. The exercise may lead to a substantial improvement in utilisation of scarce manpower, said a note on drone surveillance issued by the ministry. “Drone acts as an ‘eye in the sky’ and monitor an entire stretch. If any suspicious suspicious activity is noticed, it can be intimated to the nearest RPF post or division to apprehend a criminal. A similar incident recently occurred at Wadibunder Yard, when a criminal was found to be trying to steal from a stationary railway coach,” the note added. RPF has planned extensive use of drones for railway security across its zones. At present, nine drones have been procured by RPF at a cost of Rs 31.87 lakh for South Eastern Railway (SER), CE, and South Western Railway (SWR) zones and Modern Coaching Factory, Raebareili. Plans are afoot to buy 17 mores drones in the near future at a cost of Rs 97.52 lakh. “Drone deployment can be a force multiplier for security personnel. Drones can help in the inspection of railway assets and safety of yards, workshops, car sheds, etc. Drones can also be used to launch surveillance on criminal and anti-social activities such as gambling, random throwing of garbage, hawking, among others, in railway premises,” the note said. Drones can be deployed for data collection analysis and may prove to be useful in vulnerable sections for safe operations of trains. “Drones may be pressed into service at disaster sites for helping in rescue, recovery, and restoration operations and coordinating of efforts of various agencies. Drones can be useful while undertaking mapping of railway assets to assess the encroachments on railway properties. During largescale crowd management efforts, drones may give vital inputs such as the magnitude of a gathering, probable time of arrival and dispersal based on which such an exercise can be planned and executed. Drones were also used to enforce lockdown restrictions and monitor the movement of migrants back to their native places following the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak,” the note stated. So far, RPF authorities have trained 19 of their personnel in the operation and maintenance of drones. Of the 19 RPF staff, four have received licences for flying drones and another six are undergoing training for a similar exercise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-to-deploy-ninja-uavs-for-surveillance/story-hEmNXDcGOj5jjVZbz91ZUM.html

The cub’s mother, tigress MT-2 was found dead on August 3 and its sibling is still missing. Forest officials said they fear the second cub has also died. The loss of two adults and two cubs in less than a month has put a question mark over conservation efforts at Rajasthan’s third tiger reserve even as member of National Tiger Conservation Committee in Lok Sabha, Diya Kumari, wrote to Union forest minister Prakash Javedkar to take proper measures for conservation and promotion of tigers in Rajasthan. Forest officials said tiger MT-3 was unable to move for several days and died on July 23. The carcass of tigress MT-2 was found on August 3, 48 hours after the big cat had died. Tiger MT-3 died on July 23 because of multiple organ failure, according to the report from Indian Veterinary Research Institute in Bareilly (Uttar Pradesh). The post mortem report of MT-2 ruled out poisoning as cause of death. The ailing male cub of MT-2 succumbed on Tuesday. The cub, forest officials said, was in septicemic shock after witnessing fierce a territorial fight between it smother MT-1 and another tiger MT-2. “The cub was around 5-6 months old,” MHTR deputy conservator of forest Biju Joy said The DCF said hemoglobin count of the cub was found to be low in the blood test a few days ago. “The autopsy is being done by medical board as per the protocols of the NTCA (National Tiger Conservation Authority),” Joy said. A team of three veterinary doctors were looking after the cub and it had showed signs of recovery a few days ago. “The cub was kept in an air-conditioned and sanitized ICU room at the zoo. A special diet was brought from Jodhpur for it,” the DCF said. He said the cub also got meningitis and its ears were treated for injury. Meanwhile, Diya Kumari, the BJP MP from Rajsamand, claimed that the forest department tried to treat MT-3 locally instead of calling experts. “This led to its death,” she said in the letter to Javadekar. “Condition of tigers in other sanctuary areas of the state, Ranthambore, Sariska, Sajjangarh, Nahargarh, etc., is also in a dire state,” she added. She requested the forest minister to issue necessary guidelines to the state government to investigate the causes of recent tiger deaths so that such incidents do not recur. Earlier, the state government cracked the whip on the forest department officials after death of two tigers. Two IFS officers – chief conservator of forest (CCF) Anand Mohan and DCF T Mohanraj – were removed and kept under awaiting posting order (APO); two others, assistant conservator of forest Rajesh Kumar Sharma and ranger Makkhan Lal Sharma, were suspended on the charges of negligence in discharge of government duty. The state government also set up an administrative enquiry to enquire into the circumstances that led to the deaths and to establish laxity on part of any officers/ staff if any, and fix responsibility accordingly; and to review the existing systems of management in the tiger reserve including monitoring protocols, identify lacunae if any and suggest ways to improve and strengthen facilities and systems. Mukundra Hills was declared a tiger reserve in 2013 with portions of wildlife sanctuaries of Kota, Bundi, Jhalawar and Chittorgarh. It is spread across 759 square kilometer area and is now left with two adult tigers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tiger-cub-injured-in-mukundra-reserve-dies-in-kota-zoo-missing-sibling-feared-dead/story-90pLnpWxtMMYrWkxw2lWIP.html
18-08-2020||India||‘Punjab will burn’: Amarinder Singh urges Centre to be cautious on SYL Canal issue||Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday urged the Centre to look at the contentious Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) Canal issue from the national security perspective. His remarks came after a meeting, convened by the Jal Shakti ministry, to discuss the issue. It was also attended by the Haryana CM and Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat. “You have to look at the issue from the national security perspective. If you decide to go ahead with Sutlej Yamuna Link, Punjab will burn and it’ll become a national problem, with Haryana and Rajasthan also suffering from the impact,” Singh was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The meeting, held through video conferencing, followed the Supreme Court’s direction to the Centre on July 28 to mediate between the two states to discuss the completion of the SYL Canal which has been in the works for many decades.. The Punjab CM has sought complete share of water for his state from the total resources available, including from river Yamuna.“Today there was a meeting between Haryana, us and the minister of water resources. I told them that after the division of Punjab in 1966, all assets of ours were shared on a 60:40 basis, except water, because they included the water of Ravi, Beas and Sutlej but not Yamuna. I have suggested that they should include the water of Yamuna also and then divide it on a 60:40 basis,” Singh said. Haryana chief minister ML Khattar, who along with Shekhawat, joined the meeting from Delhi, said that both the CMs expressed their views on the issue and a second round of talks will be held soon. Haryana has stuck to its stance that its share of 3.5 million acre feet (MAF) in the Ravi and Beas waters and the completion of the canal are absolutely non-negotiable. At present, Haryana gets 1.62 MAF of Ravi and Beas waters. Punjab on the other hand is furthering an argument that the volume of water available in its rivers has drastically reduced over the years.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-will-burn-amarinder-singh-urges-centre-to-be-cautious-on-syl-canal-issue/story-lCafmibP00XgoovVsraI7M.html
18-08-2020||India||Telangana govt’s ban on Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations faces stiff resistance||The Telangana government’s decision to ban Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations commencing August 22 in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic has run into stiff opposition from the festival committees and Bharatiya Janata Party. A day after the state government announced that no permission would be given for public celebration of the festival by erecting Lord Ganesha mandaps (pandals) in every street of the city as was the practice in the past, the Bhagya Nagar Ganesh Utsav Samithi on Tuesday opposed the decision. State minister Talasani Srinivasa Yadav appealed to the people in general and youth associations in particular not to erect Ganesh mandaps but confine the celebrations to their respective homes in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.Hyderabad commissioner of police Anjani Kumar also announced that no idol installation or any event would be held at public places and asked the people to perform Ganesh puja at home. However, Bhagyanagar Ganesh Utsav Samithi general secretary Dr Bhagwanth Rao insisted that Ganesh mandaps could be erected in apartments, gated communities, function halls and bastis (colonies). “There is no need to take any permission from the police for installation of the idols, but mere intimation to the local police station is enough,“ he said and asked home minister Mohd Mahmud Ali to communicate the message to all the police stations. Rao, however, appealed to devotees to strictly follow the Covid-19 guidelines at the pandals. “At any point of time, not more than five persons would be present at the mandap maintaining social distance. Use of masks and sanitisers is a must,” he said. The Samithi also resisted the state government’s proposal to ban the Ganesh Nimajjan (immersion of Lord Ganesha idols) processions this year. The centralised immersion procession of Lord Ganesha at the end of 11-day festivities is one of the biggest annual events of the city and draws thousands of visitors. The government had been making massive arrangements for the centralised Ganesh Nimajjan procession up to Hussain Sagar lake every year, but due to Covid-19 pandemic, it has advised the organisers to restrict the programme to local areas. However, Rao said a decision would be taken on Ganesh immersion procession only after ascertaining the number of Ganesh idols installed in the city. “As per the traditions, immersion has to be done only in natural waters like rivers and tanks, but not in buckets and tubs as suggested by the government,” he said. The lone BJP lawmaker from Hyderabad T Raja Singh also strongly opposed the restrictions on Ganesh festivities.“There have been reports that the Covid-19 pandemic might continue till next year. Does it mean the government suggests that we stop praying and celebrating till then?” he asked. Singh, who represents Goshamahal assembly constituency in the city, also pointed out that the restrictions on Ganesh mandaps and the number of idols would hit the idol makers and artistes hard. Accusing Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao of minority appeasement, the BJP MLA wondered why the government had allowed Eid celebrations in a big way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-govt-s-ban-on-ganesh-chaturthi-celebrations-faces-stiff-resistance/story-BGvQciZqZRUQSpPU1lsAOJ.html

BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said on Tuesday, “The Philippines government will be following the Dharavi model for containing Covid-19 in densely populated slums of Philippines.” BMC has shared the details of the Dharavi model with the Philippine government’s health department, he said.Chahal also shared a news report from Philippine Daily Inquirer . The news report reads, “The DOH declared that it would follow the successful Dharavi-Mumbai campaign conceptualised by Assistant Municipal Commissioner Kiran Dighavkar. Dharavi in India is Asia’s largest slum where the Hollywood movie “Slumdog Millionaire” was shot. It has a total population of 1 million within a 2.5-square-kilometer area. This means eight to 10 people in a 9-square-meter area.” Dharavi has seen cases in single digits for the past few days, and its curve flattened by the end of June. On Monday, Dharavi recorded four new cases, on Saturday and Sunday it had recorded five new cases each, on Friday, it had recorded nine new cases, and on Thursday, it had recorded six new cases. This is in contrast with the number of cases that were being reported in a single day in May, when cases in Dharavi peaked. On May 3, it recorded its single-day highest number of cases at 94. While the total number of Covid-19 cases in Dharavi touched 2,672, it has 80 active cases currently. The doubling rate in Dharavi is 269 days, and growth rate is 0.27%, in contrast with May when the growth rate was at its peak at 4.8%. The Dharavi model of containing the spread of Covid-19 includes testing in high numbers, moving positive patients to institutional quarantine facilities, shifting high and low risk contacts to separate quarantine facilities, and treating patients in time. BMC organised fever camps, door-to-door surveys, used private clinics and dispensaries to reach maximum number of people and detect Covid-19 early, according to Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G North administrative ward, with jurisdiction over Dharavi. Dighavkar said, “We are giving the Philippines government information on how we conducted fever camps in Dharavi, and carried out contact tracing, and organised institutional quarantining.” Over the past few weeks, Dighavkar has been flooded with calls from municipal corporations in cities of Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Kolhapur, for similar information. Chahal said, “BMC’s Chase the Virus Policy has shown the world the way to fight Covid-19, but BMC is not complacent. We will not lower our guard.” He pointed out that doubling rate in Mumbai is now 86 days, with a low infection rate of 0.8%, and a discharge rate of 81%. Mumbai has done 6.6 lakh tests. He said, “There are 17,800 active cases in Mumbai, and symptomatic patients in hospitals are 5,388 and 7,548+ Covid beds are vacant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/philippines-to-follow-dharavi-model-for-tackling-covid-19-in-slums-bmc-chief/story-PNvfCO8SELhOim9yo0teJL.html

Bank statements, income tax returns, CCTV, CDR and electronic data are with both agencies. Till today nothing incriminating has been found against her,” Maneshinde said in a statement.It said that the two actors have known each other over the past several years and started dating shortly after they attended a party in April 2019.“Even though they spent a lot of time in each other’s homes, they officially moved in together in December 2019 and lived at Mount Blanc, Bandra, till Rhea left on June 8, 2020,” the statement said.She had left after Sushant requested Rhea to live with her parents for the time being as his sister Meethu was coming to live with him from June 8 for some time on his request.“Rhea had been suffering from her own anxiety issues and often endured panic attacks. Sushant’s conduct also aggravated these conditions. Even though Rhea was desirous of seeing her family, she was not at all comfortable with leaving Sushant,” the statement said.“It is total nonsense and an afterthought to make allegations after a period of 40 days, the manner in which it has been made before Bihar Police. No allegations whatsoever were made till July 27, 2020, by anybody in the family before the Mumbai Police or to any authority,” it added.Maneshinde, in the statement, also said that the relationship between Sushant’s family and Rhea were strained after his sister Priyanka once “groped” her while drunk.“Thereafter, Rhea informed Sushant as to what had transpired and Sushant got into an argument with his sister regarding the same. That due to the aforesaid incident, the relationship between Sushant’s family and Rhea had been strained since inception,” the statement said.It said that Rhea has always maintained that she would like the truth of the matter to be revealed by virtue of a fair and impartial investigation.The statement said that the actor has admitted in her petition before the Supreme Court that she sent a message to Home Minister Amit Shah to order a CBI investigation into the matter and added that she is only challenging the illegal registration of FIR and investigation by Bihar Police without jurisdiction and the transfer of the “illegal investigation” to the CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-rajput-death-rhea-chakraborty-s-financial-transactions-clear-nothing-incriminating-says-her-lawyer/story-LBkGfIHwox4tWWr0TJaWKO.html

The IROs will be established with the redeployment of resources from 10 regional offices of ministry; three regional offices of the Forest Survey of India (FSI); three regional centres of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA); four regional offices of the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) and five regional and three sub-regional offices of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB). “With a view to achieving outcomes related to mandates of the MoEFCC in an improved, timely and effective manner, and in a bid to further enhance its outreach to stakeholders, the ministry will undertake coordinated action and optimise the utilisation of its available resources…” the notification said. These IROs will have the combined strength, including the ministry’s 319 personnel, NTCA (6), CZA (4), and WCCB (74). A regional official will head an IRO. The IROs, which will become operational from October 1, will be headquartered in Shillong; Ranchi; Bhubaneshwar; Bengaluru; Chennai; Lucknow; Bhopal; Nagpur; Chandigarh; Dehradun; Jaipur; Gandhinagar; Vijaywada; Raipur; Hyderabad; Shimla; Kolkata; Guwahati, and Jammu. Besides their assigned work, the IROs will also get additional responsibilities from the MoEFCC. MoEFCC officials justified the reasons behind the integration move. “The exercise is being done for resource optimisation and increase efficiency. For example, Bengaluru had three offices, including the MoEFCC, FSI, and NTCA. There is a lot of inspection work and the area to be monitored is huge. Hence, the manpower is being redistributed,” said Sanjay Kumar, director-general (D-G), forests, MoEFCC. “In case, there is a big inspection, the integrated office will help. Similarly, for a large scale wildlife operation, or for that matter an intensive plantation exercise. This helps synchronise time, prevents cost overrun, and also comes in handy for monitoring some of the key projects,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/environment-min-creates-19-integrated-regional-offices-in-a-major-reorganisation-exercise/story-l6khQdh4poXIlnGLKnNiRL.html

The mob allegedly demolished two gates of the campus and damaged construction material that was stocked for building the wall around an open ground where an annual fair is held. The state’s only central university, of which the Prime Minister is the chancellor, named Naresh Bauri, a resident of Bolpur and TMC lawmaker from the district’s Dubrajpur constituency, in the complaint. The university also sent separate reports on the incident to the Prime Minister’s office and the Union human resource development ministry, teachers told HT. After the vandalism, the university authorities decided to close the campus temporarily. The district police started a separate suo motu case on Monday afternoon after chief minister Mamata Banerjee intervened. Eight people were arrested for the vandalism. They were produced before the Suri court on Tuesday afternoon. District police officers said that in its complaint the Visva Bharati authorities stated that the crowd went on the rampage when construction workers were in the process of setting up a wall. The complaint said that guarding the open ground was necessary to protect the environment as ordered by the National Green Tribunal last year. On Monday, Bauri claimed that he took part in the agitation as a local resident and former student of Visva Bharati and not as TMC leader. “How can Tagore’s university, which was supposed to be a part of nature, be caged behind walls. Local people will never tolerate this,” Bauri said on Monday echoing the local people. He could not be contacted on Tuesday. Held in end-December, the fair, popularly known as Poush Mela, draws thousands of people and even foreign tourists. Opposed to the wall, local people and a section of traders for whom the fair is a major source of income, had been staging demonstrations since Saturday. Bidyut Chakrabarty, the vice-chancellor, however did not budge from his decision to guard the open ground. Sunil Singh, a member of the Poush Mela Bachao Committee (save the fair committee) and one of the traders named in the complaint lodged by Visva Bharati, said, “This is a false allegation. The earthmover used to demolish the gates belongs to Visva Bharati. They did it to frame us.” Gagan Sarkar, another trader named in the complaint, alleged that Visva Bharati authorities planned the demolition. Mamata Banerjee on Monday disapproved of the wall and said, “I do not want any construction that destroys the beauty of Visva Bharati. When Rabindranath Tagore built Visva Bharati he wanted students to be in the heart of nature and study in the open. He did not want wood and cement structures.” District magistrate Moumita Godara Basu said that she will hold a meeting with university authorities and local people on Wednesday and hear both sides. University students owing allegiance to the Students’ Federation of India, the student’s front of the CPI(M), staged a silent agitation outside the vice-chancellor’s office on Monday night. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused the TMC of masterminding the vandalism. “This is an example of law and order situation in Bengal. The TMC is trying to establish control over a Central university campus,” said BJP state president Dilip Ghosh. The vice-chancellor did not talk to the media on Tuesday as well. Anirban Sircar, the only designated spokesperson of Visva Bharati did not take calls either.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/visva-bharati-university-files-police-complaint-against-tmc-mla-for-vandalism-informs-pmo/story-LZ6MpAJIFP4wQwa3DcrzvJ.html

18-08-2020||India||Ashok Lavasa resigns as Election Commissioner||Election Commissioner (EC) Ashok Lavasa, who was expected to take over the poll body next year, tendered his resignation to President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday, officials close to the former Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer told HT. The 1980-batch Haryana cadre IAS officer had almost two years remaining in his tenure as EC . He would have taken over as the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) from Sunil Arora. However, his exit puts EC Sushil Chandra in the fray for the poll watchdog’s top job. Lavasa had had several stints in various government departments, including as secretary in the Union finance ministry. As CEC, Lavasa would have overseen elections in West Bengal, Manipur, Goa, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. Lavasa didn’t indicate when he’d for Manila, where he is slated to join the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in September. ADB authorities had announced on July 15 that Lavasa has been appointed as the vice-president for private sector operations and public-private partnerships (PPP). “Mr. Lavasa has a long and distinguished career in the Indian civil service. He is currently one of the Election Commissioners of India and previously served in a range of senior posts including as Union Finance Secretary of India; Union Secretary for the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change; and Union Secretary for the Ministry of Civil Aviation. He has extensive experience in public-private partnerships and infrastructure development at the state and federal levels, with deep knowledge of public policy and the role of the private sector,” ADB said in a press release issued on Wednesday. Earlier, EC officials close to Lavasa had told HT that would take up the job. “It is a prestigious assignment and he was happy to be considered,” said an official on condition of anonymity. A former poll official said the last time an EC quit was in 1973, when Nagendra Singh, the then CEC resigned to join the International Court of Justice in the Hague, the Netherlands. Singh served with the then President of India before he took over the poll body. Lavasa was one of the key dissenters, when the poll body took a call on whether or not to give a “clean chit” to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Minister for Home Affairs Amit Shah for speeches violating the model code conduct ahead of the last year’s Lok Sabha elections. Lavasa had dissented on three points against PM Modi such as for asking for votes in the name of Balakot strike, for saying that former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi had found a “minority seat” in Wayanad to contest from and that “new India gave a fitting reply to Pakistan”. He was the sole dissenter in the three-member poll body to object to the speeches. Lavasa’s family, including his wife Noel Lavasa, were subsequently under the scanner of the Income Tax Department for alleged discrepancies. The department also surveyed Nourish Organic Foods, where Lavasa’s son is a director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashok-lavasa-resigns-as-election-commissioner/story-1yCu9JlpXXQm8hekKr7qJJ.html
18-08-2020||India||Social worker, booked for obstructing shelter for migrant workers, granted anticipatory bail||The Bombay High Court on Monday granted anticipatory bail to a social worker booked for obstructing revenue officers from creating a temporary shelter for migrant workers at a school in Shirur village, Thane district, on the condition that he will contribute ₹50,000 to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.Social worker Farukh Sattar Dalvi had moved the high court after the Kasara police booked him under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code for obstructing the tehsildar from creating a temporary shelter for 80 migrant labourers who had walked from the Vasai Virar area to their hometowns.On April 5, 2020, the tehsildar of Shahapur and some other revenue staff were making preparations to create a temporary shelter at the school in Shirur, when Dalvi, along with several other persons, reached the spot and opposed the move.The tehsildar alleged that Dalvi verbally abused and threatened her with dire consequences if they continued with the work, and so she was forced to lodge a police complaint against him.The social worker had moved the high court after the district court rejected his anticipatory bail plea. He told the high court that he was apprehensive about the possible threat of exposure to the villagers from the migrant workers.“It is no doubt true that the applicant has attempted to deter the complainant from discharging her duty and, particularly when he considers himself to be a social worker, it was rather imperative on his part to assist the government agency in securing shelter for the migrants,” justice Bharati Dangre said.The judge, however, accepted that Dalvi acted on his genuine concern for the villagers and added that, “as a responsible person and a social worker, he must contribute an amount of ₹50,000 to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund to aid the State government which is grappling with an unpredicted situation and coping with a grim and stressful scenario.”The high court has granted him bail on a personal bond of ₹25,000 on the condition that he will co-operate with the investigation and visit the Kasara police station on September 2, 3 and 4. He is supposed to submit the receipt of deposit made to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund when he visits the police station on September 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/social-worker-booked-for-obstructing-shelter-for-migrant-workers-granted-anticipatory-bail/story-7PLmAkKXhtJTpJjoaHo6YM.html
18-08-2020||India||PMC Bank fraud: PMLA court asks jail authorities to shift HDIL promoter Rakesh Wadhawan to govt hospital||Mumbai: The special court set up to try cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, on Tuesday, directed jail authorities to shift Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) promoter Rakesh Wadhawan to a government-run hospital to undergo colonoscopy or endoscopy. The court has ordered that he could be admitted to a private healthcare facility, if the treatment is not available in a government-run hospital. Wadhawan, who has been suffering from multiple ailments, through his lawyers, had pleaded to transfer him to a private hospital for treatment. The plea was made after the court had refused to grant him bail. His lawyer Subir Sarkar said that the court initially, has directed the prison authorities to transfer him to a government hospital. But, he could be shifted to a private hospital, if the government-run hospital doctors recommend it. “The jail authority is directed to take accused Rakesh Wadhawan to either KEM hospital or Nair Hospital or any other government hospital for colonoscopy or endoscopy, if the procedure has not been carried out yet. If it is noticed during the treatment by the government-run hospital doctors that Wadhawan would need to be treated at a private hospital, then he could be shifted there. However, the hospital’s administrative and jail authorities’ advice will be required before he can be shifted to a private hospital,” said PP Rajvaidy, judge, special PMLA court. Wadhawan and his son Sarang have been booked by the Mumbai Police’s economic offence wing (EOW) after they had defaulted on the repayment of a loan taken from the Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank (PMC). The bank had run into acute financial troubles, as HDIL had 73% of the financial institution’s total loan exposure of Rs 8,300, which works out to around Rs 6,226 crore. They had allegedly conspired with bank officials to secure the loan without security. Soon after the EOW case, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) also had initiated a separate probe into money laundering allegations against the Wadhawans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmc-bank-fraud-pmla-court-asks-jail-authorities-to-shift-hdil-promoter-rakesh-wadhawan-to-govt-hospital/story-tOo9VczxSnoKBLImwlenGN.html

The court observed that rescuing women and children, keeping them in confinement for a period of time and then releasing them would not solve the issue of begging and the state should come up with a policy in compliance with an earlier order of the high court. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Revati Mohite Dere, while hearing the PIL filed by Dhyandeshwar Darwatkar through advocate Shekhar Jagtap, was informed that a survey of the city by a Pune NGO in 2016 had revealed that about 10,000 children were begging on the streets. Jagtap submitted that his client, an activist, had been working on eradication of begging among children and women for the past six years but there had been lack of action on the part of the state and the PMC, so begging has continued unabated.Jagtap also referred to the Prevention of Begging Act, 1959, and pointed out that the state was obliged to provide rehabilitation and reformation of persons found begging. He added that in 2016 a bench of justice A S Oka had also directed the state to frame a policy in this regard and hence, the state should be directed to do so immediately. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that as the issues raised in the petition were of extreme importance, it wanted advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni to appear for the state in the matter and also peruse the petition and respond to it on the next hearing on August 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-seeks-maha-response-to-pil-against-begging/story-7JyRhtdiZ2y7xkvMDbXfeM.html

I urge you all to take the right precautions. The Government is also closely monitoring the situation and ensuring care to those affected. Stay safe, be happy!” PM Modi tweeted. PM Modi’s tweet comes at a time when India is likely to face challenges during the dengue season, prompting state governments to prepare protocols and find ways to ease the burden on country’s healthcare infrastructure. Tropical and vector-borne diseases are caused by blood-sucking anthropoid like mosquitoes. The most commonly reported infectious tropical and vector-borne diseases in India include dengue, malaria and chikungunya. Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that spreads dengue, is most prevalent in cities, and experts have warned in the past that increased urbanisation and warming temperatures due to climate change means that its range will keep increasing.According to World Health Organization (WHO), 2019 was the worst year on record for dengue cases, with every region affected, and some countries were hit for the first time. According to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), 1,36,422 dengue cases were diagnosed in India in 2019 and an estimated 132 people died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/take-the-right-precautions-pm-modi-cautions-citizens-amid-dengue-season/story-PlLtJw4UbdF8DoEBHPEtAO.html
18-08-2020||India||Gorakhpur college to hold students’ union poll online on August 28||Lucknow: A college in Uttar Pradesh’s Gorakhpur’s will hold students’ union elections online on August 28 even as the Covid-19 pandemic has halted such activities across the country. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath-led Gorakhnath Temple Trust runs the Maharana Pratap Post-Graduate College.Dr Pradeep Rao, the college principal, said they have been holding elections annually since the institute was established in 2005 to instil values of democracy among the students. “Along with imparting quality education, the college administration is working to instil the values of democracy among the students. The office-bearers of the students’ union not only manage students’ activities but coordinate with the college administration in organising sports activities, running the library, organising cultural activities, purchasing various items, and maintaining discipline on the campus,” he said.The college is the first in Uttar Pradesh to schedule campus polls online and has constituted a technical committee of teachers to work out the modalities for them.Rao said the pandemic has forced the closure of the college but they were organising classes online. He added teachers, as well as students, did not want to discontinue the students’ union activities. “We will follow the Covid-19 protocol during the election,” he added.As per the protocol, there will be no campaigning on the campus. To maintain social distancing, the candidates have been told to contact the voters through mobile phones or WhatsApp.Rao said the college wishes to send a message to all educational institutions that while imparting quality education, they can inculcate values of democracy by holding students’ union elections.Maharana Pratap Post-Graduate College Students Union president Vijay Kumar said the elections ensure participation of students in the college activities. “The students’ union executive committee approves students’ welfare schemes, cultural activities, and sports activities on the campus. The students union election is held according to the academic calendar of the college between August 15 to 28 each year. The college has set an example for other educational institutions in the state...”Rao said all the 2,558 students of the college are registered online and attending classes.RK Rai, a retired college teacher in the Gorakhpur, said universities and colleges should promote student union activities. “A majority of political leaders in Uttar Pradesh are products of student politics. The online student’s union election by a college is an innovative and novel method of promoting students’ activities during the pandemic.” The pandemic has disrupted the electoral processes in the country. The Election Commission has only held elections to some Rajya Sabha seats, and the assembly councils of states, where voting is open to specialised electoral colleges rather than the general public, amid the pandemic. It deferred by-polls on July 24 to eight states till September 7 though the mandatory six-month period to conduct these elections has lapsed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gorakhpur-college-to-hold-students-union-poll-online-on-august-28/story-jrxplA8YghangTM8XBNTNL.html
18-08-2020||India||Facebook ‘interfering’ with India’s electoral democracy: Congress writes to Mark Zuckerberg||The Congress on Tuesday wrote to Mark Zuckerberg saying Facebook may be “a willing participant in thwarting the rights and values” its founding leaders sacrificed their lives for while calling for an inquiry into a report that last week claimed that the social media company was biased towards the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in censoring hate speech.K C Venugopal, the Congress general secretary (organisation), kept up the party’s attack in a letter to Zuckerberg over the issue. He referred to the report and said the social company provided the BJP with “favourable treatment on election-related issues”. He called it a “damning and serious allegation” that Facebook was interfering in India’s electoral democracy.The Wall Street Journal report on Friday suggested Facebook was going easy on hate speeches by BJP members and triggered a controversy. The Congress on Saturday said it had flagged similar concerns to a senior executive of the social media company named in the report.The report cited interviews with unnamed Facebook insiders and claimed the company’s senior India policy executive Ankhi Das intervened in internal content review processes to stop a ban on BJP’s Telangana lawmaker Raja Singh, whose posts targeted the Muslim community. It said Das told staff members that punishing violations by BJP politicians would damage the company’s business prospects.The Congress on Tuesday asked Zuckerberg to set up a high-level inquiry into the Facebook India leadership team and their operations. It has asked the company to make public all instances of hate speech posts since 2014 allowed on the platform. The Congress has suggested the appointment of a new team to lead the India operations till the inquiry is completed. “As India’s oldest political party that fought for the nation’s freedom and established electoral democracy through adult franchise, it is deeply disturbing to note that your company may be a willing participant in thwarting the very rights and values that our founding leaders sacrificed their lives for,” said Venugopal.HT reached out to Facebook for a comment but did not get a response immediately. The report will be updated to reflect Facebook’s response once it is received.The BJP hit out at the Congress for its demand for a Facebook inquiry. “[The] Congress party, faced with electoral irrelevance, and rejection at the hustings, wants to pin blame on everyone else except its uninspiring and unworthy leadership,” said Amit Malviya, the BJP’s national Information and technology in-charge. “Facebook is just another addition to their ‘save the Gandhis’ campaign. The Left-Congress ecosystem wants unfettered control over freedom of speech and hence, in a last roll of dice, are now trying to muzzle platforms, which have empowered ordinary citizens and made their opinions valuable. A vibrant, participative democracy is inimical to their political agenda.”The Congress on Monday attacked Facebook, saying its “inaction against hate content destabilises” democracy in India, and reiterated its demand for a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe into the charges.Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi rejected Congress’s demand for the JPC probe into the matter, saying it was out of the questionCongress leader Shashi Tharoor, who heads the parliamentary standing committee on information technology, Sunday said the panel would like to hear an explanation from the social media company about the report. The panel has been split over asking Facebook executives to explain the report.BJP lawmaker Nishikant Dubey, who is a member of the panel, on Monday said Tharoor cannot call Facebook to seek an explanation because the House rules do not allow it. He cited Rule 269 and added the secretary-general has the power to summon a witness.India is one of Facebook’s fastest-growing markets and the company was estimated to have close to 350 million users by June. Instagram and WhatsApp, both owned by the California-based company, have hundreds of millions more users from India.Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have been under increasing pressure because there are concerns that they are not doing enough to crackdown on fake news and hate speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-interfering-with-india-s-electoral-democracy-congress-writes-to-mark-zuckerberg/story-3XAeoQ04jYRbWIWT5MqrSP.html

18-08-2020||India||‘Facebook’s involvement in peddling fake, hate news needs to be questioned’: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday launched another attack over a report by a foreign publication alleging that Facebook overlooks hate speech by leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in order to protect their business prospects in India.“We cannot allow any manipulation of our hard-earned democracy through bias, fake news & hate speech. As exposed by @WSJ, Facebook’s involvement in peddling fake and hate news needs to be questioned by all Indians,” Gandhi tweeted.He also posted the letter his party has written to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, calling for a time-bound high-level probe into the allegations his company’s India team overlooked hate comments by BJP leaders.KC Venugopal, Congress’ general secretary (organisation), wrote the letter to Zuckerberg referring to the Wall Street Journal report, which alleged that Facebook’s India policy head Ankhi Das ‘provided the Bharatiya Janata Party with favourable treatment on election-related issues’. The Congress accused Facebook India of “interfering” with the country’s electoral democracy and also demanded a probe into the conduct of Facebook India leadership team, and their operations.The opposition is up in arms over allegations that Facebook, the social media company, has been lenient while censoring content that amounts to hate-speech by members of the BJP.Gandhi, who has been targeting the Centre every day over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the state of the country’s economy and the standoff with China in Ladakh, on Sunday alleged that the BJP and its ideological parent the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh control Facebook and WhatsApp in India. “They spread fake news and hatred through it and use it to influence the electorate. Finally, the American media has come out with the truth about Facebook,” Gandhi tweeted.On its part, the ruling party launched a counter attack on Gandhi and the Congress, saying it had no locus standi to question the BJP given previous allegations of opposition party having used online platforms to influence elections in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-s-involvement-in-peddling-fake-hate-news-needs-to-be-questioned-rahul-gandhi/story-HVzc31OoRufaGof6dlS5eP.html
18-08-2020||India||Kanpur police launches plasma donation drive||Kanpur police have launched a plasma donors’ group to supplement donations at the newly set up plasma bank at Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial Medical College (GSVM medical college) here. The initiative was launched in the wake of poor response to the plasma bank which received a mere five units of plasma between July 15 and August 10. “So far, 73 policemen (including 26 PAC jawans) have been infected and 42 who recovered are eligible for donation and will do so, soon,” said Dr Anil Kumar, SP, Kanpur West. “Our efforts to motivate the public seem to be working as people are now volunteering to donate plasma. Hopefully, their number will increase,” said Dr Lubna Khan, head of blood bank at GSVM medical college. “The plasma therapy is effective in moderate cases and prevents patients from going into a critical state,” she said, appealing to the public to donate plasma.As of now, only one policeman, inspector Satish Chandra Sahu, has donated plasma which helped two patients recover from the infection. Since March 23, when the first Covid-19 case was reported in a Nawabgunj residential colony, the city has added 10,107 infections and close to 6,000 people have recovered. Half of those who recovered can donate plasma as per the protocol while the rest can do so once their quarantine period is over. DIG, PAC, R L Verma said 26 jawans currently under treatment at L1 Covid-19 hospital would also be among the donors. Deputy SP Ajay Kumar, who was transferred to Faizabad last week, said,”Before leaving on new assignment, I will donate plasma at the blood bank. Everyone who has recovered should do this.” In May, Kumar had tested Covid positive and had to be put on ventilator before he beat the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanpur-police-launches-plasma-donation-drive/story-daMqFmaMUmFEFlqUxFqLWL.html
18-08-2020||India||Indian foreign secretary visits Bangladesh||Indian foreign secretary Harsh Shringla flew to Dhaka on Tuesday for a previously unannounced visit, during which he is expected to convey a special message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina, people familiar with the developments said. This is Shringla’s first trip abroad since the Covid-19 outbreak. It is also a senior Indian official’s the first visit to Bangladesh since travel restrictions were imposed due to the pandemic. Shringla, who earlier served as the Indian envoy in Dhaka, is carrying a message from Modi for Hasina, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. He is also expected to meet foreign minister AK Abdul Momen and foreign secretary Masud bin Momen. A brief statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs after Shringla arrived in Dhaka said the foreign secretary was on a visit to Bangladesh from August 18-19 to “discuss and take forward cooperation on matters of mutual interest”. Hasina visited India last October, while Modi’s planned visit to Bangladesh in March to participate in events marking the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was called off due to the pandemic. The two leaders have spoken on the phone several times this year, most recently in May. Ties between the two countries have been under some strain since last year, when Bangladeshi leaders were irked by comments from BJP leaders about deporting illegal migrants from Assam. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the implementation of the National Register of Citizens also affected ties, and Hasina had questioned the need for CAA during an interview earlier this year. India has taken several steps in recent weeks to improve connectivity with Bangladesh, including handing over 10 railway locomotives last month. This was done days after the first container train made its way from India to Bangladesh and the first shipment of goods was sent from Kolkata to Tripura via Chattogram port. After taking over as foreign secretary in January, Shringla visited Dhaka in March. Shringla had met Prime Minister Hasina during his last visit to Bangladesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-foreign-secretary-visits-bangladesh/story-fhNrqeMd5ytGYHIFb2AuuI.html
18-08-2020||India||‘Rahul Gandhi never spared any opportunity to weaken country’s resolve in Covid-19 fight’: Ravi Shankar Prasad||Union minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ravi Shankar Prasad joined party chief JP Nadda in attacking Congress leader Rahul Gandhi after the Supreme Court verdict on PM CARES fund.The apex court on Tuesday rejected a plea seeking transfer of all contributions made to PM CARES Fund till date to the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), a statutory fund created under said act.“Transparency is writ large in PM CARES Fund both in terms of legal requirement and transparent management of funds received on a voluntary basis. Our government has not faced even a single accusation of corruption,” said Prasad.He further said that Rahul Gandhi, from day 1, has used coronavirus to create disunity in the nation. “Rahul Gandhi never spared any opportunity to weaken the national resolve in the fight against Covid-19,” the minister added.Prasad once again talked about the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, which he said was being run like a family trust and funds meant for the country were diverted there.He said that many petitions were filed in various courts “by Rahul Gandhi and Congress party” against the PM CARES Fund but all such negative efforts have today been nullified.“Rahul Gandhi was against lockdown, even made fun of PM’s initiatives like lighting of diyas and banging of utensils or clapping for doctors and nurses. Today, all the countries are adopting similar measures,” said Prasad.Shortly after the verdict was announced, BJP chief JP Nadda had said that “is a resounding blow to the nefarious designs of Rahul Gandhi”.“The verdict by Supreme Court on PM CARES is a resounding blow to the nefarious designs of Rahul Gandhi & his band of ‘rent a cause’ activists. It shows that the truth shines despite the ill intent and malicious efforts of the Congress party and its associates,” Nadda said on Twitter.“Rahul Gandhi’s rants have been repeatedly dismissed by the common man who has overwhelmingly contributed to PM CARES. With the highest court also pronouncing its verdict, will Rahul & his ‘rent a cause’ activist army mend their ways or embarrass themselves further?” he said in his second tweet.A three-judge bench of the apex court on Tuesday rejected a petition by an NGO seeking transfer of contributions in PM CARES Fund to National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF). The court held that individual and organisations are free to contribute to NDRF and there is no prohibition on the same. However, PM CARES is a separate fund established as a public charitable trust and no direction can be issued to transfer funds from that to NDRF, a three-judge bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan ruled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-never-spared-any-opportunity-to-weaken-country-s-resolve-in-covid-19-fight-ravi-shankar-prasad/story-RcobrRfxDrIFMnn5loen6I.html
18-08-2020||India||Nigrani samitis: UP govt’s latest tool to increase the vigil against Covid-19||To step up the watch on Covid-19 patients in home quarantine and ensure that mass gatherings such as marriages and parties are not taking place in such areas in the state capital, the government has comprised ‘nigrani samitis’ (monitoring teams).“The city has 110 wards. We have constituted 140 mohalla nigrani samitis to keep a strict watch in their respective ward or locality. Each samiti will comprise 10 persons, including a corporater, a sanitation worker, an Asha activist and residents,” said Mukesh Meshram, the divisional commissioner of Lucknow. “Nigrani samitis will act as a bridge between the district administration/health department and patients/localities. In the present circumstances, the samitis will have a crucial role to play,” said Manish Bansal, the chief development officer (CDO) of Lucknow. The CDO further said nigrani samitis were already active in rural parts of Lucknow. “In rural pockets, the samitis are known as gram nigrani samitis. These samitis also keep tabs on Covid-19 cases in villages and maintain records of migrant labourers and patients in home quarantine,” said Bansal. There are over 100 such samitis functioning in the rural pockets of the state capital, he added. “However, the task is not as easy as it sounds,” claims a corporater from Rajiv Gandhi ward of Gomti Nagar—one of the most affected areas of Lucknow. So far, the state capital has reported more than 17,000 Covid-19 cases. Arun Tiwari, an active member of the nigrani samiti of the Rajiv Gandhi ward, Gomti Nagar, said, “Our ward has over 30 active Covid-19 cases at present. It’s difficult to monitor people as most do not admit to feeling ill. We often have to use our own sources to gather reliable information to keep the administration and health officials informed.” Meanwhile, Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) officials said the first task of the monitoring teams is to develop sources in the neighbourhood of Covid-19 patients to check that they stay indoors and do not venture out, which is also an offence. “The teams will also coordinate with surveillance teams and assist them in contact mapping, marking houses, coordinating with sanitisation staff to sanitise patients’ houses besides ensuring barricading at the patients’ houses,” said Adil Ahmed Khan, LMC corporater from Tilak Nagar in Kundri Rakabganj. Civic officials said the monitoring teams will also ensure a regular supply of medicine to patients besides admitting them to Covid care centres in case of emergency. The teams’ duties also include keeping a check on mass gatherings and ensuring that the Covid-19 protocol is followed in localities. The directive to set up nigrani samitis came in July—the UP government asked the magistrates of districts to form Covid-19 vigilance teams in urban and rural pockets of their districts. Around one lakh surveillance teams were to be set up in the state by roping in government, private and anganwadi workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nigrani-samitis-up-govt-s-latest-tool-to-increase-the-vigil-against-covid-19/story-XxtCMwWJsJpaEgCr6jrF4K.html

They said the statement was recorded on Monday in connection with Singh’s claims regarding cash transfers from his son’s accounts and his finances. Singh, a complainant in the case, had filed a case with the Bihar police last month on the basis of which ED filed a money laundering case on July 31. Singh has levelled serious allegations against actor Rhea Chakraborty of embezzling his son’s money while staying with him. He has alleged that an unusual transaction of Rs 15 crore had taken place from his son’s account which needed to be investigated.The ED, officials cited above said, has already questioned Chakraborty in the case. The Bihar Police had lodged a case under various IPC sections: 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement), 380 (theft in dwelling house), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) and 306 (abetment of suicide). The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has also registered a case against Chakraborty, three of her family members,and others in connection with the actor’s death. Rajput was found dead in his Mumbai home on June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-records-sushant-singh-father-s-statement/story-fBfsmuBa5HyGHkv4RDH2EO.html
18-08-2020||India||BJP used social media to spread religious hatred: Shiv Sena||The ruling Shiv Sena, which is part of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government, comprising the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, on Tuesday, launched into ally-turned-rival the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and alleged that the party benefitted the most electorally using social media and gained politically by spreading religious hatred since it assumed power at the Centre in 2014. An editorial in Saamana, the party mouthpiece, referred to a news report published in The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on August 14 that took a dig at Facebook’s India operations for turning a blind eye to hate speech by a BJP elected representative and three other “Hindu nationalist individuals and groups” in a bid not to hurt the social media company’s lucrative business prospects in its biggest market. The editorial in the Marathi daily said that social media platforms can be used to voice opinions but “if it is used to spread hatred to divide the country, then action should be taken against those without thinking about which party they belong to. Facebook cannot turn a blind eye to the person spreading hatred because he is from the ruling party.” It exhorted foreign companies to abide by Indian laws. The BJP leader cited in the WSJ report is T Raja Singh, the lone party member of the Telangana legislative assembly (MLA), who is known for his provocative social media posts against Muslims and dabbling in divisive and rabble-rousing politics. “It is alright to have a difference of opinion on platforms such as Facebook… However, the social media company (Facebook) is not a platform to create a divide between Hindus and Muslims,” it said. “Instead of connecting society, social media is used to spread hatred. Today, countless new age Goebbels have their own law, judicial process, prison. Social media is on the payrolls of political parties. In 2014, the social media army had made a big contribution because of which the BJP had won the election under the leadership of (Narendra) Modi,” it said. “In the last seven years, truth is being twisted and falsehood is being openly propagated. Rumours and hatred against religion are being spread for political gains,” it added. The editorial pointed out that social media was full of jokes and memes about former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh until not too long ago, but now the same platform has turned on the heat on PM Modi and ex-Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, which is “tragic”. Keshav Upadhye, BJP’s chief spokesperson, Maharashtra, dismissed the allegation that the party has gained electorally because of its divisive politics. He described Sena’s charges as “laughable”. “Such claims made by the Congress or the Shiv Sena are baseless. It is far from reality. Before last year’s parliamentary elections, over 700 (Facebook) pages, which had right-wing propaganda, were banned. Today, too, materials written against Modiji are available on Facebook. The BJP has not benefitted electorally in any way,” Upadhye rebutted. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had also taken a swipe at the BJP over the WSJ report. “BJP and RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) control Facebook & WhatsApp in India. They spread fake news and hatred through it and use it to influence the electorate. Finally, the American media has come out with the truth about Facebook,” Gandhi had tweeted on Sunday, two days after WSJ had published the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-used-social-media-to-spread-religious-hatred-shiv-sena/story-FOcyfxblvgm4SeELLEkStL.html

The decision was taken after 20 staff members of the UP Assembly tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Monday, days ahead of the monsoon session set to begin August 20. The development also comes in the wake of two state ministers -- Kamal Rani Varun and Chetan Chauhan -- succumbing to the infection within a span of two weeks. “We will begin testing our staff for Covid-19 on Tuesday. We will also test the members of legislative council (MLCs) on August 19-20,” said chairman, Vidhan Parishad, Ramesh Yadav. Yadav held a meeting with leaders of political parties to discuss measures to enforce social distancing in the house during the monsoon session. In order to ensure that no two members are seated right next to each other, arrangements have been made for the legislators to sit in the ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ lobbies as well. Each lobby can accommodate 30 legislators. A visitors’ gallery has also been reserved for the MLAs to sit in. Uttar Pradesh has a bicameral house. While the state assembly has a sanctioned strength of 403 members, the upper house has 100 seats. Seven seats have fallen vacant in the lower house while the upper house of state legislature has 13 vacancies. The state assembly began testing its staff for Covid-19 on Monday. In all, 600 persons, including staff of state assembly and some other departments to be deployed for work during the monsoon session, were tested. Out of those, 20 were found positive for Covid-19, confirmed assembly speaker Hridaya Narain Dikshit. He said Covid-19 testing centres would be established near the MLAs’ residences as they all have to be tested in a day. All the MLAs are being informed about the testing facility at the Vidhayak Nivas (MLAs’ apartment building) and at the Vidhan Bhawan. Use of mask has been made mandatory in both the houses. The three-day session will begin on August 20 and conclude on August 24 with Saturday and Sunday (August 22-23) as off days. Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav has demanded that adequate measures be taken to protect public representatives attending the monsoon session. “Given the spread of Covid-19 in the state, adequate measures should be taken to protect the public representatives from the disease,” Yadav tweeted in Hindi on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-session-up-legislators-council-staff-to-undergo-covid-test/story-rRUW5xOZxKaPKrR3pFRz5K.html

He also asked Zuckerberg to set up a high-level inquiry into the Facebook India leadership team and their operations.“This is a damning and serious allegation of Facebook India’s interference in India’s electoral democracy,” Venugopal has said in the letter.“As India’s oldest political party that fought for the nation’s freedom and established electoral democracy through adult franchise, it is deeply disturbing to note that your company may be a willing participant in thwarting the very rights and values that our founding leaders sacrificed their lives for,” he added.The Congress party has asked the company to make public all instances of hate speech posts since 2014 that were allowed on the platform.

18-08-2020||India||Conducting physical exams amid pandemic a challenge: DU||A day after the Delhi High Court directed the Delhi University (DU) to conduct physical exams for final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students from September 14, the university administration, teachers and students have raised concerns over its feasibility amid the Coronavirus disease (Covid-9) pandemic. The university had proposed holding physical examinations for students, who could not take the Open Book Exams (OBE) online and those who want to better their performance despite taking them, from September 20. But a bench comprising justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad said the timeline was “quite unreasonable” and asked DU to advance the date. This comes days after the Union home ministry, in an affidavit in the Supreme Court, said that colleges could reopen to conduct final-year examinations. While ensuring precautionary measures such as social distancing while conducting the physical examination is a key concern for authorities, teachers say they will not have much time to complete the evaluation and declare the results for the ongoing online exams. The examination began on August 10 and will continue till August 31. A lot of students had left for their hometowns before the nationwide lockdown was announced. Travelling back to Delhi to take the examination, they say, will not only put their lives at risk but also add to the financial burden. DU’s Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani said conducting exams while ensuring safety precautions during the pandemic would be a challenge. “State universities can conduct offline exams without challenges because their students live locally, unlike central universities, where students from all across the country study. Candidates from far-flung areas will face difficulties in coming to Delhi. Hostel accommodation will be risky due to Covid-19 restrictions. Students, especially those from economically weaker sections, might face difficulties in making these arrangements. Besides, students might be asked to quarantine; that will be another challenge,” he said. Principals across colleges said they will have to make elaborate arrangements to conduct physical exams. The acting principal of Miranda House Bijayalaxmi Nanda said, “We have to prepare because multiple things have to be done. There must be uniform protocols regarding health and safety because they are of paramount importance. If thousands of students come to the campus for offline exams, arrangements for social distancing and sanitisation and other things have to be made. If outstation students return, hostel arrangements have to be made. Limited resources have to be utilised, which will be challenging. Classes and evaluation are going on simultaneously.”Several principals said that conducting physical exams in October would have been better since DU’s admission process begins in September. Manoj Sinha, the secretary of Delhi University Principal’s Association and the principal of Aryabhatta College, said, “The date doesn’t seem feasible since there isn’t enough time to prepare for offline exams, given the Covid-19 scenario. The entire teaching staff will be busy evaluating OBE papers. We cannot compromise this because it would affect overall results. Starting physical exams will not be conducive to the functioning of the institutions at present, but we will do what the varsity administration decides.” DU is presently conducting online exams in open-book format for 260,000 final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students, as a one-time measure given the Covid-19 pandemic. Several faculty members raised concerns over the comparison of students who are now appearing for the OBE to those who will appear for the offline exams in September. Rajesh Jha, a member of DU’s executive council (EC), said, “The problem is how to put the two sets of students in the same bracket. It is not scientific and against the basics of standardised examinations. The uniformity of yardstick is a basic tenet of examinations.” Most faculty members said completing the evaluation process of the ongoing OBE would not be possible before September 14. Pankaj Garg, an associate professor at Rajdhani College, said, “It’s not possible to declare results before September 14. All the major exams will be held by August 19 and miscellaneous exams will continue till August 31. How will students decide to appear in the second phase of examination before their results are announced?” Students also raised concerns about their safety during the prevailing situation. Amal Simon, a final-year BSc Hons (Physics) student at Ramjas College, said he and most of his friends are trying to write online exams to avoid travelling for offline exams. Simon, a resident of Kerala’s Palakkad, said, “We are visiting cyber cafes or friends’ places to write exams; we just want to get this over with. We can’t risk our lives by travelling to Delhi at a time when cases are increasing day by day.” Ram Govind, a final-year student of Rajdhani College, who lives in a village near Allahabad, said, “Even if train services resume and we manage to reach Delhi, where we will live? We had to let go of our rented accommodation when we returned to our hometown to save rent. Besides, our families won’t allow many of us to travel back due to the Covid-19 situation.” Many visually impaired students said that it would not be possible for them to travel to Delhi for exams amid the pandemic. Ramjatan Yadav, a visually impaired student from Uttar Pradesh’s Sultanpur, said, “Both decisions of conducting online and physical exams amid the pandemic are not inclusive and students like us were not kept in mind while making these decisions. How will we even travel and manage to stay without families in times like these?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conducting-physical-exams-amid-pandemic-a-challenge-du/story-9orwworvk09imv5YJ4MeoK.html

18-08-2020||India||Mumbai building collapse leaves 1 dead, 1 injured||Mumbai: A 41-year-old man died and another person was injured after a portion of a vacant building near Rizvi College, in Mumbai’s Bandra (West), collapsed, late on Monday. The three-storey building had collapsed on the compound wall of the neighbouring building and also damaged its ground floor. Search and rescue operation was still going on at the time of filing of this report. Two fire engines were at the spot and the debris was being removed.According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) disaster management cell, around 8.30 pm, Bharti Building collapsed on the four-storeyed Hardik Villa residential complex on Sherley Rajan Road.Fire brigade rescued seven people, two of whom were injured and were rushed to the hospital. The injured, Bruce D’Penha and Arjun Ramsagar Pandit (22) (41) sustained a leg and a head injury, respectively. D’Penha, who was visiting an electronic repair shop on the ground floor of Hardik Villa at the time of the mishap, succumbed to his injuries on Tuesday morning. Pandit is recovering at Bhabha Hospital.The collapse damaged the wall and compound area of Hardik Villa. Cars parked there were also damaged. After the incident, residents of Hardik Villa were evacuated.Locals said Bharti Building was over two decades old. It tilted towards Hardik Villa and collapsed within seconds. Sadiq Rizvi, a resident of a nearby building, said, “This structure had been vacant for the past 20 years and the authorities did not take notice. It had become dangerous and should have been demolished long back. This collapse could have caused major damage and casualties.”Congress MLA Zeeshan Siddique said, “I have requested a thorough inquiry into the matter. The demolition of this building, provided no one was staying in the building, should have taken place before such an untoward incident happened.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-injured-in-mumbai-building-collapse/story-rDxi27PCroD99EFPF3gNMM.html

He continues to be on ventilator support and his vital parameters are stable,” a statement from the hospital said on Tuesday.The 84-year-old former President underwent the surgery to remove a clot in his brain after he suffered a fall at his Rajaji Marg residence and he has been in coma since then. He was also tested coronavirus-positive.

18-08-2020||India||SC rejects plea seeking fund transfer from PM Cares to NDRF||The PM Cares Fund set up by the central government is not in violation of the Disaster Management Act (DM Act) of 2005, the Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday, rejecting a plea seeking transfer of all contributions made to PM Cares Fund till date to the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), a statutory fund created under said act.A three-judge bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan held that the two funds can exist separately and individuals and organisations are free to contribute to NDRF but funds from PM Cares need not be transferred to NDRF.“PM Cares Fund is an entirely different fund established as a public charitable trust. Funds in PM Cares cannot be directed to be deposited to NDRF,” the bench, which also comprised justices R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah, ruled.Further, the court also turned down a prayer seeking formulation of a national plan for Covid management stating that the existing plan under the DM Act is sufficient to deal with the pandemic.The petitioner NGO, Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), had claimed that PM Cares Fund was set up in violation of the legal mandate under the DM Act as per which any grant made by any person or institution for the purpose of disaster management should be compulsorily credited to NDRF.Reacting to the Supreme Court verdict, CPIL lawyer, advocate Prashant Bhushan tweeted, “Unfortunate that the SC allows the non-transparent and unaccountable PM Cares fund set up as a secret trust to garner money in the name of Covid relief, rather than transferring such funds to the Statutory NDRF which is accessible under RTI and audited by CAG.” “Now that the Supreme Court has adjudicated on the matter, we hope that the attack on the PM Cares Fund ends conclusively,” BJP spokesperson and Supreme Court advocate, Nalin Kohli told HT.The PM Cares Fund was set up by the Centre on March 28 as a public charitable trust with the primary objective of dealing with any kind of emergency or distress situation such as that posed by Covid-19 pandemic.“Even though there is a provision for NDRF under Section 46 of the Disaster Management Act, the central government has come up with a PM Cares Fund. All the contributions being made by individuals and institutions in relation to Covid-19 crisis are being credited into the PM Cares Fund and not to the NDRF, in clear violation of Section 46 of the DM Act,” the petitioner submitted.On the necessity of national plan for Covid management, the petitioner had placed reliance on section 11 of DM Act.“Section 11 of the DM Act makes it mandatory for a national plan to be drawn up for disaster management for whole of the country but currently, there is no such national plan in place to deal with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic even though the same has been notified as a ‘disaster’ and numerous notifications are being issued to contain the same under the DM Act”, the petitioner had pointed out.In its affidavit before the top court in July 8, the Centre had rebutted this argument by stating that PM Cares is a fund established to carry out relief work and several such funds have been established on similar lines in the past.“Mere existence of a statutory fund (NDRF) would not prohibit creation of a different fund like PM Cares Fund which provides for voluntary donations,” the affidavit said.During the hearing before the apex court, the Centre, through solicitor general Tushar Mehta, had defended the PM Cares fund saying that it was not intended to circumvent the NDRF as alleged by the petitioners.“Whatever amount that has to go to NDRF under the law will go (to NDRF). PM Cares is a public charitable trust. If private individuals want to donate, they can do so. There are several public charitable trusts getting donations,” Mehta argued.The petitioner through their counsel, senior advocate Dushyant Dave, had pointed out that PM Cares Fund was not being audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) but by private auditors.“This government believes in transparency. Why should private auditors audit it (PM Cares)? NDRF, under DM Act, is audited by CAG,” Dave said.The bench had reserved its judgment in the case on July 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-rejects-plea-seeking-transfer-of-funds-from-pm-cares-to-ndrf/story-zZwPlSFbEwHxsr2xmzB1LN.html
18-08-2020||India||India tests record 8.97 lakh swab samples in a day||India continues to aggressively ramp up its daily testing count for coronavirus disease (Covid-19), as 8.97 lakh swab samples were tested on Monday. The country is close to achieving the daily testing target of around a million swab samples. India has conducted 309,38,400 Covid-19 tests to date since the first swab sample was diagnosed on January 23. There has been a threefold rise in conducting Covid-19 tests, as compared to a month ago, when 10 million samples were tested. “A new peak was achieved following 8.97 lakh Covid-19 tests in the last 24 hours. Even with such a high level of testing, the positivity has remained low at 8.81%, as compared to the weekly national average of 8.84%,” said a release from the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW). Aggressive testing leads to early identification and isolation of Covid-19 positive cases. The case fatality rate (CFR) is brought down through aggressive testing and efficient clinical treatment. The number of laboratories approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for diagnosing Covid-19 has also seen steady growth, experts said. From a single laboratory -- ICMR’s National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune on January 23, -- to 160 labs on March 23, India has consistently expanded its diagnostic network amid the viral outbreak. At present, the country has 1,470 approved laboratories across the country, including 969 and 501 government and private-run facilities, respectively. “Each day laboratories are being added to the network of Covid-19 testing facilities across India. Now, we are doing up to 800,000 Covid-19 tests in a day and it is a significant achievement in such a short span of time. Besides laboratories in the ICMR’s network, Covid-19 tests are being done in other government and private-run facilities that are showing good results,” said an ICMR official, who did not wish to be identified. India’s Covid-19-related death toll is also among the lowest, as compared with the other severely affected countries. Though the Covid-19 fatality count has crossed the 50,000 mark, the MoH&FW said the country is better placed than other nations such as the United States of America (USA) that clocked a similar fatality figure in 23 days, while Brazil and Mexico reached it in 95 and 141 days, respectively. On the contrary, India took 156 days to report 50,000 mortalities due to the raging viral infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-tests-record-8-97-lakh-swab-samples-in-a-day/story-FE9D0UJ1T79NjHUBJzAxVI.html
18-08-2020||India||Maharashtra has more Covid-19 cases than South Africa, the sixth worst-hit country in the world||Maharashtra now has more Covid-19 cases--over 600,000--than South Africa, the sixth worst-hit country globally. South Africa has reported 5,89,886 Covid-19 cases as per the reference website worldometers.info.With 5,612,027 cases, the US tops the list of countries with maximum cases in the world. Brazil has reported 3,363,235 cases, India 2,701,604 and Russia 927,745, according to the website. Maharashtra alone recorded 604,358 cases till Monday, according to the state health department.Maharashtra crossed the 600,000 mark nine days after it recorded half-a-million cases on August 8. It recorded 8,493 cases on Monday and 11,111 on Sunday. Maharashtra has now 155,268 active cases.The state recorded first 100,000 cases in 96 days, the second in 22, third in 14, fourth in 11, and the fifth in just 10 days. In the first 17 days of August, Maharashtra reported 182,834 cases, or around 10,754 daily. It is much higher than previous months. As many as 247,392 cases were recorded in July, 102,172 in June, 57,157 in May, 10,196 in April and 302 in March.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, a public health expert who heads the state government’s communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee, said the cases were rapidly rising in rural areas since the lockdown restrictions have been eased.“Distribution of cases started soon after the state opted for unlocking the restrictions. Before that, cases used to be reported only from urban areas but now it [infection] has spread to semi-urban and rural areas. The overall cases are also increasing in an accelerated fashion,” Dr Salunkhe said.Officials said another major cause of concern was Covid-19 fatalities. In the first 17 days of the month, the state has reported 5,271 deaths compared to 6,988 in July, 5,638 in June, 2,286 in May, 449 in April, and 10 in March. The case fatality rate (CFR) in Maharashtra was 3.35% on Monday. It continued to be second highest in the country after Gujarat with 3.54% CFR and 2,785 deaths and 78,680 cases till Sunday, according to government data.Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, a public health expert, said the government does not have resources in terms of specialised staff and health infrastructure to deal with the situation, especially in rural areas.“Tertiary care treatment can only prevent Covid-19 fatalities. We need specialised staff to treat critical patients. Both the state and the Central government could not provide that quality of trained health staff and infrastructure in rural and semi-urban areas,” said Dr Pattiwar.He said the state needs to train its doctors and health staff in rural areas. There should be a system for regular interaction between doctors from semi-urban and rural areas with the members of task force formed to reduce Covid-19 casualties, which is not happening, added Pattiwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-has-more-covid-19-cases-than-south-africa-the-sixth-worst-hit-country-in-the-world/story-f11k1FIK8QhyTfO5vpiC4M.html
18-08-2020||India||Goa governor Satya Pal Malik transferred to Meghalaya||Panaji/New Delhi: Goa governor Satya Pal Malik was on Tuesday transferred to Meghalaya less than a year after he was shifted to the western state after helming Jammu & Kashmir when it was divested of its special status and split into two Union territories last year. Differences of opinion with Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant marked Malik’s tenure in the state.In a statement, the Press Information Bureau confirmed Malik’s transfer. It said Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who is the governor of neighbouring Maharashtra, has been given the additional charge of Goa.Tathagata Roy, Malik’s predecessor in Meghalaya, said he was supposed to be relieved after the end of his tenure in May. “Upon receipt of news from Rashtrapati Bhavan [about the transfer], I spoke to Shri Satyapal Malikji, the new Governor-Designate and welcomed him to Shillong [Meghalaya]. It may take him a little time to come here. I was supposed to have been relieved on 20th May. Now the end of the road is in sight!” tweeted Roy.Malik and Sawant have been in the news over their disagreements. In July, Malik, 74, summoned Sawant to discuss the government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis. When Sawant sought to downplay the meeting, Malik accused the chief minister of putting words in his mouth. Malik has underlined the need for coming together and not criticising each other. He called for synergy among the ministers and officers amid the crisis.Malik wrote a letter to Sawant on August 1 opposing the construction of a new Raj Bhavan (governor’s house) “as irrational and imprudent” when the state is battling Covid-19 and reeling under financial crises. The letter followed Sawant’s move to go ahead with the construction. In May, Malik said news reports on “differences and divergences between him and the chief minister in handling the crisis” were “in bad taste”Malik’s criticism of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government gave opposition parties in the state a much-needed fillip and a handle to attack it.“Governor of Goa Satya Pal Malikji stood by truth, emotions & sentiments of every Goan on core issues like Mhadei, Economic Revival & Austerity Measures, Handling & Management of Covid Pandemic. Truth and @BJP4Goa cant go together. Goa needed him the most now,” opposition leader Digambar Kamat tweeted after news about Malik’s transfer broke.Vijai Sardesai, the leader of Goa Forward Party, echoed Kamat. “Who will want a Governor who speaks truth on Mhadei, Goa’s precarious Covid situation, need to prevent wasteful expenditure & not to do scams during pandemic & call out Goa CM [Sawant] for being uncultured? So Satyapal Malik who captured Goan hearts in his short tenure was expected to get transferred due to party pressure!”Malik was sworn in as Goa governor on November 4 last year in what was thought to be a more relaxed posting following his tenure in Jammu & Kashmir. He oversaw the transition of Jammu & Kashmir from a state to the Union Territory as its last governor.During his tenure in Jammu & Kashmir, Malik triggered a controversy when he claimed he had not received a letter from political parties staking claim to form the government in the then state after the BJP-People’s Democratic Party coalition collapsed in June 2018. He later said the fax machine in Raj Bhavan was not working.Malik, who began his political career in 1965, was first elected to the Rajya Sabha as a Lok Dal member in 1980. He was again elected to the Rajya Sabha as a Congress candidate in 1986. Malik joined the BJP and was elected as a Lok Sabha member in 2005.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-governor-satya-pal-malik-transferred-to-meghalaya/story-p4gsGnc2hFLnh342hO3ofM.html

18-08-2020||India||India is already establishing itself as an important global player, says UKIBC’s Jayant Krishna||The UK India Business Council (UKIBC) has appointed Jayant Krishna as its group chief executive officer in India for the first time. Krishna spoke to Rajeev Jayaswal about the plans of UK firms to set up their manufacturing bases in India. Edited excerpts: Many multi-nationals are considering exiting China and looking for India as one of the alternatives. What is the view of the UK industry on this matter?UK firms, like many multi-nationals, have started looking at diversifying supply chains as a result of the [Covid-19] pandemic, and India, with its already large and growing market, presents an attractive destination. The UK industry has long invested in India across sectors. It is not just the shift to reducing reliance on China or other areas that will see that grow, but directly the rapid improvement in the operating environment in India – the rise of India in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business rankings is testament to that - and the growing opportunities as the Indian economy continues to achieve its full potential on the world stage.Why would British firms prefer India over China?UK businesses are and will look to India as an incremental base for manufacturing and research and development, among other areas. I cannot say now how many British firms are looking to shift from China to India but some of them are contemplating exploring India as a manufacturing destination in addition to their existing investments in China. But I would say that India is an extremely attractive country for British firms to invest in.How do you see India as an investment destination?I think it is widely agreed that India is already establishing itself as an important global player, both economically and geopolitically, and that journey is moving forward. In not so distant a future, India will be the largest country by population and the third largest in terms of the size of its economy; and quite understandably, businesses want to be a part of that.From a UK perspective, that thought process is heightened by Brexit, in which the UK is forging new trading relationships, post-Covid-19.In terms of policy changes, those mentioned previously in the priority sectors of food and drink, life science and healthcare, and digital and data services, should be the focus, and ultimately make it easier for the UK firms to do business in India.India has significant legal and regulatory barriers still to overcome, as our members have told us every year in our annual Doing Business in India survey run since 2015. Progress has been made but making the regulatory framework more equitable would indeed be very positive for attracting more investments.Is the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliant India Initiative) congruent to enhanced bilateral trade between India and UK?UK businesses remain committed to India and want to be part of and support India’s Atmanirbhar Bharat mission. With that being said, it is vital that India remains open to international trade and investment.India has made great progress in terms of economic development since opening up to international markets in 1991 and the ambition to become the world’s manufacturing powerhouse is quite appropriate. But to do so, India will need imports and technology and knowledge transfers if it wants to be a competitive exporter.Should India remain open and speaking with senior government officials I am reassured that it will, I see no reason why bilateral trade between the UK and India will not grow. At the JETCO [UK-India Joint Economic Trade Committee], both governments were in agreeance that the relationship has grown in recent years and the pandemic, Brexit and India’s global ambitions present an opportunity to revitalise the relationship.There are great complementaries between India’s needs and the UK’s offering and it was very positive to hear that Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the centrality of sectors such as manufacturing, infrastructure, energy, pharma, space, and defence, to global cooperation. These are all areas ripe for India-UK collaboration in creating Aatmanirbhar Bharat, underpinned by both nations’ strong track record in technology and innovation.How much have India-UK trade and investment increased?Since the turn of the century, the UK has been one of the largest investors in India, totaling over £22 billion in last two decades, and making it the second-fastest-growing G20 investor in India. And in trade, it is clear that businesses and consumers share confidence in one another – demonstrated by growth in trade to £24 billion in 2019. Likewise, FDI [foreign direct investment] from India reached £11 billion in 2019.What are the problems and prospects of trade and investment relations between India and the UK?The prospects for trade and investment between the UK and India are certainly upbeat. At the JETCO at the end of July, UK secretary of state for international trade Liz Truss and India minister for commerce and industry Piyush Goyal recommitted to important progress to remove non-tariff barriers in core sectors of food and drink, life science and healthcare, and digital and data services, in the shape of an Enhanced Trade Partnership.Business-led joint working groups highlighted the key challenges to trade and made formal recommendations to overcome these. The next round of JETCO is scheduled to take place in autumn where the ministers will discuss how to support these recommendations, which include greater standards alignment and a UK-India data adequacy agreement, and in due course make it easier to do business between and in both countries.In addition to the identified sectors, manufacturing will be a key sector for UK trade and investment and we at UKIBC have consistently advocated that the UK government amend visa policies to ensure that talented people from India can study, train and work in the UK. UKIBC has been particularly active in the area around the post-study working visa. India now receives more than half of all UK tier-2 working visas and the second most tier-4 study visas. The new UK Graduate Immigration Route for this year, which allows students to stay for up to two years post-study to find work, is a very welcome move and should help to attract Indian talent to the UK, and strengthen the living bridge between the UK and India.Is an India-UK FTA expected soon? What are the possible areas of early harvest agreements?The UKIBC has welcomed the governments’ shared ambition for a future FTA that came out of JETCO. The commitment to an Enhanced Trade Partnership is seen as a road map to such an agreement, starting, rightly, by focussing on market access issues and the ease of doing business.The three priority sectors – food and drink, life science and healthcare, and digital and data services – are important starting points for such action.So, the priority is to remove market access barriers and ultimately make it easier for businesses in the UK-India trade and economic corridor, with a view to a future FTA, and I think both governments are aligned to that view.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-is-already-establishing-itself-as-an-important-global-player-says-ukibc-s-jayant-krishna/story-DdkICvXQMSMF8BSnrfPlBI.html

Speaking in the backdrop of the controversy stoked by an article in the Wall Street Journal that alleges that Ankhi Das, public policy director, Facebook, for India, South and Central Asia, had opposed action against BJP leaders accused of hate speech; Govindacharya said a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe as demanded by the Congress should be used as an opportunity to address “fundamental and systemic problems”. “Instead of trading accusations the political parties will do well to address the basic question of accountability and work on creating a mechanism for drafting the necessary laws for doing so. They speak one language in power and another when in the opposition,” he said. Govindacharya, who has been leading a campaign seeking regulation of social media platforms and has filed a petition in the Delhi high court (HC) for rules to make companies such as Facebook and Google establish their servers in India, has also been pushing for fast tracking the Personal Data Protection Bill to make internet technology companies pay more taxes. In 2014, he wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to call off his meeting with Facebook’s co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, until issues such as data protection, taxation and user privacy are not resolved. “Parties should not replace conviction with convenience. They should use the JPC to address the concerns of right to privacy, the selective and biased approach to taking down content; there have to be curative solutions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-rss-ideologue-govindacharya-wants-parliamentary-probe-in-workings-of-socia-media-platforms/story-Xwea7amzRxjixSYChZwvrO.html
18-08-2020||India||India records decline in daily Covid-19 cases and deaths; tally over 2.7 million||India saw 55,079 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 875 deaths, the lowest in nearly a week, in the last 24 hours, bringing the country’s case count to 2,702,742, according to the Union health ministry data.There has been a decline in the daily number of Covid-19 cases for the last three days--there were 63,490 infections last Sunday and 57,981 on Monday, the health ministry’s data showed.The health ministry’s dashboard showed that the number recovered patients climbed to 1,977,779 as 57,937 people were cured of Covid-19 between Monday and Tuesday morning. With that, India’s recovery rate climbed to 73.17%. The gap between the active cases at 673,166 and recovered cases in the country has widened further at 1,304,613. The country’s death toll from the coronavirus disease is now at 51,797. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said 3,09,41,264 samples were tested up to Monday for Covid-19. Of these, 8,99,864 samples were tested on Monday, the top research body said. “A new peak of 8.97 lakh #COVID19 tests were done in the last 24 hours. Even with such a high level of testing, the positivity has remained low i.e. 8.81% compared to the weekly national average i.e. 8.84%,” the health ministry said in a tweet on Tuesday.“Focused implemention of Centre-led strategies has ensured prompt identification, timely isolation & effective clinical treatment, leading to reduced Case Fatality Rate. 30 States/UTs performed better than the national average,” it added.The government has asked five pharmaceutical firms, including three that have candidates in clinical trials, prepare and a present a comprehensive note on the way forward by Thursday on how soon they can produce large quantities and what pricing they expect if their shot is approved.The meeting was held between an expert group spearheading India’s vaccine strategy and involved Serum Institute of India, Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila – all three have vaccine candidates in human trials. Serum Institute is licensed to produce up to some quantities the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is largely considered the front runner globally.The two others were Biological E and Gennova, both of which have candidates in preclinical phases. Trial data of none of the India-made vaccines is yet to be made available.“Even as scientists are working to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, we are simultaneously working on procuring the final product to ensure availability and access to our population,” Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said following Monday’s meeting. “. As part of India’s proactive, pre-emptive and graded response to Covid-19 since January, the expert group is holding consultations with vaccine manufacturers to plan ahead for the production, pricing and distribution of the vaccine, whenever it is ready,” he added.India has not struck a pre-production deal with any of the vaccine developers that are in the race for a successful candidate, a strategy several advanced economies such as United States, United Kingdom and some European Union nations have adopted in order to jump what might be a long waiting line.Of these countries, the US has the most number of infections at 5,437,851, followed by Brazil with 3,359,570 cases. There have been more than 21 million cases of the coronavirus disease and 773,152 deaths across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-2-7-million-mark-with-over-55-000-cases-876-deaths-in-a-day/story-n32OfFNmTrBQraUxREYOKL.html
18-08-2020||India||With no jobs in Bengal, migrant workers from Murshidabad leave home again||As unemployment hits migrant workers who returned home to West Bengal over the past five months, a non-government welfare organisation is helping people in Murshidabad district return to the states they left in a hurry because of the Covid-19 pandemic. According to data from the 2011 census, Bengal ranks fourth among the states from where people migrate. Between 2001 and 2011, 5.8 lakh people had migrated from Bengal. The number is now over 11 lakh, according to the state government. Murshidabad accounts for the most migration among all districts. Citizens for Social Justice, an organisation formed by people from different walks of life, has helped over 2,000 migrants from Murshidabad return home between April and July by raising funds. The organisation is now sending people back in buses and even providing them with an accident cover of ₹2 lakh, fitness certificates issued after medical tests and subscriptions to a doctor-on-call service. “We sent off 200 people last week. Since they bear a portion of the transportation cost, it helps us hire big buses suitable for interstate travel. In each of Murshidabad’s 28 community blocks, there are people whose skills are in demand in south and north India,” Arindam Das, a Calcutta High Court lawyer and the secretary of Citizens for Social Justice, said.  “Many of these people have been getting calls from former employers, but they don’t know how to return. We are arranging for antigen tests and providing healthy people with medical certificates,” Das said. Members of the group track the buses throughout the journey. “The other day, authorities stopped a bus at the border of Tamil Nadu. When I talked to a superintendent of police from that area, he immediately identified Murshidabad as the district where thousands of workers are from. He let the bus in after checking the papers,” Das said. “If these people stayed home without jobs, it would have led to socio-economic problems and caused a headache for the administration. The word has spread and many people from other districts have sought our help. Some even want to go to Delhi, where there is a demand for skilled construction workers,” Das added. The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) has welcomed the development. “Skilled people who work in the construction, textiles or the jewellery industry will not find jobs that pay as well as employers in other states. Jobs that our government provide for 100 days under the Mahatma Gandhi Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) are not enough for these people,” Apurba Sarkar, the spokesperson of the TMC in Murshidabad district, said. “Their skills fetch good money in states where these industries have boomed. The social welfare organisation is doing a good job,” Sarkar added. For chief minister Mamata Banerjee, migrant workers from Bengal have been a major issue ever since the pandemic started. On March 26, Banerjee wrote to the chief ministers of 18 states, urging them to provide basic shelter, food and medicine to stranded migrants from Bengal. The Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 20 to provide employment to migrant workers affected by the lockdown, became a political issue in Bengal since the state was not included in the scheme. In the initial announcement, 116 districts in six states, including Bihar and Odisha, figured among the beneficiaries. The Centre selected districts where over 25,000 migrants returned home. TMC and the Left parties took umbrage, alleging that millions of those who returned to Bengal were ignored for political reasons. The chief minister’s nephew and Lok Sabha member Abhishek Banerjee expressed his anguish in a tweet. “Shri @narendramodi Ji, why have you blatantly ignored the concerns of 11 Lakh migrant workers from #Bengal who’ve recently returned to their homes. Why has WB been left out of the Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan? Why this apathy towards the people of Bengal?” tweeted Banerjee on June 22.The BJP Bengal unit responded by saying that the TMC government did not implement important Central schemes, such as Ayushman Bharat, that benefit the poor, and was reluctant to let special trains bring migrant workers back to Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-no-jobs-in-bengal-migrant-workers-from-murshidabad-leave-home-again/story-3R9wJaFcoCPhLluPKqTAoI.html
18-08-2020||India||Chhattisgarh Police files FIR against Facebook’s Ankhi Das||Chhattisgarh Police registered a first information report (FIR) against Ankhi Das, the public policy director of Facebook for India, South and Central Asia, and two others in Raipur late at night on Monday. They have been booked under sections 295 (a) (deliberate and malicious acts that are intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs); 505 (1) (c) (with intent to incite, or which is likely to incite, any class or community of persons to commit any offence against any other class or community); 506 (criminal intimidation); 500 (defamation) and (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on the basis of a complaint filed by a Raipur-based journalist, Awesh Tiwari, on Monday. The FIR was registered after Tiwari was named in a complaint registered by Delhi Police’s cyber cell on the basis of a charge levelled against him by Das on Sunday. In her complaint, Das alleged receiving death threats and social media abuse after a report in The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) suggested that Facebook was biased towards the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in censoring hate speech. Earlier, a controversy had erupted after an article was published by WSJ on August 14, which reported that Das opposed the idea of removing incendiary posts by the BJP leaders, as she had warned that this could hurt the company’s “commercial interests” in India. Das had also not revealed that Facebook had deleted fake news pages connected to the BJP, the WSJ report stated. Das alleged that she was threatened and filed an FIR under provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) pertaining to sexually coloured remarks, vulgar gestures through words, and criminal intimidation. On Monday night, Das, Ram Sahu, a resident of Mungeli, Chhattisgarh, and Vivek Sinha, an Indore resident, were named in the FIR registered at Kabir Nagar police station in Raipur. The FIR, which HT has a copy, stated that complainant Tiwari had put out a Facebook post on Sunday following the WSJ report. “There were comments over the facts of the story, which was published in the newspaper (WSJ). I have also mentioned the role of Ankhi Das, which was there in the story. The story mentioned that Das was forcing her subordinates not to remove hate speech posts from Facebook before last year’s Lok Sabha election for political gains. She had told her subordinates that political relations with the government would be affected because of their (the posts) removal,” Tiwari’s complaint stated. He alleged in the FIR that following his post, Sahu and Sinha sprang to Das’s defence and asked why should she support the outlawed Communist Party of India (CPI)-Maoist rebels, the traitors from the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and indulge in politics that favoured Muslims. They argued that Das is a Hindu and is talking about the faith’s benefit. Sahu allegedly had posted derogatory and communally-sensitive photographs and also threatened Tiwari. The FIR stated Tiwari is receiving threatening calls after his post against Das and they are claiming to “destroy” him. Das, Sahu, and Sinha are spreading communal hatred due to which his life is under threat and he is living in constant fear, Tiwari further alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-police-files-fir-against-facebook-s-ankhi-das/story-PDGluaa304G1YYxm9U5lPO.html
18-08-2020||India||MNNIT scholar generates power from Ganga soil||A research scholar at the department of electrical engineering in Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT), Prayagraj, has developed a technique to generate electricity from the soil of the Ganga riverbed, for which he has been selected for the prestigious Sristi-Gandhian Young Technological Innovation Award (GYTI Awards)-2020. President Ram Nath Kovind will present the award to Jeetendra Prasad, the scholar. According to Prasad, the technique could come in handy for lighting remote areas of the country. Using this technology, Prasad successfully charged a 12-volt battery, converted the generated current into AC with a voltage of 230 volts, and illuminated an electric bulb for nine hours. “The technology will provide a source of power for electronic devices and military wireless sensors in remote areas,” he said. The GYTI Awards are a Sristi (Society for Research and Initiatives for Sustainable Technologies and Institutions) initiative to encourage youth-driven technology innovations in 42 categories. After four stages of evaluation, seven teams are selected for the award and 15 are selected for the Sristi-GYTI appreciation award. MNNIT is the only national institute of technology to receive this award among all 31 institutes in the country this year, according to MNNIT officials. Much of Prasad’s research work has been published internationally by Wiley, ScienceDirect and IEEE.Prasad said, “I have developed 35 sediment microbial fuel cell (SMFC) reactors and used 500 grams of Ganga sediment to charge each reactor. Microbes in the sediment create electrons in the anode chamber. These electrons flow from anode to cathode via an electric circuit and produce voltage. Each SMFC reactor generates a voltage of 1.16 volts. By connecting all SMFCs in series-parallel connections, a voltage of 5 volts is harnessed.” Further, the voltage can be increased up to 12 volts using an electronic circuit. A charged 12 volt battery can then convert it into an AC voltage of 230 volts, which is enough to illuminate an electric bulb for nine hours, he said, adding that this technology does not create pollution while generating electricity.  This work has been published in Journal of Power Sources in January 2020, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy in July 2020, and International Journal oh Energy Research in 2019.Prasad was born in Shakkarpur village of Ghazipur district (UP). His father, Ramkrit Prajapati, is a retired electrician who worked with the UP State Bridge Corporation Ltd. Prasad receives a stipend under the Visvesvaraya PhD Scheme for Electronics & IT from the Union Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mnnit-scholar-generates-power-from-ganga-soil/story-TVsUcHZo5Np9D2LPqZ610N.html

Many of the idol makers in Haryana’s Ambala have claimed that they are not receiving any demand for large-sized Ganesha idols. “This year, demand for idols taller than 7-feet is very low as they are normally used in processions and much larger gatherings. Booking for smaller three to four-foot idols are coming as usual but we have not received any orders for the large-sized idols due to restrictions due to the Covid-19 outbreak,” Chamba Lal, an idol maker told ANI, adding that by this time last year, he had nearly sold out all idols prepared by him.According to Satish Gupta, the President of the Sri Siddhivinayak Seva Mandal in Ambala, this year, the festival will not be celebrated with usual grandeur but will be a more muted affair in accordance with the government’s prescribed precautions.“We have been celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi for the last seven years with splendour, but this year due to the pandemic, we will not put up a pandal. We normally celebrate with a seven to 10-foot idol but this year we will have a three-foot idol.” Gupta said“If anyone wants to distribute prasad, they must do so from a distance in their own individual capacity. All those coming to worship Lord Ganesha will have to wear a face mask and sanitise their hands,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ganesh-chaturthi-covid-19-diminishes-demand-for-large-sized-ganesha-idols-in-haryana/story-x10zFspv4oE9BHUGD9e14L.html
18-08-2020||India||More than 400 students, faculty members sci-tech institutes demand bail for Varavara Rao, GN Saibaba||More than 400 students, faculty members, and alumni from various science and technology institutes in the country have signed a petition to the Central government, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), and Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, demanding bail and medical care for Varavara Rao and GN Saibaba, who are in jail for their alleged Communist Party of India (CPI)-Maoist links, and the release of other political prisoners. Rao (81), an acclaimed Telugu poet and a human rights activist, is booked in the Elgar Parishad/Bhima Koregaon case and is undergoing treatment at Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital in Mumbai after he had tested coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive in July. Saibaba, who is 90% physically handicapped, is a Delhi University (DU) professor and was convicted in 2017 along with five others for their links with Left-wing extremist (LWE) organisations and for waging war against India. The petition, signed by the researchers and scientists from various Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs), makes three specific demands. The petitioners are seeking immediate and proper medical treatment and bail for Rao and Saibaba. The petitioners are seeking the release of all political prisoners arrested in the Elgar Parishad/Bhima Koregaon case in Maharashtra and anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, protests in New Delhi following a spike in Covid-19 cases in prisons across the country. They are also seeking the repeal of the draconian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act (UAPAA), 2019. “The government, in a bid to stifle dissent, is using the pandemic as an opportunity to arrest political activists such as Dr. Anand Teltumbde, Gautam Navlakha, Dr. Kafeel Khan, and Pinjra Tod activists Natasha and Devangana. They have been arrested, as they were active in the anti-CAA protests,” said a researcher from IIT-Bombay and a signatory to the petition. “The government is putting their lives at grave risk amid a spike in Covid-19 cases in prisons,” he said. Delhi Police had arrested students of Jamia Milia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University following the communal riots in north-east Delhi in February and during the anti-CAA protests last year. Pregnant Jamia student Safoora Zargar and IIT-Bombay alumnus Sharjeel Imam are among the prominent activists, who have been arrested by Delhi Police. Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, both students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), were slapped with the stringent UAPAA, 2019, which empowers the government to take action against activities that are against the integrity and sovereignty of the country. “We can clearly see that the government is continuously attacking activists, writers, poets, lawyers, students, and professors, who are critical of its anti-people agenda. As socially-conscious citizens associated with some of the best institutions of our country, it is our duty to make our society more equitable. We must raise our voice in solidarity to demand the release of all political prisoners,” read the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-than-400-students-faculty-members-sci-tech-institutes-demand-bail-for-varavara-rao-gn-saibaba/story-ZyXxXd6uhrzwaWOPjWdibJ.html

Launched on the occasion of the 74th Independence Day on August 15, Avran is a virucide powered by nanotechnology. It has been developed by Navork Innovations Private Ltd, a start-up working in the domains of nanotechnology, chemicals, textile, and material science, in association with Abstract Ideas, a design, and aesthetics start-up. Avran is one of the products selected by the Union Ministry of Science and Technology’s Department of Science and Technology under an initiative called the Centre for Augmenting War with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) health crisis (CAWACH). The two start-ups, mentored by the Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (SINE) at IIT-Bombay, came together to develop the product following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. “We have received a Rs 1-crore grant from CAWACH for developing and marketing the product. Our first batch of sterilisers were dispatched on Monday,” said Diptesh Mukherjee, an IIT-Bombay alumnus and a co-founder of Abstract Ideas. Agastya Bouyant, incubated at IIM-Calcutta, that manufactures inflatables for cleaning of water surfaces of rivers and sea, too, was a part of the product development. The steriliser is alcohol-free and a single spray can protect a surface from both virus and bacteria. The product has been tested at a laboratory that is accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL). The steriliser provides five levels of protection by providing a coating of nanoparticles, positively-charged molecular chains, antiviral and antibacterial film, nitrogen and halogen-based organic compounds (halamines) and naturally-occurring coconut and lemon extracts. “Our product can kill 99.999% virus and bacteria in five minutes only. The surface will remain bacteria and virus-free for 10 days,” said Abhishek Sahgal, an alumnus of IIT-Delhi and KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, and the co-founder of Navork. Manufactured at IIT-Bombay and a facility in Taloja in Navi Mumbai, the sterilisers are high in demand, according to the founders. “The demand for the product is almost 10 times that we had estimated. Around 40% of our customers are distributors of medical supplies, 30% are companies established in the industry and the rest (30%) are the general public,” said Sahgal. A 250-millilitre (ml) spray bottle is priced at Rs 240 and a 500-ml bottle is available for Rs 360. While for a five-litre jar, the disinfectant is available for Rs 1,750. A patent for the technology was filed four months ago and the product will be available on e-commerce portals from September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-iit-bombay-start-ups-develop-alcohol-free-steriliser-that-can-keep-surfaces-bacteria-and-virus-free-for-10-days/story-527AOKg9LGdTGPzVXwuiiN.html
18-08-2020||India||Only 44% state information commissions conduct hearings: CHRI survey||The working of the state information commissions (SICs) dropped from 80% in June to 44% in July, a survey by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) has found.The CHRI is an organisation working towards greater transparency in governance. The survey was conducted by contacting each of 28 SICs across the country via phone calls and emails and tracking their websites. The first survey (in April) had found that none of the SICs were working, but during the second survey (in May) 12 SICs had opened their offices. However, only eight were conducting hearings. According to its third rapid telephonic survey, the organisation found the SICs that had started attending to litigants in June had stopped by July.“We found, out of the 29 Information Commissions nearly 80% (23 Commissions) had resumed hearings during Unlock1.0 starting on 1st June, 2020,” says CHRI’s report. The Central Information Commission began functioning in mid-April.“We continued to track the working of information commissions during the Unlock 2.0 phase also as several state governments had imposed local lockdowns to contain the spread of Covid-19. Once again we surveyed the websites of the state information commissions (SICs) and made phone calls to their offices to ascertain whether local lockdowns have affected their work. This time we found, only 44% information commissions under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, i.e., 13 out of 29 Commissions were conducting hearings during Unlock 2.0 starting 1st July,” the report adds.They also found that the SICs of Bihar, Goa, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh continue to function without a chief information commissioner. SIC officials say that reason for the hearings getting stopped in July is the exponential spike in Covid-19 cases across the country, with nearly 60,000 cases being added every day. However, the inability to conduct the hearings has drawn criticism from social activists for denying people access to information.According to an information commissioner (IC) in Bihar who did not wish to be named, the reason hearings could not be conducted is because the state had limited public transport.“There has been a steep rise in cases across Bihar,” the IC said. “Most of the people could not be present for physical hearings due to the lack of public transport.” However, the IC added, that virtual hearings had been held using WhatsApp for the litigants who agreed to them.“Only 25% of the litigants who come to the commission use WhatsApp,” the Bihar IC said. “We reached out to all of them, either by text or on WhatsApp to see if they’d want a virtual hearing. Some agreed to it, but many also opposed it. We even tried Google Meet and Microsoft Teams to hold virtual hearings.” The Bihar IC added that they had also written to the state government to make arrangements to hold the hearings using NIC software. “It is the health of the litigants and our officials that was kept in mind when we decided to reduce the number of physical hearings.” According to social activist and programme head at CHRI Venkatesh Nayak, the SICs were denying people access to information under the garb of Covid-19. “It is very distressing to know the SICs haven’t resumed work,” he told Hindustan Times. “They have once again gone back to shutting the door to information. There must be over 2 lakh cases pending across the country. This is the time they should be most active.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-44-state-information-commissions-conduct-hearings-chri-survey/story-tMT6otWRcVxyeC0nM7jCNN.html

Two days after India’s Independence from the British rule, the Chittagong Hill Tract comprising 97.5% non-Muslim population was illegally awarded to erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) as per the mandate of Bengal boundary commission headed by Sir Cyril Radcliffe, said Chakma National Council of India (CNCI), a forum to raise voice for rights of the community.After the inclusion of Chittagong Hill Tracts with East Pakistan, over 50,000 Chakmas took shelter at different relief camps in Tripura and Mizoram in 1986. Many of them also took refuge at Arunachal Pradesh. “The Chakmas became the biggest victim of Partition. Our community faced years of deprivation even after these years of independence. Like previous years, we have observed today as black day against this injustice,” said Aniruddha Chakma, vice president of CNCI, Tripura chapter. He claimed that inclusion of the Chittagong Hill Tract with India could be a solution to their problems. The protests were organised at different parts of the state including Agartala, Pecharthal, Kanchanpur, Gandacherra, Karbook, Silacheri etc. There are more than 300,000 Chakmas in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-chakmas-observe-black-day-against-injustice-against-community-in-bangladesh/story-RSF4DA0TfedTz8hqRaacSN.html
18-08-2020||India||CWC flood advisory for several states; cloudburst, flashfloods likely in hilly districts in north||The Central Water Commission Monday issued a flood advisory for several states, warning some hill districts in the north of likely flashfloods and landslides, as heavy rains continued to wreak havoc in parts of the country and water level in rivers rises. The advisory for Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh said there is likelihood of rise in water levels in rivers such as the Ganga, Sutlej, Ravi, Beas, Ghaggar, Yamuna, Bhagirathi, Alaknanda, Ramganga, Sarda, Sarju and Ghaghra due to a forecast of heavy to very rains there. “There is likelihood of flashfloods in some of the hill districts in these states in association with cloudburst. Necessary precautions have to be taken for possible landslides and blockages of river flows due to landslides in high ranges of these states,” it said. The advisory for Odisha, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh said heavy to very heavy with isolated extremely heavy falls are likely over Telangana, Vidarbha (Maharashtra) and Chhattisgarh during next 24 hours. Due to the ongoing extremely heavy rainfall, the Godavari River is also getting good flows due to rain in Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Telangana, the advisory said. The Polavaram project on Godavari in Andhra Pradesh is likely to get around 40,000 cumec (cubic metre per second) and Laxmi Barrage around 20,000 cumec till Monday night and is expected to rise in view of the rainfall forecast, it said.The Indravati River is likely to rise in Dantewada, Narayanpur and Bijapur districts in Chhattisgarh. while river Sabari is likely to rise rapidly in Koraput, Malkangiri districts of Odisha and in Sukma district in Chhattisgarh and east Godavari District of Andhra Pradesh, it said. The advisory for Maharashtra, Gujarat and Goa said there is likelihood of rise in water levels in the basins of lower Mahi, lower Narmada, lower Tapi and Damanganga. Water level for Narmada, Tapi, Damanganga rivers are likely to rise rapidly due to rains which are predicted over next 4-5 days, it said. Madhuban dam in Valsad District is likely to get heavy inflows. At present, the dam has storage of 67.09 per cent. A close watch is to be maintained and release of water, if any has to be done, it should be with due care and after informing all downstream districts including Union Territory of Daman, the CWC said.Other dams in this region such as Kadana Dam on river Mahi, Panam Dam on river Panam, Sardar Sarovar Dam on river Narmada, Ukai Dam on river Tapi are also expected to get increased inflows. The Hatnur Dam in Jalgaon district of Maharashtra is likely to get an inflow of around 1,505 cumec till Monday night and Ukai Dam is also expected to receive around 3,703 cumec till Tuesday morning. “Due to the forecast of extremely heavy rain in their catchment, there is likelihood of sudden rise in inflows which may have to be regulated properly following the rule curves and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) after informing all downstream districts well in advance,” it said.As the rainfall of higher intensity is likely to continue for at least 1-2 days, there is likelihood of rise in levels of rivers along the west coast in Maharashtra and Goa in the west flowing rivers between Tapi and Tadri. “Necessary precautions have to be taken on road and rail bridges which pass through these areas as they are prone to submergence. Care should be taken to regulate road and rail traffic to avoid any incidents,” the advisory said.East Rajasthan and west Madhya Pradesh are likely to get heavy to very rains for next 3-4 days and there is a likelihood of rise in water levels in rivers such as Chambal, Mahi, Sabarmati, Kalisindh, Banas. Most of the dams in these rivers are having storage between 35 to 70 percent, care should be exercised to monitor the situation very closely, the advisory said. The advisory for Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh said inflows have started increasing in Panchana dam, and Parwan Pickup Weir and have crossed the threshold limit. The advisory for Tamil Nadu and Karnataka said due to continuous inflows from the previous spell of rainfall in the southern states, most of the dams in Cauvery Basin have reached very close to 90-97 per cent storage. A round the clock watch has to be maintained for proper reservoir operation and information to all downstream districts as well as to lower riparian states has to be provided well in advance, it said. Most of the dams in Krishna Basin are also having storage between 86 to 97 per cent. Hidkal Dam on Ghataprabha River is filled to 97 per cent of its full capacity and hence a close watch has to be maintained for any increased inflows likely due to the very heavy rainfall forecast for central Maharashtra during the next 2-3 days, the advisory said. Due to water flows from upstream areas of Krishna River, the Almatti and Narayanpur dams are getting heavy inflows and since these dams are filled around 90 to 92 per cent of the capacity, both the dams are releasing the excess flow. The advisory for Bihar said many rivers the state continue to flow in severe to above normal flood situation with falling trend. The situation will continue for another three-four days, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cwc-flood-advisory-for-several-states-cloudburst-flashfloods-likely-in-hilly-districts-in-north/story-hQAFO1x6V5PW4F1YLR22xL.html

18-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||It is yet another mystery surrounding coronavirus disease numbers. South Africa, the S of the expanded BRICS grouping — C, China was where it all began, R, Russia is at #4 in terms of cases, I, India, is at #3, and B, Brazil is at #2 — is the fifth in the world in terms of number of Covid-19 cases. It has seen close to 600,000; yet, the next country from the African continent on the list is Egypt, at #29. Then comes Nigeria at #49. Then starting with Morocco at #52, come another 16 countries within the top 100. Egypt has seen fewer than 100,000 cases; Nigeria, a little less than 50,000. The numbers are all from worldometers.info as of Monday evening. Experts, including some from Africa, caution against taking the numbers at face value — most African countries aren’t testing enough, and record-keeping is poor in many. Others point to the low case fatality rates in South Africa and Nigeria (just around 2% in both) and say the high incidence of infectious diseases in Africa may have given its people some level of protection against the SARS-CoV2 virus which causes Covid-19. Egypt, with a fatality rate of 5.3% is an exception.Also read: Govt kick-starts talks to explore Covid-19 vaccine dealThe relatively slow march of Covid-19 through Africa, and the low fatality rates have encouraged talk of how countries on the continent could well follow the strategy that the United Kingdom erroneously tried to adopt at the beginning of the pandemic — aspire for herd immunity. It is likely the results of such an approach will be similar to what they were in the UK — a near disaster, and a sharp U-turn into a more conventional test-trace-isolate-treat strategy. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage With more countries, and, in India, more states and cities conducting antibody tests on a sample of the population (sero-surveys as they are called) to assess the prevalence of the disease and understand just what proportion of people have antibodies against the virus (and are, therefore, immune), herd immunity is one of those concepts that is always likely to be in the news. Delhi, where a random sero-survey across 11 districts showed that almost one in every four of those examined had been exposed to the disease, has completed its second sero-survey, and its results are expected later this week. It will be interesting to see whether its results match that of the first survey. From Delhi’s perspective, the best result will be a number that is higher than the 23% of the first survey (which was conducted in late June and early July; the second survey was conducted in early August; Delhi plans to conduct one every month). A higher number will mean more residents of the Capital have been exposed to the disease, and that the city is a step closer to achieving herd immunity. A similar exercise in Mumbai (not as representative, though, because of its smaller sample and restricted coverage) came up with the finding that 57% of those surveyed in slums and 16% of those surveyed in apartments (or residential societies) had been exposed to the disease. On Monday, Pune’s first sero-survey (covering 1,664 people and conducted in late July and early August) showed consistently high exposure to the virus across the city’s five administrative zones (from 36% to 65%), with 56-62% of those who live in slums, 44% of those who reside in bungalows, and 33% of apartment dwellers having been exposed to it. Pune is India’s worst affected city after Delhi, but these numbers, while unrepresentative, should bring it some cheer.Also read: Many delaying treatments for fear of Covid, putting their lives at risk, say doctorsPune’s numbers are close to the new estimates for herd immunity that experts are moving towards. A paper released on August 14 in Science, based on a mathematical model by researchers at the University of Nottingham and Stockholm University that took into account differences in age and activity levels in a population found that the herd immunity for Covid-19 could be around 40% (a June news report based on the same research put the number at 43%). The model does not take into account two other factors: not everyone exposed to the disease gets infected; and not everyone who gets infected passes it on to others. That would seem to suggest that the actual herd immunity level for Covid-19 may be lower, although this can only be established by more (and deeper) research. Still, if that is the case, and Pune, Mumbai, and Delhi’s numbers hold up to scrutiny, they are either safe or on their way there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-3v27kECrZsxV4LzBciT8hP.html

According to the police, the terrorists opened fire on a joint checkpoint of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the J&K police in the Watergam Kreeri area of Baramulla.“In the firing, two CRPF jawans and one SPO [Special Police Officer] of J&K police were killed. Soon after the attack, forces launched a search operation. The attackers were chased and killed,” Kashmir’s inspector general of police (IGP) Vijay Kumar said. He added that the gunmen were suspected to be the members of Pakistan-based terrorist outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba. Officials familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that after the attack, the terrorists fled with the security personnel’s weapons, which were recovered from their possession. Kumar said it seemed that the terrorists had changed their strategy in the Valley and are now attacking security checkpoints. “It is a matter of concern. The number of forces on a naka point [checkpoint] is less and is normally in a remote area where they [the gunmen] conceal themselves by coming along with civilians and then fire on the forces. We have faced losses and they have managed to flee a few times, but, we will soon find a response to this tactic and end this problem,” he said.This was the third attack on security forces in Kashmir in less than a week. On Friday, two policemen were killed and another injured after suspected Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists opened fire on a police team in Srinagar’s Nowgam area. On August 12, a soldier was injured in an attack in Sopore’s Hygam area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-terrorists-shot-dead-in-encounter-in-jammu-and-kashmir-s-baramulla/story-t8bLJIIcDqCxZ5xQQeLF6K.html
18-08-2020||India||Doyen of Hindustani classical music Pandit Jasraj dies at 90||“A huge pillar of Hindustani classical music has fallen,” poet and lyricist Javed Akhtar said on Monday. “I have been with Pandit Jasraj in India and abroad and I have seen how people responded to him — the kind of reverence and admiration they had for him reflected his genius and his humility.” Speaking on Monday, the day of Jasraj’s passing — the legendary vocalist died aged 90, from cardiac arrest, in New Jersey — Akhtar recalled an event at which they performed together in New Delhi a few years ago. “The event was called Tiranga and was conceptualised by his daughter Durga Jasraj. All the elements of the Indian national flag had to be described through poems recited by me, without directly mentioning nationalism or patriotism. He performed, singing about the colour orange. And only by his voice, his taan and his singing he created the whole atmosphere that the poem sought to convey,” Akhtar recalled. He was a teacher till the very end, his daughter Durga said on Monday. “What he did for Indian classical vocal music was unprecedented. He had schools for classical music all over the world — in North America, in Canada in Mumbai, Kerala and Pune. Even at 90, he was teaching via [the video chat app] Zoom. He had no mental blocks about technology or anything else. He even did three virtual concerts recently.” Jasraj’s love of music really did transcend. The proponent of the Mewati Gharana made his debut as a tabla artist in 1937. His first concert as a vocalist was in the darbar of King Tribhuvan Bik Bikram Shah of Nepal in 1952; he was 22. It was here that the genius of his voice was first recognised, and he was awarded 5,000 mohurs. As he put it in a 2019 interview with HT, “The sum was more than I could count.” In 1995, percussionist Aneesh Pradhan remembers meeting Jasraj at the Pandit Motiram Pandit Maniram event that the latter organised annually in Hyderabad. . “I was sitting in the green room with my tabla and Pandit Jasraj reached out and said, ‘Let me give it a go’,” Pradhan said, “and after so many years, he was perfectly in command of the instrument. It was quite astounding.” In those few minutes, Pradhan said, he witnessed the wonder of a music-lover rediscovering an instrument. “There was no element of his being a star. It was just a musician doing what he loved, and it was heart-warming.” Durga said love of music spilled over and enchanted others around the world. “He was born in a very small village in Haryana and he captivated an entire world and also became a planet last year.” In September 2019, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) named a minor planet the Panditjasraj 300128, the number reflecting the date of his birth in reverse. It whirls between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, in a band of others also named after classical musicians — there’s a Pavarotti, a Beethoven, a Mozart. Jasraj received honour after honour here at home too, including the Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan. The tribute that meant most to him, he said, was when the people of his village of Pilli Mandori built a park in his name. Jaraj was an innovator. In the 1970s he introduced a unique form of the jugalbandi, called the Jasrangi, where a male and female vocalist sang different ragas simultaneously, in their natural pitch, and eventually merged into one uniform sound. It evolved from the idea of equality. He revived old forms of music such as the haveli sangeet, once performed only in temples. He sang for films and listened to all forms of music, including Bollywood tunes. “What a blessing to sing till the very end,” Durga said of her father on Monday. “If you listen to one of those online concerts today you’ll ask yourself, was he ever 90?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doyen-of-hindustani-classical-music-pandit-jasraj-dies-at-90/story-DHVyam4iY8nSrNxSxZxZJM.html

The CSG, which has India’s senior most ministers, military leaders and bureaucrat as members, is the body that recommends the country’s course on action with China.While China wants India to normalize diplomatic relations on an as-is-where-is basis, the Modi government firmly believes that anything short of status quo ante in Ladakh sector is unacceptable with a cost attached to it. Despite being the aggressor, the PLA believes that its troops are well within it own perception of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. Thus, it is holding on to the positions at both Gogra-Hot Springs as well as the green top of finger four feature of Pangong Tso lake while making unacceptable demands on Indian Army posts.According to officials, the Indian Army has been asked to remain in forward positions along the 1597 km LAC in Ladakh.On July 5, the Indian Special Representative on boundary dialogue spoke to his Chinese counterpart for more than two hours .

18-08-2020||India||Visva Bharati university closes campus after clashes||Santiniketan’s Visva Bharati university on Monday decided to temporarily close its campus following violent protests against its decision to construct a boundary wall around the venue of its annual fair. The protesters demolished two of the university’s gates and threw construction material stocked to build a wall around an open ground, where an annual fair is held in December, police said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the chancellor of the central university.The fair, popularly known as Poush Mela, is a prestigious annual cultural event started more than a century ago and draws thousands of people and foreign tourists. Locals and traders — the fair is a major source of income for many — have been staging demonstrations against the boundary wall since Saturday. However, Bidyut Chakrabarty, the vice-chancellor, has refused to stop the construction.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee disapproved of the wall and said: “I do not want any construction that destroys the beauty of Visva Bharati. The governor called me to seek the state’s intervention. I have told the police to let the district magistrate call a meeting where students, locals and the vice-chancellor can express their views. I will urge the vice-chancellor not do anything that destroys the heritage of Tagore and Bengal.” The vice-chancellor did not comment. Anirban Sircar, the only designated spokesperson of Visva Bharati did not take calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/visva-bharati-university-closes-campus-after-clashes/story-NQZFDuDgkffPIHbPjPpnFM.html
18-08-2020||India||Chinese mystery man under I-T, ED scanner||What is known is that Charlie Peng is the Chinese national being questioned by the income-tax department who detained him earlier this month for his alleged involvement in a Rs1,000 crore cross-border money laundering racket using shell companies.Around two years before income-tax detectives got to him, Peng, 41, was arrested by Delhi police on charges of forgery. In 2018, he was a Chinese man living illegally in India using forged papers. To his neighbours in the Dwarka neighbourhood where he lived, Peng posed as a northeast Indian who ran a successful pharmaceuticals business, had an office in Gurugram and moved around in swanky cars, including a Toyota Fortuner, and seemed to have plenty of money.Nobody knew much more about the short, middle-aged, bespectacled man. Until he was caught this month, no one in the neighbourhood knew that in 2009 Peng had fled China, trekking from Tibet to Nepal. No one knew that for six years he had lived as a monk at a monastery in Nepal and then travelled to India,where he became a garments trader. Many in the Delhi police recall him as a smooth talker who knew a lot about India, which enabled him to pass off as an Indian citizen. When he was first arrested on a rainy evening in September 2018, he tried to pass himself off as an Indian businessman. On the evening of September 12,2018, at 6.30, a police informant tipped off inspector Sanjay Gupta about a Chinese national who had forged papers and was living in India under a false identity. The informant told Gupta that the man, who identified himself as Charlie Peng, may be engaging in “anti-national” activities using fake identity documents. Less than an hour later, Gupta and his team were in Majnu Ka Tila, looking for a Toyota Fortuner with Haryana licence plates, that the informant had alerted the police about. The informant had told inspector Gupta that Peng was meeting an accomplice in Majnu Ka Tila, a Tibetan refugee settlement on the banks of the Yamuna near north Delhi.“At 7.10 pm, we spotted a Fortuner car coming and the informer pointed to us that he was Charlie Peng. He could have escaped, but because of the heavy traffic...could not. We stopped his car. He was seated next to the driver. He said his name was Charlie Peng,” read Delhi police’s charge sheet, filed in a city court after his arrest in 2018. Delhi police officers who questioned Peng in 2018 said he was living at an apartment in Dwarka and had an office in Gurugram’s Phase 5. Police then recovered two Aadhaar cards in the name of Charlie Peng, which showed he was a resident of Dwarka and another showing him to belong to Churachandpur in Manipur.His real name, according to police records, is Luo Sang. “In Dwarka, none of the neighbours knew about his past. He had told them that he was from the northeastern state. He had also married a woman from Mizoram. Our team had gone to Manipur and also spoken to the sarpanch of the village. No one knew him at the Manipur address mentioned in his Aadhaar card,” said an officer who questioned him.The beginningsPolice records show that Peng was born in Tibet in 1978. He told police his parents had a troubled marriage. When he was eight, his mother met a man named Li Peng, who helped them flee Tibet and shift to Nanjing in Jiangsu, China, where Li Peng ran an auto spare parts business.“He was not good in studies and had developed bad habits. When he was 18, he went to Tibet to meet his biological father. He stayed with his father for a year. He worked as a businessman dealing in medicines. He started trading of a local medicinal herb, dong chong xia cao. He earned handsome money from this business because he knew the Chinese language and could bargain hard with the Chinese people,” his interrogation report in 2018 reads.Peng told police that he wanted to expand his business and illegally entered Nepal on foot with six other Tibetans in the summer of 2009. Police say Peng’s motive was to come to India and that Nepal was only a transit point. In Nepal, Peng stayed for six years until 2014, living as a monk at the Gelug Monastery near Kathmandu and continued to trade in dong chong xia cao. He told his interrogators that the business was so good that many people from the monastery and outside became dependent on him. “Some acquaintances in the monastery suggested to him to go to India to earn a fortune. In 2014, he came to India at Majnu Ka Tila, New Delhi from Kathmandu by bus,” a report on his confession before the police’s investigating officer reads.Detailing his early days in Delhi, police said Peng had stayed in the Punjabi Basti area opposite Majnu Ka Tila and used documents from the monastery to get an identity card as a Tibetan refugee. According to records, Peng then started importing noodles from China and sent them to monks in south India. When he made money, he shifted to importing Chinese goods through an online firm. “As he knew Mandarin, he was able to converse with Chinese exporters and earned their faith. Gradually he developed links with them. From Punjabi Basti, New Delhi he went to Bangalore as his imports were destined to Bangalore. Thereafter he again shifted to New Delhi and took a flat in Dwarka,” a police officer told a court in 2018.Move to GurugramPolice said that by 2016, when Peng’s business grew, he shifted from Dwarka to Gurugram and also opened a company by the name of Sunhara Bird Pvt. Ltd. According to information of different search engines, the company is shown to be a financial planning firm. “We always suspected that he was into money laundering and other crimes but we had little evidence then. We only charged him for fraud and forgery then,” a second police officer, who did not wish to be named, said.Police then found that Peng operated a money exchange business from his Gurugram office. Two bank accounts --at IndusInd Bank and ICICI Bank--were opened using fake Indian identity cards. There was at least Rs20 lakh in the ICICI Bank account and about Rs70,000 in IndusInd bank, according to the bank account statement details police mentioned in his interrogation report.Currently under investigation for his handling of the finances of several firms and laundering money using shell companies, Peng is suspected to have created a web of sham entities to transfer hawala funds to and from China, income-tax officials said. Currently out on bail in the forgery case, Peng was posing as a businessman who dealt in the import and export of medical and electronic goods to mislead authorities. After his arrest, the Central Bureau of Direct Taxes said that “ the subsidiary of a Chinese company linked to Peng and its related concerns had taken over Rs100 crore bogus advances from shell entities for opening businesses of retail showrooms...”Income tax officials said that during raids on August 11 and 12, they recovered a large number of documents apart from over Rs50 lakh in cash, from premises in Delhi, Gurugram and Ghaziabad linked to his associates, such as chartered accountants, bank officials and representatives of a few Chinese firms who helped him. “He had made it big. He had even married a woman from Mizoram. Initially, she also did not know about his past. He had got a tout to prepare a fake Indian passport from a tout in Manipur. He had money then and that money was possibly not earned from just selling clothes,” a third police officer who questioned Peng in 2018 said, also requesting anonymity.“Currently, he has approached the court to release his passport. He may not have thought that he would be arrested and that the government would find evidence. If the investigators go deeper, they will find more about Peng and the Chinese residents for whom he has been working for all these years,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-mystery-man-under-i-t-ed-scanner/story-bx06Ca03elSLdU2fjP1fJP.html
18-08-2020||India||Functioning of state information panels takes a hit: Survey||The working of the state information commissions (SICs) dropped from 80% in June to 44% in July, a survey by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) has found. The CHRI is an organisation working towards greater transparency in governance. The survey was conducted contacting each of 28 SICs. The first survey (in April) had found that none of the SICs were working, but during the second survey (in May) 12 SICs had opened their offices, but only eight were conducting hearings. According to its third rapid telephonic survey, the organisation found that the commissions that had previously started attending to litigants June had stopped by July. “We found, out of the 29 Information Commissions nearly 80% (23 Commissions) had resumed hearings during Unlock1.0 starting on 1st June, 2020,” says CHRI’s report. The Central Information Commission began functioning in mid-April. “We continued to track the working of Information Commissions during the Unlock 2.0 phase... This time we found, only 44% Information Commissions under The Right to Information Act, 2005 (RTI Act), i.e., 13 out of 29 Commissions were conducting hearings during Unlock 2.0 starting on 1st July,” the report adds. SIC officials say that reason for the hearings stopping in July is because of the spike in Covid-19 cases across the country. However, the inability to conduct the hearings has drawn criticism from social activists for denying people access to information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/functioning-of-state-information-panels-takes-a-hit-survey/story-1WiHY27q6qtinvRLchO2IM.html
18-08-2020||India||Congress hits out at Sanjay Jha over claim of rumblings within party||Did some Congress leaders sent an SOS letter to their party president Sonia Gandhi criticising the current state of the main opposition party? Former party spokesperson Sanjay Jha’s claim to that effect may have been denied by the party, but at least one other person confirmed that a letter had indeed been written and delivered on Independence Day to 10, Janpath, Gandhi’s residence. The signatories, this leader said, included former ministers and Chief Ministers although neither was available for comment and HT was unable to verify this.The party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala took to Twitter to rebut Jha whose claim created a buzz in Congress circles. He called it a ploy by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to divert attention from the issue of the ruling party’s links with Facebook.“Special Misinformation Group on Media-TV Debate Guidance in its Whatsapp of today directed to run the story of a non-existent letter of Congress leaders to divert attention from Facebook-BJP links. Of course, BJP stooges have started acting upon it,” Surjewala tweeted.His reference is to the controversy surrounding a Wall Street Journal story that said Facebook’s India policy chief had advised against acting against an account belonging to a BJP leader for hate speech.Earlier in the day, Jha claimed that about 100 leaders of the Congress party, including Members of Parliament, wrote to Gandhi on the leadership issue , seeking transparent elections to the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision-making body.“It is estimated that around 100 Congress leaders (including MP’s), distressed at the state of affairs within the party, have written a letter to Mrs Sonia Gandhi, Congress President, asking for change in political leadership and transparent elections in CWC. Watch this space,” Jha had tweeted.In a virtual news conference, Congress spokespersons Supriya Shrinate and Pranav Jha said “no such letter has been written or received” by the party, alleging the issue is being raised at the behest of the BJP to divert the attention its nexus with Facebook.Jha was suspended from the Congress last month for “anti-party activities and breach of discipline” following his criticism of the leadership over the handling of the political turmoil in Rajasthan in the wake of rebellion by Sachin Pilot and 18 other legislators.And before that, Jha was sacked as a Congress spokesperson after he criticised the party leadership in an article.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-hits-out-at-sanjay-jha-over-claim-of-rumblings-within-party/story-znpuub6l6ykjtWEaVLoaVM.html

He has been with me for the past 20 years on the path of service to people. The pain and anguish he has undergone is known to all. And we also know how the Congress is trying to put its house in order after a delayed approach. The truth is not hidden. Today, in the Congress, questions are raised against capabilities and it’s sad,” Scindia said.In an attack on former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath, Scindia said leaders of the Congress are only interested in reclaiming power and have nothing to do with public service. “Congress leaders are struggling to get their chair back. They want that they should anyhow get their chair back. They have nothing to do with public service or with the promises they had made to people,” he said. He was responding to a query on Nath’s statement that the Congress would bounce back to power after by-elections.“I am confident that people are with the BJP and in the coming by-elections, these people (Congress leaders) will get a strong reply in the court of the common people,” the BJP MP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jyotiraditya-scindia-attacks-congress-over-questioning-talent/story-vVRSaUXDENiOpqFJqERGVK.html
18-08-2020||India||Chhattisgarh journalist booked for Facebook post saying tribals killing each other||A journalist based out of Chhattisgarh’s Surguja has been booked for provocation and criminal intimidation over a Facebook post.A case was registered against Manish Soni for a post on Facebook that tribals were killing each other. Chhattisgarh police said Soni was booked under section 153 (A), 153 (B) and 504 (B) on Sunday and investigation has started.“On the complaint of one Alok Dubey, a case has been registered but no arrest has been made. We have started investigation and further action will be taken. The journalist will be given a chance to submit his views,” Surguja Range inspector general of police K L Dangi said.Soni is a reporter of a regional channel operating in Surguja district. On March 25, he shared the photographs of personnel of district reserve guard (DRG) who were killed in a Maoist attack on March 18, and wrote on Facebook: “Marne valon kee jaati dekhein aur maarne valon kee pehchaan hone dein sab ek hi jaati ke honge .. Ab marvaane valon ko samjhiye ..jawaab mil jaayega.. ab inhe saheej kahke shaadat ko salaam kijiye aur agali baar kee ghatna ka intezaar kijiye.. adivasi ko adivasi se ladakar hi jungle pe kabza kiya sakta hai …(The caste of those who died and the killers ...will be the same. Now understand the people behind the killings and you find the answers. Call them martyrs, salute them and wait for the next incident. The jungle could only be encroached upon by making tribals fight each other).” Soni was unavailable for comment despite repeated attempts. Interestingly, Chhattisgarh government has set up a committee to draft Chhattisgarh Protection of Mediapersons Act for the protection of journalists working in the state.“Police have registered a case against Soni because he was constantly writing about custodial death of a Pankaj Baik,” said Kamal Shukla, one of the journalists who had initially demanded the law for the protection of journalists in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-journalist-booked-for-facebook-post-saying-tribals-killing-each-other/story-hgk1vXuSJDD3kI1wpxhjeO.html
18-08-2020||India||Foreign secy Harsh Shringla to visit Bangladesh, likely to meet PM Sheikh Hasina||Indian foreign secretary Harsh Shringla will make a previously unannounced visit to Bangladesh on Tuesday, during which he is expected to meet Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, people familiar with developments said. This will be Shringla’s first trip abroad since the Covid-19 outbreak. It will also be the first visit to Bangladesh by a senior Indian official since travel restrictions were imposed due to the pandemic. Shringla, who earlier served as the Indian envoy in Dhaka, is expected to carry a message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi for Hasina, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. The people said Shringla’s discussions in Dhaka are expected to focus on ways to further strengthen the bilateral relationship. He is expected to return home the same day. There was no official word from the external affairs ministry regarding the visit. Hasina visited India last October, while Modi’s planned visit to Bangladesh in March to participate in events marking the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was called off due to the pandemic. The two leaders have spoken on phone several times this year, most recently in May. Ties between the two sides have been under some strain since last year, when Bangladeshi leaders were irked by comments from BJP leaders about deporting illegal migrants from Assam. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the implementation of the National Register of Citizens also hit ties, and Hasina had questioned the need for CAA during an interview earlier this year. India has taken several steps in recent weeks to improve connectivity with Bangladesh, including handing over 10 railway locomotives last month. This was done days after the first container train made its way from India to Bangladesh and the first shipment of goods was sent from Kolkata to Tripura via Chattogram port. After taking over as foreign secretary in January, Shringla had visited Dhaka in March. Shringla had met Prime Minister Hasina during his last visit to Bangladesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreign-secretary-harsh-shringla-to-visit-bangladesh-likely-to-meet-pm-sheikh-hasina/story-tsXna6EEa2qCsXiBPmmZ5I.html

The petition also complained against the assembly speaker for facilitating the MLAs to continue as ministers by delaying a decision on the disqualification petitions against 22 Congress MLAs, including the 12, pending since March 12. These 22 Congress MLAs, who joined the BJP, led to the downfall of the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde issued a notice on the PIL filed by Jabalpur North MLA Vinay Saxena, and sought responses from the speaker and Vidhan Sabha through its Principal Secretary by September 21. Senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Vivek Tankha, representing petitioners, said that the Speaker is bound by a recent decision of the apex court to decide disqualification petitions expeditiously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-admits-plea-on-mp-congress-mlas-who-defected/story-TTRPoDzoOjEgm3EYL0THFI.html
18-08-2020||India||HRD Ministry is now officially Ministry of Education as it gets President’s nod||President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday gave assent to the change in name of the ministry of human resource development (MHRD) as ministry of education, an official notification said. The name change was among the key recommendations of the draft new National Education Policy (NEP), which was also cleared by the Union Cabinet last month. A gazette notification published on Monday night said the President had given his nod to changing the name of HRD ministry to ministry of education. The heading ministry of human resources development stands substituted to ministry of education, it said. The ministry of education was renamed as the HRD ministry in 1985 during the tenure of then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. The NEP was introduced the next year and it was later amended in 1992. P V Narasimha Rao became the first HRD minister in the Rajiv Gandhi cabinet. A panel headed by former ISRO chairman K Kasturirangan, tasked with working on the new NEP, had first proposed that the name of the ministry should be changed again. In 2018, the idea was also mooted by Ram Bahadur Rai, chairman of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts and also chairman of the joint organising committee of the Conference on Academic Leadership on Education for Resurgence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-nod-to-change-of-hrd-ministry-s-name-to-ministry-of-education/story-XHcCZzUeYnFwIYM0GPyWTI.html
18-08-2020||India||‘Can’t waste a year’: SC rejects NEET, JEE delay||The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for students seeking admission to medical and dental courses and the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) for those aspiring to join top engineering schools will be held on schedule in September after the Supreme Court on Monday rejected a plea seeking postponement of the two entrance tests in the backdrop of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).A three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra said “life has to go on” despite the outbreak of the viral disease and the court cannot put the career of students in jeopardy by interfering with the decision of the National Testing Agency (NTA) to hold the examinations in September.“Life has to move on even in Covid times. Covid may continue but postponement of exams is a loss for the country. Are you (petitioners) ready to waste a whole year?” justice Mishra asked the petitioners’ counsel, Alakh Alok Srivastava.The petition, which was filed on August 7 by 11 students who are planning to appear for JEE/ NEET, sought postponement of the exams until after the Covid-19 crisis has passed.JEE is scheduled to be held from September 1 to 6 and NEET for September 13. JEE and NEET, which were initially scheduled to be held in April and May, respectively, were postponed because of the Covid-19 outbreak. Last year, around 960,000 students appeared for JEE and over 1.4 million for NEET. The postponement of the exams has already disrupted the academic calendars of engineering and medical colleges across India. When contacted, Prof Lalit Kumar Awasthi, director of NIT, Jalandhar, said, “The students and their parents face a lot of pressure as they prepare for these exams. It is important that they are held so that the academic session can move on.” On July 3, the NTA, the central government body tasked with conducting JEE and NEET, came out with public notices to hold JEE and NEET in September.Srivastava pointed out that various other examinations like the ones organised by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination (ICSE) had been postponed and sought parity with those for NEET and JEE. He also submitted that the petitioners were not seeking an indefinite postponement, and wanted the exams to be on hold until the development of a vaccine for Covid-19, which, he said, may be discovered soon. “Vaccine for Covid-19 is on its way. I am not seeking an indefinite postponement,” he saidThe bench wondered how lawyers were demanding the resumption of physical hearings in the courts while filing petitions seeking postponement of entrance and other competitive examinations because of the viral disease.“You (lawyers) are demanding opening of physical courts. But you want exams to be postponed. Why can’t exams be held with precautions?” the court asked.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was representing the NTA, opposed the plea, stating that all safeguards were in place for holding the examinations.“The career of students cannot be put in peril. We find no merit in the petition. The petition is dismissed,” the bench, which also comprised justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, ordered.A government official said the NTA was already working on a thorough plan to ensure social distancing is followed. Another petition praying that NEET and JEE be held on schedule was withdrawn by the petitioner after the court rejected the plea seeking their postponement.Sumit Chandra Das, a JEE aspirant, said the uncertainty or frequent postponement of exams were not easy on students as they went through nervousness and anxiety. “COVID-19 is a concern but exams should be held and with proper arrangements,” he said.JEE scores are the basis for admission to engineering schools like the National Institutes of Technology and the Indian Institutes of Technology. Admission to medical and dental undergraduate courses is based on NEET scores.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-waste-a-year-sc-rejects-neet-jee-delay/story-7RGAOR9uLU3z9oXzO4ZjaM.html
18-08-2020||India||Govt kick-starts talks to explore Covid-19 vaccine deal||The government took the first steps on Monday to potentially secure a procurement deal for a Covid-19 vaccine, asking officials of five pharma firms, including three that have candidates in clinical trials, to present a road map within three days of how soon they can produce large quantities and what pricing they expect if their shot is approved. India is yet to strike a pre-production deal with any of the vaccine developers that are in the race for a successful candidate, a strategy several advanced economies such as United States, United Kingdom and some European Union nations have adopted in order to jump what might be a long waiting line. “Even as scientists are working to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, we are simultaneously working on procuring the final product to ensure availability and access to our population. As part of India’s proactive, pre-emptive and graded response to Covid-19 since January, the expert group is holding consultations with vaccine manufacturers to plan ahead for the production, pricing and distribution of the vaccine, whenever it is ready,” Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said following Monday’s meeting. Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe meeting was held between an expert group spearheading India’s vaccine strategy and involved Serum Institute of India, Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila – all three have vaccine candidates in human trials. Serum Institute is licensed to produce up to some quantities the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is largely considered the front runner globally. The two others were Biological E and Gennova, both of which have candidates in preclinical phases. All five are Indian companies. Trial data of none of the India-made vaccines is yet to be made available.The expert group asked the representatives of these companies to prepare and a present a comprehensive note on the way forward to the government by Thursday. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “We first need to get a sense of how prepared vaccine manufacturers are. There is no final number at the moment that the government is looking to pre-order, even though initial projections made a few months ago among the various departments involved talked about roughly 680 million vaccines being required, including primary and booster shots,” said a person aware of the discussions in the vaccine strategy-making process, asking not to be named. “The target group is likely to be between 18 and 65 years. However, there is no final number decided as yet,” this person added. The expert panel is headed by Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul and Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan. The other members of the panel are department of biotechnology secretary Renu Swarup, Indian Council of Medical Research director general Dr Balram Bhargava, and department of pharmaceuticals secretary PD Vaghela.Also read| ‘Very worrying’: Few UK Asian volunteers in Covid-19 vaccine trialsIn its official release, the health ministry confirmed representatives of the five manufacturers attended the meeting with the expert group. “The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration today met leading domestic vaccine manufactures — Serum Institute of India, Pune; Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad; Zydus Cadila, Ahmedabad; Gennova Biopharmaceuticals, Pune; and Biological E, Hyderabad. The meeting was mutually beneficial and productive. It provided the National Expert Group with inputs about the present stage of various candidate vaccines being developed by the indigenous manufacturers as well as their expectations from the Union Government,” said a statement. UK’s Oxford-AstraZeneca and United States’s Moderna-NIAID are the global front runners for a coronavirus vaccine and are undergoing tests in the largest of the trials yet. India too is looking at these options, top government officials told HT earlier.The national vaccine expert group has referred the matter of selection of the right vaccine candidate for use in the country to the Standing Technical Sub-Committee of National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI). NTAGI is an advisory committee consisting of multidisciplinary groups of experts advising the government on vaccine and immunisation policy based on available evidence.The government will also closely track the progress of candidates being tested by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech and Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila. Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) has struck a production and clinical trials deal with AstraZeneca for the AZD1222 vaccine.The centre has already decided to take charge of procurement of the vaccine as and when it is ready. “The states have been told not to approach companies directly for procurement related requests,” confirmed a second official in the government in the know of things, who did not wish to be identified.The first meeting of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 was held on August 12 with all states. India has decided to support its key neighbours and development partner countries for Covid-19 vaccines.India has some of the biggest vaccine makers by volume and is also likely to receive some doses as part of multilateral mechanisms such as the World Health organization-led Covax Facility that is meant to ensure equitable distribution of doses between rich and emerging economies. “This is just the right time to start planning as the competition for Covid-19 vaccine is going to be steep globally. It makes sense to plan for the logistics now to avoid last minute procurement rush, especially when you do not know which one of these vaccines is going to finally materialise,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India.The health ministry announced earlier that the delivery mechanism will go digital to check last mile delivery on a real-time basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-kick-starts-talks-toexplore-vaccine-deal/story-DMDnHJVDs2zPTA9oM2XzHM.html
18-08-2020||India||Naidu writes to PM over ‘phone tapping’||Hyderabad Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu on Monday demanded that the Centre order a high-level inquiry into the alleged telephone tapping by the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government in the state. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the former Andhra Pradesh chief minister alleged that the YSR Congress government in the state was tapping of phones of opposition leaders, advocates, journalists and social activists. He accused the CM of perpetrating a “jungle raj” on the people of the state. The TDP chief alleged that the ruling party and some private individuals were using sophisticated technology and illegal software to tap phones. “This is in a violation of the Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India that protect the fundamental rights of citizens. The ruling YSRCP is using illegal tactics to safeguard its power by intimidating and blackmailing the opponents and dissenting voices. These illegal activities are posing a serious threat to the right to privacy in the State,” he said. “It appears that the ruling YSRCP has now even targeted judiciary, the third pillar of the democracy, as it is facing hurdles from the judiciary,” Naidu said. Naidu said the Centre should take stringent action in this regard. “If these nefarious activities were not put to an end, they would emerge as a bigger threat to national security and sovereignty of the country as a whole,” he said. In a related development, YSRC rebel lawmaker K Raghurama Krishnam Raju made similar complaints to Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on Sunday. Alleging that the state intelligence department was tapping his two numbers, he requested that the Centre order a probe against Jagan government. On Monday, senior advocate Sravan Kumar also filed a petition before the Andhra Pradesh high court seeking an inquiry into the alleged telephone tapping. He presented certain evidences before the court, which agreed to take up the hearing on the petition on Tuesday. Andhra Pradesh home minister Mekathoti Sucharitha refuted the allegations. She accused Naidu of making baseless allegations to tarnish the image of the Jagan government. “Are you an anti-social element or a terrorist? Or are you afraid that your money laundering activities will come out if telephone tapping is done?” she asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naidu-writes-to-pm-over-phone-tapping/story-RkemecyTtBMxOyPb2JUQpM.html
18-08-2020||India||Bhushan contempt case: SC to examine when can a judge be accused of corruption||The Supreme Court on Monday indicated that it was in favour of closing a 2009 contempt case against lawyer Prashant Bhushan, but added that it would first examine whether alleging corruption against judges in the public is permissible and to put in place a procedure by which such statements can be dealt with even if they involved a retired judge.Bhushan gave an interview to Tehelka magazine published on September 5, 2009 alleging that half the past 16 chief justices of India (CJIs) had been corrupt. The matter will now be heard next Monday.The Court had on August 10 agreed to proceed with the contempt case against Bhushan. Along with Bhushan, former Tehelka editor Tarun Tejpal is also charged with contempt. The apex court convicted Bhushan of contempt last week for two tweets directed against the present CJI SA Bobde and the judiciary. On Monday, a three-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra expanded the scope of its earlier order and said, “We like to be addressed on the issue that in what circumstances can such a statement on corruption be made and the procedure to be adopted in this regard, with regard to sitting and retired judges.” Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who had offered apology on behalf of Tejpal on the earlier occasion, told the bench: “This matter can be given a quietus.” The bench replied: “We want to give a quietus to the case but it involves a question as to the circumstances in which you can allege corruption by speaking to the press.”Bhushan, who is represented by senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, demanded the matter to be sent to a Constitution bench of five judges. He formulated five issues, the important among them being, “Whether the expression of a bona fide opinion about the extent of corruption in any section of the judiciary would amount to contempt of court.” And If yes, “Whether the person who expresses such opinion…is obliged to prove that his opinion is correct or whether it is enough to show that he bona fide held that opinion.”The bench, also comprising Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, posted the matter for hearing next Monday and said: “Even on referring the case to Constitution bench we will hear all parties….if we shirk our responsibility, it may not be proper for the future of the (judicial) system.”Since these questions are bound to arise in the other contempt case decided against Bhushan, Dhavan said that the judgment passed by the apex court convicting Bhushan of contempt on August 14 has to be challenged as it suffered from “grave imbalances”. He intends to file a review plea against the judgment, Dhavan said. He referred to decisions by the Supreme Court wherein disparaging comments against retired judges was not held to be contempt.In a related development, the same bench on Monday heard a public interest litigation filed by a petitioner, Subhash Vijayran, who demanded that no aspersions be cast against judges in public. The petitioner said: “Judges are not politicians. Any imputation or motive attributed to judges cannot be defended by them in the media.” The bench led by Justice Arun Mishra asked the petitioner if he could cite any law or judgment in support of his case. The Court gave two weeks to the petitioner to prepare the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhushan-contempt-case-sc-to-examine-when-can-a-judge-be-accused-of-corruption/story-9UzMthZ4TBpmVCRioS45dM.html
18-08-2020||India||Prakash Javadekar urges farmers to plant trees on agricultural land||Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar on Monday encouraged farmer to plant trees on their lands which can be sold and transported when ready. Addressing a virtual meeting with forest ministers of all states and Union territories, Javadekar said, “Farmers shouldn’t fear that their land will become forest land. The land will remain theirs. They can sell the trees when needed and transport them.” With the Compensatory Afforestation Fund money available with states, water and fodder augmentation projects will have to be taken up in one forest in each state; afforestation of river banks and floodplains of all major rivers will be taken up; school nurseries will be developed in 2000 schools across the country and urban forestry projects will also be taken up with private participation, he added.The Union environment ministry had released Rs 47,436 crore to 27 states for compensatory afforestation and other forest conservation work last August.“At least 80% of the compensatory afforestation funds are to be utilised only for afforestation and rest of the 20% can be utilised for capacity and infrastructure development like buildings or vehicles. The money should not be used for payment of salaries, traveling allowances and medical expenses,” he said. Javadekar also asked states to come up with an outline of Project Dolphin (which was announced by PM Modi on Independence Day) within a fortnight. The project will involve long-term conservation of Gangetic dolphins and dolphins in the sea along the coasts.Sanjay Kumar, director general of forests, said there is a sub-mission on agroforestry under the ministry of agriculture which provides 50% subsidy to farmers for plantation. The environment ministry is also considering making common lands accessible to private parties with an arrangement of benefit sharing with locals. “An arrangement has to be developed which is friendly and acceptable to local people because common lands provide various benefits to locals. We have received a number of suggestions and requests on this matter. But it’s a complex matter and the policy is in conceptual stage,” he said.“The Environment Ministry had put out a draft Forest Policy in 2019. The policy had aimed to take us back to the 1980s when state forest departments were basically operating as commercial plantation growing agencies with no care for India’s forest diversity or the relationships between communities and forests. The 2019 policy was heavily criticised by many for various reasons and it never got finalised. This new announcement by the minister reflects this draft policy and it may take us back to those years of heavily funded plantation forestry. The policy is completely unsuitable for the new ecological realities we are in today,” said Manju Menon, senior fellow, Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/javadekar-urges-farmers-to-plant-trees-on-agri-land/story-TbBTDnwsM2n4cytMqitPnM.html
18-08-2020||India||Delhi committee likely to probe Facebook officials over charges||New Delhi: The Delhi Assembly’s peace and harmony committee on Monday said it will soon summon Facebook India executives including its public policy director Ankhi Das as it seeks to investigate alleged instances of “intentional and deliberate inaction” by the social media company to curtail hate speech by members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The committee, headed by Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Rajendra Nagar, Raghav Chadha, said it had received “several complaints” after the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on August 14 published a report titled Facebook hate speech rules collide with Indian politics. The WSJ report alleged that Facebook executives, particularly Das, cited business imperatives while choosing not to apply hate speech rules to at least four individuals and groups linked to the BJP, despite them being internally flagged for promoting or participating in violence.Chadha said the committee will also investigate whether Facebook executives were complicit in the alleged orchestration of the February riots in northeast Delhi riots that left 53 people dead and around 400 injured.“Delhi Assembly’s committee on peace and harmony has received several complaints emanating from a scathing article published in the WSJ. These complaints pertain to the alleged role of Facebook in deliberate and willful inaction on the part of the social media company to rein in hate speech and to impose and implement its own policies when it comes to curbing hate mongers. The complaints prima facie indicate that Facebook allegedly provided a platform for breeding communal discord. The committee has evaluated the complaints and has come to the conclusion that immediate cognisance of the matter is required. The proceedings of the committee have been set in motion from Monday,” Chadha said after the first meeting of the panel on the issue.When contacted, Facebook declined to comment on the matter.Chadha said the panel shall be sending summons to Facebook executives including Das.“The committee shall convene its meeting this week to initiate the proceedings forthwith. The committee aims at redressing the issue at the earliest, therefore, the proceedings shall be expedited in order to put this issue to its logical conclusion. If needed, it will also give its recommendations to the Assembly. The sole intention is to ensure and promote peace and harmony in the NCT {national capital territory} of Delhi. No unholy nexus or no alliance between a social media platform and hate mongers can be allowed to breed with a view to disturbing the communal harmony in the city,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-committee-likely-to-probe-facebook-officials-over-charges/story-P1vqMTpFr2rx9iUiVsltDJ.html
18-08-2020||India||Facebook India exec files FIR over ‘violent threats’||Delhi Police’s cyber cell on Monday registered an FIR on a complaint by Ankhi Das, public policy director of Facebook India, who alleged receiving death threats and social media abuse after a report in the Wall Street Journal suggested the company displayed bias towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in censoring hate speech.In her complaint, Das said she was receiving threats and demanded an FIR under provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) pertaining to sexually coloured remarks, vulgar gestures through words, and criminal intimidation. “The content, which even includes my photograph is evidently threatening to my life and body and I fear for my safety as well as that of my family members. The content also maligns my reputation based on a news article and I am subjected to name-calling, cyber bullying and eve-teasing online,” she said.She also demanded police protection at her home in south Delhi.Das emailed her complaint to the cyber cell unit of South Delhi district police. Delhi Police’s specialised Cyber Prevention Awareness and Detection (CyPAD) team examined her complaint and registered an FIR. “On a complaint regarding online threats and harassment received from Ms. Ankhi Das, Facebook India, a case has been registered under relevant sections of law on August 17 and investigation has been taken up by CyPAD Unit of Delhi Police,” a statement released by the police said. The police neither commented on the sections applied in the FIR, nor on her request for security. In her complaint, Das said the threats began on Friday evening after the WSJ report appeared. The alleged harassment included death threats on Twitter, threats on Facebook and circulation of her photographs on social media with defamatory comments.In her email, 49-year-old Das attached links to two alleged threats on Twitter, two on Facebook, screenshots of other forms of harassment and the link to the WSJ article that she alleged was being further published in a “mischaracterised and distorted manner” by publications in India.A Facebook spokesperson said, “We take the safety and security of our employees seriously and care for their well-being. However, we do not comment on individual employee matters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-india-exec-files-fir-over-violent-threats/story-vF3shevVZfaOYPm8gDqIxL.html
18-08-2020||India||Charles Allen, author of Ashoka, no more||“I’m very conscious that I’m a writer of history, not a historian,” Charles Allen once said at a literary festival in India in 2015, while talking about his book Ashoka – the Search for India’s Lost Emperor, which had released in 2012. The work was well-received, and Allen travelled with it, speaking at panels, including the Jaipur Literary Festival, marveling often at the number of youngsters who had come to hear him speak about the Mauryan emperor who, over two millennia ago (from 270 to 233 BC), popularised Buddhism and respect for all sects and communities as a reformed ruler. Allen’s books achieved a good deal of success, not only because they were written skillfully — reviewers across the world spoke highly of his ability to tell a story well — but also because they made history, and particularly history of the British in India, more accessible to readers.Long-time associate Toby Sinclair, who worked with Allen on the documentary Bones of The Buddha in 2013, which was broadcast by National Geographic Channel said, “Charles talked about the many layers of Indian history and he walked the land he wrote about. Without giving too much prominence to the European rulers, Allen focused on the men or women in the field who studied India, be they local historians or British or European academics, interlinking different bits of information across a wide area of research. It was well written accessible history backed up by rigorous research.”Nowhere was this more prominent than in the books on Buddha that Allen wrote. In 2002, The Buddha and the Sahibs, Allen wrote of James Princep, an assay master in the Calcutta Mint who helped decrypt the Brahmi Script of the third century BC, and of the legwork of members of the Asiatic Society who studied Ashoka’s edicts inscribed on slabs across the subcontinent. In The Buddha and Dr Fuhrer: An Archeological Scandal, which was published in 2008, Anton Fuhrer, an unscrupulous archeologist who trafficked in forged Buddhist relics, is part of the very title of the book. As a review of the 2012 book on Ashoka in the Guardian read, Allen was adept at putting back together such a vast academic jigsaw for the reader’s benefit.Allen has been critiqued for not adequately acknowledging the study of the subcontinent’s natural and political history during the British rule as an exercise of colonial aggrandizement — an exercise that was brought into sharp focus with critical theorist Edward Said’s seminal work, Orientalism.Yet, Allen was not a stranger to these criticisms. After all, in the same 2015 literary festival alluded to above, he went on to say, “We use that word history — we bandy it about too seriously. History is a minefield. It has always been used as propaganda. We have to look at it with an open mind.”Allen’s association with India went back generations. He was born in Kanpur in 1940, and authored several books, including Plain Tales from the Raj: Images of British India in the Twentieth Century and Kipling Sahib: India and the Making of Rudyard Kipling. He passed away at his home in England on August 16. He is survived by his children and his wife, Elizabeth.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/charles-allen-author-of-ashoka-no-more/story-xY0MCNa26FNPUFuvV4x1hL.html
18-08-2020||India||Govt plans cyber security system for financial sector||The government is in the process of setting up a system to secure the country’s financial sector from cyber attacks after agencies pointed to its vulnerability due to the increase in number of digital transactions over the past few months on account of Covid-19, and threats from hostile countries such as China and Pakistan, three officials aware of the plans said on condition of anonymity.At present, the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) deals with all types of cyber security threats but officials in the administration have been discussing the need for a specialised agency, which could be called Cert-Fin, the officials said, asking not to be identified. “This is a work in progress. Several rounds of discussions have been held at the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) on the matter of securing the financial sector from cyber attacks,” one of the officials said.FSDC is an apex body for coordination between the various regulators of the financial sector, and is chaired by the finance minister. Its members include top bureaucrats and heads of financial sector regulators such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority of India (PFRDA), the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) and the Forward Markets Commission (FMC).“The government may set up a Computer Emergency Response Team for Financial Sector (CERT-Fin). This has been also discussed at FSDC, but a final decision is awaited as the government wants to take a comprehensive view of cyber security” a second official said. CERT-Fin was first proposed on February 1, 2017 by then finance minister, the late Arun Jaitley.Banking and ATM networks have been the target of cyber criminals for several years, with attackers often disrupting operations and attempting to steal sensitive data. In one of the biggest attacks of this kind, the data of 3.2 million debit cards used in India was stolen after a malware was injected in a back-end banking system in 2016.A third official said cyber security, in general, tops the government’s agenda since it can disrupt social and political harmony and dislocate financial systems. Based on inputs from agencies such CERT-In and complaints received by agencies, the government recently decided to ban 59 mobile applications mostly of Chinese origin over what it said was concerns that they may be jeopardising user data. The security of the financial system has been accorded high priority ; Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the matter in his Independence Day speech on Saturday. CERT-In functions under the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY).The finance ministry and MeitY did not respond to queries on this matter.The PM announced on Saturday that a draft of new cyber security policy would be unveiled soon. He said that the government was aware of cyber threats “to the social fabric” and the “economy”. According to the proposal under consideration, Cert-Fin will draw expertise from various financial sector agencies such as the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA), the Employees Provident Fund Organization (EPFO), the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), the Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Limited (SPMCIL) and the Goods and Service Tax Network (GSTN). RBI’s latest Financial Stability Report also flagged the issue of cyber threats to the financial sector. “Cyber security preparedness requires continuous and synchronous efforts from multiple stakeholders with varied levels of cyber security preparedness,” it said.Quoting a report by VMware Carbon Black, Shree Parthasarathy, partner and national leader- Cyber Risk Services at Deloitte India said that hackers from various countries attempted over 40,000 cyber attacks on India’s Information Technology infrastructure and banking sector over five days in the last week of June. Cyber attacks against banks and financial institutions globally have increased 238% amid the Covid-19 crisis between February and April 2020. Ransomware attacks increased by nine times during the same period.“Cyber threats are fast evolving and the threat landscape is dynamic. It will be foolhardy to assume current set of controls are adequate,” he said adding that “the CERT-Fin is necessary though it may not be adequate.” “The combination of a sudden pandemic, quarantine and unconventional work from home situations has exacerbated this security threat,” said GV Anand Bhushan, partner at law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co.“India was ranked 23rd in the UN Cyber security Index amongst 165 nations. We need to view India as a ‘maturing’ and ‘evolving’ category of countries which are continually trying to improve cyber security measures,” he added.Bhushan described CERT-Fin as a grand vision. Unfortunately till date there has been no budgetary allocation for setting up such a body, he said, adding that it was however clear that CERT-In alone would not be able to meet the emerging challenges in the space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-cyber-security-system/story-bHRwwBeFVGLIrA3VMmOaDO.html
18-08-2020||India||House IT panel divided on summoning Facebook||The information technology (IT) parliamentary committee is split over summoning Facebook executives to explain reports of it displaying a bias towards the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) when it comes to censoring hate speech. IT panel chairperson Shashi Tharoor on Sunday said that the committee would like to hear an explanation from the social media company after a report in the Wall Street Journal said that its policy head Ankhi Das advised against taking acton against a BJP leader. Committee member and BJP MP Nishikant Dubey told Hindustan Times that Tharoor could not call Facebook to seek an explanation because the House rules don’t allow it . Also read: Delhi committee likely to probe Facebook officials over charges“As the chair, Tharoor’s powers are conferred upon him by the speaker,” said Dubey. “Rule 269 states that it is the secretary general who has the power to summon a witness.” Dubey earlier tweeted out a similar message, sparking a controversy on the microblogging site with Trinamool Congress MP and committee member Mahua Moitra coming to Tharoor’s defence. “Am IT committee member -- agenda item was already agreed & bulletinized with Speaker’s approval at the beginning of the year,” Moitra tweeted. “When to schedule each item and who to call is Chairman’s prerogative. Amazing how BJP jumps up & down at anything to do with FB’s interests.” Tharoor too responded late on Monday evening, saying that Dubey has brought the “committee’s work into disrepute”. “You are absolutely right, Mahua Moitra, & by imputing motives to my decision, @nishikant_dubey has brought the Committee’s work into disrepute, a matter I will take up. Extraordinary that an MP would suggest that a matter of such great public interest should NOT be taken up by us,” he wrote on Twitter. According former Lok Sabha secretary general P.D.T Achary, the committee can take up a special subject under rule 276 of the procedure. “A committee may, if it thinks fit, make a special report on any matter that arises or comes to light in the course of its work which it may consider necessary to bring to the notice of the Speaker or the House, notwithstanding that such matter is not directly connected with, or does not fall within or is not incidental to, its terms of reference,” is what the rule says. Achary told Hindustan Times that the secretary general is the administrative head, but not all documents need to necessarily be signed by him. “There is a secretariat attached to each committee,” Achary said. “The chairperson can request a third party to come and offer an explanation. It then goes to the secretariat for approval.” Achary added that issue here would have been whether the subject can be taken up, but since there is provision for a “special subject” that does not hold in this case. “Once a subject is taken up, which at the discretion of the chairperson unless there is wide opposition from the committee a request can be made to call a third party.” The IT committee has 30 members, 15 of whom are from the BJP and its allies. Also read: Ravi Shankar Prasad says Rahul Gandhi’s attack on RSS, BJP relies on a myth, asks a counter questionThe Congress on Monday stepped up its attack, saying Facebook’s “inaction against hate content destabilises” democracy in India, and reiterated its demand for a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) into the charges. Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi, however, told Hindustan Times that a JPC was out of the question. “The allegations are a manifestation of the frustration of the Congress and Rahul (Gandhi). They have been disrespecting institutions like CAG { Comptroller and Auditor General} , EC {Election Commission}, SC {Supreme Court} and also the electronic voting machine by raising doubts. Facebook is a new chapter from their frustration book.” The Congress, however, isn’t the only opposition party to have raised the issue. “I spoke on this issue on the floor of #Parliamentin June 2019,” tweeted TMC spokesperson Derek O’Brien. In his speech, O’Brien had alleged the existence of a connection between the BJP and the senior management of the social networking site which he referred to as “de facto campaigners for the BJP,“ alluding to Das. “Facebook’s Delhi office is virtually an extended BJP IT cell. Facebook censored anti-BJP news and put other parties in jeopardy,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-it-panel-divided-on-summoning-facebook/story-ZYM1eJtqaEranngnPAojgN.html
18-08-2020||India||Ready to fight with indigenous arms: Army vice chief||At a time when self-reliance in the defence sector is a top priority for the government, army vice chief Lieutenant General SK Saini on Monday said developing indigenous capabilities to face security challenges was imperative because during crunch situations, technologies developed by other countries would either not be available or be at the cost of India’s strategic autonomy. At a Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) webinar, Saini assured the industry of the army’s unequivocal commitment to the Make in India initiative and sought to dispel the notion that the force has an import bias. He said the army was more than ready to fight with locally produced equipment provided it passed stringent quality tests and manufacturers adhered to delivery timelines. Saini said it was critical to equip the army with the best weapons and systems to fight its adversaries as heavy costs were imposed on the runner-up. Also read: India seeks investments from UAE in infrastructure, defence“Self-reliance in defence production through advanced technologies and manufacturing capacity consolidated indigenously and expeditiously will be imperative for an effective and independent foreign policy,” said former army vice chief Lieutenant General AS Lamba (retd). The army is pursuing a raft of projects through the indigenous route including third-generation anti-tank guided missiles, upgrades of infantry combat vehicles, precision ammunition, tank ammunition, drone kill systems and a variety of radars. In his Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi covered the significance of self-reliance in the defence sector and steps being taken to attain the goal. He said the government had imposed an import ban on 101 types of weapons and ammunition — from missiles to transport aircraft and assault rifles to light combat helicopters --- to provide a push to self-reliance in the defence sector. The military hardware on the negative import list, released by the government on August 9, includes assault rifles, sniper rifles, short-range surface-to-air missiles, beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, corvettes, missile destroyers, ship-borne cruise missiles, light combat aircraft, a variety of radars and different types of ammunition. Speaking at the webinar, Raj Kumar, secretary, defence production, said the government was working on the second negative import list of defence items and it would be expanded periodically. He said that the announcement of the first set of embargoed items on imports would accelerate the process of indigenisation. “Industry will also have to meet the needs of future wars with future products. The industry will now have to shoulder the responsibility of catering to the requirements of embargoed items domestically,” a FICCI statement quoted Kumar as saying. Kumar said the domestic defence industry would hold online interactions with the representatives of friendly countries to understand their defence needs, and country-wise profiles of weapons and systems they may require would be prepared to promote exports. From raising foreign direct investment (FDI) limits in defence manufacturing to creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware and notifying a list of weapons/equipment that cannot be imported, the government had announced a raft of measures to boost self-reliance in the defence sector in May 2020. Imports account for 60-65% of the country’s military requirements and it has signed contracts worth billions of dollars during the last decade for weapons and systems including fighter jets, air defence missile systems, submarine hunter planes, attack helicopters, heavy-lift choppers and lightweight howitzers. India was the third-biggest military spender in the world last year after the United States and China, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) said in a report released in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-to-fight-with-indigenous-arms-army-vice-chief/story-3vaa2jxUYwXgz592xPtY5K.html
18-08-2020||India||Modi-Abe summit likely in early Sept||New Delhi: The much-awaited summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is scheduled to take place next month with the signing of the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) on the cards and the possibility of some Japanese manufacturers shifting production to India from China. The December 15-17, 2019 summit in Guwahati was postponed because of protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act , or CAA, in Assam.According to South Block officials, the virtual summit between Modi and Abe will be held on September 10, subject to the health of Abe. It will take place at a time when both countries are facing off with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in Ladakh and the Senkaku Islands, respectively.The virtual summit will not only discuss the Chinese aggression in Ladakh and the South China Sea, but also cement the QUAD, a four-nation strategic forum, with both the US and Australia ready to deter Beijing’s wolf warrior diplomacy and keep the sea lanes of communication open for freedom of navigation. While the decision of inviting Australia to the Malabar naval exercises at the end of the year is more or less a mere formality, the two leaders will discuss the Indo-Pacific region and the challenges it faces from the Middle Kingdom.ACSA, which is key to India and Japan extending logistics and other support to each other’s military, is expected to be initialled by the two leaders; India has a similar agreement with the other two members of the QUAD.According to senior government officials, the two leaders will further cement economic cooperation with India opening the doors to Japanese manufacturing activity and perhaps involving Tokyo in ramping up port infrastructure in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.While India has linked peace and tranquility on its border with China to overall bilateral ties, Prime Minister Abe is also under pressure from his own Cabinet members to adopt a tough line on China. Beijing’s expansion drive is not limited to Ladakh, but has created security concerns with Japan over the ownership of Senkaku Islands. China, which calls them Diaoyu Islands, claims ownership of them with any eye towards extending its exclusive economic zone and strengthening its hold beyond the South China Sea. The Japanese are not only in favour of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Tokyo being cancelled, but also want the Abe government to be more critical of Beijing on the new Hong Kong security law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-abe-summit-likely-in-early-sept/story-NczOyZXJHLL60rZaetTWBO.html

The tests are being done across 1,469 diagnostic labs, with 969 labs in the government sector and 500 private labs approved for Covid-19 testing across the country, where the first sample was tested on January 23.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe government has attributed India’s low case fatality rate and improved recovery rate to aggressive testing, improvements in clinical treatment, supervised home isolation, use of non-invasive oxygen support and improved ambulance services to bring patients to hospitals without delay. “The key is to identify those infected early and isolate them in time. The way testing has been ramped up in such a short span of time; it has significantly contributed in keeping the numbers low. The strategy of test, track and treat has proved highly effective, and will be continued further,” a government official said, requesting anonymity.Epidemiologists suggest that India needs to keep testing aggressively because the positivity rate is still on the high side. India’s positivity rate, the people who test positive for the virus as a percentage of those tested, as of August 17 is 8.81%.Also read: Govt kick-starts talks to explore vaccine deal“The cases are still rising and the positivity rate is not going down; that suggests aggressive testing should continue as transmission cycle has not been completely broken yet. The virus is still in circulation. Ideally, the positivity rate should be 5% or below,” says Dr Lalit Kant, former head, epidemiology and communicable disease, Indian Council of Medical Research. The overall Covid-19 situation in India is seeing improvement. While India’s Covid-19 deaths have crossed the 50,000 mark, the health ministry says India is better placed than other countries such as the US, where the fatalities exceeded 50,000 in just 23 days, Brazil (95 days) and Mexico (141 days). It took India 156 days to reach the grim milestone.India’s case fatality rate, the percentage of deaths with respect to the total number of positive cases of the disease, has seen a steady decline. From 3.33% on June 8, the death rate dropped to 1.92% as of August 17, suggesting the measures that the government has taken to curb the viral outbreak are working well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-30-million-samples-tested-for-covid-19-health-ministry/story-tqmcsBxFo2bOpyzKlDzqdI.html
18-08-2020||India||Pune Covid-19 sero survey suggests 51.5% have antibodies||The first sero survey conducted in Pune has revealed that 51.5% of the residents of five areas of the city highly affected by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have developed antibodies against the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease. A total of 1,664 people above the age of 18 were covered by the survey. The study was conducted by the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) in collaboration with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC); Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU); Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), Faridabad; Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore and funded by Persistent Foundation. According to the findings, extensive spread of the SARS Cov-2 infection was found in five areas of Pune covered by the survey . Lohiya Nagar ( Kasewadi ) in Bhavani Peth accounted for the highest seropositivity -- 65.4% . followed by Navipeth ( Parvati ) at 56.7%, Yerawada (56.6%), Rasta Peth (45.7%) and Kasba Peth (Smowarpeth) at 36.1%. Pune recorded 919 cases on Monday and its tally stood at 80,407 cases. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, admitting that the survey was not comprehensive, said two more sero surveys will now start and include a larger samples. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Dr Aurnab Ghose, associate professor at ISSER, said that 52.8% of men and 50.1% of women covered by the survey were found to have a seroprevalence of antibodies.He added that blood samples were collected from 1,664 people who were asymptomatic or symptomatic, but undetected from the five areas with a collective population of 366,000. Those tested didn’t know they had been infected by the virus at some time, which means they could have passed on the infection to more people without realizing it. Findings of similar surveys conducted in July in Delhi and Mumbai showed a seroprevalence of 23% and 36.5%, respectively.Also read: Govt kick-starts talks to explore Covid-19 vaccine deal“This study does not prove that those with antibodies are immune to the virus. For that we need a separate study which is more expensive and time-consuming. The study definitely proves that the spread of the virus is across all socio-economic strata. Serological testing for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a representative sample population can estimate the cumulative incidence of infection in the population,” said Ghose of ISSER.The study will now help the administration take necessary steps to contain the spread, said divisional commissioner Rao. “It is true that we are at the peak and there is no denying that. This study will help us draw measures to reduce the spread. Pune city’s testing has been ramped up and contact tracing is completed in 2-3 days. We will now test even more and also the other two sero surveys will also help us understand the situation even better,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pune-survey-suggests-51-5-have-antibodies/story-9MlFUJfmiWnNOrzujCwKIP.html
18-08-2020||India||Only quarter percent of 80 million migrants got govt food aid||States were able to hand out free food under a federal programme to a mere quarter percent of an estimated 80 million undocumented migrant workers who fled distressing conditions in cities during the recent lockdown, data cited before a parliamentary panel show. The Union government’s target of reaching free food to an estimated 80 million migrant workers has been impacted by significant last-mile bottlenecks in various states which are overwhelmed by migration from cities due to the coronavirus pandemic, official data show. The Biju Janata Dal’s Bahtruhari Mahtab, who is chairman of the labour standing committee, at a review Monday sought information about the progress of free food-grains programme for migrants. Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayThis programme aimed to reach food to a large section of the country’s migrant population who otherwise don’t opt for regular cheap rations because they are scattered across the country. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had in May announced providing 800,000 tonne of emergency ration to the estimated 80 million migrants under the Union government’s Atma Nirbhar Bharat programme for distribution during May and June. Each migrant is entitled to receive up to 5 kg foodgrains a month free. The Mahtab-led panel was informed that out of the 800,000 tonne foodgrain to be allotted to 80 million migrant undocumented migrant workers, slightly over 600,000 tonne food grains had been withdrawn by states. Till August 5, just over 200,000 tonne had been distributed to 20.3 million beneficiaries. The food secretary said states were slow distributing the food aid. Food secretary Sudhangshu Pandey informed the parliamentary panel that guidelines for distribution had been strengthened and said states were slow to reach food to migrants. Data accessed by HT show state authorities, overwhelmed by largescale migration, were able to hand out a mere 10.9% of cereals they had drawn from federally-held stocks in back in May. In June, state governments were able to distribute just 7.5% of the total stocks they had for the purpose. Food disbursal to migrants not covered under the National Food Security Act 2013 should have been quicker because the Union government and states had agreed to waive off time-consuming processes to qualify for food assistance.

Migrant workers are also provisionally exempt from meeting any poverty criterion. The number of migrants who have been covered by emergency food handouts are far lower than the total target, i.e. 80 million. In May, only 8.7 million beneficiaries were covered, while till June 20, about 6 million received ration. Cumulatively, over the two months so far, 14.7 million migrants received food handouts. That’s only nearly 18% of the total number targeted.

States should not rely on just the public distribution route, which would have been overwhelmed, nor should federal authorities insist on it,” said economist Abhijit Sen, who oversaw policymaking in the erstwhile Planning Commission. Authorities should distribute food at any convenient point for migrants, whether it is a “bus-stop or quarantine centres”, he said. The lockdown has pushed migrant workers and day-wagers into a survival battle, as they fled urban economic hubs in large numbers back to home states. Bihar and Jharkhand account for the largest number of migrants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-quarter-of-80-million-migrants-got-govt-food-aid/story-HBnQrzNtYhrrPqPn1npWvO.html
18-08-2020||India||Aviation industry may take a big hit: Govt note||Domestic and international air traffic to and from India may decline by at least 50% in the current financial year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, causing significant job losses and force some airlines to ground aircraft to tide over the situation, according to an official note reviewed by Hindustan Times on Monday.Meanwhile, the tourism ministry has cited Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) estimates to suggest that the loss of revenue to tourism can range between Rs 72,000 crore and Rs 1.58 lakh crores in 2020-21. According to the ministry, branded hotels will take the biggest hit in the tourism sector, followed by tour operators. Also read: Plan for Covid-19 test at airport for international flyersThe civil aviation ministry’s note also stated that the sector and its stakeholders were focusing on reforms for a sustainable, safe and efficient revival of the aviation industry. The government suspended domestic and international flights in March to control the spread of the coronavirus disease pandemic; they have since resumed in a limited way. India, which witnessed double-digit growth in air traffic before the Covid-19 pandemic, is staring at “a significant hit on airline and airport revenue,” the official note said. Based on the preliminary estimates by airlines,the sector may be set for a reduction of 50-60% in international traffic and up to a 50% drop in domestic traffic, the note said. It also added that “there might be a significant but temporary loss of both direct and indirect jobs in the sector.” It also estimated that due to such losses, “it is also likely that some aircraft may have to be grounded” and “a significant reduction is also expected in the air cargo handled at airports across India.” Click here for complete coronavirus coverage India has two full service airlines, Air India and Vistara, apart from budget carriers IndiGo, SpiceJet, GoAir and Air Asia. Apart from these airlines, there are some small airlines that, along with Indigo, operate on routes under the Udaan scheme, meant to improve regional air connectivity and make air travel affordable to the masses.. Kapil Kaul, CEO of aviation consultancy Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) - India, said: “The entire civil aviation sector is at a breaking point. CAPA expects domestic traffic to decline by over 60% and international traffic by 70-80 % in financial year 2021. Work force impact is likely to be over 30% for the entire aviation sector. Airlines are expected to have around 250 surplus aircraft in the current financial year. We expect the industry to see pre-Covid traffic only by the end of financial year 2023.”According to aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation, domestic air passenger traffic slumped 82.3% in July compared with the same month a year ago. From January to July, airlines carried a total of 37.28 million passengers, a decline of 54.84% compared to the corresponding period a year ago. The aviation ministry has restarted domestic flights in many major routes and while scheduled international flights are still not allowed, it has created bilateral travel bubbles and allowed special repatriation flights both by Indian carriers and foreign airliners to carry stranded citizens back home. At present the centre has allowed only 45% capacity utilisation on domestic routes. Domestic flights were allowed to resume from May 25, two months after a blanket suspension since the first lockdown was announced. The Centre has also extended the suspension of international flights until August 31. “Traffic projections will depend entirely on the behaviour of the Covid-19 disease. Our traffic footfall is slowly picking up each month now since the lockdown (ended). As on August 16, there were 947 departure flights ferrying 93,639 passengers. Comparing the numbers from July 16 where there were 783 departure flights ferrying 61,772 passengers, there has been a big improvement . We are expecting it to pick up significantly over the next two three months,” civil aviation ministry spokesperson Rajeev Jain said. The ministry’s note added that greater clarity will emerge in the next few months; and that the potential impact of Covid-19 on the aviation sector will depend on the intensity, duration and spread of the viral disease. According to credit rating agency CRISIL, Indian airlines will face a revenue loss of Rs 1.3 lakh crore between fiscal 2020 and 2022 because of the pandemic. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), airlines in the Asia-Pacific region will be the hardest hit by the health crisis, with losses expected to be around $29 billion for 2020. This is more than a third of the $84.3 billion industry losses globally. For India alone, IATA expected passenger demand in 2020 to shrink by 49% compared to last year. The potential impact on employment in the aviation and sectors dependent on it could be to the tune of 3 million jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aviation-industry-may-take-a-big-hit-govt-note/story-pIS4Dhx3zpcYnRCSMd3AhI.html
18-08-2020||India||SC to decide on Tuesday if PM CARES Fund violates Disaster Management law||The Supreme Court will pronounce its judgment on Tuesday on a plea that all contributions made to the PM CARES Fund till date should be transferred to the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), a statutory fund created under section 46 of the Disaster Management Act of 2005 (DM Act).The verdict, which will be pronounced by a three-judge bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan, will also decide whether the PM Cares Fund violates the legal provisions contained in the DM Act.The petitioner NGO, Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) had claimed that PM CARES Fund was set up in violation of the legal mandate under the DM Act as per which any grant made by any person or institution for the purpose of disaster management should be compulsorily credited to NDRF.The PM Cares Fund was set up by the central government on March 28 as a public charitable trust with the primary objective of dealing with any kind of emergency or distress situation such as that posed by Covid-19 pandemic.“Even though there is a provision for NDRF under Section 46 of the Disaster Management Act, the central government has come up with a PM CARES Fund. All the contributions being made by individuals and institutions in relation to Covid-19 crisis are being credited into the PM CARES Fund and not to the NDRF, in clear violation of Section 46 of the DM Act,” the petitioner submitted.The central government had rebutted this argument stating in its affidavit before the top court on July 8 that the PM CARES is a fund established to carry out relief work and there are several such funds established on similar lines in the past.“Mere existence of a statutory fund (NDRF) would not prohibit creation of a different fund like PM CARES Fund which provides for voluntary donations,” the affidavit said.During the hearing before the apex court, the central government through solicitor general Tushar Mehta, had defended the PM Cares fund saying that it was not intended to circumvent the NDRF as alleged by the petitioners.“Whatever amount that has to go to NDRF under the law will go (to NDRF). PM Cares is a public charitable trust. If private individuals want to donate, they can do so. There are several public charitable trusts getting donations,” Mehta argued.The petitioner through their counsel, senior advocate Dushyant Dave had pointed out that PM Cares was not being audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) but by private auditors.“This government believes in transparency. Why should private auditors audit it (PM Cares)? NDRF under the DM Act is audited by CAG,” Dave had said.The bench, which also comprised justices R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah, had reserved its judgment in the case on July 27.Another petition against the PM CARES Fund filed by Rajasthan government in June, is also pending before the Supreme Court. The Rajasthan government has challenged exclusion of contributions made towards Chief Minister’s Relief Fund (CMRF) meant for Covid-19 mitigation from the purview of corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities while allowing contributions made to PM CARES Fund as CSR, stating that it is irrational and violates Article 14. That petition will be heard separately.The Companies Act of 2013 mandates that corporates having net worth of at least Rs. 500 crore or turnover of Rs. 1,000 crore or more or a net profit of at least Rs. 5 crore during the immediately preceding financial year have to spend at least 2 per cent of their profits towards activities listed as CSR activities under schedule VII of the Act.“To allow the PM CARES Fund for Covid-19 as CSR but to exclude the CMRF for the very same purposes is creating a distinction without a difference. This is gross infraction of Art. 14 of Constitution of India,” the Rajasthan government had told the apex court.This argument was also raised by senior counsel Kapil Sibal, who was appearing for an intervener, in the CPIL petition. Sibal had pointed out that contributions made towards PM Cares come within the purview of CSR and corporates would, therefore, prefer making donations to PM Cares. “There are CSR benefits attached to this fund. Why will any person contribute to NDRF when they get so much relief under PM Cares?” Sibal had asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-decide-on-tuesday-if-pm-cares-fund-violates-disaster-management-law/story-74Nqo9Dzn41HCIJwzHJ3mL.html
18-08-2020||India||Army denies Uttarakhand jawan succumbed to injuries in Galwan clash, says he died of cancer,||A day after 42-year-old army jawan was cremated by his family in his hometown in Nainital, Indian Army authorities on Monday denied that he succumbed to injuries suffered in Galwan Valley clash but died of colon cancer for which he was undergoing treatment at command hospital in Chandimandir. On Sunday, the jawan identified as Havildar Bishan Singh, a native of Haldwani, was cremated by his family members. They claimed that he died during treatment after suffering injuries during the Galwan Valley clash with Chinese troops in June this year. The denial was given by the Army in a statement issued by it stating, “Reports in a section of media on the death of Hav Bishan Singh of 17 KUMAON attributing it to Galwan are not true.” “The individual was a case of Colon Cancer admitted to GH Leh on 29 June. He was later shifted to CH Chandimandir on 03 July and passed away at 1:30 AM on 15 August 20.” Clarifying the development, Singh’s younger brother Jagat Singh, who retired from Indian Army as Naik in 2014, said, “He had suffered internal injuries in Pangong Lake clash on May 5 and not in the Galwan Valley” “His son while speaking to media persons on Sunday got confused between the two and mentioned Galwan instead of Pangong Lake where he was posted with his unit 17 Kumaon,” said Jagat. Jagat Singh however, insisted that his deceased brother didn’t inform them about the colon cancer earlier and was perfectly fine. “I only got to know from the doctor on August 11 when I went to visit him at the army command hospital in Chandimandir where he was undergoing treatment and later succumbed.” Editor’s note: An earlier version of the story went by the family’s claims and said the soldier died due to his injuries. The error is regretted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/galwan-clash-soldier-succumbs-to-injuries-cremated-in-his-home-district-nainital/story-V0NWOIDFDZOnfTOo8abMyN.html
18-08-2020||Editorials||A tribute to Pandit Jasraj | HT Editorial||With his masterly virtuosity and incomparable voice, Pandit Jasraj, who passed away on August 17 at 90, was one of the greatest proponents of Hindustani classical music. But his reputation was built on a range of other equally important qualities, which will define his legacy. Pandit Jasraj was an innovator who believed in crossing boundaries that other gharanas of Hindustani classical musicians held dear. He brought elements of thumri to khayal; though both are types of musical compositions, stalwarts consider the former soft and non-serious, and the latter, a sacrosanct form in the tradition. He also brought elements of other gharanas into his music. He pioneered a form of jugalbandi between a male and female singer called Jasrangi, based on a shifting of notes or swaras to allow for their pitches to match, and for different melodic ragas to be sung together in harmonious tandem. He brought bhajans (devotional music) to the stage defying genre-based hierarchies. And, at a time when tensions between India and Pakistan were high, in the 1960s, he composed Mero Allah Meherbaan (My Allah is kind) in raag Bhairav, a melodic raga presumed to have been created by the Hindu god, Shiva.His music was for everyone — he gave classes, on Zoom, till the very end; he often chaffed against the elitism that adhered to classical music; and he did not stand for false distinctions. There are many apocryphal tales that surround Pandit Jasraj — he also has a planet named after him — which will add to the legend of the man. But one will stand out. A few decades ago, performing in a temple in Benares, a deer came close to him and stood as though mesmerised, while the musician sang with his eyes closed. When he opened them and saw his unusual audience, Pandit Jasraj folded his hands and reportedly murmured, “Jai ho!” Perhaps it is this oneness — between humans, and between humanity and nature itself — that he embodied in his life and work, which will remain his true legacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-tribute-to-pandit-jasraj-ht-editorial/story-xcGw8HsuMZhQHvAY7Y6h9J.html
18-08-2020||Editorials||Expand the welfare ambit | HT Editorial||The Centre has been unable to meet its target of providing free food to an estimated 80 million undocumented migrant workers because states have been slow in distributing the aid, food secretary S Pandey has informed a parliamentary panel, according to a report in this newspaper on Tuesday. In May, the Centre announced that it will provide 800,000 tonnes of ration to 80 million migrants and each will receive up to five kg food grains a month free. But, to date, a little over 600,000 tonnes food grains had been lifted by states; and only 200,000 tonnes had been distributed to 20.3 million beneficiaries. Civil society groups too, based on ground-level research, have suggested that a large pool of migrant workers are struggling for both food and livelihood.The challenges are complex. There are pre-existing weaknesses in the delivery system of states, an outcome of a more generic problem of limited State capacity. Many migrant workers don’t have ration cards to access the public distribution system (PDS) — the plan envisages access to ration even without cards, but this has not translated on the ground. Many also don’t have job cards for the Mahatma Gandhi Nation Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). In addition, many migrants choose not to opt for the rural job scheme because of subsistence wages. Economists also point out that despite the enhanced budget of the scheme, which is now a little over Rs 1 lakh crore, it is only one-third of what the Centre needs to spend to provide employment to the 140 million job card holders for 100 days of work at Rs 200 per day, which translates to Rs 2.8 lakh crore.With the economy contracting and jobs scarce, the Centre must ensure that the social safety net is strengthened by infusing more funds in the job scheme (possibly expanding the scope of work) and universalising the PDS. In addition, there is a need to add a nutritional item (for example, eggs) in the PDS basket (a suggestion that the Niti Aayog is working on for its 15-year vision document); and open community kitchens in accessible locations for those who don’t have ration cards. Expanding welfare is key to fighting the livelihoods and food crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/expand-the-welfare-ambit-ht-editorial/story-ti2WsNNhiNHcfJW9FUuUSJ.html
18-08-2020||Editorials||Joe Biden reassures India | HT Editorial||Offering clues about his broader worldview, the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, has spoken glowingly about India. But Mr Biden also made one or two critical comments about the Narendra Modi government’s policies, for instance on Kashmir. All of this had led to much debate in India — most of which reads too much into far too little.A United States (US) presidential candidate will make comments to please different voter and funding groups. These comments will sound contradictory because, at this point, they are far from having a well-thought-out foreign policy programme. A non-incumbent candidate will be particularly prone to have little or no view on what are marginal issues that do not affect US voters. This US election is unusually dominated by domestic issues, with a sprinkling of concern about China. All else is immaterial.What matters is how much the core foreign policy views of the candidates differ from the mainstream. And this is where Mr Biden’s comments are reassuring. He sees China as the primary strategic challenge of the US, making India geopolitically vital. He puts climate and terrorism as overriding global concerns, which resonates with New Delhi. On immigration and trade, he promises to be more generous than President Donald Trump. His foreign policy aides have indicated differences with India will be left to the diplomats to resolve. In other words, the drivers of the US-India relationship are shared by both candidates and India has little to worry about if a new administration comes to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/joe-biden-reassures-india/story-z5SSesT3omTus19R2PksTI.html
