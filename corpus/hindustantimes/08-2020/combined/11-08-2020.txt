Television, since then, emerged as a powerful medium in election campaigns worldwide.In the Bihar assembly elections, if they are held as scheduled towards the end of the year, a new form of campaigning, the virtual campaign, will take centre stage. If successful, it will change the course of elections in India. Home minister Amit Shah addressed a virtual rally on June 7. He, according to reports, spoke to half-a-million people in Bihar. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi too, has held virtual interactions with his party’s leaders, albeit on a limited scale. While the Janata Dal (United), led by chief minister Nitish Kumar, too had planned a virtual rally on August 7, it was postponed.Such virtual campaigns are possible because a huge constituency of digital users has been created. Over 500 million people in India are estimated to be connected, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently suggesting that a majority of them are in rural areas. The fact that Bihar is predominantly rural adds to its uniqueness. Further, Internet use is more gender-balanced in India, with a substantial segment of women users. This represents a rupture. In the Lalu Prasad era, when Sharad Pawar visited Patna, he was shocked to know that there were only 100 Internet connections in Patna, whereas in his parliamentary constituency, Baramati, there were 12,000 connections. But now, digital platforms have emerged as vehicles for the democratisation of information dissemination. Bihar will be the epicentre of how this will manifest itself in electoral politics in a post-Covid-19 India.But what about the substance of the electoral competition? It appears that Kumar has a tough challenge ahead. His third term, unlike the first two, have not been covered in glory. The administration’s weaknesses have got exposed in handling the Covid-19 situation. There is a degree of public anger.However, he also has clear advantages. Kumar is still a major political brand in the state, equated with the improvements of his earlier terms. Even though his partnership with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has not brought about benefits demanded by JD(U) such as a special category status for Bihar or central university status for Patna University, the alliance is beneficial for both parties. It has ensured a successful “coalition of extremes” from upper castes to Dalits. If Jitan Ram Manjhi joins the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the social coalition will become even more formidable. Kumar has also cultivated the women constituency by providing them 35% reservation in panchayati raj institutions and extending reservations for them in police and government jobs. He has cultivated the more extreme segments of backward communities over the last 15 years and is seen as their leader. The inward migration in the wake of Covid-19 was mishandled initially, but the scheme of providing Rs 4,000 per migrant and economically marginal persons could work out well.If the present “coalition of extremes” holds strong, the election outcome a foregone conclusion. The BJP’s campaign, notes of dissent by Lok Janshakti Party’s Chirag Paswan or the challenge by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)’s Tejaswi Yadav are designed to fill the vacuum after the Kumar era in Bihar politics, ie, once his next, and by all assessments, final stint ends in 2025. Bihar is the only state in the Hindi heartland where the BJP has not reached its plateau. It has preferred an alliance despite Modi’s popularity. After successful social engineering at the grassroots, it is now evoking regional sub-nationalism. Modi praised the valour of the Biharis and Bihar Regiment, and their sacrifice during the Indo-China clashes. While extending the time limit of PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojna , Modi specifically mentioned on June 30 that it will continue up to the Chhath festival in November. Chhath is the only sub-national festival in Bihar, where all castes and classes participate without any social divide. The BJP is also trying to woo young people — all its district presidents in Bihar are in the age group of 40 to 45.But it is not as much the strengths of the ruling alliance as the weaknesses of the Opposition that explain the current moment. Even though there is substantial anti-incumbency, perhaps natural after 15 years of rule, the Opposition is in disarray. Tejaswi Yadav is yet to fill Lalu Prasad’s shoes. Hegemony over any caste — Yadavs in the case of the RJD — doesn’t last without formal political power. RJD has been out of power now for 15 years. And a social movement to sustain the support of the entire caste group is absent. The Congress and communist parties are in a state of drift. Upendra Kushwaha or Mukesh Sahni’s social strength does not match the political attention they draw. Chirag Paswan is appealing to a broader provincial identity with the slogan of “Bihar First and Bihari First” to project himself as a pan-Bihar leader but it is unlikely to yield immediate returns. Yashwant Sinha’s new front with the “Badlo Bihar” slogan lacks authenticity. Even though he was principal secretary to former chief minister Karpoori Thakur, he has not been associated with the social justice movement in Bihar and instead seen as having proactively ensured the division of Bihar. His aides are past their political prime.Given this context — where the ruling coalition has a strong CM face and social arithmetic on its side and the Opposition is adrift, leaderless, and without a substantial caste coalition — Bihar is set to see the return of the incumbent if elections happen.Shaibal Gupta is member-secretary, Asian Development Research InstituteThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-poll-bound-bihar-it-is-advantage-nitish-kumar/story-pyM3mZzOFwWHQTjIHg248M.html
11-08-2020||News||Covid-19: Decoding the global search for a vaccine||Finding a vaccine for Sars-CoV-2 has become the single-point agenda for the global scientific fraternity. No other disease has seen such unwavering focus in recent memory. The public believes — and rightly so — that the pandemic will only be curtailed once an effective vaccine becomes available.How many vaccines are currently being tested? As per the World Health Organization (WHO), there are at least 28 coronavirus vaccines in clinical trials around the world, including four that have successfully completed the phase 2 expanded safety trials. These have now entered phase 3 for wider testing and assessing effectiveness. Another 150-plus are in the early stage of development.Vaccines are an article of faith for all of us because they have eradicated diseases that have ravaged humanity for millennia. The reason why vaccines are safe, and may perhaps be the most effective exit strategy from an infectious pandemic, is because they have generally undergone years, if not decades, of intensive research and development. The fastest vaccine ever developed is the one for mumps, and even that took over four years.However, with Covid-19, time is a luxury we can ill-afford. Even so, the major companies still estimate a minimum of 12-18 months before a vaccine will be ready for manufacture. But so far, the prospects look bright although it will be a heroic act if even this timeline is achieved. It is equally possible that the effectiveness level of the best of the vaccine(s) may not be as high as one would desire. Researchers have used many different methods for making proteins that are a “lookalike” of the S protein of the original virus, but have the ability to trigger the immune system of the host to induce both a neutralising antibody and a memory T-cell response.Because vaccines eventually have to be administered to billions of healthy people, the path to their development is often vigorous and time-consuming. The need to perform extensive animal studies to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the product, prior to the extended human trials, cannot be overstated. Further, careful monitoring is needed to document evidence of any undesirable side effects.Of the several trials underway, a few are real front-runners. One is the vaccine, called ChAdOx1 designed by Oxford University and developed by AstraZeneca. Made from a genetically-engineered virus that causes the common cold in chimpanzees, it has been heavily modified such that it cannot cause infection in humans. Published results on the phase 1/2 randomised-controlled trial of this vaccine involving 1,077 volunteers from ages 18 to 55 in the United Kingdom are promising so far. However, it is too early to ascertain whether it is safe enough to offer protection. Phase 3 trials of this vaccine involving variable age groups among different ethnic groups in several countries are underway. There are other potentially viable candidates, including Sinovac from China and BioNtech Pfizer from Germany, both of which have entered phase 3 trials.Another vaccine that has shown promise is the one being developed by the US Biotech firm, Moderna, based on a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) platform. Labelled as the mRNA-1273 vaccine, it has revealed a good safety profile in all volunteers who received high doses. Crucially, the 100 microgram dose group elicited high neutralisation antibody and robust memory T-cell responses. This vaccine has also entered the crucial phase 3 trial stage.India, with its world-class manufacturing hubs, is a powerhouse of vaccine production. About half of the vaccine requirements of the world are met by India. The Pune-based Serum Institute of India is partnering with AstraZeneca to produce bulk doses of its vaccine and has also received the Drug Controller General of India’s permission to conduct phase 3 trials on over 1,400 volunteers from India. Besides, at least seven indigenous candidate vaccines are under various phases of trial in India, of which two, namely Bharat Biotech and Zydus-Cadila, have already entered phase 1 trials after successful pre-clinical testing.The critical aspect of the process is to develop a protein that must be close to the original virus, and against which the body is able to raise antibodies for neutralising the virus. Any deviation could lead to the development of “blocking factors” through a process called Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE). Simply put, rather than neutralising the virus, such antibodies could do the opposite, namely facilitate further virus entry into cells. This has happened earlier for the dengue virus where the vaccine, rather than conferring protection, actually acted like a silent primary infection.Recently, the Indian Council of Medical Research organised an international symposium to discuss novel ideas in science and ethics of vaccines against Covid-19. Most speakers highlighted the need for adopting best regulatory and ethical practices even at the cost of speed, full compliance of human rights and above all, the need to develop policies and procedures for “equitable access”, should an effective vaccine become available, possibly before next summer.Until an appropriate vaccine becomes available as the exit strategy for Covid-19, people must also contribute and help the health authorities slow the spread of the virus. Adopting simple habits in day-to-day life such as social distancing, mask-wearing whenever in public places and regular hand-washing would go a long way in controlling the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-decoding-the-global-search-for-a-vaccine/story-nZqwqMLJTScDZ7VDKsmmwJ.html

The contractor moved the court and a stay was ordered in the case. While the case is sub-judice, the MC officials rather than following up the case properly so that the contract could be terminated, are seeking advice from the transport department for increasing the fare as demanded by the contractor.”“Strict directions have been issued that nothing should be done to increase the fare and the court case should be followed properly to terminate the contract with the company. The buses are not being run on prescribed routes and are gathering dust at the depot. The contractor is also not clearing the dues then how can the MC increase the fare?,” questioned Ashu.The contractor has been demanding a revision in the fare for a long time and the matter was also put in front of the court during the ongoing case. Presently, the city bus service is being run only on the Clock-tower to Sahnewal route.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/don-t-hike-fare-terminate-bus-service-contract-instead-mamta-ashu/story-vdm6gctsUOwt7rQYpJdHSM.html

Deep potholes lead to accidents every day and water-logging during the rainy season added to the woes of the commuters, they said.District general secretary of Samajwadi Party, RK Yadav, said, “The roads leading to Giaspura have been in a bad shape for a long time now. Large number of residents move on these roads on a regular basis including the factory labourers, who live in the Giaspira area. Several complaints have been given in the past as accidents also take place due to potholes and water logging. But the authorities are not paying heed to the problem.“Whenever the issue is raised, the civic body deputes two-three labourers at the site, but the roads remain the same. A complaint has also been forwarded to the chief minister’s office, also marked to the secretary of the local bodies department. We demand that the roads be constructed at the earliest for bringing relief to commuters and residents of the area,” said Yadav.Despite several attempts to reach him, the MC superintending engineer (bridges and roads department), Rahul Gagneja, was not available for comments.Councillor Jaspal Singh said, “Sewer lines are being installed at the PSPCL office road and the construction is underway. The contract of the Oswal road was awarded but work has not commenced yet due to which the company has been blacklisted, and work has been issued to another contractor. It will begin in a week or so. Further directions have already been issued to repair the road behind Avon Cycles and tenders are being floated for recarpeting it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/samajwadi-party-members-protest-against-bad-roads-burn-effigies-in-ludhiana/story-eCCS4Br5DziGeqxVdhSvJO.html

All hospitals have to immediately start rapid antigen tests. If required, NMMC will supply the kits for the same. The hospitals will not be charged for it. In all hospitals, 80% of beds will be controlled by NMMC. The charges for the beds will be as per the specified government order. The availability of beds should be prominently displayed by the hospitals in the lobby of their main entrance.”The civic chief added that the real-time bed occupancy data of the hospitals will have to be updated on the NMMC dashboard. Bangar also warned that patients should not be denied admission to the hospital. “If the patient’s oxygen saturation is less than 95%, he should not be denied admission, even if there is no bed. Till the time a bed is made available elsewhere, the patients should be stabilised at the triage department and later shifted in an oxygen-equipped ambulance to another hospital. In case of the death of a patient, the hospital cannot stop the handover of the body to the family for non-payment of hospital bills,” Bangar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navi-mumbai-chief-warns-hospitals-not-to-overcharge-covid-patients/story-jzGhvEvmOcMaiFOJUPVabN.html

The plasma bank was set up at the Rotary Club’s blood bank has a storage capacity of 10,000 units of 200 ml each. However, with recovered patients -- Gautam Budh Nagar currently has over 5,000-- hesitant to return to the hospital and donate their plasma, the blood bank is struggling to fill its quota. “Currently we have two units of plasma in the stock. Around 20 donors, who recovered from Covid-19 had turned up to donate, however, only three qualified due to health or age-related limitations. The donors contacted so far were reached through our personal sources,” said Ravi Chopra, managing trustee, Rotary club blood bank. The convalescent plasma therapy involves injecting antibodies from a person who recovered from Covid-19 into one who required critical care. Although experimental, the therapy has shown promise in helping people fight off the infection. The bank was set up to provide easier access to plasma after many patients and their families reported that they could not find matching plasma. A person can walk in with a proper prescription from a Covid-19 hospital and acquire plasma for treatment of their family members. A unit is priced at ₹10,500 for general patients, while it is free for pregnant women and below poverty line card holdersAt present, there are 169 patients admitted in two different L-3 (critical care) hosptials, of which around 15-20 are in the ICU.“We are getting all possible help from the administration, and we are working on acquiring the list of potential donors so that we can call them and motivate them to donate their plasma. We can also arrange pickup and drop facility for them,” said Chopra. According to the rotary club officials, there is a need to motivate potential donors. “Many patients who recover are hesitant in donating the plasma. They give different reasons or make excuses. There is a need to raise awareness that it’s completely safe to donate,” said Trilok Sharma, founder trustee, Rotary Noida blood bank. “There’s already an awareness program going on since past two months at GIMS and Child PGI under which recovered patients are motivated to donate plasma. We will soon start reaching out more potential donors to donate at Plasma bansk as well,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, GB Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/state-s-first-plasma-bank-suffers-low-turnout-of-donors/story-AJwdqwbBhnRJPwTTfuOX6J.html

We informed the Baghpat police and a team also went to the prison and recovered a mobile phone from Sarfaraz,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural). Over 100 calls were exchanged between Sarfaraz and the two suspects over two-and-a-half months, said police officers privy to the investigation. Sarfaraz, a resident of Muzaffarnagar, was in jail since October, 2019 in connection with a murder case registered at Doghat police station. He also has cases of robbery, murder and Arms Act against him at different police stations in Baghpat and Meerut, said police. The Baghpat police has now registered an FIR against him under the provision of the Prisons Act. It states that a mobile phone was recovered from the toilet of barrack number 5 in the jail where the suspect is presently lodged. “We are investigating role of the suspect and also trying to find out from where the mobile got inside. A detailed investigation is underway,” said Dilip Singh, circle officer (Khekda – Baghpat). Prison officials from the Baghpat and Meerut division could not be reached for comment. Anand Kumar, director general (prisons), could not be reached as well. “The two suspects arrested by Ghaziabad police said that they supplied the arms for ₹15,000-50,000,” Jadaun, added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/illegal-arms-suppliers-arrest-leads-to-discovery-of-gang-operated-from-baghpat-jail/story-EjJkVrT7ROojEIraaB7dyK.html
11-08-2020||City||Mohali MC unfazed as stray cattle rule roads||The roads of Mohali have become a safe haven for stray and domestic cattle these days as the civic body has not conducted any drive to remove the animals since March this year, given the pandemic.These animals, mostly seen on main roads, lead to traffic chaos and even road accidents. The commuters said the MC officials were not taking the issue seriously and there was no political interference either as the MC House had been dissolved in April this year.Every evening, one can see herds near the municipal corporation office in Sector 68. The other affected areas are Phase 11, Industrial Area Phase 9, Airport Road, Sector 76 to 80, Sector 82, and Phase 9. Meanwhile, at least five people have lost their lives in accidents involving stray cattle in the past one year.In the last five years, at every House meeting the issue of stray cattle is raised and the officials resolve to make Mohali a ‘cattle-free’ city, but the ground reality is different. In the last one year, not even a single effective drive has taken place. There are an estimated 2,000 stray cattle in the town and officials have been able to catch only 200 animals in one year. This, when every year the civic body collects ₹50 lakh cow cess.Former deputy mayor Manjit Singh Sethi said, “In August 2018, the civic body had even increased the fine from ₹5,000 to ₹20,000, but again in September last year, the fine was slashed to ₹5,000. The MC had even decided that apart from the fine, the owner will have to pay ₹500 per day per animal for its fodder, but not a single owner has been penalised. And no wonder, since the MC has just one truck and a staff of three to deal with the menace.”Sham Lal, chief sanitary inspector and in-charge of stray cattle catching drive, said the drive could not be conducted due to Covid-19, and they were short on staff, too.In March this year for the first time, the MC roped in a Rajasthan-based private firm to catch stray cattle and even signed an agreement with them, but the work has not begun. Even though MC officials have been claiming that they have lodged cases against cattle owners for leaving their animals on the streets, no record is available with the civic body.MC has one gaushala in Industrial Area, Phase 1, with a capacity of 700 animals and it is full at the moment. Four years ago, there was a proposal to make a new cattle pound, but nothing was done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-mc-unfazed-as-stray-cattle-rule-roads/story-6mtWuBCumneEeAOhASDHxM.html
11-08-2020||Mumbai||Covid curve bends downward?||The number of active Covid-19 cases in Mumbai has steadily dipped since July, an indication that the city’s coronavirus curve could be “bending downward”, according to health experts. Active cases are calculated by deducting the number of recovered patients and fatalities from the total Covid-19 infections in Mumbai. As of Tuesday, there are 18,887 active Covid-19 cases in Mumbai, and 99,147 patients have recovered with the city’s recovery rate at 79.17%. The number of active cases stood at 29,175 on July 1. By mid-July, they had dropped to between 22,000 and 25,000, with 24,307 active infections reported on July 16 and 22,888 on July 15. The tally further dipped to 20,731 on August 1. The recovery rate in the city, during the same period, has risen from 56% on July 1 to 70% on July 15 to 76% on August 1. “Definitely the curve of the infection has bent. All private and public sector hospitals being involved in Covid care has made a huge impact. We are past the peak, and we can see a trend where a decline [of daily cases] is happening. Initially, it [cases curve] was stable, now it’s bending down. We can hope that in the next two to three weeks it will further dip. This is despite the open testing policy and the city being partly unlocked,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, senior doctor and a member of the task force formed by the Maharashtra government in April to control Covid-19 fatalities in the state. According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) Covid-19 dashboard, as of Monday, the city had 19,718 active Covid-19 cases. Of these, 66% of patients were asymptomatic, 29% of patients had symptoms, and 5% were critical. Fewer active cases in Mumbai have also resulted in availability of beds for serious and critical patients, said Brinelle D’Souza, co-convener of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, Mumbai. “Policymakers were earlier worried how Mumbai’s medical infrastructure would handle a sudden surge in cases, as was predicted in the beginning. The city now is equipped to handle a rise in cases, and fewer Covid-19 cases will ensure more beds will be easily available,” D’Souza said.As of Monday, 51% of the total 20,162 beds available to treat Covid-19 patients, in hospitals and jumbo facilities across the city, were unoccupied. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of health department in BMC, said, “The trends show that BMC’s interventions are working.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-curve-bends-downward/story-YHFva3ZfbnCk2cChocOJIL.html
11-08-2020||City||Greater Noida authority expedites work on Ganga water project||The Greater Noida authority said it has expedited work on the Ganga water project and expects the civil work on the project—which has missed several deadlines— by September.The authority has expedited the work so that it can start supplying water from the Ganga river to Greater Noida residents this year, officials said.“We have fixed September end, 2020 as the date for completion of civil work on the Ganga water project. The authority wants to finish the work at the earliest so that the residents can start getting better quality drinking water as soon as possible,” Deep Chandar, additional chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority, said.In the absence of water supply from Ganga, all the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors in the city depend on the groundwater that is salty, the officials said. The authority aims to will supply 210 million litre daily (MLD) Ganga water under this ambitious project. As of now, its 10 lakh population depends on groundwater for all their water requirement.“When we decided to buy a flat in Greater Noida we thought we will get good quality drinking water. The authority used to advertise that they will deliver drinking water from Ganga river, but now we have to depend on the groundwater which is salty and does not taste good at all. We hope that this year the authority will fulfill its promise and start supply Ganga water,” said Vivek Raman, president, Greater Noida entrepreneur association.The authority said it is about to finish work on 17.9km long pipeline needed to bring Ganga water from the Masuri-Dehra Ganga Canal to the water treatment plant in the city that is under construction in Palla village of Greater Noida.The ₹291.77 crore Ganga water project was started in 2010 and was scheduled to be completed by 2013 but has missed several deadlines since then. In April 2016, the authority had set March 2018 as the revised deadline for the project, but work again got delayed. The authority is now sure that it will be able to supply Ganga water to residents this year as there are no more hurdles that could delay the project. Farmers, whose land was coming up in the way of the project have already agreed to give their land to the authority, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-authority-expedites-work-on-ganga-water-project/story-SudJXh6P1IS1GphYA3QO0K.html
11-08-2020||Delhi||More than 700 have been administered plasma therapy for Covid-19 in Delhi||More than 700 Covid-19 patients in the national capital have been administered convalescent plasma therapy plasma therapy one-and-a-half months since the country’s first plasma bank was set up at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Science at Vasant Kunj. Two other dedicated Covid-19 hospitals — Lok Nayak and Guru Teg Bahadur — that had set up banks will now also provide convalescent plasma to those admitted in other hospitals, starting Wednesday. Either the patients or the hospital will have to provide a replacement donor or an undertaking of providing one at the earliest. Convalescent plasma therapy uses the blood component plasma that has virus-fighting antibodies from a patient who has recovered from Covid-19 to a person still fighting the infection to aid their immune system. According to data provided by the Delhi government, 710 units of convalescent plasma have been issued to patients from other hospitals so far — 388 to patients over the age of 60 and 322 to patient below that age. The youngest to have received plasma from the government bank was 18-years-old and the oldest was 94-years-old. The gender-wise breakup of the data shows that among the recipients 522 were males and 188 female. Several studies have shown that men are at a higher risk of dying of Covid-19 because of higher levels of ACE-2 receptors that the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes the disease, uses to enter cells. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said plasma therapy plays an important role in reducing the death rate among Covid-19 patients until a vaccine is available. He said it has shown encouraging results in recovery of critically ill patients and should be looked at as an effective treatment for Covid-19. An interim analysis of the clinical outcomes of 30 Covid-19 patients at the All India Institute of Medical Science found that the number of deaths remained the same among those who received convalescent plasma and those who didn’t. A large study of 20,000 patients spearheaded by the Mayo clinic in the United States found the therapy to be safe, it did not establish efficacy of the therapy. A study from China in April showed that there was improvement in clinical parameters such as oxygen saturation in patient who received the therapy, but the scientists noted that larger studies were needed to prove the effectiveness of the therapy. “However, none of the studies so far have shown mortality benefit of this therapy, or any other therapy for that matter. However, we have seen that it reduces the severity and the recovery time for the infection,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/more-than-700-have-been-administered-plasma-therapy-for-covid-19-in-delhi/story-QnyXABzPbDFEFqHzi9he1M.html

An effigy of MP Bittu was also burned.Lambasting the police department for supporting Congress, LIP president and MLA Simarjeet Singh Bains announced that they will protest outside the house of CM Captain Amarinder Singh and interim chief of Congress, Sonia Gandhi, if appropriate action was not taken.“A video of the entire incident went viral and it is clear that Congressman attacked LIP workers led by in-charge of Gill constituency, Gagandeep Singh (Sunny) Kainth, and tossed their turbans, while they went to protest outside the house of the MP seeking installation of ventilators at the civil hospital. But the police have not added the sections of hurting religious sentiments even when the turbans of LIP leaders were tossed. Even derogatory remarks were passed on the caste of LIP leader Sunny Kainth. Rather the police registered a cross FIR against the LIP leaders,” said Bains.Bains also alleged that the SHO of division number 8, Jarnail Singh, worked in cahoots with Congress. The SHO had refuted the allegations.MP REFUTES ALLEGATIONSMeanwhile, MP Bittu refuted the allegations and instead alleged that the LIP workers had conspired to attack Congressmen. “I was not in the city that day and did not even know that LIP was coming for a protest. In a video that went viral, an LIP worker could be seen with a kirpan in his hands. The police had to take action as per law.”The police had registered a cross FIR after Congressmen allegedly attacked the LIP leaders outside the house of MP Bittu on August 8 and both the parties entered into a brawl. The FIRs have been lodged under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (likely to spread the infection), 323 ( voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) and 149 (unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code. Former district president of Youth Congress, Rajiv Raja, Congress supporter Abbas Raja among others have been booked on the complaint of Kainth. Sunny Kainth and others have been booked on the complaint of Congress supporter Tarwinder Singh. The LIP had announced that the party will protest outside CP office if sections were not added in the FIR against Congress leaders till Tuesday. Despite attempts to reach CP Rakesh Agrawal and ADCP Sameer Verma, they were not available for comments.SHO, division number 5, Richa Rani said, “An FIR has been registered against MLA Simarjeet Singh Bains, MLA Balwinder Singh Bains, Gagandeep Singh ‘Sunny’ Kainth among others under Section 188, 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) of the IPC and Section 57 (penalty for contravention of any order regarding requisitioning) of the Disaster Management Act.”SOCIAL DISTANCING NORMS WENT FOR A TOSSSocial distancing went for a toss as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the CP office on Tuesday. Even Bains was not wearing a mask.CONGRESS ALSO SEEKS FIR FOR HURTING RELIGIOUS SENTIMENTSMeanwhile, the members of Youth Congress have also sought addition of Section 295A for hurting religious sentiments in the FIR registered against LIP leaders on the complaint of Congress worker Talwinder Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lip-stages-protest-outside-police-commissioner-s-office-burns-effigy-of-mp-bittu-in-ludhiana/story-szhJHsIkrzg4PaDNj6na5J.html
11-08-2020||City||Gautam Budh Nagar took 11 days to reach from 5,000 to 6,000 Covid-19 cases||NOIDA The Gautam Budh Nagar district, which had reported its first Covid-19 case on March 8, took 155 days since then to reach 6,000-mark on August 10, according to an analysis of the state government data. While the first 1,000 positive cases came after 99 days, the district took 11 days for the tally to progress from 5,000 to 6,000. However, it took only 10 days for the number of positive cases to rise from 3,000 to 4,000 in the district . According to the government data, no death of Covid-19 patient has been reported in GB Nagar district after August 1. As a result, the case fatality rate (CFR) of the district has been reduced to 0.71%, which is much better than state CFR of 1.67%. With 5,041 cured patients, GB Nagar stands second in terms of discharged patients after Lucknow’s 6,904. However, in terms of fatality rate and active cases, it is much better positioned than Lucknow. While the fatality rate of GB Nagar (43 deaths till August 10) is 0.71%, Lucknow (149 deaths) has a fatality rate of 1.11%. Similarly, while GB Nagar has 632 active cases, Lucknow has 6,337 such cases. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that the fatality rate has gone down drastically. “The data indicates that our recovery rate has been increasing day by day. Since August 1, no fresh death due to Covid-19 has been reported in the district. Not only that, GB Nagar has the lowest mortality rate among the districts of the state, which have reported over 3,000 positive cases so far,” he said. Suhas also said that several measures are being taken to increase the surveillance and minimize the fatality rate. “Due to continuous effort of our doctors and paramedics, over 84% of the total positive cases have been cured. Plasma therapy has been used successfully by GIMS, and recently a private plasma bank has been set up in Noida, which will also provide free plasma to poor patients,” he said. The DM further said that since July, GB Nagar’s testing rate has been one of the highest in the national capital region. “We are testing more than 3,000 samples per day, which translates to 1,500 per million a day. Previously, when the infection rate had gone up, we had reached positivity rate of up to 15% or more. But, now due to extensive containment, testing and isolation, it has reduced significantly to around 5%,” he said. Meanwhile, the GB Nagar health department has closed down all general and private quarantine wards in the district. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that since the results of rapid antigen kits come in a few minutes, the patients are either sent to different Covid-dedicated hospitals or their homes. “Earlier, we use to keep all the persons, who had come in contact with the infected people, in seven days’ mandatory quarantine in these wards. But now, after testing negative through rapid antigen tests, we send them back to their homes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gautam-budh-nagar-took-11-days-to-reach-from-5-000-to-6-000-covid-19-cases/story-yEhJQi7mLWyFKJIU58ED4N.html
11-08-2020||Chandigarh||Masked men steal 2 cars, motorcycle at gunpoint in Ropar, Kurali, abandon them later||Officials of three police stations at Kurali and Rupnagar were left baffled over a mysterious case in which two masked gunmen stole a sedan, a sports utility vehicle (SUV) and a motorcycle on Monday in the Kurali and Ropar areas and abandoned them later.Sources who did not wish to be identified said two gunmen, one wearing a mask and the other with a cloth covering his face, stole the bike first and then the other two cars within a span of 50 minutes before disappearing, leaving the police groping in the dark 24 hours later.The sequence of events pieced together reveal that the men first stopped a Splendor Pro motorcycle (PB 65-P-6908) driven by Nadeem Ahmed near his village Lakhnaur at around 2 pm. They then threatened him with a gun, pushed him and fled with the vehicle.Minutes later, they left the bike and carjacked a Dzire (HR 99-ABY-8303) near a liquor vend at Charheri village on the Kurali-Ropar bypass road from Pardeep Kumar, a resident of Phase-7 here, and drove towards Ropar. The, while approaching the Bheora village bridge, they snatched a Toyota Fortuner from Ramandeep Singh, a resident of Ghandoli village, at around 2.50 pm. After driving towards the village roads to avoid the toll plaza on the highway and reaching Bindrakh road near a river, they abandoned the SUV and fled from the spot. Officials at the Sadar and City police stations in Kurali and the Sadar police station in Rupnagar later recovered the vehicles and registered three separate cases under Sections 392, 411, 382, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and 25, 27-54-59 of the Arms Act. Police teams of both the districts were scrutinising CCTV camera footage at various spots to trace the miscreants.Call dumps of the crime spots have also been lifted, but no leads have been found.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/masked-men-steal-2-cars-motorcycle-at-gunpoint-in-ropar-kurali-abandon-them-later/story-qETNE1vVV3giommyfOz7ZP.html

11-08-2020||City||Six of nine quarantine centres vacant, but administration against shutting them||Out of nine government quarantine centres in Ghaziabad, six have no patients under their care, HT has found. Officials of the six centres, however, said that none of the facilities will be shut down but will be in a state of readiness in case the number of cases spike in the future.. All the nine government quarantine facilities are for close contacts of Covid-19 patients who are required to be kept separate and tested after their contact with a positive case. According to official figures, a total of 1,417 people have been to the quarantine facilities since March. Of these, at least 1348 were discharged till August 10, while 69 continue to remain admitted. “Nowadays, we are admitting close contacts of positive patients to quarantine facility in order to get them tested. Such people are kept in the quarantine facility for about 2 to 3 days and discharged once their test reports are received. If they test positive, they are sent to an appropriate Covid facility, else they are allowed to go home,” said an officer from the health department. “Majority of those in the quarantine facilities are getting tested through RT-PCR test for better confirmation of their health status. The number of people in these government quarantine facilities have gone down ever since home isolation was allowed,” the officer. Earlier in May, the UP government had issued directions and allowed 14 days of home quarantine for close contacts of Covid-19 positive patients if they fulfil certain conditions. The order said that those having bigger houses that had more than one toilet may be allowed to remain in home quarantine, provided they follow norms and also give an undertaking. According to official figures, 69 people continue to remain admitted at three centres located at Govindpuram, Lal Kuan and Delhi-Meerut Road. “The numbers of those admitted to facility quarantine has come down sharply. Still, we will not be shutting down the empty centres as a need for them may arise in future. If we close the centres, it takes time and resources to make them operational once again. So, we have decided that the operation will be suspended but not fully shutdown,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Like the facility quarantine centres, the L1 hospitals are also seeing a decline in number of patients after home isolation was allowed by the government on July 20. According to official figures till morning of August 11, the district had 966 beds at L1 hospitals and allied Covid care facilities. Of these, 898 beds were vacant. Home isolation is meant for asymptomatic patients who were earlier required to remain in L1 Covid hospitals. After home isolation was allowed by the government, at least 445 patients applied for the same, of which the requests of 421 patients had been approved till August 10. Of these, 261 were discharged while 153 are still under home isolation. Of the total patients under home isolation, 23 were also referred to different Covid facilities after their health condition deteriorated. “Once the patients under home isolation recover after 10 days, they are marked as discharged. .The decline in number of patients under government’s facility quarantine centres came after the revised guidelines for home quarantine arrived in mid of May,” the officer quoted above, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/six-of-nine-quarantine-centres-vacant-but-administration-against-shutting-them/story-OS4r6N1dL3UAmTIhJq7v1L.html
11-08-2020||Delhi||Eight new virus deaths in Delhi, fewest in nearly three months||Delhi on Tuesday recorded eight deaths due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the lowest single-day fatalities for the city in nearly three months. This is the first time since May 19 that daily deaths have dropped to single digits.So far, 147,391 people in Delhi have been infected with Sars-CoV-2 — the virus that causes Covid-19 — and 4,139 people have died. This puts Delhi’s case fatality rate (CFR) – the proportion of deaths among those diagnosed with the infection – at 2.81%. To be sure, this is much higher than the national average of 1.99%.“Today there were 8 deaths due to corona in Delhi. After many days fewer than 10 deaths have happened. We have taken several steps to reduce the number of deaths due to corona. Our effort is to have no deaths. For us every life is precious,” said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a tweet.The highest single-day deaths in Delhi were lodged on June 16 when 437 fatalities were added to the daily bulletin. However, 344 of these deaths had occurred in the past and were being reconciled after being vetted by a three-member death audit committee.The Delhi government had started reconciling the data on the deaths due to Covid-19 being reported from the city May 12 onwards after news reports highlighted that the cumulative number of deaths in the daily bulletin were much lower than deaths reported from hospitals treating Covid-19 patients.Meanwhile, the Capital has one of the highest testing rates in the country. As of Tuesday night, over 1.2 million samples have been tested in the city, placing the testing per million at 64,412. In comparison, the national average is 19,643.Delhi is also the only region in the country that has seemingly managed to turn a corner in the battle against the pandemic in the country. While cases at the national level have a doubling rate of 24.2 days, this number for Delhi is significantly better — 84.4 days. City hospitals started reported a surge in Covid-19 cases (and subsequently deaths) during the second half of June. Since then, the Delhi government has significantly scaled up the city’s intensive care facilities by creating more ICU beds in its hospitals – Lok Nayak, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality and Guru Teg Bahadur hospital.“The number of deaths due to Covid-19 has gone down because we now know that early admission in the intensive care unit and providing oxygen therapy helps,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak hospital – Delhi’s biggest Covid-19 treatment facility. In June — after the centre stepped in to manage the crisis in Delhi – Union home minister Amit Shah had said almost half the deaths in the hospitals were happening within 48 to 72 hours of admission, meaning that patients were reaching hospital later than needed. This, experts had said, was due to a phenomenon called ‘silent hypoxia’, or ‘happy hypoxia’, where patients do not have breathlessness or other symptoms despite having low oxygen saturation.Provisions were also made to give pulse oximeters to those under home isolation to prevent deaths that were happening because of late admissions. On June 13, the Indian Council of Medical Research also allowed the use of several therapies – including Delhi government’s flagship plasma therapy – for experimental use in Covid-19 patients outside of clinical trials. Hospitals have reported use of steroids, plasma therapy and drugs such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab have helped in reducing Covid-19 mortality. The government opened the country’s first plasma bank at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Disease (ILBS), Vasant Kunj on July 2 to aid patients in getting blood-type matched convalescent plasma. In July end, to further reduce mortality, the Delhi government also set up four panels to inspect 10 hospitals that were reporting higher number of deaths and suggest remedies. Equipping Covid-19 wards with more high-flow nasal oxygen systems, scaling up plasma therapy administration in earlier stages of treatment, early transfer of severe patients to intensive care units (ICUs), and preparing for a ICU bed augmentation strategy for a potential second wave of the pandemic were some of the steps suggested by the committee reduce deaths.“Over the last few months, we have learnt to better manage Covid-19 patients. We now know that the patients tend to do better when put on high flow oxygen therapy rather than on a ventilator. Earlier, when the condition of the patients deteriorated they were put on ventilators and the outcomes were worse. We also know that early intervention helps. Be it plasma therapy or other drugs, these are being given to patients early on to prevent a high viral load that throws the immune system off track causing a cytokine storm (a condition where a hyper active immune system attacks the body itself) that leads to multi-organ failure and death,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, professor of pulmonology at Safdarjung hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/eight-new-virus-deaths-in-delhi-fewest-in-nearly-three-months/story-wJSwM402oCXmKwGl4HwOfJ.html
11-08-2020||City||Gzb reaches 6,000 Covid-19 cases||Ghaziabad The district, which has witnessed a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases since June 1, crossed the 6,000-mark on Tuesday. According to the figures of the state control room, every subsequent lot of 1,000 positive cases in the district has come in a span of seven to 12 days. Health department officials said that the district is yet to see a declining trend. Ghaziabad reported a total of 6,007 positive cases till Tuesday, with 65 deaths, as per the daily health bulletin released by the state government. Now, the district has 1,014 active cases while 4,928 patients have been discharged at the rate of 82.16%. The first case was reported on March 5 in the district, while the tally of first 1,000 cases reached on June 23 in a span of 110 days. However, it took just 49 days for the tally to rise from 1,000 to 6,000 cases. “There has been a spike since June when the activities opened up under Unlock 1. According to the figures, every lot of 1,000 cases since June is coming in at a fast pace and in a span of 7-12 days. Still, we don’t see any declining trend,” said an officer from the health department who wished not to be named. “The relief is, however, in terms of asymptomatic patients who account for about 70-75% of total cases in Ghaziabad. The overall Covid-19 cases in the country are also on the rise,” the officer added. Till May 31, the district had only 305 positive cases while the tally shot up to 1,615 till June 30 and further up to 4,937 till July 31. After the first 1,000 cases were reached in span of 110 days, the next 1000 cases (total 2000 cases) arrived in 11 days while the next 1000 (total of 3000 cases) came in another seven days. From figure of overall 3000 cases the next 1000 cases (total 4000 cases) came in nine days while next 1000 (total of 5000 cases) came in next 12 days. The figure of next 1000 cases (total of 6000 cases) was reached in another 10 days.District administration officials said that they are working on the early detection of symptomatic cases. “The cases are increasing at a constant rate. Our primary target is to continue with the present rate of testing and make sure that symptomatic patients and those having co-morbid conditions are detected early and placed under treatment,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “Despite rise in the cases, we have worked hard to considerably reduce the fatality rate after a major surge in June. We will also be observing the trend in Delhi as major part of our population goes to Delhi and other NCR areas for work. Our trans-Hindon localities got affected by the cross-border infection.The current rate of testing (2,500 to 3,000 a day) will continue, and we would like to increase it further to about 4,000 tests per day,” he added. According to the official figures, the district till August 10 collected a total of 138,311 samples (since March), out of which test results were received for 134,690. The total sampling/testing includes 78,686 tests conducted since June 26 with the help of rapid antigen kits. Of the 78,686 tests conducted by the rapid kits, only 1,971 turned positive with a positivity rate of 2.5%. “The testing should continue at the current pace in order to find more positive cases. The idea is that the maximum positive cases should be found out and treated. The trend is still not on decline, but it is a good sign that fatality rate has dropped considerably after June,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). According to the official records, age group 21-40 years is among the most affected with 47.29% share while the second most affected group is those aged 41-60 years and having share of 31.57% of total cases till August 10. The figures reveal that age group 0-10 years is least affected with 4.06% share, while 11-20 years group is second least affected with 7.49%. Those aged over 60 years have share of 9.59% in overall cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gzb-reaches-6-000-covid-19-cases/story-Ruaws96AQqqwV3NHQnRFAL.html

11-08-2020||Chandigarh||Business as usual in micro- containment zone in Ludhiana||Though the health department claims that strict measures are being taken to curtail thoroughfare in micro-containment zones, it was business as usual at Sham Singh Road. Maid servants and fruit sellers were spotted going from house-to-house, not giving two hoots to the barricades installed outside the street. The police were conspicuous by their absence and as such many residents could be seen venturing out of their homes in the containment zone. The street was declared a micro-containment zone after six members of one family tested positive for Covid-19. The cherry on the cake were the Janmashtami celebrations taking place at the Bhuri Wala temple, which is located only a few metres away from Sham Singh Road. Some of the devotees ignorant of the micro-containment zone were also seen walking on the street. Upon being notified of the violations, additional deputy commissioner of police Sameer Verma said that he will send a police party to the area. NO SAMPLES COLLECTED, SAYS RESIDENTAn elderly resident living near the colony said no samples had been collected in the area. “Only Asha workers came to the area. They jotted down the numbers and other details of the residents and left after pasting a sticker outside the house where six members had tested positive for the infection,” she said. Despite repeated attempts, both civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga and district epidemiologist Dr Ramesh did not respond to calls. As per the protocol, only essential and medical services are provided in micro-containment zones. The health department conducts intensive house-to-house checking, surveillance, contact tracing and sampling in the area. The primary focus is the high-risk population, including the elderly, children and pregnant women. House-to-house surveillance and contact tracing continues for 14 days. If no more than one case is found positive in a week then restrictions are lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/business-as-usual-in-micro-containment-zone-in-ludhiana/story-AF1dJ6LxKPtNOvzzVKgtjN.html
11-08-2020||Chandigarh||Cong to bring pvt member’s bill to help sacked PTIs: Hooda||Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Tuesday said the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) will bring a private member’s bill during the next assembly session to facilitate the reinstatement of 1,983 physical training instructors (PTIs) whose selections were set aside by the Punjab and Haryana high court and upheld by the Supreme Court. The selections were done by the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) during the Congress rule. On being asked why the Congress felt the need to push for reinstatement of PTIs, the former chief minister during a press briefing said that courts had set aside the selection on technical grounds. “Also, the Haryana government did not contest the case well in the Supreme Court,” he added. Regarding the registration of an FIR in the matter by the vigilance bureau, the leader of opposition in the Haryana assembly said it was done only to satisfy the appointed PTIs. But an FIR will not bring any benefit to them, he said. A single bench of the high court had on September 11, 2012, set aside the 2010 selections of PTIs on account of changes made in the selection process. The decision was upheld by an HC division bench and later by the Supreme Court on April 8, 2020. An apex court bench of Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice Navin Sinha had said that HSSC’s decision of June 30, 2008, to cancel the written examination, the July 11, 2008 decision to call candidates eight times the number of vacancies on minimum percentage of marks for interviews and the decision of July 31, 2008, to call all eligible candidates for interviews were arbitrary decisions. Decisions were taken without any reason to change the selection criterion published in 2006 which have the effect of downgrading the merit in the selection, the court said. Liquor scam needs probe by House committee, CBIHooda attacked the BJP-JJP government on ‘liquor and registry scams’. “The government is trying to put the blame of the entire liquor scam on the officials. However, our demand is that influential persons who perpetrated the scams should be exposed. Thus, it is necessary that an inquiry committee should be constituted, either under a sitting judge of the high court or the CBI should probe the matter or a committee of Haryana assembly having MLAs from all parties inquire into these issues,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cong-to-bring-pvt-member-s-bill-to-help-sacked-ptis-hooda/story-QZox7YCN0ioNvPvea0UmQM.html

11-08-2020||Mumbai||PIL in HC seeks policy for differently-abled students during Unlock phase||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the state government to file a response to a public interest litigation (PIL) that sought relief for specially-abled school and college students during Unlock phase 2. The directions were issued after the PIL pointed out that while the government introduced online teaching for regular students, no steps were taken for special students.The PIL claimed that 7% of the state’s population consists of differently-abled people, of which 3% are special students. However, the state has failed to make a decision or frame a policy for the educational needs of such students, and hence, the court should direct the state in this regard.A division bench of justice AA Sayed and justice SP Tavade, while hearing the PIL filed by NGO Anamprem through advocate Uday Warunjikar, was informed that while the government had framed a policy for learning for normal students, it had failed to consider special students in the policy.Warunjikar submitted that as no policy was framed for specially-abled students, those belonging to marginalised and rural families were being deprived of learning.Warunjikar further submitted that while the state government permitted online lectures during Unlock phase 1 and 2, and came up with other directions for schools and colleges, there was nothing planned for those who use sign language.“A large number of hearing-impaired students having benchmark (at least 40%) disability are beyond the scheme, and therefore, interference of this court is necessary,” the plea read.Warunjikar further submitted that the state government should be directed to implement the provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act, which makes it mandatory for all educational institutions to provide inclusive education and specially-abled free infrastructure on their campuses for students with benchmark disabilities.Warunjikar suggested that as Doordarshan (DD) or other government channels had widespread coverage and were free of charge, they should be utilised by the state while imparting education to children with those with benchmark disabilities. He added that it was a well-known fact that a large number of persons with disabilities were staying in hostels given their problem of commuting or travelling.“The special schools also have hostel facilities, and in view of the same, the respondent [state] ought to have considered the special schools and their requirements, by issuing Unlock phase 1 and phase 2 directions,” said Warunjikar.The state government lawyer sought time to take instructions and respond to the plea. Granting the same, the bench directed the government to file an affidavit in reply within seven days and posted further hearing next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pil-in-hc-seeks-policy-for-differently-abled-students-during-unlock-phase/story-rdhxbfjI5fwnB6Y0cgcinK.html

11-08-2020||Mumbai||Sushant SinghRajput’s sister records her statement before ED||The late actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s sister Mitu Singh recorded her statement before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday, as part of an investigation into allegations of misappropriation of Rajput’s funds. Singh is the first member of Rajput’s family to be questioned by ED. Singh, a Goregaon resident, was among those present at Rajput’s residence in Bandra, when Mumbai Police conducted a panchnama on June 14 after Rajput, 34, was found dead in his apartment. Later, Singh accompanied the police to a property Rajput owned in Lonavla. However, Mumbai Police said Singh has subsequently avoided appearing before the investigators probing the actor’s death, despite being called five times. On Tuesday, Singh appeared before ED at around 1.15pm. After nearly nine hours of questioning, Singh left ED office at around 10.30pm. At the time of going to print, Rajput’s friend and flatmate Siddharth Pithani was still at ED office. Earlier in the day, Rajput’s former manager and Chakraborty’s present manager Shruti Modi had appeared before ED and left the office in the afternoon. Sources at ED said Singh may be able to throw some light on Rajput’s financial activities and the extent of actor Rhea Chakraborty’s involvement in his finances. According to a first information report (FIR) filed by Bihar Police, Rajput’s father KK Singh has accused Chakraborty of abetting Rajput’s suicide and siphoning his money. KK Singh has alleged Chakraborty appropriated ₹15 crore from Rajput’s accounts. Chakraborty has denied the allegations. On July 31, ED had filed a case on the basis of Bihar Police’s FIR which named Chakraborty as an accused. Chakraborty approached Supreme Court (SC), requesting the case be transferred to Mumbai. SC has reserved a verdict on her plea and asked all parties to file brief written submissions by August 13, when the plea will be heard next. Alongside ED, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has also launched a probe on the Bihar government’s request. Chakraborty, her brother Showik, four other family members and other persons have been named as accused by CBI. ED’s investigation is probing a possible mismatch between Chakraborty’s income and expenditures. Sources said questions were raised about a flat she owns in Khar. Chakraborty told investigators that the property is valued at ₹84 lakh and to purchase it, she took a home loan of ₹60 lakh. Chakraborty has maintained she is innocent and she has denied using Rajput’s money for any of her investments, officials said. Showik was a director in two companies owned by Rajput and has been questioned multiple times by ED for his involvement in the money laundering case. On August 8, Showik was grilled for 18 hours by ED and left the ED’s office at 6.30am on August 9. He appeared before ED again on Monday. Yesterday, Chakraborty, Showik and their father appeared before ED and were questioned for over nine hours. This was the second time Chakraborty had been questioned by the agency. Sources in ED said she had responded to most of their questions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singhrajput-s-sister-records-her-statement-before-ed/story-uWOpMsMcPbHBTGZv4jcD6I.html

11-08-2020||Mumbai||PIL seeks Covid preparedness at Ratnagiri during Ganesh festival||Concerned with the lack of health workers and adequate medical staff to screen and treat the large number of people who will be travelling to the Konkan for the upcoming Ganeshotsav, public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Bombay high court seeking to appoint staff to the approved posts in Ratnagiri district that are lying vacant.The PIL has claimed that as there is an imminent threat of the spread of Covid-19 outbreak during the festive season. The authorities should be asked to fill up the nearly 200 vacant posts of medical officers and staff on an urgent basis, as the existing staff was incapable of coping with the Covid situation in Ratnagiri. The state has been directed to file its response and the matter is posted for hearing after two weeks.A division bench of justice A A Sayed and justice S P Tavade while hearing public interest litigation filed by Khalil Hasanmiya Wasta, a fisherman from Ratnagiri was informed by advocate Rakesh Bhatkar that as the Ganesh Utsav was starting later this month, lakhs of residents from the districts working or employed in Mumbai and Pune were expected to return. Bhatkar submitted that data received from the district health authorities showed that it was not equipped to deal with Covid-19 in the event of such a large number of people arriving in the district.The PIL states, “It is pertinent to note that at present the immediate threat posed is due to the upcoming festivals like Ganesh Utsav, where large numbers of people are expected to travel in Konkan Region from the rest of Maharashtra. Under these circumstances, it is incumbent upon the state to get itself ready for any medical exigencies which may arise due to the upcoming festival seasons.”Bhatkar further stated that nearly 16 out of 19 sanctioned posts of medical officers in Government hospitals were vacant and only 34 out of 181 posts of other medical staff had been filled across government-run rural hospitals in the Ratnagiri District. He added that the problem was not only restricted to Ratnagiri but government hospitals across Maharashtra were facing issues of lack of medical staff, which are required to be addressed.Wasta had earlier filed another PIL wherein he had sought setting up of a dedicated Covid testing laboratory in Ratnagiri as there was none and test samples had to be sent to Sangli. The bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta had taken cognizance of the submissions in the PIL and widened the scope of the petition to cover the entire state. The PIL was disposed of after the state assured the court that it had made arrangements for testing as per the ICMR guidelines across the state and had also set up a dedicated lab in Ratnagiri.After the government lawyer sought time to respond to the plea, the bench granted the same and posted further hearing after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pil-seeks-covid-preparedness-at-ratnagiri-during-ganesh-festival/story-acOhKSBG2jQaX9snooBeQP.html

11-08-2020||Mumbai||Independent MLA, a minister in state cabinet, joins Sena||Maharashtra water conservation minister Shankarrao Gadakh on Tuesday joined the Shiv Sena, the party he had backed after the state Assembly polls in 2019 as an independent MLA from Ahmednagar district. Chief Minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray inducted Gadakh in the party fold at ‘Matoshree’, the Thackeray family residence. Gadakh was elected as an independent MLA from Nevasa constituency in Ahmednagar. Gadakh tweeted on Tuesday: “The Shiv Sena knows the pulse of the hard-working farmer, the poor and needy. I am joining the Shiv Sena as our ideology matches and I have full faith in the leadership of honourable chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.”With this development, Sena’s effective strength has increased to 57 legislators in the 288-member Maharashtra Legislative Assembly. Besides that, Gadakh’s entry into the Sena is expected to boost the party’s prospects in Ahmednagar district where there was a vacuum created after the death of party deputy leader Anil Rathod last week. Gadakh, who hails from one of the influential families of sugar barons, is expected to lead the party in the district. Sena’s coalition partners the Congress party and the Nationalist Congress Party, and opponents Bharatiya Janata Party have a strong presence in Ahmednagar district.Sena secretary and Thackeray’s personal assistant Milind Narvekar was instrumental in bringing Gadakh, who was the founder and president of Krantikari Shetkari Party (KSP), to back the Sena last year. Narvekar is also said to have played a key role in getting Gadakh into the party fold.Congress has a strong presence in politically sensitive Ahmednagar in the form of its state president and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat. BJP is represented by Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil and his MP son Sujay while NCP has legislator Sangram Jagtap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/independent-mla-a-minister-in-state-cabinet-joins-sena/story-4vsBz0XQDff1BCfWXrXoSO.html
11-08-2020||Chandigarh||HC restrains Punjab from notifying delimitation of Zirakpur MC wards||Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday restrained the Punjab government from carrying out the final notification of wards of Zirakpur municipal council (MC) under the delimitation exercise launched in July.The order was passed by high court bench of justice Jaswant Singh and justice Ashok Kumar Verma, acting on the plea of one Kulwinder Singh, a former president of the council. A detailed order from the court is awaited.It was argued that the Census Commissioner of India in September 2019 had asked Punjab to submit proposals of change of existing boundaries of districts and municipalities etc with December 2019 as deadline, beyond which, it had stated, the administrative boundaries shall stand frozen. In November 2019, Punjab local government department issued a notification stating that with effect from January 1 to March 31, 2020, the boundaries would stand frozen. However, in July 2020, the department in violation of its November notification constituted a board and asked it to give recommendations on delimitation of boundaries of the Zirakpur MC.The court was told that the board has been set up in violation of norms as the state can nominate only one member, but in the case in hand, two members were nominated. Population is to be determined on the basis of the previous census, which had been conducted in 2011, after which the delimitation exercise took place in 2014. But even as fresh census data is yet to come, the government has initiated the process of ward delimitation, the HC was apprised.The petitioner had accused the government of embarking on the exercise to seek ‘political advantage’ and demanded that the July 28 report submitted by the delimitation board be stayed. The petitioner has also demanded that the notification with which the exercise was initiated should be quashed. The court has sought a response from the state and Centre by August 27.BIG WIN FOR DEMOCRACY: NK SHARMAReacting to the development, former chief parliamentary secretary NK Sharma said that the Congress government was trying to change the boundaries of wards for the forthcoming municipal elections in Punjab as per the dictates of its legislators and party leaders. “It was taking advantage of restrictions imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic to change ward boundaries. The high court’s decision is a big victory for democracy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-restrains-punjab-from-notifying-delimitation-of-zirakpur-mc-wards/story-eSesE73nkl7SG6L9ZgIDEM.html
11-08-2020||Delhi||Meharchand Market to soon be redeveloped with ‘uniform look’||Delhi’s iconic Meharchand Market in Lodhi Colony -- once home to designer boutiques, restaurants and jewellery shops, and often touted as the next Khan Market -- will get a new lease of life as the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Tuesday cleared a proposal to redevelop the popular shopping hub that has been nearly lying shut since the 2018 sealing drive. The market -- originally set up to settle refugees from Pakistan after Partition and named after Mehr Chand Khanna, who was Union minister of rehabilitation in the 1950s -- will be redeveloped according to the Master Plan of Delhi 2021, with shops getting a floor area ratio (FAR ) of 350 compared to the present FAR of 150. Around 80% of shops of the market were shut during the 2018 sealing drive, one of the biggest in Delhi, for violation of building norms.According to SDMC officials, the existing shops will be demolished and reconstructed by the traders themselves in accordance with sanctioned standard building plans. A senior official of SDMC’s town planning department said the market will have a uniform look similar to Connaught Place with elements such as a public corridor, uniform billboards, etc. The corporation is also likely to make it a pedestrian-only market. “It will be the traders’ responsibility to redevelop their shops as per a ‘standard plan’ prepared by the corporation’s architecture department. The plan provides norms for construction of the outer façade, display windows, columns, advertising boards, billboard, etc. This will provide a uniform look to the market. The front façade of all shops in the redeveloped market would be the same. The shops will follow a definite colour code pattern as suggested by the ‘standard plan’,” the official said requesting anonymity.Raj Dutt Gahlot, chairman standing committee, said all the existing structures will be demolished and newly constructed. No time-frame has been set for the work to begin.“Under the approved scheme, 90% ground coverage with 350 FAR has been accepted. The market may be declared as a pedestrian shopping street due to non-availability of parking facilities in the premises,” Gahlot said.The market saw a major transformation in the last decade, becoming a popular destination for designer boutiques, restaurants, jewellery shops, salons and cafes. But in January 2018, as many as 135 out of 152 shops were sealed by the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee for violating building norms and constructing beyond the permitted FAR of 150.According to traders, in 1948, refugees from West Pakistan were given temporary wooden shops in the market. Later in 1963, they were allotted permanent concrete shops. Municipal officials said these were single-storeyed shops with a verandah but over a period of time, many traders added extra floors.Officials said local shopping complexes (LSCs) in Delhi such as Defence Colony, Green Park and Hauz Khas got some relief on June 21, 2018, when the Central government notified changes in MPD-2021 but confusion remained over Meharchand Market.According to another official of SDMC’s town planning department, in November 2019, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) clarified that the MPD-2021 amendments can be applied to Meharchand Market, and so a FAR of 350 (as opposed to 150) can be provided to the shop owners.“The decision to redevelop the market was taken after discussing the plan with traders. Before starting redevelopment work, they will have to deposit a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh with the monitoring committee for the illegal structures and raze them. We will start passing building plans for the market and traders will have to approach the SDMC’s building department to approve their building maps. Apart from collecting conversion charges, SDMC will get Rs 10 crore from the owners for approving the layout plan,” the official said.The official quoted above said the development charges, augmentation fees and other charges will be recovered from plot owners by the engineering department.Ashok Sakhuja, president of the Meharchand Market Traders Association, said it was a “welcome move” and would benefit traders a lot.“Our market is almost dead since January 2018. We are ready to do anything to revive our market. With such a move, our shops will be de-sealed and we will be able to reconstruct them as per the standard plan. The market will be pedestrian-friendly and wear a uniform look,” he said.Indrajeet Singh, who owns a tent house in the market, said traders survived the sealing as some had alternative businesses and others relied on savings. “At present our priority to bring back the market to life again so that our business can pick up. We will see if any problem arises out of the no-parking move,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/meharchand-market-to-soon-be-redeveloped-with-uniform-look/story-mwynJKt6LExPe40kPz88NO.html

11-08-2020||Delhi||FIR against 100 Asha workers for Jantar Mantar protest||The Delhi Police on Tuesday filed a case against more than 100 Asha workers as well as members of Central Trade Unions for holding a protest at Jantar Mantar on Sunday in contravention of the Unlock 3 guidelines in effect to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Accredited Social Health Activists (Asha) have been crucial in the fight against the disease, and a majority of them in the city have been on strike since July 21, demanding better wages.They were booked for holding protests without permission and “violating social distancing norms” at the protest. The FIR was registered at the Parliament Street police station under Section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code, Section 3 of the Epidemic Disease Act and Section 51B of the Disaster Management Act, said deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal.Singhal, who is also a spokesperson for the city police, said more than 100 Asha workers and members of Central Trade Unions had gathered at Jantar Mantar to protest on Sunday noon. He said the police went to the protest spot and informed them no such protest or gathering was allowed in the city, as per the Unlock 3.0 guidelines.The protesters, however, claimed they had got permits from authorities concerned. “When the protesters were asked to produce the permission letter they failed to do it. They were convinced, and they left Jantar Mantar after around half an hour, assuring they would submit the letter on Monday. However, nobody turned up on Monday, after which the FIR was registered,” Singhal added.The protest at Jantar Mantar was organised by the All India United Traders Union Centre (AIUTUC) against privatisation in all government sectors and scheme workers such as Ashas being denied salary and position of a regular worker.

11-08-2020||Delhi||CISF readies for Metro reopening, no word on when services will resume||The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has started preparations for the resumption of Metro services in Delhi-NCR, although there is no official word yet on when services will restart.According to CISF officials, they have been asked to make sure services can be resumed at short notice. Delhi Metro services have remained suspended since March 22, when the Janta curfew was observed. While other modes of public transport have been allowed, with restrictions, as part of the gradual easing of lockdown norms, the Metro, which catered to nearly 2.4 million passengers daily pre-pandemic, has remained suspended.According to a senior CISF official, who asked not to be named, the force has been directed to be prepared to resume services. An official from the ministry of home affairs, which is in charge of guidelines for unlocking services and economic activities across India, however, said there has been no date set yet by the government for the resumption of Metro services. “ CISF is prepared with all security arrangements whenever it opens,” another official, who didn’t wish to be named, said.When contacted, housing and urban affairs (HUA) minister Hardeep Singh Puri declined comment on the matter. Last week, Puri told the Economic Times in an interview that a call on this could be taken in two weeks. He added that he resumption would be staggered. The CISF official said the force has been directed to ensure that metal detectors and other equipment such as X-ray scanners are kept at the ready.“Because the force was stationed in different locations to maintain distancing norms during the pandemic, it has been directed that the personnel may now be mobilised and positioned at Metro stations as per the requirement. We also have directions to ensure that there are enough face shields, gloves and other protective equipment as need be to enforce social distancing and safe frisking of passengers,” the second official said. CISF used to have 12,500 personnel at 254 Metro stations across Delhi. Apart from securing the stations, CISF personnel also frisk the passengers and patrol areas near stations . The second official said Delhi Metro is already on high alert, along with other significant government installations and buildings in the capital, on account of Independence Day (August 15).In April, HT reported that CISF was preparing new standard operating procedures (SOPs) for Delhi Metro, to be implemented once services resume.Officials said once in effect, the new SOPs will include use of the Aarogya Setu contact tracing app . CISF is also considering providing personal protective equipment (PPE) to personnel deployed in areas with heavy public movement . Food stalls and other commercial outlets within stations will have additional access controls in place and CISF personnel will be directed to follow certain safety measures.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has finalised the protocols for passenger movement at its stations and trains. These include cashless transactions at ticketing counters, designated spots for passengers to stand and wait for trains, use of face masks and Aarogya Setu mobile app, and alternate seat on trains being left vacant.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communication, DMRC, said: “ DMRC shall be prepared to commence operations whenever directed by the government. All necessary guidelines are in place to combat the spread of Covid-19 and all efforts shall be made to make travel safe for our valued commuters.”Community medicine expert Dr Jugal Kishore of Safdarjung hospital said, “It is about time the government started Metro services, as people are facing a lot of inconvenience while commuting. As per the last sero survey, which was conducted during the peak of the infection, 23% of the population had developed antibodies. The positivity rate has gone down now. So it is safe to open public transport and ensure people follow all the precautions such as the use of sanitisers and masks and social distancing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cisf-readies-for-metro-reopening-no-word-on-when-services-will-resume/story-8t2jBABpJiQdxGtm5GSPUN.html
11-08-2020||Chandigarh||Another night robbery bid at unmanned ATM in Manimajra||Three masked men made an unsuccessful attempt to loot an unguarded ATM in Manimajra on Monday night.The police said they were informed about the robbery bid on Tuesday morning and have registered a case in this regard.As per the CCTV footage, three masked youths walked into an AXIS Bank ATM booth in Subash Nagar area of Manimajra at 11.59pm on Monday and initially tried to withdraw some amount. Then one of them walked out and stood guard while the other two accused tried to break open the kiosk. Failing to do so, the two came out of the booth and sent the third accused inside, who then damaged the ATM screen and CCTV installed there. The trio fled around 12.18am.On the complaint of Kikar Singh, who is entrusted with the maintenance of ATMs, police registered a case under sections 380, 511 and 427 of the IPC at the IT Park police station.GUARDS REPLACED BY ALARM SYSTEMSThis is the fourth such attempt to loot an unguarded ATM since May 31. Despite Chandigarh administration and police repeatedly asking the banks to deploy security guards outside ATMs, no such step has been taken. Instead of guards, the banks have installed centralised security alarms. “The investigations into previous ATM thefts or attempts have shown that guards are mostly posted at the ATMs on bank branch premises, but not at the offsite ATMs,” said a senior Chandigarh police officer, adding that the security arrangements are outsourced to private agencies and thus the banks have little say on the shift timings of the guards.“We have taken up the matter with the banks and asked them to ensure that ATMs have guards,” said UT police spokesperson DSP Charanjit Singh.PREVIOUS CASES YET TO BE CRACKEDOn June 18, masked burglars managed to steal ₹7.64 lakh from an ATM of Union Bank of India in Kishangarh. While on the intervening night of June 24-25, an attempt was made to break open an SBI ATM at Sector 44 market. The miscreants had sprayed paint on a CCTV camera installed inside the booth and also cut the alarm wire. As per the police, both ATMs were unmanned. The police are yet to make any breakthrough in these cases.ATM THEFT SPREEJuly 20: Two men break into a PNB ATM at Gharuan village in KhararJune 18: Masked man flee with ₹7.6 lakh from a Union Bank of India ATM at Kishangarh in ChandigarhJune 10: Miscreants flee with ATM containing ₹16 lakh uprooted from a PNB kiosk at Dappar near LalruMay 31: Four people make unsuccessful bid to loot an ATM at Kishangarh in Chandigarh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/another-night-robbery-bid-at-unmanned-atm-in-manimajra/story-qeXDSdsJb1tlwbQSELka7I.html
11-08-2020||Chandigarh||2 PU senators for appeal against HC decision on ex-governing body member||Two senators and syndicate members of Panjab University (PU) have written to chancellor and Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu, asking for an appeal against the Punjab and Haryana high court decision in the case of an ex-senator’s registration as a graduate constituency member being cancelled by PU.The court quashed PU’s 2019 decision to revoke the registration of former senator Munish Verma as a graduate constituency member, which allows ex-students to elect and contest polls for the university’s apex governing body.PU senators Rabindra Nath Sharma and Jarnail Singh, who are also the members of the syndicate, have urged Naidu to file the appeal in view of the allegations made against Verma.“This is a matter of dignity for the PU senate and chancellor of the university. There was no dissent in the syndicate and senate over the decision taken against the former senator,” Sharma said.The court had questioned the quorum of the meeting in which the decision was taken, adding that according to the PU Act, a person’s name could be struck off the register of the registered graduates with the concurrence of not less than two third members of the senate. Out of 91 members only 38 members were present when the decision was taken.In a letter to Verma last year, PU had written that his registration for the graduate constituency had been revoked thus barring him from contesting the senate polls.Verma’s registration was cancelled after he was indicted in a case of wrongful hiring of three persons as centre and assistant superintendents in the 2014 annual examination to MR Government College Fazilka, Punjab. PU’s registrar Karamjeet Singh was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/request-for-plea-against-hc-decision-on-pu-ex-senator/story-uwyewklF6o2OsdnQBFaWlK.html
11-08-2020||Delhi||SDMC gets Rs 43 crore from Centre for dust-control and waste processing measures||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has received Rs 42.77 crore from the Centre under the Urban Development Fund (UDF) for the current financial year to combat air pollution by introducing dust-control measures and to augment its waste-processing facilities. A proposal to use the money for the purpose was approved by the corporation’s Standing Committee on Tuesday and will be presented in the House for a final approval. Civic officials said the corporation had approached the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs earlier this year for a grant under UDF for the work. Dust is a major contributor to air pollution in Delhi. The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Control and Prevention) Authority (EPCA) had been asking the civic bodies to take measures to check road dust. Standing Committee chairman Rajdutt Gahlot said the funds will be utilised to strengthen and resurface damaged roads, develop decentralised compost plants and promote the use of recycled water by installing decentralised sewage treatment plants (STPs), among others. “Internal roads will be strengthened using this fund at 12 locations, including Malviya Nagar, Panchsheel Park, Hauz Khas, Green Park Main and Extension, C R Park, Dwarka (pocket-1) and Mahavir Enclave, among others, at an estimated cost of Rs 20 crore,” Gahlot said. Gahlot said Rs 7 crore has been allocated to develop 15 waste treatment plants and lay pipelines at various locations. Besides, Rs 3.7 crore have been sanctioned for procuring five electric road sweeping machines and Rs 12 crore for installing drum composters to treat solid waste at the ward level. The approved proposal said the projects must be completed within 12 months.“The corporation has been taking various measures to combat air pollution such as making the city green and clean, including makeover of spaces under flyovers, creating vertical gardens, mechanical sweeping and sprinkling of water on roads. “To augment these projects, the civic body had approached the union ministry for funds. A comprehensive proposal and a detailed report with an estimate of Rs 86.59 crore was sent to the ministry. After a scrutiny of projects, a grant for Rs 42.77 crore was approved. We will have to bear 20% from our own resources,” said Gahlot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sdmc-gets-rs-43-cr-from-centre-for-dust-control-and-waste-processing-measures/story-4BpxgnEErzCWJC6D5nV6eI.html
11-08-2020||Delhi||Website crashes during day 2 of DU’s online open-book exams||Final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students of Delhi University continued to face a harrowing time on Tuesday—the second day of online open-book exams (OBE) at Delhi University—as the website briefly crashed in the afternoon while students were trying to upload their answer scripts.Throughout the day, students took to social media to complain about the glitches and reached out to their teachers for help.Karuna Sawal, a final-year BCom (Hons) student, said she allotted herself 45 minutes of the total time just to upload her answer sheets. “While uploading my answers, the website crashed. I tried to attach my answer scripts on e-mail but even that has a limit of 25MB. It was traumatising to struggle through this and the worst thing is it does not end here. It might happen again,” she said, adding that she has three more exams to take.The OBE exams, to be held as a one-time measure in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, will continue till August 31 for around 240,000 students of the varsity—including those enrolled in non-collegiate courses of School of Open Learning (SOL) and Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board (NCWEB). On Monday, the first day of exams, students had complained of technical glitches.While 35,000 students appeared for the exams on Monday, as per data provided by university officials, 32,000 students appeared for their exams on Tuesday. Teachers said that several students received the wrong question papers on e-mail and had to approach their colleges for the correct ones.Pankaj Garg, a former academic council member who teaches at Rajdhani College, was among those teachers. “Students have been extremely stressed. Since uploading answers on the portal is becoming difficult, they e-mail their answer scripts to university officials and college’s nodal officers. It raises concerns of duplicity if they send their answer scripts everywhere. Some students even send e-mails to colleges after the deadline due to all the confusion. So, there remains a question over whether the varsity will accept answer scripts from colleges after the deadline,” he said. Garg has also written to vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi asking him to look into the issues. Despite calls and messages, Tyagi did not comment on the matter on Tuesday.DU Teachers’ Association member Abha Dev Habib also raised questions over the rule of asking students to mention their name in the e-mail while sending their answer scripts. “Students fear victimisation. They are nervous about sharing their experiences in the public domain as they may face discrimination,” she said.DU Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani said, “If the portal is not working, they can e-mail us the answer scripts. The website is not the only option. Yes, we are facing issues of duplicity but we are working on finding a solution to deal with it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/website-crashes-during-day-2-of-du-s-online-open-book-exams/story-ENhlsNpiQOwh0xRsvHRJgJ.html
11-08-2020||Delhi||Illegal call centre busted for duping loan seekers||An illegal call centre running from outer Delhi’s Ranhola and cheating people in the name of providing loans from a leading financial services company has been busted by Delhi Police’s cyber cell unit (CyPAD). Seven people, including a sales promoter associated with a telecom service providing company, were arrested for cheating more than 500 loan aspirants to the tune of Rs 2.5 crore in the last two years, officials said.Deputy commissioner of police (CyPAD) Anyesh Roy said the arrested sales promoter, Pawan Mittal, is not an employee of the company but a third-party promoter. Mittal used to activate SIM cards by illegally using documents and photographs of foreigners who had submitted them to get new numbers during their stay in India. The illegally activated SIM cards were used for contacting loan seekers with an intent to dupe them and avoid getting caught by law enforcement agencies, Roy said.“As the SIM cards were activated using foreigners’ documents and photographs, it became difficult to identify and nab the fraudsters,” the DCP said.Police said the call centre was busted following an investigation into a complaint filed by one Pawan Kumar, who was cheated of nearly Rs 2.19 lakh in name of providing a personal loan of Rs 10 lakh.Kumar was trying to get a personal loan online when he came across a phone number that claimed to be associated with a leading financial services company. “Kumar called on that number and was assured a loan at a lucrative interest rate. He was tricked into paying around R2.19 lakh as processing fee and other charges. To win his confidence, he was sent an email from an ID that looked similar to the company’s official email ID,” said the officer.The loan-seeker knew he was duped when he did not receive the money and the number on which he contacted the loan provider was deactivated. A cheating case was registered on his complaint.During the probe, DCP Roy said, the investigating team established the money trail and through technical surveillance traced the call centre to Rahnola.“We first arrested Mittal who had activated the number used to call the complainant. His interrogation led to the arrest of the leader, Mohammad Irfan Saifi, who earlier worked as a telecaller at an insurance company,” he said.The other arrested persons are Vishal Tiwari, Vidhata, Amit Kumar, Gyan Singh and Rishabh Mohammad. Saifi told police that they cheated 20-25 people every month through the call centre he had established two years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/illegal-call-centre-busted-for-duping-loan-seekers/story-S4NuiZyKT83QewwgjV1aaL.html

A majority of the patients are from Punjab (60) followed by Chandigarh (53), Haryana (13) and Himachal Pradesh (12), even cases from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. “Existing ventilators in the Covid-19 hospital have been exhausted and a few ventilators shifted from other areas for the Covid-19 patients. We have severely (ill) patients from across the region and few mild cases who are employees of the institute,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER. Similarly, in the Sector 48 hospital, out of 100 beds, around 50 are occupied and four patients are on ventilators, which leaves 11 out of 15 ventilators free for use. UT health secretary Arun Gupta said they had asked the hospitals to prepare more ICUs in the hospital. “Intensive care is required for those who are severely ill, so we have asked PGIMER and GMCH-32 to prepare more ICU beds.” Gupta said there were enough facilities for asymptomatic and mild cases.Out of 628 patients, around 150 are in home isolation and the remaining in Covid care centres. As of now, two Covid care centres established at Sood Dharamshala and the Sector 47 Ayurvedic College are almost at full capacity and hostels at Panjab University are being readied for patients.The city hospitals in total have around 250 ventilators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/admin-asks-pgimer-gmch-32-to-create-more-icus-for-covid-patients/story-Cqiy8UyKRI3fAFI0P5pfRI.html

11-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police recover 8kg heroin from member of interstate gang||The Delhi Police on Tuesday said they had recovered eight kilograms of heroin from a 41-year-old suspected member of an interstate drug syndicate operating from the Maoist-affected areas of Chatra, Khunti, Palamu, and Saraikela in Jharkhand. The syndicate is involved in illegal opium cultivation, heroin-making and smuggling the contraband into Delhi-NCR and Uttar Pradesh,said officials of the special cell that arrested the drug supplier, Santosh Kumar Sinha, and recovered the consignment. Police have estimated that the total value of the seized eight kg heroin is around Rs 32 crore in the international market, pegging it at about Rs 4 crore per kg. However, the price of heroin in the international market varies between Rs 40 lakh and Rs 80 lakh per kg depending on its quality and location, according to various global watchdogs, including agencies linked with United Nations. Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said that the special cell team, while working on active interstate gangs dealing in narcotic drugs, received information that due to the Maoist stronghold and obscure terrain, the forested areas of Chatra, Khunti, Palamu, and Saraikela in Jharkhand have emerged as a major hub of illegal opium cultivation. “Several villagers in these areas are involved in the illegal business of opium/poppy cultivation for easy money. To do so, farmers are supposed to pay a certain amount to the Maoists. People involved in drug supply procure crude heroin from the villagers, process it into pure heroin and smuggle the contraband into Delhi and UP,” said DCP Yadav. The special cell received inputs about one such syndicate and surveilled the activities and movements of its members. On Monday, the team received information that one of the gang’s members would be in Delhi to deliver a consignment of heroin to a drug dealer in Inderpuri. “Accordingly, they laid a trap and the supplier, Santosh Kumar Sinha, was caught with eight kg heroin from Rohini area around 11pm Monday. His interrogation revealed that to avoid law enforcement agencies, he changed his mode of transport and cellphone numbers during each trip. The gang members usually travel in private vehicles and trucks,” added the DCP. The police are interrogating Sinha to establish his connection with Maoists in Jharkhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-recover-8kg-heroin-from-member-of-interstate-gang/story-ofp1WJ276inv55S13feGSM.html

11-08-2020||Delhi||Trader body holds protest in CP, wants gyms and hotels in capital reopened||Members of the Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI) – a collective of trade and industrial bodies – on Tuesday staged a protest in Connaught Place and several other commercial areas, demanding that hotels, weekly markets and gymnasiums be allowed to open in the capital as part of the Centre’s unlock plan to remove lockdown restrictions in a gradual manner.Hotels, weekly markets and gymnasiums have been closed in Delhi since March 25 as part of the nationwide lockdown imposed to contain Covid-19. The AAP-led Delhi government is in favour of opening them while lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal is against them being opened saying the Covid situation in the capital is still fragile.“Hotels, weekly markets and gyms collectively provide livelihood to around 2.5 million people. While several other states have allowed them to function under the guidelines issued by the central government, these remain shut in Delhi. It is difficult to understand why. We demand that the L-G reconsiders the decision to allow hotels, weekly markets and gyms to function,” said Brijesh Goyal, president of CTI.Chirag Sethi, vice-president of Delhi gym association, said, “Delhi has around 5,500 registered gymnasiums and most of them will be forced to shut if restrictions are not lifted at the earliest.

With the arrival of monsoon in Punjab and authorities not taking lesson from the deaths caused by building collapses in the past, many unsafe structures are awaiting tragedy.At around 11pm on Monday, a four-storied residential building collapsed and eight people had a narrow escape. On hearing the noise, the neighbours came out and helped clear the debris. As per police, owner of the house was running an embroidery factory in the building’s fourth floor. Due to strong vibrations caused by operation of the machines, the building collapsed.However, locals are blaming officials of the Amritsar municipal corporation for allowing the owner to construct a fourth floor on the building which was at that time 40-year-old.This is not the first time when an old building has collapsed in the recent times. On July 12, a couple had died after the roof of their house on Dhapai Road collapsed due to high-velocity winds and rain. Another couple and their six-month-old twins had died when the roof of their house had collapsed following a hailstorm and heavy rain at Moole Chak village on March 6.MC commissioner Komal Mittal said, “Before onset of monsoon every year, we conduct a survey for unsafe buildings. As per the survey conducted in 2020, 122 buildings in Amritsar were declared unsafe. MC had demolished one of these buildings, which was in a dilapidated state. Owners of remaining buildings were given official notices to either vacate the structures or repair the faults. I have deployed special teams to conduct a drive to recheck status of these buildings.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/4-storey-building-collapse-in-amritsar-brings-scores-of-unsafe-structures-in-focus/story-1ODNSBO4ao9gevLWwwJPYK.html

Punjab cabinet minister OP Soni inaugurated the plasma bank through video conferencing.However, only two recovered patients, including a doctor, came forward to donate plasma for transfusion of immunoglobulin antibodies for covid treatment. Under convalescent plasma therapy, antibody-rich blood plasma of patients who have recovered from Covid-19 is preserved for transfusion into critical patients.In June, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had allowed Government Medical Colleges (GMCs) in Amritsar, Faridkot and Patiala to treat covid patients with plasma therapy.Eight covid patients who recovered are ready for transfusion. However, most of them are doctors or health workers. Common people who have recovered from the virus are reluctant to donate plasma fearing side effects.GGSMCH principal Dr Deepak Bhatti said, “Seven to eight persons have given consent to donate plasma, and two have already done so. Many doctors who had contracted the virus have recovered and will donate plasma after completing 28 days standard time period. We are motivating common people as well to donate plasma, but they are a little reluctant.”“Plasma therapy is completely safe and takes just 45-60 minutes. The newly setup plasma bank is equipped with two plasma therapy machines,” he added.Baba Farid University of Health Sciences V-C Dr Raj Bahadur said, “Amid pandemic, people were finding it difficult to get plasma and the situation is getting chaotic.

11-08-2020||Lucknow||State industry has progressed from survival to revival: Satish Mahana||Soon after coming to power in March 2017, the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh began showcasing the state as an investment destination and focused on industrial development, which is expected to play a big a part in chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s one trillion dollar economy goal.The state hosted the UP Investors Summit 2018, two ground-breaking ceremonies and the biggest ever Defence Expo. Howerver, Covid-19 hit the industrial and other sectors. HT spoke to industrial development minister Satish Mahana about how his department engaged in governance during the pandemic.How did you face the challenge?The impact of Covid-19 on industry in UP began weeks before the lockdown. The pandemic had already hit many countries, including Europe and the US, before us. Flights and cargo services were disrupted. Industry started feeling the heat before other sectors. But once the lockdown was declared in India, labourers were affected first. Then, industry came to a grinding halt. Our first major decision was to allow 11 crucial continuous process industries (CPI) in the state to function. We were quick to follow Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s lockdown-2 mantra ‘Jaan Bhi, Jahan Bhi (we have to save lives and the economy at the same time)’. After April 16, we began opening industries. We initiated amendments to make a shift from ‘survival’ to ‘revival’.What did you do for the survival stage?In the first stage, we began hand-holding the industries to get them to reopen with Covid safety protocols. We asked industry to pay full or partial salaries to employees. At the same time, employees were persuaded to begin working even on curtailed salaries as the factories were in distress. This is how the industries began functioning. Now, the situation has drastically changed. They are in a revival stage.How is industry performing now?In February, the industrial sector consumed (through industrial feeder) 8,630 mega-units of power per day. By May 22, the industrial sector power consumption reached 7,246 mega-units per day. This was 84% of February’s consumption. And now we have surpassed the February consumption. This is a clear indicator that we have entered the progress stage. Also, construction work on expressways is going on rapidly.What steps did the government take for industry to overcome Covid-19 impact? What concessions were offered?In Noida and Greater Noida, the construction sector, too, is under the industry department. We gave the builders six months’ extension for project completion. We gave a moratorium to industry on loan repayments. There were power related exemptions and concessions too. We also reviewed our 2017 industrial policy. For instance, earlier a minimum of 150 acres land had to be bought for establishment of a private industrial park. In view of Covid, we reduced this to 30 acres. We have offered concessions for logistics and warehousing ventures also. Our government has improved the ease of doing business by introducing various IT driven modules. Did the state get new investment during Covid-19? What about the MoUs of investment summits?We never stopped tracking MoUs signed at the summits. We began removing hurdles. On the ease of doing business index, Uttar Pradesh has been consistently outperforming (others) for the last four years and got ‘Achiever’ State status in 2017-18. What about attracting investors who want to shift from China? We are working on it with financial institutions. We have established helpdesks for different countries which could be potential investors in Uttar Pradesh. We expect that some would begin the shifting process once the Covid crisis ends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/state-industry-has-progressed-from-survival-to-revival-satish-mahana/story-EDrTi6AOqdhQ5VKIgO1d3I.html
11-08-2020||City||2 arrested for stealing pickup trucks||The Rabale police have arrested two men for stealing pick-up trucks during lockdown from Navi Mumbai. Two other accused are absconding. According to police, one of the two accused arrested was out on a parole, due to the pandemic. Chandra Pujari, 42, and Rakesh Pawar, 25, were arrested recently and following their interrogation, police recovered four pick-up trucks valued at ₹11 lakh from their possession. Pujari had gotten out of Nashik jail around the time of coronavirus lockdown while one of the absconding accomplices is among the many undertrials released during the lockdown on parole to ease burden in jails. The group had been active in Navi Mumbai since the start of April, shortly after the lockdown was imposed at the end of March. Pujari and another accused would identify the vehicles with no anti-theft sensors and steal them at night using a master-key. Pawar would then drive the vehicle to hide it at a safehouse, until it is meant to be sold. “The men used a master-key to steal the pick-up trucks. We have recovered four vehicles which were stolen from our jurisdiction, Rabale MIDC, Koparkhairane and Taloja areas. They have been remanded in judicial custody,” said Yogesh Gawde, senior inspector, Rabale police station. Pujari has cases against him in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Gujarat. Pujari and Pawar are residents of Thane, said police. “The accused mostly sold vehicles outside the city limits after changing the chassis number and the engine number of the vehicle. If the vehicle was not worth selling, they would break it down to salvage the scrap parts for sale,” said Pravin Phadtare, assistant inspector, Rabale police station. The police caught the two by checking the CCTV footage of some of the thefts and other technical details. The accused have been booked for theft. Officials are on the lookout for two other accused, including a Dhule based agent. The agent allegedly helped the accused with scrapping the vehicles or with documents of a scrapped vehicle, using which the stolen vehicles were sold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-arrested-for-stealing-pickup-trucks/story-q6VlTdT8ZLPV2c8UrUwKRN.html

11-08-2020||City||Don’t shift Covid-19 patients from Sirmaur, Solan to DDU, Shimla: HC to HP govt||The Himachal Pradesh high court on Tuesday directed the state government not to shift Covid-19 patients from Sirmaur and Solan districts to Deen Dayal Upadhyaya (DDU) Hospital, Shimla, unless the hospitals in these districts run out of capacity to attend virus infected patients.A division bench comprising chief justice L Narayana Swamy and justice Anoop Chitkara passed these orders on a petition filed by Inderjit Singh, challenging the July 16 order of the state government designating DDU Zonal Hospital, Shimla, as the Dedicated Covid Care Hospital for Solan and Sirmaur in addition to Shimla and Kinnaur districts.The petitioner has alleged that in a meeting held on May 15, overall analysis of equipments and staff was done and it itself reflected the shortcomings of the hospital to be fully equipped and handle the situation as per the guidelines of Union ministry of health and family welfare. As per the petition, the analysis reflected that the ICU itself needs basic infrastructure. There is gap of 11 anaesthetists/medical specialists, 62 staff nurses and four radiographers. Besides, one remote control monitoring system is needed to be installed to decrease exposure of staff. 12 pulse oxymeter, one defribrillator, electric suction machines— one for ICU and four for the Covid ward, oxygen manifold, 10 oxygen regulator, one video laryngoscope, 12 syringe infusion pumps, scrub station, portable X-ray and alpha bed mattresses are also required. The petitioner prayed that in such a situation when the DDU is not fully equipped, it would be detrimental to public interest to transfer the patients from Solan and Sirmaur.During the course of hearing, on August 7, it was pointed out by the director health services that there are twenty four ventilators and given the infrastructure, one anesthetist can cater to six ventilators only. However, on Tuesday, it was stated that there are now two anesthetists working to cater to the ventilators.The high court observed that even if two anesthetists are available, 12 ventilators still don’t have anesthetists. Hence, when the infrastructure at DDU itself is incomplete, it does not permit the state to order shifting of patients from Sirmaur and Solan, unless those hospitals have run out of infrastructure.The next hearing in the case is on August 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/don-t-shift-covid-19-patients-from-sirmaur-solan-to-ddu-shimla-hc-to-hp-govt/story-KEhKh1V6xcnbMLWKQcRoDI.html

This year, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, Cambridge International had cancelled its June 2020 exams. They engaged with education authorities, governments and schools around the world to develop a robust process for awarding students with assessed grades. The marks awarding process combined teacher insights – predicted grades and rank orders - with a rigorous standardisation process, keeping teacher judgments consistent, across different schools. Very few city schools conducted the exams in June this year. At Jamnabai Narsee School in Vile Parle, a 100% result was recorded. A total of 59 students had taken the exam and the school topper Veer Bathwal got 94%. Mahesh Srivastava, the regional director, South Asia at Cambridge Assessment International Education, said, “2020 has been a transformational year and has had a huge impact on teaching and learning across the world. With school closures, Cambridge learners were not able to take their June exams and therefore we developed a rigorous process for awarding assessed grades. Throughout the process, we worked closely with schools and aimed to create a level playing field and ensure that our grades are fair.”In India, this year the most popular Cambridge IGCSE subjects were English, physics and chemistry and the most popular Cambridge International AS and A level subjects were mathematics, economics and physics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cambridge-igcse-as-a-level-results-for-june-series-out/story-eC013Ye8cbRdd6ZYmLovTN.html

However, around 38% of parents/guardians have suggested reopening schools with less strength taking all precautionary measures. Apart from this, parents have suggested restarting Classes 10th and 12th. Ajay Thakur, whose son studies in a government school in Shimla said, “Although we know that education is very important but considering the ongoing situation it is very risky to restart regular classes in schools.

11-08-2020||Chandigarh||As Covid cases surge in Punjab, CM seeks liberal financial package from PM||Chandigarh: Amid a surge in Covid cases and 50% revenue decline for the first quarter of this fiscal in Punjab, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release a liberal financial package for states to fill the collection gap caused by the pandemic besides flexibility on Covid-related terms of expenditure in SDRF. During a video-conference meet of the Prime Minister with chief ministers of some states to review the Covid situation, Captain Amarinder Singh said the current cap of 35% in the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF) for Covid-related expenditure, according to home ministry guidelines, is not sufficient to meet the present requirement. Citing the state’s rising number of Covid cases, which have gone up to 24,891 with 604 deaths, the chief minister urged the Prime Minister to review the UGC decision on mandatory exams for exit classes to be held by September 30. “Punjab may not be in a position to conduct exams in September as it may be facing its peak at that time,” he said, suggesting promoting students on past performance and internal assessment, with the option to take exams later for those wanting to improve their performance. He sought the Centre’s assistance for online school education, especially for students of Classes 10 and 12 from needy families. “More money is needed for creating infrastructure to support online education,” he added. NEED TO SCALE UP TESTING Though Punjab is conducting 23,000 tests per million for Covid (higher than the national average), and planned to increase RT-PCR tests from 12,000 to 20,000 in the next 15 days, it needs to scale up the testing capacity further, the chief minister said. He requested the Prime Minister to direct the central government institutions in Chandigarh and Punjab to increase testing capacity. Expressing concern over the state’s mortality rate of 2.4%, Captain Amarinder Singh said though it was lower than the all-India deaths per million and 91% of the fatality cases were with co-morbidity, it was still higher than neighbouring Haryana. Patients were coming to hospitals late and 86% deaths were occurring in tertiary hospitals. BOOSTER FOR INFRASTRUCTURE The chief minister thanked the Centre for accepting Punjab’s proposal to set up a National Institute of Virology for the north zone and said the state government will soon give 25 acres for the institute to the ICMR for the purpose. He requested immediate operationalisation of Covid testing and treatment at AIIMS, Bathinda, where OPDs are functional, and said this will be useful for the people of southern Punjab. Noting that PGI, Chandigarh, is a premier tertiary care facility for Punjab, he also sought increase in the bed capacity at the hospital and strengthening of the existing PGI satellite centre at Sangrur, especially for Covid treatment. He urged the Centre to start work on the newly sanctioned PGI satellite centre in Ferozepur. While of the three sanctioned medical colleges, the one at Mohali will start classes this year but more such institutions are needed, Capt Amarinder Singh said, requesting for new colleges in the aspirational districts of Gurdaspur, Sangrur and Moga. LUDHIANA, JALANDHAR AND PATIALA HAVE MOST CASES On the Covid situation in the state, he said it had seen cases go up from 500 to 1,000 in two weeks, with the positivity rate of the last five days at 8.73%. The majority of cases were coming from Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Patiala, though cases were increasing in all districts. The number of micro-containment zones are being increased in the three high-incidence districts.

Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati called her death “extremely sad, embarrassing and very condemnable”.But as the case appeared to take a political turn, Bulandshahr’s district magistrate and police chief rushed to contradict the girl’s uncle Manoj Bhati who had claimed she had been harassed by two men. The uncle had also insisted that he was riding the two-wheeler.Sudeeksha Bhati, a tea seller’s daughter, was a district topper in Bulandshahr in 2018. She had scored 98% in her Class 12 examination in 2018 and was awarded a scholarship to study at Babson College, Wellesley, Massachusetts. She was scheduled to return on August 20 and wanted to catch up with her relatives.The officials said Sudeeksha was riding pillion with her young brother - “a minor” - when his motorcycle crashed into another bike that had abruptly stopped ahead of them “due to traffic”. Sudeeksha was on her way from Dadri in Gautam Buddh Nagar to Bulandshahr 40 km away, district magistrate Ravindra Kumar said.The police also tweeted an excerpt from his younger brother’s video statement, which the police said, did not make any reference to the alleged harassment.“But we will investigate the harassment charge and are trying to get in touch with Sudeeksha’s family,” Kumar said, adding that he wasn’t sure why her uncle had claimed that he was accompanying the girl.Her uncle Manoj Bhati earlier told reporters that the two men started “performing stunts near them” and would overtake them, then let them pass. At one point, the men stopped their bike just in front of their two-wheeler. Manoj Bhati said he applied the brakes but nevertheless, lost control.Sudeeksha sustained injuries and died later.Bulandshahr officials said they had sent a team to Dadri to meet Sudeeksha’s family since their phone numbers were not reachable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/bulandshahr-topper-dies-in-road-accident-cops-deny-she-was-harassed/story-svAfftCTqfW8MAJEs87gAK.html

He had passed matriculation (Class 10) examinations in 1995.The minister has been facing criticism, not only from the common people but also from a section of elected members, for his educational qualification ever since he was elevated to the post of the HRD minister of Jharkhand.“Constant criticism inspired me to restart my pending education. Ever since I was made the education minister of Jharkhand, a section of people has been critical of my educational qualification.

11-08-2020||Delhi||Deer Park’s graveyard||It has been raining on and off for the past few days, and the graves have gone mossy. The stoney ground is green and slippery, too. But this evening, the sky has suddenly cleared up and the setting sun has immersed half of these dozen graves into a funnel of golden glow. The remaining half is sheltered within a cocoon of damp darkness.It might be one of the capital’s most beautiful cemeteries, and it is also very little known. You will rarely locate it in guidebooks though it is easily accessible, tucked within Deer Park in south Delhi.The graveyard is sandwiched between a Lodhi-era dome called Bagh-I-Alam and a ruined wall-mosque from the same period, circa 15th century. In fact, the graves almost seem to be a part of the mosque. They are within a few steps of the mosque’s Mecca-facing mihrab (niche), making one wonder just where the devotees of the old times would find a space to gather and offer prayers. Perhaps the graves came up long after the mosque fell into disuse. The graveyard too has fallen out of use.Today, this place feels like an abandoned courtyard that happens to be littered with forgotten tombs.A fallen tree is covering a part of the mosque, its densely leaved branches reaching over to a few graves. A black dog is sleeping beside a gravestone, half smothered by tree leaves and wild overgrown grass. Sometimes rustling sounds are suddenly emerging from within this impenetrable greens. Can there be snakes?The fear, the anticipation of unseen life has cloaked the space with thrill and suspense, and also with a sense of remoteness, as if you had strayed far from the assured bustle of city life (though Safdarjung Enclave is just a 10-minute walk).You can spend hours examining each of these graves. They are exquisitely beautiful in their dilapidation. Nobody knows whose resting places they are, but in a way they evoke more feeling than ordinary graves. The stones on the graves lie cracked, the patterns of designs on them have faded at places, and the calligraphies are disjointed. On one grave, the inscriptions, possibly in Persian or perhaps Arabic, are missing in many parts—making the writing appear like a secret code that could be cracked only by those in the know. Indeed, the slow irregular damage borne by the centuries of exposure to the elements has made the graves look like the heavily annotated pages of a much-thumbed poetry book.It’s almost sunset now and the evening walkers—elderly men in knickers and face masks—are walking past without a glance. Their casual neglect intensifies the cemetery’s isolation.And yet the graveyard is actually crowded—it is teeming with makodas, large black ants, purposefully buzzing about the tombstones, covering the floor in great number of rows as if it were a bustling metropolis of their own.The park closes after sunset and one does wonder what it would feel like to experience this secretive forgotten graveyard at midnight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/deer-park-s-graveyard/story-HbJ9B5idsoBWCRmKBItj7M.html
11-08-2020||City||Maharashtra FDA warns against high doses of Vitamin C||The Food and Drug Administration is acting against firms that are selling high doses of Vitamin C tablets. “Some companies are making 1,000mg tablets while permissions are giving only to manufacture 500mg tablets. High intake of Vitamin C can harm the health of citizens, and therefore we are taking action against such companies.We have taken action against one company in Bhiwandi for manufacturing 1,000mg of Vitamin C tablets and seized tablets worth Rs56 lakh. People are following the advice of their friends and families and are buying the tablets without prescription,” joint commissioner of FDA Sunil Bhardwaj said. Since the onset of the pandemic, Vitamin C intake has been recommended by doctors as one of the measures to boost immunity, leading to a rise in the demand of Vitamin C tablets. As the demands surged, the production for the tablets has also increased. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has set the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) value for popular vitamins such as Vitamin C at 40mg per day. However, FDA said that some companies were manufacturing 1000-mg tablets and buyers were consuming it without knowing the intake percentage. Dr Afreen Soudagar, CEO of Kalsekar Covid Hospital in Mumbra, said, “Generally, we prescribe a 90-mg Vitamin C tablet for women, and 100mg for men for daily intake. I think anything above more than 500mg is not needed. Also consuming 1,000mg tablet every day is good. But it also differs from person to person.”According to Dr Aditya Sadawarte, a practicing doctor from Thane, said, 100mg tablet is enough for one day. “Vitamin C tablets are water soluble and so they are not harmful, but a 1,000mg tablet is not necessary and its also a high dosage. People can buy any good branded companies tablets under 100mg every day. We recommend 500mg tablets to patient recovering from surgery,” he said.After the FDA started taking action against the black marketing of drugs used in Covid-19 treatment, they have also been checking if companies making Vitamin C tablets are selling them at a higher price or beyond permissible limits. “We have found Vitamin C tablets with duplicate labels of date and content from a store in Bhiwandi and are investigating the case,” said Bharadwaj.Increase in production of sanitsers, masks and PPE kits: FDAFDA officials said that before the Covid-19 outbreak, there were 94 companies who had the authority to produce sanitisers, but now 111, including ayurvedic and homeopathic firms have been given permission to manufacture sanitisers. The production of masks, too, has witnessed a surge in Maharashtra. According to the FDA, there are 89.84 lakh masks produced. There were only four PPE kit producers in Maharashtra in March but now Maharashtra has 19 producers and 102 distributors of PPE kits in the market. FDA officials claim they conduct surprise checks in every company to determine the quality of the kits. “After the pandemic broke out, we faced many challenges. We first checked if food items, milk, vegetables and grocery are adequately available. After the demand for masks and sanitisers grew, many began manufacturing it without permission and also hoarded them. We took action against them to ensure that enough sanitisers and masks are available in the market. Now, as more companies are manufacturing these two items, we would be able to create enough stocks lasting upto next year. So we request citizens to not fall for any rumors and start panic buying,” said Bharadwaj.Jaideep Jaiswar, a member of the Thane Medical Association, said,” Since the pandemic broke out, distributors and medical shop owners are also alert and have been informing authorities if they find anything suspicious. They are also maintaining their records properly. After reports of remdesivir injection being sold at high prices came to light, the FDA started taking action against the violators. If we get any information about any such malpractices, we inform the FDA on its helpline.”Within a span of two months, FDA teams have conducted 24,042 checks at several firms. FDA has acted against 83 firms all over Maharashtra for manufacturing or selling poor quality sanitisers, and seized Rs2.59-crore worth of assets and sanitisers worth Rs38.54 lakh. More than 50 cases have been registered against distributors, who overcharged consumers for masks and sanitisers. FDA teams have also taken action against hand wash makers and distributors and seized substandard products worth Rs42.83 lakh. There are five cases registered against manufacturers of PPE kits for making poor quality kits or charging high prices for the sale of the kits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-fda-warns-against-high-doses-of-vitamin-c/story-9k6W1q2uc29xa8qBaMkwGP.html

11-08-2020||City||Awhad says focus should be on managing Covid-19||Cabinet minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Jitendra Awhad on Monday said that the priority should be on managing Covid-19 pandemic efficiently and not on indulging in politics. His comment comes amid rumours of 12 NCP MLAs joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“There will be many who will come and go, but I am not used to such kind of politics. As a minister and a politician, my focus is on controlling the pandemic. We need to ensure that those who test positive get proper treatment. In such a difficult time, indulging in politics is a derogatory behaviour,” Awhad said.The housing minister was in Thane to meet with Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma to discuss implementing the measures used in Mumbra, which saw zero new cases on Sunday, across Thane city. Awhad’s constituency, Mumbra, was one of those areas which saw violation of lockdown rules and reported as many as 547 positive cases in June. However, the number of daily new cases dropped to single digits over the past fortnight.“When no one was observing lockdown norms, everyone pointed at crowded Mumbra markets and said it would be difficult to control the pandemic in Mumbra. There discussion from across the state about how Mumra could turn into the epicentre of the pandemic. But now, Mumbra is among one of those few places with zero new cases,” the minister said while addressing the media outside TMC headquarters on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/awhad-says-focus-should-be-on-managing-covid-19/story-haKnMbEUzrH9VkUBB7PbmM.html
11-08-2020||Mumbai||ED opposes Nirav’s son’s plea against seizure of properties||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday opposed the petition filed by Rohin Modi, son of fugitive diamond trader Nirav Modi who is a prime accused in ₹13,500-crore fraud at Punjab National Bank (PNB), challenging confiscation of properties purportedly belonging to a trust under his own name.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, representing ED, supported the June 8, 2020 special court order passed under section 12 of the Fugitive Economic Offenders (FEO) Act, 2018 ordering confiscation of movable and immovable properties worth ₹1,396 crore belonging to Nirav Modi and his firms.Singh said there was no need to hear Rohin as his parents Nirav and Ami Modi, both trustees of the trust, were represented before the special court and were heard before passing of the order that he has challenged. He further said that no relief can be granted to Rohin because his father defrauded PNB to the tune of ₹6,498 crore, laundered most of the amount outside India, and fled from the country.Rohin has moved HC, through advocate Lakshyaved Odhekar, challenging the special court order primarily on the grounds that no notice was issued either to Rohin Trust or him before ordering confiscation of trust properties including a penthouse in Samudra Mahal building at Worli and around 40 artworks. The said properties were part of other movable and immovable properties purportedly belonging to Nirav Modi and his firms which were listed for confiscation.Rohin’s counsel, advocate Abhimanyu Bhandari, pointed out that section 4 of FEO Act mandates that ED shall submit list of all persons, other than the FEO, interested in or who may have interest in the properties sought to be confiscated. He further added that ED was aware that Rohin Trust owned the paintings and the penthouse, but neither the trust nor Rohin was mentioned in the list of interested persons submitted by ED, and no notice was given to them.Bhandari also pointed out that section 10 of FEO Act provides for an opportunity of hearing to such interested persons, but no such hearing was given to Rohin before passing of the order. He therefore urged the high court to grant the 19-year-old son of the fugitive diamontaire an opportunity of hearing to point out to the special court that the penthouse cannot be ordered to be confiscated as the premises were purchased in 2006, about five years before PNB started extending financial facilities to Nirav Modi and his firms.Bhandari also urged the court to direct ED to maintain status quo with respect to the penthouse till Rohin is heard by the court.A division bench of justice Sadhana Jadhav and justice NJ Jamadar, however, adjourned the matter for further hearing on Thursday after finding that the file before it did not contain reasoned order of the special court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ed-opposes-nirav-s-son-s-plea-against-seizure-of-properties/story-Lt34ZPqNP4w6lyK9Sl0j9K.html
11-08-2020||Mumbai||State orders more distance between stone quarries||The state has increased the minimum distance between stone quarries that do not require blasting and residential areas and public buildings to 100 metres (m) from 50m. However, environmentalists maintain the revised guidelines are grossly inadequate and do not address the issue of uncontrolled blasting, which can affects human habitation within a 500m radius. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) published revised guidelines on August 3, which were made available on its website on Saturday. These come after a February 2 order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), based on a petition against quarrying in Kerala. NGT directed the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to develop country-wide uniform guidelines for quarrying. “We have implemented exactly what CPCB has communicated to us,” said Sudhir Srivastava, chairman, MPCB. MPCB’s circular states stone quarries may be set up at a minimum distance of 100 m (without blasting) from residential areas, highways, public buildings, railways lines, bridges, dams, monuments, heritage sites, canals, lakes, tanks etc. The minimum distance for quarries that require blasting of rocks remains the same at 200 m. “The regulation for the danger zone – 500m – as prescribed by the Directorate General (DG) of Mines Safety needs to be followed scrupulously,” reads the circular . While the pan-India mandate remains 200 m minimum distance (when blasting is involved), the 500 m rule regulation would applicable wherever necessary and the state pollution control board would implement it on a case-to-case basis, said officials. “However, it is not a mandate and needs to be enforced only when required through controlled blasting methods and ensuring that human habitations and linear infrastructure is not threatened by the quarry’s functioning,” said Srivastava, adding that MPCB would ensure the 500m distance is maintained and noise norms are not violated by stone quarries. Stone quarries emit particulate matter almost 100 times the safe limit, according to MPCB. “Apart from air, noise and water pollution, express guidelines for blasting and drilling have been issued. Such activities need to be done during favourable weather conditions [not during monsoon when there may be landslides] using permissible quantity of explosives so there is no impact to human habitation,” he said. Stone quarries emit particulate matter almost 100 times the safe limit, according to MPCB. “Apart from air, noise and water pollution, express guidelines for blasting and drilling have been issued. Such activities need to be done during favourable weather conditions (not during monsoon that can lead to landslides), permissible quantity of explosives so there is no impact to human habitations, and vibrations need to be periodically monitored,” said Srivastava. According to district survey reports from 2019, mining permits were issued to approximately 16 quarries in the Mumbai suburban district; 330 permits were issued in Thane; 52 in Palghar; 170 in Nagpur; and 30 in Sindhudurg. Environmentalists said the revised guidelines are inadequate. “While none of the existing quarries are following this rule, the 500m distance has not been followed by CPCB or MPCB. Another issue is cluster mining, which is more dangerous. This is an ad-hoc measure to comply with the NGT order,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee, Conservation Action Trust. BN Kumar, director, NatConnect said, “Going by the example of Navi Mumbai, for over three decades, Vashi, Nerul, Belapur face loud sounds of the blasts leading to cracks on glass windows. Presently, the neighbouring Kharghar node is facing a quarry menace. The hills behind the Tata Cancer Hospital are being blasted. Several houses at Gholwadi village also complained of cracks on their walls and window glasses.” CASE STUDIES OF QUARRY MENACE Thane-Belapur Industrial Belt “When there is uncontrolled blasting, the minimum distance has to be more than 500m and despite the advent of technology, most of these quarries are not installing better equipment for controlled blasting. We faced a horrible situation as the entire industrial belt was threatened by these activities until it was taken up with the state. Only then, most of these quarries were moved out. However, the threat looms for other industrial and residential areas where the 200 m minimum distance is insufficient,” said Jaydevan K, former additional chief secretary, Thane Belapur Industrial belt (TBIA). Hillocks Being Flattened In MMR Environmentalist Nandkumar Pawar, who has recently filed complaints of destruction of hills along the Dombivli-Ambernath MIDC road due to quarries that supply stones for housing construction projects in Kharghar, said, “These quarries are not even 50m away from the highway and there are villages less than 150 m where uncontrolled blasting had taken place before the monsoon season,” said Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-orders-more-distance-between-stone-quarries/story-pQffbcI6tUo4tvJszCmpeI.html
11-08-2020||Mumbai||Air pollution killing giant Asian honey bees: Study||The giant Asian honey bee or apis dorsata, which produces more than 80% of India’s honey, is falling prey to air pollution, according to a first-of-its-kind quantitative analysis on the impacts of air pollution on insects by the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bengaluru. The study indicates a decline in India’s insect population. NCBS is a centre of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. Through a four-year study of over 1,800 apis dorsata, an eight-member team led by NCBS found that more than 80% of the bees collected from moderate and highly-polluted sites died within 24 hours in Bengaluru as compared to less polluted areas where the number of dead bees was less by 20%. Between January 2017 and April 2019, average respiratory suspended particulate matter – also called PM10, which is fine particulate matter of diameter 10 microns or less – was around 28.32 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m3) at a rural site; and 33.73ug/m3, 45.95ug/m3 and 98.59ug/3 at low, moderate and highly-polluted sites respectively. The main sources of air pollution include transport emissions, industries, integrated land-use developments and open burning. Results also revealed that the rate at which giant Asian honey bees visited flowers was lower in more polluted areas. Additionally, bees from more polluted areas showed irregular heartbeats, lower blood cell count, and the expression of genes coding for stress, immunity, and metabolism. Bee debris also contained several toxic elements. For instance, metals found on the bee cuticle comprised lead, tungsten, chromium, arsenic, aluminium and cobalt. While the study sites chosen were specific to Bengaluru, Shannon B Olsson, lead author and associate professor at NCBS’s naturalist-inspired chemical ecology laboratory, said she would imagine severe impacts on the heath of the wild bees in more polluted cities such as Delhi and Mumbai. “In a city like Delhi, which is among the top 10 polluted cities in the world, there are likely to be more severe effects on bees than in Bengaluru, but there may not be the same exact impacts since the sources and components of air pollution are different in the two cities,” said Olsson. Globally, studies have recorded declines in insect populations with one in six species of bees reported locally extinct in various regions and attributed reductions in habitat quality which include pollution as a factor. “The present study on the native pollinator is one of the few studies worldwide to address physiological and molecular impacts of air pollution on wild plants and animals with field experiments,” said Olsson. Titled “A field-based quantitative analysis of sublethal effects of air pollution on pollinators”, the study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, United States of America, on Tuesday. With India being the world’s largest fruit producer, second-largest vegetable producer as well as the second-most populous country, scientists said the findings are important because this wild pollinator is not only a common resident of Indian cities, but also an important contributor to India’s food security and ecosystems. For instance, it pollinates more than 687 plants in Karnataka alone. “India also is home to nine of the world’s 10 most polluted cities, but we have no idea of the impact of air pollution on plant and animal systems. We measure pollution using air quality index which is based on human health. The importance of bees and other pollinators to India’s plant biodiversity and agro-economy cannot be overstated,” said Olsson. For the study, four different sites were chosen based on multiple parameters, such as pollution levels, proximity to traffic, and lack of pesticide application. With India facing rapid and increased urbanisation within and among its agricultural lands, Geetha Thimmegowda, another lead author and post-doctoral researcher, NCBS, said, “There is an urgency for more studies on wild plant and animal systems to better inform Indian and international air quality guidelines. Such studies are imperative to reveal the full impact of air pollution not only on the health of humans and environmental ecosystem, but also economic loss to pollinator-dependent crops and food security in highly polluted and vulnerable regions such as India.” Researchers said more than 80% of all flowering plants rely on animal pollination, and that India’s annual mango export could stand to lose over Rs 65,000 lakhs because 53% mangoes would disappear without insect pollinators like honey bees. India’s crop species are mostly dependent on insects for their production and one reason of studying the giant Asian honey bee is because they are present in both urban and rural settings. Studies have shown this species, in addition to be often found nesting in cities, also migrates its colonies repeatedly over many kilometres throughout the year among urban, rural, and forest habitats. “As a consequence, any long-term physiological or behavioural impacts of urban air pollution will also impact the pollination services these insects provide to agricultural and forest areas where they migrate,” stated the study. Arunabha Ghosh, founder and CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said much of the air quality studies in India have either considered sources of pollution or impact on human health, and to an extent on economic productivity. “This study covers important new ground, by examining the impact of air pollution on pollinators, which would have serious implications for agricultural output in India. Such findings further underscore the need to raise India’s ambient air quality standards,” he said. The impact of poor air quality did not just take its toll on apis dorsata. Experiments undertaken with drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) reared in the laboratory displayed similar effects when exposed to air pollution. Researchers said this suggests the impact is not species-specific nor likely the result of other environmental factors. “This study provides us with hard evidence that all is not well with our wild bees since it was done with wild bees naturally visiting flowers in Bengaluru city and not in lab assays on reared honey bees kept in hive boxes that may already be stressed or immuno-compromised,” said Hema Somanathan, who studies bee behaviour and pollination ecology at the Behavioural and Evolutionary Ecology (BEE) laboratory at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram, and who was not involved in the study. “Given the scale of landscape alteration and urbanisation in India, it is expected that these effects are widespread and likely to worsen with time,” said Somanathan. In addition to NCBS, collaborators include Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine (inStem), Bengaluru, Knight Cardiovascular Institute, and the department of medicine and molecular and medical genetics at the Oregon Health and Science University, Portland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/air-pollution-killing-giant-asian-honey-bees-study/story-fhIyLlGJA2bbFFVDWOmnXJ.html

We are confident that this step will bring a significant difference in our strategy to combat the pandemic. I want to ensure that critical patients at the hospital get the best treatment and care. Hence, the 11 physicians, intensivists, anesthetists, resident doctors and other medical experts and technicians will have a new timetable of working hours. The doctors will, at their specified time, be mandatorily present at the Covid ward and ICU. The medical experts will check on every patient at an interval of every one hour. The implementation of the standard treatment protocol for the treatment of the critical patients will be the responsibility of these medical experts,” said Bangar.He added, “It will be the responsibility of the medical superintendent to ensure that the doctors and technicians concerned are not just present in the hospital but are busy taking care of the patients. The medical superintendent will have to make three visits to the Covid ward and ICU.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navi-mumbai-civic-corporation-revises-guidelines-at-its-vashi-hospital-to-reduce-covid-deaths/story-nxmkcy1Hzg04yCqrH7IF2M.html
11-08-2020||Mumbai||Petition seeks to quash ordinance allowing extension to co-operative society members||A petition challenging a June 2020 order and July 2020 ordinance of the state government which postponed elections to cooperative societies and gave a three-month extension to managing committees of cooperative societies has been moved in the Bombay high court (HC). The petition stated that in view of the Co-operative Societies Act, which does not have a provision for extension and only allows appointment as administrator in case term of managing committees end, the order and ordinance should be set aside. It further said that administrators should be appointed, similar to the ones appointed in 14,000 gram panchayats.According to the petition filed by Arun Yashwant Kulkarni through advocate Satish Talekar, the tenure of most cooperative societies in the state had ended before January 2020, but the state government passed orders postponing the elections on the grounds that most officers of the cooperative sector were involved in the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Farmer Loan Waiver Scheme. The HC had quashed and set aside the order on the grounds that they were illegal, arbitrary and ultra vires to the constitution. The HC had also noted that there was no provision which permitted continuation of the term of managing committee members.Later on June 17, 2020, the state again issued an order to postpone elections of cooperative societies for three months due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and an ordinance was promulgated on July 10, 2020 allowing members to continue to hold their office till new committees are constituted.The petition, while pointing to the unconstitutionality of the order and ordinance, referred to a 2011 amendment to the Cooperative Societies Act which fixes the term of managing committee members to five years and allows for formation of an independent body that will oversee the elections or appointment of administrators in the event elections cannot be held.In light of these submissions, the petition urged the HC to quash and set aside the order and ordinance and direct the government to appoint administrators.The petition is expected to come up for hearing on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/petition-seeks-to-quash-ordinance-allowing-extension-to-co-operative-society-members/story-Ng2fF6uL0M8rVaA1mkn1jM.html

The accused, Sandip, 28, lured the minor, a resident of Ulashi, Nadia in West Bengal, citing prospects of job and marriage and brought her to Mumbai to sell her off. However, due to the lockdown he could not sell the minor and kept her in a makeshift hut at the construction site. The parents of the victim had filed a missing complaint with West Bengal Police, following which an investigation was initiated. Later, the Delhi-based NGO found out the minor was in Kashimira and informed two other local NGOs, Childline Foundation and Samata Foundation. Volunteers along with Kashimira police reached the spot and rescued the minor. The minor has been sent to rehabilitation and rescue home in Thane till West Bengal police arrives in Maharashtra to her custody.Kashimira police has registered a case of kidnapping under sections of the Indian Penal Code and also sections of the Protection of Children for Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/minor-kidnapped-from-west-bengal-rescued/story-1ECfSVYUaftDE78Gcps7lK.html

We are keen on appointments at the earliest as they have been delayed for months owing to the pandemic. We have held preliminary discussion and have decided to submit the names from parties in the next few days,” said the minister.The leaders also discussed the long-pending transfers of IPS officers. “Transfers with the promotions of senior IPS officers, too, have been delayed by a few months. The list of promotions has been cleared by the department. It has to be decided whether to transfer them before Ganpati festival or after it,” a leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mva-discusses-statutory-board-corporation-appointments/story-XjXy2qX7F0qb2eujxxwf6L.html
11-08-2020||Mumbai||Civic body likely to re-invite tenders for two sewer tunnels||In the backdrop of the Central government’s curbs on bidders of countries that share a land border with India, on the grounds of national security, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) may have to scrap and re-invite tenders for construction of two 10-km underground sewer water tunnels (SWT) between Borivli and Goregaon. BMC had in February 2020 shortlisted Chinese companies with their joint venture partners that also included Indian firms. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had granted a green nod to BMC to go ahead with appointment of a Chinese contractor for construction of the two tunnels. However, the civic body said appointment was not done, and, in the light of new guidelines from the Central government, it may re-float tenders. India and China have been locked in a months-long border stand-off, which resulted in a deadly clash last month that left 20 Indian soldiers dead. The Government of India via the Union Finance Ministry on July 23 amended the General Financial Rules (GFR) 2017 to enable imposition of restrictions on bidders from countries, which share a land border with India on the grounds of defence of India, or matters directly or indirectly related, including national security. The countries sharing land borders can only bid, in case of special permission from the Central government. The civic body claimed it will float fresh tenders following all guidelines of the Central government. Additionally, BMC will also make changes to the tender process for the Goregaon-Mulund Link Road (GMLR) project, which currently allows any firm to participate in tenders. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We had shortlisted a Chinese company, but the appointment needed an approval of the BMC’s standing committee. In the meantime, the lockdown was imposed due to Covid-19, and we could not go further with the approval. However, with the fresh guidelines issued by the Centre, we may have to scrap the ongoing tender process and re-float fresh tenders.”Both the sewer water tunnels proposed by BMC are to be connected to Malad waste water treatment facility (WWTF), and are part of BMC’s Mumbai Sewerage Disposal Project. BMC had in March 2019 floated bids to appoint contractors for construction of sewer water tunnels in two phases. The first tunnel is proposed to be constructed between Borivli and Malad WWTF, while the second is planned between Goregaon and Malad WWTF. Both the tunnels are proposed to be constructed on the linking road. The project is aimed at improving the quality and reliability of wastewater collection, treatment and promotion of its usage by bulk consumers and citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/civic-body-likely-to-re-invite-tenders-for-two-sewer-tunnels/story-DBLk91jRWDI994PLoV3xmM.html
11-08-2020||Mumbai||Leopard trapped near JB Nagar, released in SGNP||Less than 24 hours after a leopard was spotted in an abandoned factory warehouse along the boundary of a residential complex in Andheri (East), the animal was captured in one of the strategically-placed trap cages and released back into the wild.Forest officials said it was an adult male leopard aged around four years.The animal was spotted close to Kanakia Atrium-2 near JB Nagar by security staff on Sunday early morning, following which the police and forest department were informed. Forest officials, then, set up three trap cages in the 20-acre warehouse premises on Sunday. “Early on Monday, the leopard was found trapped in one of the cages,” said Jitendra Ramgaokar, deputy conservator of forest (Thane). “The animal was transported to the van parked near the society and released back into the wild at the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) around 10am. However, as per protocol, we cannot name the exact location where the animal was released,” he said adding, “A medical examination before release showed the animal was healthy and fit.” The factory warehouse has been lying abandoned for over two decades and there are several areas that are covered with dense vegetation where the leopard could have hidden. “The animal avoided any movement during the day. But, it might have moved towards the trap cages, where a chicken was kept as bait, late at night on Sunday or Monday early morning and got trapped,” said Santosh Kank, range forest officer (Mumbai).Teams from SGNP, Thane forest range and animal rescue groups had gathered at the spot after the incident was reported on Sunday. Apart from three trap cages, around 10-12 camera traps were placed to track the animal’s movement. Two forest guards and a few police personnel were deployed at the residential complex in a bid to restrict movement of the public.In April 2019, a leopard was rescued after a three-hour operation following its entry into a residential area in Marol, Andheri (East). At least six leopards have been rescued from residential areas in the densely-populated Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) since 2017. SGNP and its surrounding areas, including Aarey Colony, are home to an estimated 47 leopards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/leopard-trapped-near-jb-nagar-released-in-sgnp/story-NWF3AU4foDg8x2uotFnDNO.html

As a part of the new initiative, mobile dispensaries will visit societies to conduct antigen tests of the residents. The launch was attended by Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde, parliamentarian Rajan Vichare, Mumbai Slum Improvement Board chairman Vijay Nahata and Navi Mumbai civic chief Abhijit Bangar. “Each of the 40 mobile dispensaries will have doctors, technicians and requisite staff. It will visit every corner of the city, including housing societies. These vehicles will ensure that antigen tests of suspected patients are conducted within the comforts of their homes. The doctors will check the residents and those found to be symptomatic will undergo the antigen and the RT-PCR tests. Residents who are aged and those suffering from comorbidities will especially benefit because of the initiative,” said Shinde, who launched Mission Zero Navi Mumbai. Bangar has appealed to citizens to support the initiative. “This project will ensure increased testing with little hassle to residents. We have already boosted testing in the city to over 3,000 per day and this initiative will further augment our capacity and reach. We appeal to the residents to support this initiative. It will help us curb fatalities and ultimately bring the cases down to zero in our city, which is our mission.” Organisations such as the Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana, Desh Apnayen, United Way and Credai MCHI helped the civic body procure 40 mobile van dispensaries. “A large number of people are unable to go to testing centres and this service will prove to be a boon for them. This is an excellent initiative and the residents should take maximum advantage of the opportunity,” said Nahata.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mission-zero-navi-mumbai-launched-to-increase-covid-testing-in-city/story-fVc7pvVCWJMcSWPlrd87VM.html
11-08-2020||Mumbai||Transfer plot at Mahul to BMC for pumping station: Thackeray||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday sought transfer of a plot owned by the Union ministry of commerce and industry at Mahul to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for building a pumping station to improve the chronic flooding during monsoon at Dadar-Hindmata area. In a review meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on states which were hit by floods recently, Thackeray also said that a committee, headed by the PM, should be formed for better co-ordination to tackle natural calamities. Chief ministers of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka and Assam also attended the meeting through video conferencing.Thackeray also demanded a financial assistance of ₹1,500 crore from the Centre which includes ₹1,065 crore for damages due to Cyclone Nisarga in June this year and ₹500 crore for Mumbai floods.The pumping station at Mahul is part of the seven pumping stations planned under Brimstowad project and is one of the two stations which are yet to be constructed. Another pumping station in Mogra, Andheri is also pending construction. Brimstowad project got a boost after the July 2005 deluge in Mumbai and it envisages upgrading the city’s colonial drainage systems. The pumping station at Mahul will provide relief in low-lying areas such as Wadala, Dadar and Hindmata, which are among flood-prone spots in the city. Of the seven pumping stations, Mahul is the largest one with a capacity to pump out 150 cubic metres of water each second.“The CM insisted that the city needs the pumping station to prevent flooding at several areas including Wadala, Dadar, Hindmata. It is a long pending issue that needs to be resolved. It is also the most-suitable plot the civic body has identified for the project,” said a senior official who attended the meeting.Non-availability of land has delayed the Mahul pumping station project for over a decade. After identifying the plot, BMC issued tenders for the project multiple times but the work is yet to start. The civic body has written several letters for land transfer but got little response so far.“The PM directed the concerned departments to take decisions on all the suggestions and demands following due process and study,” said the official.On June 3, Cyclone Nisarga made landfall in Alibag, and wreaked havoc in Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Thane and Palghar districts leading to damages to property, houses, infrastructure. Mumbai witnessed floods after heavy downpour which lasted for almost 24 hours, Thackeray said. He also raised the railways ministry’s proposed project to upgrade the 176-km long Akola-Khandwa railway line saying that it passes through Melghat tiger reserve and requires over 160 hectare forest land. Thackeray suggested alternative alignment of the railway line from outside the tiger reserve, an official said. The project involves conversion of metre-gauge line to a broad-gauge line along the stretch. Thackeray has already written a letter to Union railway minister Piyush Goyal and Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar in July in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/transfer-plot-at-mahul-to-bmc-for-pumping-station-thackeray/story-JYzZ0ZZpW6P6WRCHAgcqgO.html

State minority affairs minister Nawab Malik made the claim on Monday and said that the party leadership is yet to decide on taking them back.Malik, who also heads the party’s Mumbai unit, was responding to the rumours making rounds in the political circles that 12 MLAs from NCP may jump the ship and join BJP. NCP, the then opposition party, had faced mass exodus before the state Assembly elections in 2019 with many senior leaders, apart from eight sitting MLAs and one sitting MP, had left the party to join the then ruling parties — the BJP and Shiv Sena.With the change in the political scenario, the party is now claiming that many of the turncoats want to return. “Some irresponsible news channels have claimed that 12 NCP MLAs are set to join BJP; their claims are false and baseless. In fact, the NCP MLAs who had left the party last year are ready for ghar wapsi. However, the leadership has not taken any decision yet. If attempts to spread rumours continue, we will take a decision and empty the state BJP,” Malik said in a video statement released on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/turncoat-mlas-now-want-to-return-ncp/story-RWm08N3Vk9VYURzj0mYmkN.html

As part of this, the station building along with passenger amenities will be rebuilt at a cost of ₹2.53 crore. The work is expected to commence soon. A railway booking office, booking store, station master’s office, chief booking supervisor’s office and other structures inside the railway station will also undergo development. A foot overbridge (FoB) that will connect the east side of the station to the west side is being constructed and the work is expected to be completed in August. “The construction is being undertaken based on age and structural condition in order to rehabilitate and develop the facilities that have been demolished,” said a senior WR official. A tender for rebuilding the station building with facilities is set to be issued by the zonal railway on August 11. In 2017, the stairs of a BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) FoB had collapsed outside Charni Road railway station injuring one person. Meanwhile, 19 suburban railway stations are also being redeveloped by Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC), the body responsible for execution of suburban rail infrastructure projects in the city. Suburban railway stations including Bhandup, Mulund, Thane, Dombivli, Shahad, Neral, Kasara, GTB Nagar, Chembur, Govandi, Mankhurd, Mumbai Central (local), Jogeshwari, Kandivili, Mira Road, Bhayandar and Vasai Road station are among the stations listed for redevelopment.

Kalyan private doctors may face legal action||Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi has decided to take legal action against private doctors who do not recommend antigen tests for patients suffering from fever.In a notice issued by the civic body chief, Suryavanshi said that if doctors do not ask patients to undergo antigen tests, it would lead to a surge in Covid-19 cases and even more deaths, owing to lack of timely treatment. “We received some complaints about private doctors who are not sending their patients for antigen tests. This will be considered a serious breach of directions and the doctors will face action under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and Disaster Management Act, 2005,” said Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC. According to Panpatil, many patients end up taking various other tests on falling ill but do not undergo the Covid test as doctors do not direct them for it. “Later, when patients’ health deteriorates, they are categorised as suspected Covid patients. All of this delays their treatment,” she said. According to doctors, patients do not wish to take the antigen tests. “If required, we do ask patients to get the tests. But they want to take the medicines for fever and recover at home. However, now with the civic body’s clear directions, we will follow-up with the patients to ensure that they get the tests without fail,” a doctor from Kalyan’s Khadakpada area said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-antigen-test-despite-fever-kalyan-private-doctors-may-face-legal-action/story-bxxqds6nK8wnVEmo6tRTLO.html

11-08-2020||Mumbai||117 civic employees in Mumbai died of Covid-19: Data||A total of 117 employees of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) have succumbed to Covid-19, information by the civic body has revealed. So far, 2,384 BMC employees have been infected with Covid-19, of whom 1,280 (53%) have recovered. The case fatality rate among the civic employees is 4.9%. Sainath Rajadhyaksha, head of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Engineers’ Association, attributed the high case fatality ratio to the late reporting of the cases. “The high number of deaths is owing to the late reportage of cases when the BMC was not allowing anyone to get tested unless they had developed symptoms and a doctor’s prescription was also must. Nearly 30,000 civic employees are out on the field, working to curb the outbreak. The likelihood of many of them getting infected is high,” he said.Among the senior officials who have succumbed to Covid-19 is H-East ward’s assistant commissioner, who was working towards creating the jumbo Covid facility at Bandra-Kurla Complex. He died on July 11. On June 9, a deputy municipal commissioner also succumbed to the infection.According to the corporation, most employees who have tested positive for Covid-19 are from the solid waste management (SWM) department, health department and many staffers who work at the ward level. “These are frontline staff who come directly in contact with Covid-19 patients, work at containment zones and have been assigned field work,” a civic official said.According to the official the BMC is taking several measures to prevent the spread of the virus among its employees. “Unlike the pre-Covid times, people are not allowed to gather in large numbers at corridors or outside the BMC canteen. There are sanitisers at every entry point. Many wards are adopting foot-operated lifts and sensor-based taps. Even the Worli engineering hub will now be fitted with foot-operated machines. However, we can’t say how and when can the infection spread,” the official added.Meanwhile, Rajadhyaksha said that the compensation amount for the family of the deceased staffers should be released soon to their families. “The compensation of ₹50 lakh promised by the state to the families of government employees who succumb to Covid-19 should be expedited, as there is a lot of red tapism in releasing the money. Also, the kin of the deceased should be given jobs as per their qualification without any delay,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/117-civic-employees-in-mumbai-died-of-covid-19-data/story-PbFAXPOgXnEADrV4fxgmfI.html
11-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government to invite Covid-19 warriors to its official events on Independence Day across state||The Maharashtra government has decided to invite Covid-19 warriors such as doctors, conservancy workers and health workers for this year’s official Independence Day events, an order from the protocol department stated on Monday. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will be attending his first flag-hoisting ceremony at Mantralaya — the state headquarters — as per protocol. Similar ceremonies will be held at all the district and divisional headquarters across the state. “Along with public representatives, freedom fighters and families of martyred soldiers, doctors, conservancy workers, health workers and those fully recovered from Covid-19 should be invited as Covid warriors for this Independence Day programme,” the order by the protocol department read. Considering the health crisis, the state has issued directives to local authorities such as divisional commissioner and district collectors over celebrating Independence Day event this year. The authorities have been asked to follow all the precautionary norms, including social distancing and mandatory wearing of masks. “All the social distancing norms shall be followed considering the ongoing health crisis. The responsibility for the same would be on the organisers of the event,” the order reads, adding that arrangements must be made to telecast the official event live on the government websites so that maximum citizens can watch it from their homes. “Corona warriors have played a significant role in the battle against the pandemic. We want to acknowledge their noble service, by inviting them for the event,” a senior official from the protocol department said.Maharashtra has been the most-affected state in the country owing to Covid-19 pandemic. It has recorded over 5.24 lakh cases and around 18,000 deaths. However, the tally of the recovered patients has also crossed 3.58 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-to-invite-covid-19-warriors-to-its-official-events-on-independence-day-across-state/story-FyzSqSaDT5HfFH7UvY3raL.html

However, KDMC claims that according to its calculations, the total bill should amount to ₹1.16 lakh. KDMC said the per day cost incurred for PPE amounts to ₹1,000. “The hospital has charged ₹36,810 extra for the PPE kits, which is not permissible. The actual total bill should have been ₹1.16 lakh. We have asked the hospital for an explanation, based on which further action will be taken,” said a KDMC official. KDMC also alleged that the hospital did not maintain details of 80% beds reserved for Covid-19 patients and also did not submit all the bills to them to KDMC auditors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kalyan-hospital-gets-show-cause-notice-for-violating-state-s-directions-over-treatment-of-covid-patients/story-rZv7ewlnNuuuZ2ncTSXQAI.html
11-08-2020||City||1 lakh more rapid test kits for Mumbai?||After crossing the six lakh Covid-19 tests mark, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) plans to procure one lakh more antigen testing kits to continue with its “proactive testing approach”. The total number of Covid tests done till Sunday is 6.05 lakh. Rapid antigen kits deliver test results within 15-20 minutes, but are less sensitive compared to the RT-PCR tests. More than 50% of the daily Covid tests are done using these kits, according to BMC officials. According to the civic body’s data, more than 24,937 sanitation workers have been tested using the kits; 215 of them have tested positive. Among the 4,551 rapid tests conducted on the Mumbai police staff, 101 have come positive. A senior civic official said, “A proposal will soon be put up for another one lakh antigen kits. We are halfway through exhausting the antigen kits from the current stock of one lakh kits. These testing kits are proving to be beneficial as we are able to find more positive cases in a short span.” Civic officials also said they plan to increase the number of teams that are conducting tests and test in phases to cover more areas. Madhav Sathe, retired professor of microbiology at Nair Hospital, said, “Rapid antigen testing should be done on a larger scale across Maharashtra. Areas like Jalgaon, Solapur, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Navi Mumbai should have antigen testings, too, as there are more cases there and the testing capacity is not up to the mark.” BMC had procured one lakh kits in the first week of July from a South Korean firm, which was the only company approved by ICMR. On July 2, the civic body announced that it would start rapid antigen tests at the five wards with the most Covid-19 cases at the time – R-North (Dahisar), R-Central (Borivli), R-South (Kandivli), P-North (Malad) and P-South (Goregaon). Later, it was decided to include all wards. Meanwhile, on Monday, Mumbai recorded 925 Covid-19 cases and 46 deaths, taking the tally to 124, 307 and toll to 6, 845, according to the state health department data. As per BMC’s data, of the 46 deaths, four were of patients below 40 years of age, 30 of patients above 60 years of age, and 12 patients were between 40 and 60 years. The data stated that 1, 407 patients were discharged on Monday. A total of 97,993 patients have been treated and discharged so far. The number of active patients in the city is 19, 172. The recovery rate of the city is 78%. Dharavi reported nine new cases on Monday, taking the total to 2,626.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-lakh-more-rapid-test-kits-for-mumbai/story-JkjQZVqnK2ZpqRLCq2F5iL.html

People didn’t even wear masks,” said Bali, adding that people gathering in large numbers is obvious when a political leader visits some area.He said that the administration should have suggested the CM to avoid touring the district amid the pandemic.“If the tour was necessary, he should have listened to the public grievances at the Mini-Secretariat where it would have been easy for the authorities to implement social distancing,” said Bali.Citing an example, Bali said that he cancelled the annual Bal Mela, an annual event held at Nagrota Bagwan, which coincides with his birthday due to the Covid pandemic.He also hit out at the government over second capital status to the Dharamshala town.Bali said that the government mentions Dharamshala as second capital but leave aside the minister, not even a secretary sits here.The former minister said that the state government was talking about ₹30,000 crores losses but did not tell people where these losses occurred.“It was just a ploy to increase the bus fare and cut subsidies. Recent decisions have exposed the government’s anti-people face. The BJP government is functioning like an agent of transporters and contractors,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bali-flays-govt-over-violation-of-social-distancing-norms-during-cm-s-kangra-tour/story-w1bGveLz2G0XL9u1bPNLNN.html

Police said the burglars locked them up in a room before ransacking the house and decamping with Rs 30,000 in cash and some gold and silver ornaments. The suspects are yet to be identified. According to the police, the incident took place around 3.30pm when the house owner, a 77-year-old retired government employee, his wife and the domestic helper were home. Police said the three armed suspects barged into the house, gaining entry by breaking the door open. Jaibir Singh, station house officer (SHO), DLF phase 3 police station, said: “At the time of the incident, the couple and their domestic helper were in the house. The door was bolted from inside. The suspects used force to break the door open. They held the three at gunpoint and asked them to reveal where the cash and valuables were kept.”Police said the suspects told the victims to stay put in one corner while they ransacked the house. Police are checking footage of CCTVs in the area to identify the suspects. A case has been registered against unidentified suspects under relevant sections of the IPC at the DLF Phase 3 police station.After two similar incidents of burglaries, where armed suspects had targeted senior citizens in sectors 40 and 10 in the past five weeks, police are investigating if it is the same gang that is behind these incidents. On July 21, an armed suspect rang the doorbell of a house in Sector 40 for reconnaissance and after 20 minutes, he and his two aides had held a senior citizen couple hostage at gun-point, decamping with Rs 35,000 apart from jewellery worth lakhs. The suspects had tied the hands of the victims while ransacking the house. On July 4, three armed men had barged into a house in Sector 10 and snatched a phone and car keys from a family. The suspects had fired a gunshot to intimidate the victims and in March, four men including a domestic help had robbed jewellery and cash worth Rs 2 crore after tying up a senior citizen and a minor in Sector 45.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/armed-burglars-barge-into-dlf-phase-3-house-rob-elderly-couple/story-FSPmvnL7yHASMZkHG4y8dL.html
11-08-2020||City||3 Rajouri labourers missing from Shopian since July 17||Suspecting foul play, the family of three labourers from Rajouri district, who remain missing since July 17, on Sunday lodged a missing report with the Rajouri police. The three men Imtiyaz Ahmad, 21, of Dhar Sakri in Koteranka, Abrar Ahmad Khan, 18, of Dhar Sakri and Abrar Ahamd, 26, of Tarkassi Tehsil Koteranka in Rajouri had reached Shopian via the Mughal Road on July 2 and July 17 to work as labourers but have remained missing since. Rajouri district police chief SSP Chandan Kohli confirmed that a missing report had been lodged with the Koteranka police post. Ahmad’s uncle Lal Hussain said, “On July 2 my nephew Imtiyaz Ahmad was the first to leave Rajouri for Chowgam in Shopian district and on July 17 the other two, who are also my relatives joined Imtiyaz. On July 17, I talked to them and they told me that they had reached Chowgam. They had taken a room on rent and had brought ration and beddings for themselves. Since then there has been no contact since, the families are really worried,” he told HT over a phone from a Dhok in upper reaches of Koteranka. Hussain said “They have only one phone with them, which is switched off. Initially, we thought that they may have been quarantined in Kashmir amid the Covid-19 pandemic and Kashmir usually has connectivity problems but eventually we lodged a written missing persons complaint at Koteranka police post,” said Lal Hussain. Meanwhile, CPI (M) leader and former legislator MY Tarigami has demanded a time-bound judicial probe. “The incident of three labourers from Rajouri going missing from Shopian district from July 17 is a serious issue and needs a time-bound judicial probe,” said Tarigami. ‘KILLED IN FAKE ENCOUNTER’As per media reports the trio went missing just a day before security forces claimed they had killed three unidentified militants in Shopian. “There are unverified reports that the missing labourers have been killed in a fake encounter in Shopian on July 18. This is shocking and must be probed by a sitting high court judge in a time-bound manner,” he added. “In the past too, there have been unfortunate incidents of civilians being killed in fake encounters for rewards and promotions in Kashmir. The 2010 unrest was the creation of the Machil fake encounter,” he said. Srinagar-based defence spokesperson of the 15 Corps and 14 Corps colonel Rajesh Kalia said, “We have noted social media inputs linked to the operation at Shopian on July 18. The three terrorists killed during the operation have not been identified and the bodies were buried based on established protocols. Army is investigating the matter”.Altaf Bukhari demands high level probe Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party (JKAP) president Syed Mohammad Altaf Bukhari also sought an impartial and time bound probe to unearth the mystery behind the disappearance of the labourers. In a statement issued here, Bukhari said, “The Lt governor-led government in J&K is expected to order and pursue a serious, impartial and transparent investigation that leaves no stone unturned in finding out what happened to these three poor labourers who have lost contact with their families since July 17,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-rajouri-labourers-missing-from-shopian-since-july-17/story-FQS2EepldVWVs4MNraAbEK.html

11-08-2020||Gurugram||Serological survey 2.0 may start from August 13 in Gurugram, cover 850 people||The second round of the serological survey for Gurugram is likely to kick-off from August 13 and cover at least 850 people. Serological survey detects IgG antibodies against Covid-19, which people might have developed without showing any classic symptoms of the virus like cough, cold and fever. A sero survey helps in gauging the extent of spread of and the actual burden of Covid-19 infection in the society. IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus develops in the human body two weeks after the onset of the infection and it remains in the body for long time, indicating that the episode of the infection happened in the past. For the second round of survey , the administration has identified 16 clusters in the district where 500 people from rural and 350 from urban areas will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The latest round will be part of a statewide survey that is likely to cover at least 21,000 people.The identified clusters in urban areas in Gurugram are Basai, Khandsa, Patel Nagar and Tigra. In the rural areas the 12 identified clusters are Daulatabad, Badshahpur, Pataudi, Bajghera, Palra, Sherpur, Sarai, Aklimpur, Inchhapuri, Bhudka, Bhorakalan and Rathiwas. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Lab technicians have been trained to carry out the survey in identified clusters tentatively from August 13 or from August 17. In urban areas, 88 samples will be taken from a cluster. Each cluster will be divided into four quadrants, with each quadrant comprising of 22 households.”“Likewise, in rural areas 42 samples will be taken from each cluster. Each cluster will be divided into four quadrants comprising 11 households. Informed verbal consent of the people above 18 years of age will be taken to give their blood samples for the antibody test,” said Yadav. According to him, 16 teams have been formed. Each team will comprise three members — one medical officer, one lab technician and a health care worker. A supervisor will be appointed for every two clusters. Earlier, from June 24 till mid-July, first round of serological survey had been conducted in the district. At least 454 IgG antibody tests were conducted then, out of which 56 tested positive while 398 were negative. The districts of Ambala, Faridabad, Panchkula and Sonepat were also covered in similar surveys. This time, all 22 districts of the state will be part of the survey, with officials aiming to cover at least 21,000 people across the state. Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, said, “Final report of the survey will be prepared within a week’s time, after the survey starts.We have 21 lab technicians who have been trained and will take blood samples for antibody detection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/serological-survey-2-0-may-start-from-august-13-in-gurugram-cover-850-people/story-V6bI3mBvT2IJeZ5J4uTyQM.html
11-08-2020||Mumbai||Maha Covid recovery rate rises to 68.33%||Maharashtra on Monday reported 9,181 Covid-19 cases, taking its tally to 524,513, while the death toll rose to 18,050 with 293 new fatalities. Mumbai saw 925 new infections and 46 deaths, taking the tally to 124,307 and toll to 6,845.A total of 6,711 patients recovered in the past 24 hours, taking the total of recovered patients to 358,421, which pushed the recovery rate to 68.33%. The state has 147,735 active patients — 1,001,268 are home quarantined and 35,521 are in institutional quarantine. The percentage of active patients against the recovered ones has improved to 41.21% on Monday, from 66.49% two weeks ago on July 27. The state conducted 48,430 tests and the cumulative positivity rate of the state stood at 18.91%. Pune district continues to be on top, with respect to daily caseload, at 1,699 new cases, including 280 in rural Pune, 779 in Pune city and 640 in Pimpri-Chinchwad. Pune city has, however, for the first time in the past few weeks reported fewer cases than Mumbai. Pune city reported 23 deaths, while 19 fatalities were reported in the district’s rural part. Of the other deaths on Monday, 96 were from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), including 46 in Mumbai, 10 in Mira-Bhayander, eight in Thane city and seven in Kalyan-Dombivli. State’s case fatality rate (CFR) stood at 3.44%, against the national rate of 2.01%. The CFR of the state is a cause of worry for the state administration, as of the total fatalities, more than half have been reported in the past 35 days. Of the 17,757 deaths reported in the past five months of outbreak of the Covid-19, till August 9, 8,935 or 50.32% deaths were between July 6 and August 9. First case of the virus infection was reported in the state on March 9 this year. In the last 35 days, the state reported 3,08,713 infections and registered a CFR of 2.89%.Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune districts accounted for 69.34% or 6,196 deaths in the last 35 days. Mumbai alone has seen 1,900 cases during this period.According to the officials, the high CFR is attributed to the weak health infrastructure, lacklustre approach towards tracking and tracing of contacts. “Districts like Nandurbar depend on testing labs from neighbouring districts, leading to delay in reports, which in turn results in faster spread of the infection. The district’s administrations in such districts have failed to rope in private laboratories and use private infrastructure. The state and central government’s diktats for aggressive testing and tracing are not followed rigorously. We have been asking the district authorities to trace at least 15 people per infection, but in many districts it is below 10. Districts like Jalgaon, Solapur, Nagpur have not been able to augment the infrastructure and manage the available resources properly,” said an official from the health department.State health minister Rajesh Tope said on Sunday that the authorities have been directed to go for the aggressive tracing of more than 15 people per infection and their proper treatment which will help in reduction of CFR. Dr TP Lahane, director, directorate of medical education and research said, “High CFR is due to the late admission of patients in many districts. We have directed authorities to go for aggressive tracking and tracing to entail reduction in fatalities. We have set up labs in almost all districts now.” Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, public health consultant, said, “In many districts, we do not have crucial infrastructure with ICUs, oxygen and ventilators, apart from the lack of trained manpower and medical expertise. Government should have participation of the doctors from private medical colleges, which will help the authorities tide over the shortage of doctors.

Officials, including the chief medical officer of Gurugram and the district surveillance officer, clarified that while there were no immediate plans to ramp up surveillance for Covid-19 in the district, the current rate (and the strategy) of testing will continue until further orders from the state government. They added that the present strategy to tackle Covid-19 infections in the state would suffice in case a spike in cases occurs. Moreover, 25% of all hospital beds in Gurugram will also remain reserved for Covid-19 patients, in the anticipation of the virus’ resurgence within the community.“At present, we don’t see any need to increase testing capabilities, but we are not going to reduce testing either. Whether we will see a second wave or not is a matter of debate, but for our part, we are confident that the existing surveillance system will be enough to help us tackle another rise in cases,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s district surveillance officer in Gurugram, who emphasised that the health department’s “test-trace-isolate” policy has been successful at curbing transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 virus among the district population. While Gurugram is conducting between 2,000 to 2,500 tests a day (with about a quarter comprising the more reliable RT-PCR method), the test-positivity rate has been on the decline over the past six weeks, now resting at below 5%. This is down from almost 60% in mid-June. For at least the past 10 days, Gurugram has reported less than 100 new cases of Covid-19 each day, with recoveries outweighing new positives. The recovery rate stands at 91 percent, up from 86 percent three weeks ago, while the mortality rate now stands at 1.2% (with 125 deaths in total), as opposed to 1.4% three weeks ago. While experts were less reluctant to attribute Gurugram’s improvement solely to public health interventions, they agreed that increasing testing may not be necessary at this stage. Dr Prabhakaran Dorairaj, vice president (research and policy) at the Public Health Foundation of India, said, “With rural districts now emerging as the hot spots, it makes more sense to divert resources there instead of deploying them in urban centres where there has been a perceptible decline in cases and deaths.”Dorairaj also said that this perceptible decline is a natural progression of the epidemic, which has only been slowed down by the lockdown. “But transmission of the virus has continued despite curbs, as shown by serological studies from Delhi and Mumbai, where as many as 23% of the sampled population has been exposed to the virus. Gurugram, being a part of Delhi-NCR, would likely have a similar proportion of population infected, and this may have reached a natural threshold after which the virus has slowed down,” he said, clarifying that this hypothesis requires supporting evidence, which is yet to emerge.This view was also echoed by a senior epidemiologist at a public university in Delhi who, requesting anonymity, said, “It has yet to be proven scientifically, but my hunch is that the slowdown in NCR is happening because of a large number of people having acquired immunity through exposure. In some models, the prevalence for herd immunity is as little as 25%. Faridabad’s reported case numbers, for example, are growing not because the outbreak there is more severe, but because the population is more than Gurugram’s. Given what we know about seroprevalence in large cities now, the role of public health vigilance should be to preventing deaths when they occur, not really stopping the spread of the virus.”Gurugram’s chief medical officer, Dr Virender Yadav, was skeptical of a second wave, as it is traditionally understood in epidemiology. “India as a whole is still going through a first wave. India is so large that we will see different states, and different districts within states, reach their peaks at different times. It is good to be vigilant because cases will naturally increase as people start moving about more, but whether this counts as a ‘second wave’ can be debated. That term comes from our experience with the influenza virus, which is seasonal. We don’t know the seasonality of SARS-Cov-2 yet. Nevertheless, we have enough hospital beds reserved to treat an increase in cases, which may happen as people start going about their normal lives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/existing-measures-sufficient-for-a-second-wave-of-covid-19-infections-health-department/story-sRwFpy2MVbsdKwYToPc67H.html
11-08-2020||Gurugram||Two kidnap senior engineer of pvt company, police probe ‘honey trap’ angle||Two men were arrested for allegedly kidnapping and assaulting a senior engineer of a private company and attempting to extort Rs 2 lakh from him after recording some ‘objectionable videos’ of him in sector 50 on Sunday. Police said the kidnapped man, however, managed to escape by jumping from the car window and informing the police when the kidnappers were taking him to Badshahpur. Police said they were also probing the role of the victim’s female friend, whom the alleged kidnappers had dropped home before taking him to a hotel, with investigators looking at the ‘honey trap’ angle keenly. Police said the victim, identified as Anil, a resident of Garhi Harsaru near sector 10, received a phone call from a woman friend on Saturday evening during which she asked him to meet her in a hotel in sector 49. After the meeting, which lasted over two hours, as Anil and his friend were exiting the hotel at 11pm, two suspects parked their car near the gate of the hotel and approached them. According to the police, one of the accused men, Sahil Kamboj, 26, was acquainted with Anil’s woman friend. Police said the accused offered to drop the woman to her house and then ‘forced’ the victim into their car. After dropping the woman, the accused took Anil to a hotel near a bus stand in sector 12 and held him hostage there till Sunday morning. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “The accused men held Anil hostage all night and beat him up. They disrobed him and recorded his videos and threatened to share them if he didn’t cough up money. On Sunday, they asked him for Rs 2 lakh cash. The victim asked his brother to transfer the amount to his account. During the night, the suspects went to the hotel in sector 49, where the victim’s SUV was parked and brought it to the hotel, where he was held hostage.” Police said according to the victim, on Sunday evening, the accused then forced him into his SUV and drove towards Badshahpur area with the alleged intention of ‘killing him’. When the SUV slowed down at a traffic signal near Vatika Chowk, the victim jumped out from the car’s window to save himself. Police said the suspects fled with the SUV immediately after. Some documents and Rs 40,000 cash was kept in the victim’s car at the time. The victim later informed the police control room and teams from sector 50 police station conducted raids to nab the duo, who were later tracked and arrested from Fazilpur Jharsa village near sector 71. Police said later on Sunday night, Anil’s woman friend filed a complaint against him alleging that he had raped her in the hotel in sector 49 on Saturday. Surender Singh, station house officer (SHO), sector 50 police station, said, “One of the arrested suspects is a friend of the woman. We are probing if she was also complicit in the kidnapping. Prima facie, our probe suggests that the accused wanted to extort money and were waiting for the amount to be transferred to his account. The woman has also filed a complaint of rape against Anil and an FIR has been registered. We are investigating the allegations levelled by her.” The arrested men, Sahil Kamboj and Aman Sharma, 18, are both residents of Sheetla Colony. Police recovered two cars, including the victim’s SUV, and Rs 29,500 cash from their possession. Kamboj works as a supervisor of a private outsourced project with the municipal corporation of Gurugram, according to a police statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-kidnap-senior-engineer-of-pvt-company-police-probe-honey-trap-angle/story-77u2ves4CmHqvNxqj14s0K.html
11-08-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: ED questions Rhea Chakraborty again for 10 hours||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday questioned actor Rhea Chakraborty for over ten hours in the case of money laundering registered in connection with the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Chakraborty, 28, had allegedly been in a romantic relationship with Rajput at the time of his death. This is the second time Chakraborty has been questioned by ED following allegations by Rajput’s father that Chakraborty abetted Rajput’s suspected suicide and misappropriated his funds. On Monday, Chakraborty arrived at the Central agency’s office at Ballard Estate at around 11.30 am. She was accompanied by her father Indrajeet and brother Showik. Later, her manager Shruti Modi also arrived at the ED office. A few hours later, Rajput’s friend and flatmate Sidhharth Pithani also reached the ED office for questioning. Chakraborty and her family were questioned for over nine hours and left the ED office at around 9pm. Sources in ED said the questioning was focused around Chakraborty’s income, expenditures, investments, business and professional deals. Details of properties in Khar and Navi Mumbai linked to Chakraborty as well as dealings of the companies that she and her family had established with Rajput were under scrutiny. Her statements were recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). ED’s investigation has focused on a possible mismatch between Chakraborty’s income and expenditures. Sources said questions were raised about a flat she owns in Khar. Chakraborty told investigators that the property is valued at ₹84 lakh and to purchase it, she took a home loan of ₹60 lakh. Chakraborty has maintained she is innocent and she has denied using Rajput’s money for any of her investments, officials said. Chakraborty had initially refused to appear before the agency, citing an appeal pending before the Supreme Court. However, she later produced herself before ED investigators on Friday and again on Monday. Officials said she had responded to most of their questions. Rhea’s manager Shruti Modi left ED office at around 10.30pm. At the time of going to press Rajput’s close friend Sidhharth Pithani was still being questioned at the ED office.Previously, Chakraborty’s brother Showik, who is a director at two companies reportedly owned by Rajput, was questioned for approximately 18 hours by ED. On July 31, ED filed a case on the basis of a first information report (FIR) by Bihar Police. The FIR was registered following a complaint by Rajput’s father, KK Singh, who accused Chakraborty and her family of abetting Rajput’s suspected suicide and misappropriating his funds. Singh alleged close to ₹15 crore had been transferred from Rajput’s account to unknown persons and that Rajput’s credit cards were linked to Chakraborty. On the request of the Bihar government, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has launched a probe in the matter of Rajput’s death and named Chakraborty, Showik and four other family members of Chakraborty, as accused along with other unknown persons. Rajput, 34, was found dead in his apartment in Bandra on June 14 and a case of accidental death was registered by Bandra Police, which is conducting a parallel investigation into the actor’s death. According to the post-mortem report, Rajput’s death was due to asphyxia and there were no indications of foul play.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-ed-questions-rhea-chakraborty-again-for-9-hours/story-yYzjb6VhM07avCeIMQAGCJ.html
11-08-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad: Covid-related death reported after 19 days as 37-year-old dies during treatment||After having recorded no Covid-related deaths for 19 days, the Ghaziabad district saw a fatality on Sunday when a 37-year-old coronavirus-positive man died, according to the August 10 data of the state control room for the district. According to officials, the man breathed his last at the L3 hospital in Ghaziabad.The last death was reported in the district on July 21. In Sunday’s case, which is the first Covid-related in the month for Ghaziabad, the patient was admitted to Santosh Medical, the only L3 facility here, on August 3. According to the health department, the patient was admitted with low (82%) oxygen level and low respiratory rate. “The man was from Ambedkar Nagar area and was admitted to ICU and also given oxygen through high flow nasal cannula to relax the low oxygen levels. On August 4, he was given Remdesivir and other high value medicines. Although his oxygen level increased, it could not go beyond 85%, against the minimum required at 94%. On August 5, he was given plasma. On August 8, he developed complications with kidney ailments and passed away on August 9,” said an officer from the district health department, who wished not to be named.Officials said they gave the best possible treatment to the patient.“We tried every possible treatment, along with medicines available. But his was a case of someone who got admitted when his condition had already deteriorated. Since June, when a majority of deaths were reported, we have put in a number of systems in place for early testing and early detection, faster referral and treatment in order to avoid fatalities. It is still our focus that people should get themselves tested at the onset of symptoms so that their treatment can start immediately,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.Till May 31, the district had four deaths while a majority of them, 51, were added to the tally in the month of June. In July, the fatality rate decreased with nine deaths, while one has taken place so far in the month of August.In another case, the DM on Monday assigned an inquiry to the city magistrate to look into allegations made by the family of a 92-year-old man who died at the premises of the MMG District Hospital early Sunday. His family alleged that after the man had tested positive at Sarvodaya Hospital in Kavi Nagar, they took him to the emergency wing of the MMG Hospital at around 1.30am on Sunday but no doctor turned up till 6am. “As a result, he died. He was suffering diarrhoea and we took him to Sarvodaya Hospital where he was treated for a similar complication three years ago and had got relief. At the hospital, he tested positive for Covid-19. We rushed him in a private car to MMG Hospital but no one attended to him till 6am. Finally when a team of doctors arrived and declared him dead,” alleged Anil Kumar, son of victim Mangu Ram.DM Shankar said that city magistrate Shiv Pratap Shukla has been assigned an inquiry. “The allegations of the family will be taken up in the inquiry and the report is expected within two-three days,” Pandey added. This fatality, however, has not been added to the district’s tally as inquiry is still pending in the case.Dr Neeraj Garg, the chief medical superintendent of Sarvodaya Hospital, said that the patient was not admitted to the hospital.“When his family brought him to the hospital, we conducted a test and found him positive for Covid-19. He was admitted at another private hospital and later brought here at 12.30m on August 9. Later, the family said that they have some contacts at the government hospital and offered to take him. They took him within 30-40 minutes,” he said. Dr Sunil Katyal, the acting chief medical superintendent of MMG Hospital, however, declined to offer any comments about the incident and said that he has submitted a report to the chief medical officer. “As per protocol, the hospital where the patient tested positive should immediately inform the office of the chief medical officer so that the patient can be referred to an appropriate Covid facility,” said an officer from the district health department, who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-covid-related-death-reported-after-19-days-as-37-year-old-dies-during-treatment/story-uwjZ6g2kCjP1Dwv9t8H6uL.html
11-08-2020||Delhi||Govt employee, aide held for supplying guns on fake licences||Delhi police arrested a 31-year-old junior statistical officer working with the ministry of labour and employment and one of his aides for supplying pistols manufactured in ordnance factories to criminals based in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi on fake arms licences. The weapons were sold through various gun shops to criminals without verification of arms licences and no record of buyers was maintained, senior officers said.The arrested government officer was identified as Insar Khan from Baghpat in UP, who was working as a junior statistical officer in the ministry of labour and employment in Delhi. Police identified Khan’s aide as Paras Chopra, 36, from Karnal, Haryana. He owns a gun shop in Karnal.Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Bhisham Singh said they received information on August 4 that a consignment of illegal arms was being supplied from UP to Delhi and would be delivered near India Gate. “Based on the information, a raid was conducted at a location on Tilak Marg and a suspect later identified Insar Khan was held and one 0.32 bore automatic pistol made in ordnance factory of Kolkata. A magazine and five live cartridges were recovered from Khan,” the DCP said. During interrogation, the police found he worked in the ministry. “Khan said he collected the pistol from Deepak, a criminal from Baghpat, UP. He said they buy automatic pistols from a gun house on a fake arms licence. A raid was conducted at the identified gun house from where 14 live cartridges and one magazine were recovered. Khan disclosed the name of his associate as Paras Chopra,” police said.The DCP said Khan joined the government job in 2012. “His first posting was at Pune from 2012 to 2015. He was transferred to Delhi in 2015. He was arrested in 2012 in a case of SSC paper cheating by Lucknow police,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-employee-aide-held-for-supplying-guns-on-fake-licences/story-7DkFCkFhlY5kZGVcRd9czJ.html
11-08-2020||Delhi||More Covid patients in Delhi hospitals after two-week lull||Hospitalisation from coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi have stayed above 3,000 since Thursday after registering a steady decline in the two preceding weeks, shows data from the daily health bulletins released by the Delhi government. Clinicians in Covid-19 wards and hospital administrators say the spike in the number is both because hospitals are choosing to admit at-risk patients at an early stage of infection to save lives, and an increase in the number of patients from other states getting tested and treated in Delhi. With over 1.3 lakh recoveries, 90% of those who were diagnosed with the infection have recovered, shows government data. “Over 90% of Corona patients in Delhi have now recovered. Only 7% cases are active now. Slowly and steadily, the people of Delhi are defeating Corona. #DelhiModel,” Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted on Monday. More than 3,000 people with Covid-19 have been hospitalised in Delhi over the past five days -- the number had stayed below 3,000 for 11 days with the exception of July 29, when 3028 people were in hospitals. On July 28, 2,775 people with Covid-19 needed hospitalisation, the data shows. On Monday, 3,115 Covid patients were in city hospitals. This accounted for 30% of the total active cases or those still living with the infection. The rest of the patients are either admitted to Covid Care Centres or are in home isolation. This proportion has been on the rise since the first week of July when on average 21% of the active cases needed hospitalisation. “We are admitting people early on and taking them into the intensive care units (ICUs) before they start developing complications like multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The referrals from other smaller centres or non-Covid hospitals are also happening in a timely manner. This has resulted in better outcomes for the Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, of the 2,000-bed Lok Nayak hospital, which is Delhi’s biggest Covid-19 centre. This could be one of the reasons for increase in the number of hospitalisations in the city, even as the number of active cases has remained around 10,000 for two weeks. Another reason for the increase in the number of admissions is the influx of patients from the neighbouring states. “We have started getting patients from Noida, Ghaziabad, Faridabad and other parts of the NCR over the last week or so. Earlier, inter-state travel was restricted and we used to receive almost no Covd-19 patients from these areas,” said Dr Kumar. This is a trend observed by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences as well. “Yes, there has been an increase in the number of admissions, but not too much – at the trauma centre the numbers have gone up to about 160 from the average of 120. I don’t think it is worrying but we need to keep our guards up. The numbers could be driven up by patients from neighbouring states being referred here or coming here over the last 10 days, which had almost stopped with restrictions on borders, difficulty in travelling, etc,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent, All India Institute of Medical sciences (AIIMS) Delhi. Earlier, the Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday had said that about 35% beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 in Delhi are occupied by patients from other states.The number of hospitalisations in Delhi had peaked at just over 6,200 in the last week of June. The government had worked to ramp up the bed capacity by converting some government hospitals to Covid-19 only, asking all big hospitals in the city to reserve 20% of their bed capacity for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, linking hotels to hospitals, and creating temporary field hospitals with the help of the armed forces. “The increase in the hospitalisation rate is a very positive sign. I think people are now coming forward. Earlier, they were scared of going to hospitals and preferred to remain home unless absolutely necessary. This also shows that the protocols have become well-established and receptive – patients are no longer being referred from hospital to hospital or to other places to get tests etc,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.“The other reason could be that patients from other states have started to come here for treatment. I have said it time and again that the travel restriction for patients from other states should be eased, especially now that so many beds are lying vacant in Delhi hospitals. We can help patients from UP and Haryana in a big way. The admissions are likely to go up as the number of cases is on the rise across the country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/more-covid-patients-in-delhi-hospitals-after-two-week-lull/story-uKJbOtV9bECyItCzegV2EK.html
11-08-2020||Mumbai||After Kozhikode crash, focus on pilots’ health||Senior and former Air India pilots said the airline must pay attention to the mental and physical health of pilots, especially since there have been pay cuts and greater stress since the outbreak of Covid-19. Senior airline officials said Air India Express had announced heavy pay cuts for its flying crew on August 5. An office circular dated August 5 cited adverse effects on airlines due to the pandemic and announced pay cuts for Air India Express’s flying crew (pilots and cabin crew). All pilots, along with the ground instructors, would have to take a 40% pay cut from their flying allowance, which pilots claim constitutes 70% of their salary. The circular also stated cabin crew would take a 20% pay cut. An Air India Express pilot alleged the pay cuts were unfair, “Unlike Air India, Air India Express has been posting profits for the past four consecutive years. Why has the management then imposed heavy pay cuts? Also, the management is taking a pay-cut of around 8% whereas we are burdened with maximum pay cuts,” said the pilot. Air India Express did not respond to calls or message from this reporter. Additionally, both Air India and Air India Express have done away with testing pilots for Covid-19 after flights, which has raised anxieties of getting infected, said pilots. An Air India spokesperson said, “We are adhering to all the laid down protocols required to protect the safety of our crew members. We are only streamlining the procedure. Our crew still have the option of getting the test done whenever they feel they have the symptoms on return.” A senior airline pilot said, “Initially, pilots would be tested for Covid two days before flying and after landing at the destination airport. However, it is nearly two weeks now that the airline has stopped conducting post-flight Covid tests for pilots which is a cause of worry for everyone.” An official from Air India said, “According to the new norms, a pilot can be tested after landing only if he is symptomatic. But there are many cases where a person with no symptoms tests positive for the virus. In that case, there are high chances that the pilot will infect his family, and children or parents are at higher risk of getting infected. Every pilot flying during this phase has this stress of carrying the virus home.” Captain Mohan Ranganathan, former Boeing 737 instructor and aviation safety aviation expert, said, “Stress is a big factor because you are not only worried for yourself but also about infecting family hence it will always be there in your mind. You will not (mentally) be 200% in the cockpit.” He said another worry among pilots would be losing their license in case they contract a severe case of Covid-19 and their medical record is affected as a result of this. Another Air India Express pilot said the pilots are suffering from fatigue. “The previous flight duty time limit (FDTL) for pilots did not allow consecutive night flying. However, the revised FDTL, introduced in 2019, allows pilots to be rostered for two consecutive nights in a week. Air India Express particularly has many flights scheduled at night, which take a toll on the body as a pilot is expected to report to duty two hours before departure time,” they said. A senior official from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said, “The [FTDL] matter is sub judice and so I would not like to comment.” All pilots spoke to HT requesting anonymity since they are not authorised to speak to the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-kozhikode-crash-focus-on-pilots-health/story-QvTnAtEuwlexseO5m5fqRM.html
11-08-2020||Delhi||Three dozen gangsters held while celebrating release of criminal on bail||Over three dozen members of the notorious Naveen Khati gang were caught while they were celebrating the release of one of their associates from jail on bail in west Delhi’s Dwarka in the early hours of Sunday, the police said.While five of them were arrested for carrying illegal weapons, the others were booked for violating social distancing norms.The police did not find the released prisoner, identified as Sunny alias Nandi, at the venue. They believe he was among three-four people who managed to scale the walls and escape.Anto Alphonse, the deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka), said that 23-year-old Deepak was released from jail on bail on Saturday for the treatment of piles. He is accused of a double murder, attacking police personnel and robbery. He is to return to jail on August 30.“To celebrate his release, members of the Naveen Khati gang held a cocktail party at a party lawn in Pochanpur village near Dwarka,” the DCP said.“Though they are members of the Naveen Khati gang, they were planning to start their own gang—Nandi Gang,” the DCP added.But the local police were tipped off about the gathering and surrounded the place. “When the gathering got to know of our arrival, they tried to scale the walls of the party lawn and escape. Three-four of them managed to escape while we nabbed 37 others,” the DCP said.The police apprehended four of them for carrying automatic pistols and one for carrying a short hand gun, apart from a dozen bullets, illegally.The men carrying the weapons were booked under the Arms Act and arrested. These five men have previously been involved in several criminal cases each, the DCP said.As for the others, the police are verifying their criminal antecedents and for now have booked them for violating social distancing.“We have also booked the owner of the party lawn for allowing the violation of social distancing norms under the Epidemic Diseases Act,” another investigator said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/three-dozen-gangsters-held-while-celebrating-release-of-criminal-on-bail/story-ZcLGCwPKB9FmuME1oorYWI.html
11-08-2020||Delhi||Head constable killed after drunk driver rams police van in north campus||A head constable was killed and another policeman injured when an allegedly drunk 19-year-old student drove his Honda City into an anti-street crimes police van, Prakhar, near Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Khalsa College in Delhi University’s North Campus in the early hours of Monday, the police said.The impact of the hit was such that the police van -- a Mahindra Scorpio -- was toppled and skid over 15 feet, leaving the head constable trapped inside.The errant driver, Tushar Gupta, who too was injured in the mishap, was caught from the spot, said Monika Bhardwaj, deputy commissioner of police (north). Gupta is pursuing Bachelors in Commerce degree from a university in Singapore and was visiting his parents in Delhi’s Model Town in March when the lockdown was announced, leaving him stranded in India, the DCP said.“He was heavily drunk, possibly way beyond the permissible limit. We are awaiting his blood sample report,” the DCP said.The accident took place at a time when the Delhi Traffic Police has been forced to suspend prosecution of drunk driving on Delhi’s roads amid fears that using alcometers to check if a driver is drunk or not may lead to infections to the traffic personnel.There has not been any prosecution or action against drunk drivers ever since, unless someone is involved in an accident and gets caught.Head constable Wazir Singh, 50, and his colleague constable Amit, 40, were patrolling the streets in the Prakhar van when the accident took place around 1.30 am.The DCP said Gupta was returning home from the house of a friend in Civil Lines where he had been drinking.“The Prakhar van was moving very slow when a Honda City rammed it at a very high speed at the junction of the Chhatra Marg and Ring Road,” said the DCP, adding that the sedan’s front was heavily damaged while the police vehicle toppled and skidded for several feet before coming to a halt.Constable Amit, who was behind the wheel of the van, was badly injured, but he managed to emerge from the vehicle. Head constable Singh, however, was trapped inside.“Despite his injury, Amit joined hands with some passersby to pull out Singh from the mangled remains of the vehicle. They were then rushed to Sushruta Trauma Centre where the head constable died during treatment,” said the DCP. Amit continues to remain hospitalised, but the police said that he is likely to survive.Singh’s son, Vinay, who is a constable with the Haryana Police, said his father had left their home in Sonepat on Sunday evening, hours before his death. “He would come home to us during the 24 hours of rest he got after 12 hours of duty on the roads. He left us on Sunday night saying he would return as soon as his duty ended,” said Vinay, one of two sons of Singh.He said his father had joined the Delhi Police 19 years ago and was deployed with the PCR unit just two months ago after a prolonged stint in the traffic police.“I’ll pursue the case to ensure justice for my father,” said Vinay.Gupta, meanwhile, was saved from severe injuries because of the safety airbags, which were deployed immediately after the collision, the DCP said.Gupta was restrained at the accident spot by the passersby and he was later booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, rash driving and causing hurt due to a negligent act, said the DCP.When HT reached out to Gupta’s family, they refused to comment on the incident.The traffic police, is “waiting and watching” the Covid-19 situation before resuming its action against drunk drivers, said Taj Hassan, special commissioner of police (traffic police).“The drunk driving checking involves a one-to-one interface while using the alcometers, which makes the process unsafe for the personnel carrying out the exercise. Apart from that, they have to escort many drunk drivers to hospitals, which too is risky,” said Hassan about the reason behind the suspension of the exercise.Last month, the traffic police also stepped out on the streets to begin issuing e-challans to other violators, but there has been no resumption in the prosecution of drunk drivers, said Hassan.The fatal accident comes just two weeks after a traffic assistant commissioner of police, Sanket Kaushik, was fatally run over by a tempo on the service lane near Rajokri Flyover.Till July 31 this year, 557 people have been killed in 543 fatal accidents in the national capital, data released by the traffic police on Monday showed.In the corresponding period last year, there were 929 accidents which left 945 people dead.In 2019, there were 1,433 fatal accidents in which 1,463 people died.According to the data, while private car users accounted for only 13 road accident deaths, these cars were responsible for killing 83 of 265 people in whose cases the cause for the death have been ascertained.As for drunk driving, there have been 26 accidents due to drunk driving till July end this year, as against 107 in the corresponding period last year.Four persons were killed during the two corresponding durations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/head-constable-killed-after-drunk-driver-rams-police-van-in-north-campus/story-iAtaKycbkrKBqaYvenS6jK.html
11-08-2020||Chandigarh||SET holds Haryana excise officials guilty of inaction in liquor seizure probes||Indicating inaction by Haryana excise and taxation officials in investigation of cases involving large seizures of illegal liquor, the special enquiry team (SET), constituted to inquire into the instances of liquor pilferage from warehouses, in its report said that despite having powers to investigate, the department did not do so. During an interactive session with SET, the excise and taxation commissioner (ETC), Shekhar Vidyarthi, on June 27 said that deputy excise and taxation commissioners (excise) posted in districts were vested with the powers of collector to investigate cases of seizure of illegal liquor and were fully responsible for investigation as per the requirement of the case. “In cases of big seizures, the details are also sent to the collector at the head office. Normally, the collector follows up the large detections though excise and taxation commissioner is also apprised. However, the ETC admitted no such investigation of illegal liquor confiscated in the field is being done by the excise department,” said the inquiry report submitted to home minister Anil Vij. Quoting an instance, the SET report said one such huge detection was reported by Sonepat DETC (excise) in February 2019 whose details were also sent to the ETC office. “Since no action was taken by the ETC office, the Sonepat DETC simply kept on issuing notices in that case and did not finalise the proceedings until May 2020 when that case came into limelight after the Kharkhauda-Matindoo godown fiasco wherein FIR was registered by police on May 5,” the report said. Excise department failed to recover big penalty amount The SET report has also blamed the excise and taxation department for its failure to ensure that penalties for excise offences were levied on time and recovered from the offenders. “As per provisions of Haryana Imposition and Recovery of Penalty Rules, 2003, the collector releases the offender on furnishing of sureties or securities to his satisfaction. Hence, it is indefensible as to why penalties have not been recovered in many cases,” the report said. The report mentioned that out of 8,337 cases of illegal liquor seizure between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020, 8,171 cases have been decided. Out of penalty of about ₹8.58 crore imposed, the department has recovered only ₹7.21 crore, leaving a balance of ₹1.37 crore, the report said. “The then collector, Yogesh Kumar, tried to defend this inaction by stating that penalty has been recovered in 97% of cases. However, he has cleverly not given the amount of penalty which is required to be recovered because remaining 3% cases amount to 16% of the total amount of penalty imposed,” the report said. As per the report, in cases involving huge penalty amounts like the one pertaining to Kharkhauda-Matindoo godown case, penalties have not been recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/set-holds-haryana-excise-officials-guilty-of-inaction-in-liquor-seizure-probes/story-UVa6bmo0gZVb89PifzsQYJ.html
11-08-2020||Delhi||In absence of scribes and assistive devices, many visually impaired students couldn’t take DU online exam on day 1||Many visually challenged students on Monday said they were unable to take the test on the first day of Delhi University’s (DU) online open-book exams (OBE) for final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students, due to unavailability of scribes and assistive devices. The university had earlier said visually impaired students appearing in the exams could seek its help in getting scribes at the common service centres (CSCs) -- facilities created under the ministry of electronics and information technology -- or their campuses. The university had asked colleges to provide support material to all visually challenged students. There are around 400 visually challenged final-year students in undergraduate and postgraduate courses. It was not yet known how many took the test as DU was still collecting data from colleges.But many students alleged they were not provided scribes, assistive devices and relevant study material by their colleges. Roshan Kumar, 19, a final-year BA (prog) student at Ramjas College, was among those who could not take the exam on Monday. “We cannot read printed books. We use two types of devices. One is a laptop or netbook with a screen reader software and another is DAISY (digital accessible information system) players. These players have recorded study material. We could not get anything since colleges are closed in view of the pandemic. It was impossible for me to prepare for exams without all this,” said Kumar, a first-generation learner from west Delhi’s Nawada. Manoj Khanna, principal of Ramjas College, said all visually impaired students got audio study material. “We had informed students that they can visit the campus and avail of the facility of scribes. A visually challenged student will come this week to write his exam with the help of a scribe provided by the college,” he said.Then there were students stuck in different parts of the country amid the Covid-19 pandemic, who could not get scribes. Deepak Gupta, 23, a visually impaired student studying MA in English, said he could not arrange for a scribe in his home town in Bihar. “I could not appear in the exam on Monday. It was not possible for me to travel to Delhi at this time. We do not have proper study material at home. We used to take help of our classmates in audio recording study material. Nothing such happened this time amid the pandemic,” he said.Ramjastan, a BA (prog) final-year student at a south campus college and a resident of Uttar Pradesh’s Sultanpur, also could not take the exam. “I did not have the prescribed study material in accessible form to study. The college asked me to visit the campus if I needed a scribe. When other students are not called to the campus amid the pandemic, why have students with disabilities have to go?” Preevi, 20, a final-year BA (English Hons) student at Miranda House, said she will not be able to appear Tuesday’s exam also. “I am stuck in my home town Varanasi due to the prevailing situation. The college had asked me to come to the campus if I want a scribe. It’s absolutely unsafe to travel at this time. I have no idea when I will get another opportunity to appear in the exams now,” she said.Bijayalaxmi Nanda, principal of Miranda House, said, “We have set up a support system at our college campus for students with disabilities. But it was not possible to provide scribes in different parts of the country amid the pandemic.”Despite several attempts, DU dean of exam, Vinay Gupta, did not respond to calls and texts sent for a comment. A member of the examination branch, who wished not to be named, said, “The online exam is optional and all students will get another chance to write the exam.”Senior advocate SK Rungta, who has filed a petition in the Delhi High Court on behalf of the National Federation of Blind (NFB), seeking effective mechanisms for visually impaired and specially abled students for the online exam, said, “The university and UGC should consider promoting of these students on the basis their internal exams. We will soon move Supreme Court, demanding the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-absence-of-scribes-and-assistive-devices-many-visually-impaired-students-couldn-t-take-du-online-exam-on-day-1/story-94eLtOdhD73sybLwuQo9UK.html
11-08-2020||Delhi||Hotels, gyms in Delhi, unlikely to open this week||Hotels, gyms and weekly markets in Delhi are unlikely to open this week, senior government officials said on Monday.“If the number of daily fresh Covid-19 cases continues to be like it was last week, it is highly possible that gyms, hotels and yoga centres will not be allowed for now,” said an official in the health department on condition of anonymity. The Delhi government declined to comment on the matter.Officials in the chief minister’s office said Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal is yet to return the file sent by revenue minister Kailash Gahlot on August 6, seeking approval to open hotels, gyms, weekly markets and yoga centres in the Capital. Delhi recorded 707 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, which is because of fewer tests (12,323) conducted on Sunday and its recovery rate crossed the 90% mark with 131,657 persons recovering of the total 146,134 cases recorded so far. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted that only around 7% of the total Covid cases in Delhi are now active. “Slowly and steadily, the people of Delhi are defeating Corona,” he said. Between August 1 and 7, Delhi witnessed an average of 1,028 fresh cases per day.Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday had said around 35% of beds in Covid hospitals in Delhi are currently occupied by patients from other states. “Till last month, we observed that total bed occupancy in Covid hospitals in the city in terms of absolute numbers was dropping by around 100 per day on an average. But, for at least the last 10 days, the number has been more or less constant. When we studied the trends, it emerged that around 35% of patients who have occupied beds currently are outsiders. In fact, on Saturday, 224 Delhi residents were admitted in Covid hospitals, compared to 97 patients from other states,” said Jain, who himself recovered from Covid and joined the office last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hotels-gyms-unlikely-to-open-this-week/story-khrB22uGbhrFaHbMxkeGrJ.html
11-08-2020||Delhi||Seven-day ‘Garbage-Free Delhi’ campaign to help clean up city||Delhi’s three municipal corporations — north, east and south — will launch a week-long intensive sanitation campaign “Garbage Free Delhi” from Tuesday, in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to make cities garbage-free. Under the campaign, the civic bodies will press into service 100 more garbage compactors to reduce the number of dhalaos (local garbage collection sites) across the city. Mayors of the three municipalities said that nearly 500 places have been identified where garbage is accumulated and eventually spills on to the roads. These places will be cleared on a priority. In the cleanliness campaign, the focus will also be on segregation of waste at source in market areas, which is negligible in the city. Addressing a joint press conference, Jai Prakash, mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said that in the special drive, teams of political executives and municipal officials will conduct inspections in different areas under their jurisdiction to check if sanitation work is being carried out properly and garbage is being lifted from the colonies and dhalaos. “We will also spread awareness among masses through pamphlets and stickers about the importance of waste segregation at source and also appeal the public not to litter on roads and throw garbage in drains. Additional dustbins will be installed in markets across Delhi with the help of market associations,” he said.Prakash further said that a meeting will be conducted with the market associations and they would be requested to start waste segregation at source and for this, they would be given separate dustbins for dry and wet waste. According to municipal estimates, Delhi produces over 10,817 metric tonnes of garbage daily. Most of this waste makes its way to the three landfill sites — Ghazipur, Bhalswa and Okhla. The municipal officials said that nearly 330 dhalaos have been eliminated across the city with the help of over 450 garbage compactor machines. With a workforce of over 72,000 sanitation employees, the three civic bodies are majorly responsible for maintaining cleanliness in the city.Anamika Mithilesh, mayor South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) said that the exercise would continue till August 18 and every councillor and civic officials will remain on the field to ensure proper execution of the plan. She said that nearly 100 more garbage compactor machines will be deployed in different areas in the three corporations to reduce the number of local garbage dumping points. Nirmal Jain, mayor East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), said that the main aim of the campaign is to make the city roads and drains free of garbage. “Nearly 500 points have been identified across the city where garbage is dumped and then later spills on roads. In the drive, we will ensure that no garbage remains at dhalaos and waste is not littered on roads and in drains. Nine compost plants of one-tonne capacity each have been installed in east corporation areas so that less waste reaches the landfill,”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/seven-day-garbage-free-delhi-campaign-to-help-clean-up-city/story-SoxyxvLmMGrKKWtExUqecO.html
11-08-2020||Delhi||SDMC to increase de-sealing fees for big businesses||Commercial establishments in south Delhi such as restaurants, coffee shops, banquet halls, health clubs sealed for violation of civic norms may have to shell out more money in order to get the government seal removed, officials of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) said.The officials said the SDMC proposes to increase the charge for de-sealing from Rs 15,000 to Rs 50,000 in case of big businesses such as restaurants (seating capacity of 20 or more), coffee shops, banquet halls, health clubs, spa, etc. For smaller businesses such as fruit juice vendors, paan shops and barbers shops (up to 5 chairs), the charge will remain Rs 15,000, they said.The proposal will be presented before the SDMC standing committee on Tuesday, and if approved, it will be presented before the SDMC House.If approved, the hiked charges will apply only to the shops sealed by the corporation. The shops that were sealed by the SC-monitoring committee are de-sealed only on court orders. Earlier, the SDMC had passed the proposal to levy a professional tax on self-employed persons — a first for Delhi — and doubled the tax on rented commercial property. The municipal body also announced hike in tax on transfer of property in new tax proposals aimed at ramping up revenue collection hit by the national lockdown to contain spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Rajdutt Gahlot, chairman, standing committee, SDMC said that the proposal is mainly to curb violations of building bye-laws, licence norms, operational and structural guidelines. “The proposal will be discussed at length and is subject to changes before it’s approved. We will bring in different slabs depending on the trade. For instance of the licence fee of a particular unit is just ₹6000 then the de-sealing charges cannot be hiked to 50,000. Similarly in case of bigger establishments such as cinema halls and bigger banquet halls or farmhouses where the licence fee starts from Rs 50,000, the de-sealing charges must be increased much more. We will introduce different categories just as it’s done while fixing circle rates,” he said. Leader of Opposition in the SDMC Prem Chauhan said that though they are in favour of revision of charges, it has to be done systematically and all bigger trades cannot be just charged Rs 50,000 for violations. “There are restauarants with 20 seats and those with over 50 seats, similarly there are banquet halls spread across much larger area that can house around 1000 guests and so the charges must be according to the floor area of an establishment and different slabs should be made for bringing in the policy.” For de-sealing of properties, owners have to comply with the rules under which the property was sealed. After this, an inspection is conducted by the municipal officials. If they find that the owners has complied, he pays the de-sealing charges for reopening the property.Ramesh Gupta, who runs a catering business in Lajpat Nagar, said hiking the charges will further hit businesses, which are already suffering on account of sealing and the loss of business due to the prolonged lockdown imposed in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. “A hike in any kind of charges at this point is not in the public interest. Traders have already been hit hard because of low sales,” said Gupta.Vijay Kheterpal, member, South Extension-1 market association, said that hiking charges at this point of time is not a good idea. “Eateries are the worst hit at this time and surviving only on takeaways. Anyways when a trader is adhering to the norms, only then a property is de-sealed then why make them pay extra charges,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sdmc-to-increase-de-sealing-fees-for-big-businesses/story-fDV22lScqBR47U6O5tGLVK.html
11-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi BJP will announce new team soon; women to get bigger roles||After the assembly election debacle early this year, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Delhi unit is now gearing up for the municipal polls in 2022. The party’s Delhi unit chief Adesh Gupta said that he will announce the new state team by the end of this month. Women party workers, Gupta said, will be given key positions, especially at the grassroot level—municipal wards (mandal) and districts.The rejig, party members say, has been long overdue. Former Delhi BJP president and North East Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari’s tenure—Tiwari was appointed the state chief in December 2016—was extended due to the assembly elections earlier this year and later due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“This time there was no election due to Covid-19. But we are in the process of finalising the team based on extensive discussions with party workers at all levels—from mandals to state and MPs. We will announce the new team by the end of this month. The team, which will lead the party into municipal elections, will be a mix of young and experienced people. This time, active women party workers will be given key roles such as mandal and district presidents,” Gupta said.The biggest challenge for the BJP, which was limited to single-digit seats in the recent assembly elections, is to regain the lost ground. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) won 62 seats while BJP got just eight seats in the elections held earlier this year.While the BJP has been out of power in the Delhi assembly, the saffron party has been ruling the three civic bodies for 13 years. Despite strong anti-incumbency sentiments in 2017, the party won 184 seats, 46 seats more than it had won in 2012, in the three municipal elections.Gupta said that the party will work hard to retain its hold over the corporations in the next elections. The party plans to start an aggressive campaign showcasing the work done by them in the last 13 years and also against the ruling AAP for stifling the corporations by not releasing funds on time.“The three corporations have done a lot of work in sanitation. We have successfully lowered the heights of landfill sites. We aim to flatten the garbage mounds in the next few years. The Centre has helped us a lot. But the Delhi government has only made things worse for us. They have not released funds on time. We will go to people and highlight these issues,” he said.With nearly one-and-a-half-years left for the corporation elections, BJP says that it has enough time to complete all the pending projects. Gupta said that once the new team is in place, the party will start the work for municipal elections.BJP attacks AAP on job portalMeanwhile, the BJP on Monday hit out at the Delhi government on its initiative for providing job-seekers with employment. The BJP alleged that the ruling party had started a similar initiative two years ago on which it spent ₹34.41 crore.“Two years ago, the party started an employment scheme which failed. The Kejriwal government had spent ₹34. 41 crore on the scheme, but only 334 people were employed,” Gupta said.Gupta said that the portal is yet another attempt to misguide people. “It is being claimed that the job portal has more than 9 lakh vacancies and has 8.64 lakh applicants. The government should tell us how many people have got jobs through the portal so far,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-bjp-will-announce-new-team-soon-women-to-get-bigger-roles/story-hUxImpEKgOT3ZsConPeACJ.html
11-08-2020||Delhi||Riots accused given bail three times due to lack of evidence||A Delhi court has granted bail to a man three times in three separate FIRs related to the arson of three floors of a building during the north-east Delhi riots in February. The order came after the police failed to put on record CCTV camera footage they claimed was evidence as part of the supplementary charge sheet despite repeated orders by the judge. The judge, on the third instance on July 28, while granting bail to Kasim Ali due to the absence of evidence in the form of the CCTV camera footage, also directed that the copy of the order be sent to the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) and Special Commissioner (Crime) for necessary action. Ali was arrested for rioting and the arson of various houses, including three floors of a building in the Jaffarabad area, on February 24 during the riots. On the basis of CCTV camera footage, Ali was first arrested when FIR-96/2020 was registered. The police said that during interrogation, he signed a disclosure statement regarding the crime following which three separate FIRs were registered (one for each floor) and he was arrested. (Three FIRS—64/2020, 121/2020 and 127/2020). In two FIRS—64/2020 and 127/2020—he was granted bail on July 22 due to the police’s failure to put the CCTV camera footage on record. “Since it is claimed that there exists CCTV camera footage, which is in the possession of the police but has not been inadvertently filed in the present case for the last several months despite allowing of previous bail application in which similar observation was made by the court with the same accused in relation to the third and fourth floors of the property…hence, let the copy of this order be sent to the concerned DCP and Special Commissioner (Crime) for their information and necessary action [sic],” the court stated in its order dated July 28. Appearing for Ali, his counsel contended that his client was falsely implicated in the case and the evidence was planted. Opposing the bail application earlier, the police had said that the allegations against Ali were serious. They said that he admitted his crime in one of the FIRs registered in the arson of an adjacent property (FIR –96/2020). The Special Public Prosecutor submitted earlier that under FIR-96/2020, there was evidence in the form of CCTV camera footage, which should be common for two of the properties Ali damaged. He, however, said that the footage had not been filed inadvertently and they will file a supplementary charge­ sheet later on. The court said that as on date, the footage was not on record and the charge sheet in the present case was filed on May 16. It said that in such circumstances, Ali was granted bail on a personal bond of ₹40,000 and a surety of like amount. According to a complaint by one Naved, that on February 24 around 4pm, he and his family left his house fearing for their safety. The next day around 11am, his neighbours informed him that rioters broke into his house, looted his possessions and set his house on fire. When he returned home, he found that the mob had looted cash of ₹1,50,000­, gold jewellery weighing 450 grams, 1½ kilogram of silver ornaments, his two Apple mobile phones and stridhan (his wife and his brother’s property) worth ₹15,00,000, and burnt the house down.Communal riots had broken in February this year in north-east Delhi, claiming 53 lives and leaving over 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/riots-accused-given-bail-three-times-due-to-lack-of-evidence/story-5UDkEyZZBssgdq7z6uvAjJ.html

11-08-2020||Delhi||South Delhi internal roads in bad shape||Several roads in various south Delhi colonies such as Defence Colony, Malviya Nagar, Saket, Green Park and Mehrauli have worn out due to lack of repair and maintenance causing water-logging, accidents and damage to vehicles, residents complained. Most of these roads are maintained by the municipal corporations. Local councillors said that due to the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus, lack of funds and labour roads could not be re-carpeted and potholes repaired ahead of the monsoon. Residents of Defence Colony D-block said getting vehicles inside during the rains is a nightmare and that there have been frequent accidents. Blocks A and C too have similar uneven roads, which have been patched up at some places. “The entire stretch gets immersed in water after rain. Pedestrians are always at risk. Many cyclists and those coming for home deliveries of food and grocery get hurt. A few months ago, a child broke his ankle on the road,” said Soni Singh, a resident of D-block. Major Ranjit Singh (retd), president, Defence Colony RWA, said after repeated letters and requests to senior officers of the civic body as well as political representatives relaying of the stretch has been sanctioned a few days ago. “We have written to the SDMC officials to involve the RWA when the project starts so that we ensure that there are no vehicles parked on the stretch and it’s fully covered. Also, there are other roads that are in bad condition and need to be repaired,” he said. Local municipal councillor Seema Malik agreed that several road stretches in her ward are in a bad condition. “The stretch in C-block has not been fixed for almost 11 years. Just four days ago, I have got ₹71 lakh sanctioned for improving and strengthening the road. There are many roads in poor condition in C-block and other areas. I am trying to get approval for repairs,” she said. Councillors in other areas said since the municipal corporations are facing massive funds crunch, several works have got delayed. They said the local area development funds for councillors has also been halved from last year.Rakhi Jain, a resident of K-block, Saket, said roads in the area have not been repaired for the past seven years. “Patches were repaired some time ago, but it didn’t last more than two to three months. The work was sanctioned and even started in some pockets before assembly elections, but then it got delayed again because of the lockdown,” said Jain, joint secretary of the K-block RWA. Kishanwati, the AAP councillor from Lado Sarai ward, which includes Saket, said the work of re-laying and repairing roads has been relaunched in many colonies, including Lodo Sarai, Katwaria Sarai and Ber Sarai. “Work has started in parts of Saket as well. It will be done in all blocks. The MLA has helped me with funds for works in my ward,” said Kishanwati. Residents in nearby Mehrauli are also struggling with poor roads for more than a year and a half. “The Delhi Jal Board had dug up around 20-25 kms of the road for laying water pipeline. Since then it has not been repaired. There have been accidents due to poor roads. Despite several requests, the authorities have done nothing,” said Sandeep Bali, president, Mehrauli RWA. While officials in the DJB said that the road cutting cost has already been paid to the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), civic officials said that they have received only half the funds. Mehrauli councillor Aarti Singh said, “I have been requesting the area MLA to help with the release of remaining funds, but there has been no response. Also, work has been held up because of lack of labour.” Mehrauli MLA Naresh Yadav said the cost for cutting roads for laying water and sewer pipelines were given to the civic body even before the elections. “Around ₹20 crores have been deposited with the corporation for the project. The roads are in bad condition and it falls under the civic body. They have failed to use the funds for doing basic road repair work,” said Yadav. SDMC spokesperson Radha Krishan said, “The work was delayed because of the lockdown and the ongoing restrictions. It is now being taken up on a priority basis in areas where improvement and strengthening of roads was due.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/south-delhi-internal-roads-in-bad-shape/story-XDddGqXPW2rIl1kXRFRPfJ.html

11-08-2020||Delhi||DDA to approve land use change of plot where V-P’s residence is proposed||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is in the process of notifying the land-use change for a 15-acre plot, which is part of Centre’s ambitious Central Vista Redevelopment project.The land-use of this plot, where the Vice President of India’s residence is proposed under the redevelopment plan, will be changed from transportation (bus terminal/parking) to residential. The land-owning agency held the public meeting in this regard on August 7, which is part of the process.Two residential plots, each spread over 15 acres, have been marked in the reworked Central Vista plan. While one on Dalhousie Road near South Block is likely to be the Prime Minister’s residence, the Vice President’s house is likely to be on the other side of Rajpath near North Block.The land-use of the plot, where the Vice President’s residence is proposed under the Centre’s redevelopment plan, was changed by the DDA in February this year. In March, the land-owning agency had invited public suggestions/objections. But the public hearing couldn’t be held due to Coronavirus pandemic.“We held the public hearing on August 7. A report regarding the public hearing will be tabled in the next authority meeting. Once approved, the proposal will be sent to the ministry of housing and urban affairs for notification,” said a senior DDA official, requesting anonymity.Another senior DDA official said that a large number of objections were raised regarding the overall project and not specific to the plot.In December last year, DDA had changed the land-use of this plot to “government office” based on a request made by the Land and Development Office (L&DO), which is under the Housing and Urban Affairs (HUA) ministry, along with six other land parcels spread over 86 acres. But the redevelopment plan was later reworked. Anuj Srivastava, spokesperson of LokPATH (people for Appropriate Transformation of Habitat), a collective of urban development experts and civil society members, said, “The very fact they have changed the plan twice in such a short span shows that it has not been properly planned. The previous changes should not be approved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dda-to-approve-land-use-change-of-plot-where-v-p-s-residence-is-proposed/story-FyhbH0ir7lmdaLTvK6V8EP.html

So the daily figures vary,” said, Anna Bodade, assistant municipal commissioner.“We are noticing an increase in positive cases only because we have increased the number of tests,” said Shravan Hardikar, PCMC commissioner.“The facilities of 30 ICU oxygen beds in Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital, 10 ICU oxygen beds in Bhosari hospital and 10 ICU beds in Jijamata hospital are ready and appointment of doctors is in the final stage. The work of Covid-19 facilities at Balnagri, Bhosari (425 beds) and Auto Cluster, Chinchwad (202 beds) will be completed by August 20,” he added.PCMC has also sped up the work of jumbo 800-bed Covid facility at Annasaheb Magar Stadium, Pimpri.Currently, PCMC has 12 Covid care centres, one Covid care hospital and two health centres, according to officials.Also, PCMC has decided to hand over 12 Covid-19 care centres to private firms for functioning due to staff crunch.“We are currently staff crunched. Once these 12 Covid care centres will be operated by private firms then we will be able to manage staff at new upcoming Covid care centres. Since positive virus cases are increasing we have to add more staff on duty,” said, Dr Pavan Salve, additional health and medical officer PCMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pcmc-covid-19-tally-nears-30k-mark/story-7bWYoFSaaD68j2FapcVPZN.html
11-08-2020||Pune||Covid-19 curve likely to flatten in Pune by August-end||The two jumbo facilities being set up in the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad may not be very useful for patients from the city as administration expects Pune’s cases are likely to stabilise by August 25. However, these facilities will be utilised to their fullest as Pimpri-Chinchwad is likely to witness a surge in the cases, followed by rural parts of the district, according to officials.The two jumbo facilities are being set up at College of Engineering, Pune and Annasaheb Magar Ground, Pimpri. The administration has set the target to make them operational by August 19.According to Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, various models including the one developed by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay suggest that by August 25, cases in the city will stabilise. From there on the next hotspot will be Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits, where the curve is likely to flatten by September-end and by October-end, the number of cases in Pune’s rural parts will stabilise.As on August 9, city’s progressive Covid-19 tally was 65,966 and the active cases at 15,812. In the case of PCMC, total progressive cases in the industrial town are 28,529, while in rural parts of the district, the total cases are 11,028.“Areas in PMC will see a sign of relief by August 25 and this has been indicated by various research institutions including IIT Bombay. This prediction is based on various algorithms and it looks like Covid-19 cases in PMC will peak by last week of August and thereafter cause of concern will be PCMC followed by rural areas, where the case fatality rate is higher,” said Rao.The higher case fatality rate is an indication of the prevalence of an unidentified number of positive cases, along with a relative lack of sufficient health infrastructure. In Pune rural, the average case fatality rate is 3.1 per cent while in Pune city, it is 2.3 per cent.According to Rao, PCMC behind by four to five weeks behind PMC in attaining a peak in Covid-19 cases and rural area again are behind by three to four weeks behind PCMC. “So when we consider district as a unit, it looks like jumbo facilities will be fully utilised. And once they are in use, it will offer respite to existing health infrastructure, which is under tremendous stress,” said Rao.“Within rural areas of Pune, the spread of virus is currently along the semi-urban areas and alongside the highways with administration expecting its spread in market areas in various villages,” said Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune zilla parishad.Prasad said, “Currently for every 100 cases, seven are from rural parts and the cases may go up in the coming days. However, we are taking every possible step to control its spread.”In the rural parts, Haveli and Khed have reported maximum cases so far, he added.An epidemiologist from the PCMC, however, said the number of cases in the industrial town will stabilize sooner than September-end, as predicted by others.Dr Pavan Salve, PCMC health and medical officer and epidemiologist, said, “The overall cases in Pune and PCMC are increasing currently. Till the end of August, the positive cases in PCMC will slow down. Although PCMC will be crossing the 30,000 active cases mark, it will come under control in the next 15 days and it will not turn into a new Covid-19 hotspot as predicted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-curve-likely-to-flatten-in-pmc-by-august-end/story-xIvCx5oI6Y0s90WVQDfx2K.html

However, with record 100 recoveries registered on Monday, the total crossed the 1,000 mark. While 1,004 people have been discharged so far, 25 have died due to the disease in the Union Territory.Among the fresh cases, there are two health workers from the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research and one from Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, while a judicial magistrate (first class) of the district court, Chandigarh, has also tested positive. A senior UT health official said at least six employees of a newspaper published from Chandigarh have also tested positive in Panchkula. While two of them are from Chandigarh and have been added to the UT’s tally, one is from Zirakpur, he said. The cases are spread across urban and rural pockets, and are mostly contacts of already hospitalised patients. Some also have travel history to Punjab, Delhi and Gurugram.Out of the total 80, 24 have been diagnosed through rapid antigen testing, stated a release.Panchkula crosses 1,000 markPanchkula district’s tally reached 1,001 on Monday, with 408 cases still active. Till July 31, there were 561 cases in the district. The remaining 440, which include 21 people deported from the US, have surfaced within just 10 days. As many as 590 patients have recovered so far while three have succumbed to the disease.On Monday, majority of the infections were reported from urban pockets.Sector 9 accounted for 12 cases while 10 people from Sector 10 tested positive too. Four cases each surfaced in Sectors 15 and 20 and three each in Sector 25 and Mansa Devi Complex’s Sector 5. The remaining were spread across the district, including Kalka and Pinjore.Meanwhile, even as the number of cases is shooting up in the district, police have decided to observe two-day “mask challan mukt divas”, wherein instead of issuing fines for not wearing masks, cops will distribute free masks to the violators and educate them about its importance.Two deaths in Dera BassiTwo more Covid-19 deaths in Dera Bassi took Mohali’s fatalities on Monday to 21, even as 76 new cases pushed up the count to 1,385. The deceased included a 38-year-old man from Mubarakpur and a 70-year-old from Preet Nagar. The former was admitted to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research at Chandigarh on July 22 and had brain surgery. The latter, who was suffering from diabetes and hypertension, was admitted to a private hospital in Panchkula on August 5. Dr Manjit Singh, civil surgeon, said the bodies were cremated as per protocol and supervised by health officials. Of the new cases, 40 were from the Dera Bassi sub-division, 23 from Mohali and 13 from Kharar. Also, 21 persons had recovered, bringing down the number of active patients to 649 in the district. Till date, 715 persons have recovered, while 21 have lost their lives in the last four months. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-tricity-sees-steepest-spike-with-218-covid-19-cases/story-hSuPsaw13rRe8UqjNa4gAJ.html
11-08-2020||Pune||Pune’s first sero survey results to be out by Aug 15||The findings of Pune’s first Covid-19 sero (serological) surveillance study will be out this week as Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) goes ahead with another survey led by BJ Medical College. The findings of the first sero survey, conducted by Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) along with Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), will be released by August 15, said IISER scientists involved in the activity. “We will come out with findings about presence of antibodies by mid-August. The findings won’t include factors like neutralising effect, which will take time,” said IISER professor Aurnab Ghose. As part of sero survey, IISER and SPPU collected random blood samples from 1,550 persons from slum and non-slum pockets from five wards. Purpose of the surveillance project and its utility for PMC is to make appropriate decisions in the coming months with project funded by Persistent Systems. The community-based sero survey helps identify presence of antibodies among vulnerable population. The presence of antibodies indicates that the person who contracted the infection has developed resistance to the virus. Both Mumbai and Delhi have already completed similar studies. In Mumbai, the sero survey revealed presence of antibodies in 57% of those surveyed in slums and 16% in non-slums. “It gives us a direction and is a reasonable indicator, but not necessarily a very strong pointer to suggest it means herd immunity,” said Ghose The second sero study in Pune will be carried out by BJ Medical College’s Microbiology department along with SPPU and IISER. What is sero survey? It includes collecting samples of people to identify whether they have developed antibodies What does presence of antibodies indicate? It indicates that the person who contracted the infection has developed resistance to the virus What is sample size in Pune?

11-08-2020||World||In 200 years, data generation to take up as much power as the world produces today: Study||In less than 200 years, we may need as much power as we are generating today into storing digital information, according to a new study published in AIP Advances on August 11The smallest unit of digital information, called bits, could match the number of atoms – 1050 – on earth by 2170, making it a digital world, quite literally, the study adds. Over the last few years, there have been many claims, some with similar warnings, and others that said the fears of a crisis being uncalled for.The study, by Dr Melvin Vopson, a senior lecturer at the School of Mathematics and Physics, University of Portsmouth, is a red flag.Considering the present requirements of storing data and extrapolating it with a growth rate of 50%, Dr Vopson said that the energy requirement will reach 18.5 terawatt (TW). This is the net energy being produced in the world today and powers everything from transport to households and industries. “It’s certainly interesting to attempt such a thought experiment but I believe it (the new study) is oversimplifying the matter,” said Dr Fabian Natterer, a professor at the department of physics of the University of Zurich who independently reviewed the study. He was part of the IBM team that, in 2017, managed to encode a bit onto an atom.Bits are binary codes -- appearing in 0s and 1s -- that is used to encode everything from the English alphabet to pictures in a form that machines can understand. Under existing technologies, almost 100,000 atoms are required to store one bit.Researchers have been trying to compress data onto the smallest area of material, giving us smaller devices with great capabilities. There have been attempts at even coding data into new materials, such as plastic and even, DNA. March of technologyDr. Natterer said that the new study did not touch upon the latest technology.“The latest developments in data recording, such as using the tunnel effect to write information to bits, would have drastically lower energy requirements per writing operation,” he said. “One could also note that it is conceivable to store more than one bit per atom, since atoms have more inner structure that could be exploited.”But such technologies are decades away, argued Dr Vopson.“It is not only the complexity around the writing and storing information in such a small volume, but developing sensitive enough read heads to retrieve back the information is another beast,” he said.Power requirements The complexity and sensitivity, in part, has to do with keeping noise -- disturbances to a signal -- out, which will require protecting bits from outside interference.In Dr Natterer’s work, for example, a rare atom had to be cooled to -233℃ for it to have the stability to hold a single bit. This, as anyone who owns an air conditioner would know, is expensive and energy consuming.“Practical systems cannot hold off noise completely and when we reach the quantum level, it is going to be highly fragile,” said Dr Shayan Srinivasa Garani of the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Indian Institute of Science. “Even to isolate an atom, you need to put an enormous amount of energy. So I’m sceptical about information bits being stored in every atom.”But data centers are advancing in terms of efficiency. A study in Science reported between 2010 and 2018, for example, while computing output had increased six-fold, the power increase was only six per cent. They concluded that though this trend is expected to continue for a few years, beyond that was anyone’s guess. “To store tons and tons of data, you’ll have to put up huge data centres where you’ll have to expend energy. That is a big concern,” said Dr. Garani.“According to IBM and other Big Data research sources, 90% of the world’s data today has been created in the last 10 years alone. I didn’t want to sound alarmist in the article, but the growth values used are rather conservative,” said Dr Vopson. “In some ways, the current Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated this process as more digital content is used and produced than ever before.” Dr Natterer, however, was more reserved in his assessment. “Since the scope of the (AIP Advances) author’s work extends to hundreds and thousands of years, it is conceivable that technology will catch up as well by then,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-200-years-data-generation-to-take-up-as-much-power-as-the-world-produces-today-study/story-cD53zIa6t9r4S4wzI731hL.html
11-08-2020||World||Pre-orders of Covid-19 vaccine top five billion||Although none of the coronavirus vaccines under development has proved its efficacy yet in clinical trials, at least 5.7 billion doses have been pre-ordered around the world.First shipments of a Covid-19 vaccine created by Western laboratories have often been snapped up by the United States.Five vaccines -- three Western and two Chinese -- are in Phase 3 efficacy trials involving thousands of people.In a surprise announcement, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed Tuesday that a vaccine dubbed “Sputnik V” -- after the Soviet satellite -- conferred “sustainable immunity” against the novel coronavirus. As research laboratories around the world race to develop a vaccine, manufacturers have received financing to help them prepare to have millions of doses ready to administer in 2021 or even before the end of the year.Oxford University, working with the Swedish-British pharmaceutical group AstraZeneca, hopes to have results by September while the US biotech company Moderna, partnering with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), is aiming for the end of the year, possibly November.- US: 700 million doses -President Donald Trump has launched “Operation Warp Speed” in a bid to develop, manufacture and distribute a Covid-19 vaccine to all Americans by January 2021.Hundreds of millions of dollars have been directed to vaccine developers including nearly $500 million to Johnson & Johnson at the end of March.The United States has allocated funding to more companies than other nation in the hope that one of them will come up with the vaccine to counter the highly contagious virus.So far, Washington has handed out at a total of least 9.4 billion dollars to seven vaccine developers and signed manufacturing contracts with five of them to provide 700 million doses.The companies involved are: Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Oxford/AztraZeneca, Novavax, Pfizer/BioNTech, Sanofi/GSK, Merck Sharp and Dohme. - Europe: 700 million dosesTwo vaccine developers -- Oxford/AztraZeneca and Sanofi/GSK -- have signed or are in advanced negotiations with the European Commission to provide a combined 700 million vaccine doses.- Britain, Japan, Brazil -Britain, because of Brexit, is negotiating a separate pre-order of 250 million doses from four developers.Japan is counting on 490 million doses from three suppliers including 250 million from Novavax of the United States.Japanese pharmaceutical giant Takeda bought the rights to a Novavax vaccine for Japan, which has funded the research. It would be produced locally.Brazil chose a similar model, ordering 100 million doses from AstraZeneca, and partnering with China’s Sinovac to produce 120 millions of “CoronaVac,” which is already undergoing testing with Brazilians.- China, Russia -Clinical tests of two Chinese vaccine candidates -- Sinovac and Sinopharm -- are well underway but only a few international partnerships have been announced, the one with Brazil and a possible one with Indonesia.Russia said 20 nations have pre-ordered one billion doses of Sputnik V and that with foreign partners it would be able to produce 500 million doses a year in five countries.- Developing countries -The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), launched in 2017 by Norway, India, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, seeks to ensure that there is “equitable access” to future vaccines.It has pre-ordered 300 million doses from AstraZeneca for dozens of developing countries in a partnership with The Vaccine Alliance (Gavi).Billions of doses would be produced for Asia and elsewhere by the giant Serum Institute of India (SII), the largest vaccine producer in the world.Novavax and AstraZeneca have separately signed agreements with SII to produce a billion doses each for India and low- and middle-income countries on the condition, of course, that they prove their efficacy in clinical trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pre-orders-of-covid-19-vaccine-top-five-billion/story-4JOtt9KymlPfkQeFonDFXL.html

The Yantai city government said in a statement the seafood was from an imported shipment that landed at Dalian but did not say where it originated.In July, customs officers in Dalian, a major port in the northeastern province of Liaoning, found the coronavirus in the packaging of frozen shrimps imported from Ecuador, and China then suspended imports from three Ecuadorean shrimp producers.The novel coronavirus is believed to have emerged in a market that sold seafood and wildlife in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.It has since spread around the world, with some new cases brought back into China from returning travellers.Some of the seafood that the three Yantai companies bought had been processed for export, while the rest had been kept in cold storage and has not entered the market, the Yantai government said.When asked if any of the processed seafood had been exported, a member of staff at a coronavirus outbreak response unit in Yantai declined to elaborate, referring Reuters to the Yantai city government statement.Authorities had sealed off the goods, the city government said. Everyone who handled the goods was under quarantine and have tested negative for the coronavirus, it said.The latest outbreak of coronavirus in Dalian city started in late July, with the first case working at a seafood processing company. By Aug. 9, Dalian has reported a total of 92 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-found-on-frozen-seafood-in-china/story-Lh77GCmu8Xl3IrML2hyj9K.html

11-08-2020||World||Watchdog report: Mike Pompeo acted properly in Saudi arms sale||The State Department’s internal watchdog has found that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not act improperly last year when he approved billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia without the consent of Congress.The State Department Office of Inspector General concluded in a report released Tuesday that Pompeo had the legal authority to declare an emergency and bypass Congress under the Arms Export Control Act.Republicans joined with Democrats in Congress to oppose the sales, but President Donald Trump, who has made close relations to Saudi Arabia a priority, vetoed resolutions in July 2019 to block the transfers and there were not enough votes to override him.The inspector general report itself has become the focus of congressional scrutiny after former Inspector General Steve Linick, who was removed from his post in May by Trump, testified to Congress that senior State Department officials had sought to block his inquiry.Senior State Department officials have said Linick was removed from his watchdog position for leaking another report and not because of his probe of the arms sales, which came amid bipartisan congressional concerns about civilian casualties in the Saudi-led war in Yemen.At least one prominent congressional critic, New York Rep. Eliot Engel, cautioned before the report’s release that it should be treated with skepticism. He noted that it features a classified annex that the public can’t read and that the State Department official in charge of arms sales review has declined to answer questions from a committee investigating Linick’s ouster.Engel, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, dismissed the emergency certification used to authorize the sales as “phony.”The report examined the process that Pompeo used to make the emergency certification. Pompeo cited the threat posed by Iran and its support for rebels in Yemen to justify approving arms sales totaling $8.1 billion to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.The report concluded that the law grants the secretary the discretion to decide what constitutes an emergency, something three previous administrations have done with respect to arms sales to Saudi Arabia.It also noted that the State Department did not “fully assess” the risks of civilian casualties from the sale of certain types of weapons, and that it “regularly” approved arms transfers to Saudi Arabia and the UAE that fell below the reporting threshold to Congress.A senior State Department official, speaking to reporters Monday on condition of anonymity to preview the report, said there was disagreement on the threshold for reporting to Congress and that there was already an effort underway to try to reduce the potential for civilian casualties with American weapons provided to allies.The official said the “big takeaway” from the report is that Pompeo and the department acted “in accordance with the law” as it sought to aid the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. The report notes that the grinding, five-year-old civil war in Yemen has led to what the United Nations has called the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/watchdog-report-mike-pompeo-acted-properly-in-saudi-arms-sale/story-2Cm9RYzn3QmWrK2rgGrxyH.html
11-08-2020||World||Canadian finance minister’s job appears unsure, markets fret over distraction||Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s job appeared uncertain on Tuesday after reports he had clashed with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, prompting analysts to fret about Ottawa becoming distracted as it tackles the coronavirus crisis.The Globe and Mail cited unnamed sources as saying Trudeau was uncertain whether Morneau was the right person to handle the recovery. Morneau was unhappy at how much money Trudeau wanted to spend to deal with the outbreak, it added.Morneau, 57, has been finance minister since the ruling Liberals took power in late 2015.“To have turnover in such a key role in the middle of an economic crisis ... could rattle investor confidence in Canada and in turn weigh on the Canadian dollar,” said Adam Button, chief currency analyst at ForexLive.The report was the first public sign of tension inside government over how to handle the pandemic. Canada has provided more than C$212 billion ($159.7 billion) in direct Covid-19 support and nearly 14% of gross domestic product in total support.Also read: Canada’s GDP fell by nearly 12% in April due to Covid-19 lockdownCanada’s budget deficit this fiscal year is expected to hit C$343.2 billion, the largest shortfall since World War Two.Trudeau’s office, asked whether he still had faith in Morneau, said it would respond later. Morneau’s office did not reply to a request for comment.Morneau is also under pressure over his failure to promptly repay travel expenses covered for him by a charity at the heart of an ethics investigation. Although Morneau apologized, opposition legislators say he must resign.“The bus has been rolling toward Mr. Morneau for weeks. Market participants understand that he has become a major political liability,” said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments.But he added: “Rocking the canoe might increase downside risk for the loonie (the Canadian dollar) and for markets more generally. And a distracted government is the last thing the economy needs,” he said.Potential replacements include Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne and Mark Carney, a former head of both the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, the paper said.Trudeau is also being probed over possible ethics violation after the charity - which has ties to his family - was chosen to manage a major student grant program. He apologized but denied the charity has received any preferential treatment over the deal, which has been scrapped.($1=1.3279 Canadian dollars)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-finance-minister-s-job-appears-unsure-markets-fret-over-distraction/story-sjYIGOkjQaYnK0d20c0uKI.html

11-08-2020||World||Lebanon marks one week since deadly Beirut explosion||A nation still burying its dead on Tuesday marked a week since the explosion in Beirut that flattened much of the Lebanese capital’s port, damaged buildings and left thousands of people dead and injured.Several events, including a moment of silence at 6:08 p.m. local time when the blast happened, were planned to commemorate the explosion. It was caused by the ignition of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been sitting at Beirut port for more than six years. A candlelight vigil was also planned.The explosion has fuelled popular outrage against the country’s top political leaders and security agencies, and led to the resignation of the government on Monday. In the wake of the disaster, documents have come to light that show that top Lebanese officials knew about the existence of the stockpile in the heart of Beirut near residential areas, and did nothing about it.It still wasn’t clear what caused the fire in a port warehouse that triggered the explosion of the chemicals, which created a shockwave so powerful it was felt as far away as the island of Cyprus more than 200 kilometers across the Mediterranean. “From one minute to the next, the world changed for people in Beirut,” said Basma Tabaja, deputy head of the International Committee of the Red Cross’s delegation in Lebanon on Tuesday. The explosion, which obliterated the capital’s port, damaged thousands of apartments and offices in the capital and came on top of an unprecedented economic and financial crisis the country the country has been mired in since late last year, compounding the nation’s collective distress. Meanwhile, behind the scenes contacts got underway Tuesday for the formation of a new government, a day after Prime Minister Hassan Diab resigned. Diab’s government, which was supported by the militant group Hezbollah and its allies, unraveled after the deadly blast, with three ministers announcing they were quitting. Diab’s government was formed after his predecessor, Saad Hariri, stepped down in October in response to anti-government demonstrations over endemic corruption. It took months of bickering among the leadership factions before they settled on Diab.Lebanese have demanded an independent Cabinet not backed by any of the political political parties they blame for the mess they are in. Many are also calling for an independent investigation into the port explosion, saying they had zero trust in a local probe. Lebanese officials have rejected an international investigation. The government, in the last decision it made before resigning Monday, referred the case to the Supreme Judicial Council, Lebanon’s top judicial body, which handles crimes infringing on Lebanon’s national security as well as political and state security crimes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanon-marks-one-week-since-deadly-beirut-explosion/story-O8T4BQ2sdV3mvZeeMu9IBP.html

The point is to have a vaccine that is safe and effective for the American people and the people of the world.” He says it’s important to have transparent data on the vaccine to prove its safety and efficacy. He also noted that the US has six vaccines in development under the Operation Warp Speed initiative.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe US has the highest death and case count in the world, with more than 163,000 deaths and over 5 million cases.Meanwhile, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway expressed skepticism about the testing backing up Russia’s claim that it has developed a Covid-19 vaccine.“The US standards are so much more stringent,” Conway said Tuesday on Fox “Fox & Friends.” “Our FDA in our country sets the standards and what I understand from the Russia announcement is this is nowhere near where we are.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-skeptical-of-russia-s-coronavirus-vaccine-safety/story-uEMszyYUSAEDlIZ9aTYgkJ.html
11-08-2020||World||Oxford launches literary book club to help deal with Covid-19||As lockdowns and restrictions in various countries encourage many to dust-off old books and revel in the delights of literature, the University of Oxford on Tuesday launched a book club that will weekly release a selected book extract that could be read in 10 minutes. Called the ‘Ten-Minute Book Club’, the initiative by academics from the English faculty will see extracts from prominent books released every week until October, starting this week. The first selection is from W.E.B.Du Bois’ 1903 book, ‘The Souls of Black Folk’.The extracts, they said, will include books by Indian writers, among others, and from a wide selection of genres, such as novels, essays, poetry and short stories. Each will be accompanied by a short introduction (in text, video or audio format) by an academic suggesting themes or contexts and suggestions for further reading - with a free link to the full text.Academic Alexandra Paddock said: “We noticed during lockdown that so many people turned to literature for escape, connection and excitement but, at the same time, the pressures of lockdown were making long, intense stretches of reading harder”“That is why we set up Ten-Minute Book Club - although we strongly believe its content will be relevant and useful long after the current restrictions have been removed”.The list of authors includes nineteenth century Bengali poet and translator Toru Dutt, Mary Prince, Geoffrey Chaucer and Patience Agbabi, Olaudah Equiano, Katherine Mansfield, Elizabeth Keckley, James Joyce, Mary Shelley and Charlotte Brontë. The readings are intended to be enjoyed alone or to spark discussion with family, friends, colleagues or anyone else. The selection is a mixture of classic well-known literature and outstanding works which deserve more prominence, mostly from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Paddock said: “All the works are originally written in English, by authors from all over the world, including New Zealand, Ireland, the Caribbean, India, United States and Britain”.Karen O’Brien, project founder, added: “We believe literature is more important than ever, as we live through the current pandemic and come to terms with its challenges and meaning for all of our lives”.“Ten-Minute Book Club aims to make a great conversation about literature possible, and to offer a quick and accessible way into some of the greatest writing by extraordinary writers from all backgrounds, guided by Oxford’s expertise on exciting authors and books.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-launches-literary-book-club-to-help-deal-with-covid-19/story-u4BOsfm8kD7NV259otAgdK.html
11-08-2020||World||German authorities conduct raids in money laundering probe||German authorities raided an import-export company and the home of a businessman in the state of Brandenburg on Tuesday on suspicion he was involved in a scheme to launder millions of euros (dollars) for Russian criminals, prosecutors said.The suspect is accused of receiving some 7 million euros ($8.3 million) in illegally obtained money, laundering it in Germany and then transferring it to offshore accounts for “individuals from Russia,” the Frankfurt prosecutors office said.The suspect, whose name wasn’t released, is alleged to have been part of the so-called “Troika Laundromat” - a money laundering network linked to the former Russian investment bank Troika Dialog, which is said to have maintained a network of offshore companies with accounts in Baltic banks, prosecutors said in a press release.Federal German police have been investigating the network since the beginning of 2019, prosecutors said.Authorities gave no further details on the investigation or the suspect, and prosecutors’ spokeswoman Nadja Niesen said she could not comment beyond the release.German authorities have been cracking down on Russian money laundering schemes, and last year seized properties worth more than 40 million euros ($47 million) they alleged were purchased through another network, known as the Russian Laundromat.That scheme, they said at the time, involved moving some $22 billion from Russia into Europe through banks in Moldova and Latvia using fictitious companies.Much of what is publicly known of the laundromat operations comes from the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, whose journalists were also involved in the Panama Papers revelations, reporting how documents from a Panamanian law firm showed hundreds of rich and powerful people registered companies in tax havens.The OCCRP, citing documents obtained by it and the Lithuanian news site 15min.lt, has reported that the main purpose of the Troika Laundromat was to channel billions of dollars out of Russia, allowing Russian oligarchs and politicians to secretly acquire shares in state-owned companies, buy property in Russia and abroad and more.The Troika was made up of at least 75 companies in a complex financial web, which functioned from 2006 to early 2013, the OCCRP reported last year.The Kremlin has dismissed the OCCRP reports as being untrue or distorted, and “nothing particularly novel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-authorities-conduct-raids-in-money-laundering-probe/story-wnp4wRkJaUAZh4ygtyzanI.html

Russia and China are active and seeking greater roles throughout the continent in the energy, infrastructure and telecommunications sectors, a trend the United States is keen to reverse.Pompeo on Tuesday was opening his visit in the Czech city of Pilsen, where he was to visit the Patton Museum and memorial to the World War II liberation of western Czechoslovakia by U.S. troops.In his talks, Pompeo will likely face questions about the Trump administration’s decision to reduce the U.S. military presence in Germany. President Donald Trump wants to withdraw thousands of American troops from bases in Germany and redeploy some of them eastward, including to neighboring Poland, the last stop on Pompeo’s week-long trip.Two of Pompeo’s other three destinations — the Czech Republic and Austria — also share a border with Germany, while Slovakia borders Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland. Germany is pointedly not on Pompeo’s itinerary.In Prague on Wednesday, Pompeo will meet Czech President Milos Zeman and Prime Minister Andrej Babis to discuss nuclear energy cooperation and “efforts to counter malign actions of Russia and communist China,” the State Department said.Energy and the tenuous political situation in the Balkans will top Pompeo’s agenda with Slovenian officials in Ljubljana, where he is expected to deliver a statement with the foreign minister about the security of 5G networks, the department said.In Vienna, Pompeo will meet Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz to review trade relations and regional security. Pompeo will also hold talks with the head of the Vienna-based U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is charged with monitoring Iran’s adherence to the 2015 nuclear deal from which the U.S. has withdrawn.The Trump administration is trying to convince other members of the U.N. Security Council to indefinitely extend an arms embargo on Iran that is due to expire in October, under terms of the nuclear deal.In Warsaw, Poland, Pompeo plans talks with President Andrzej Duda, who recently won a narrow reelection after a bitter campaign that concerned human rights advocates and others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-opens-anti-china-anti-russia-tour-in-czech-republic/story-ArhtAztBNHDENIjMutc8cP.html

TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, is already under investigation over privacy concerns by U.S., European Union and Dutch authorities. “A complaint about TikTok was received in May. This complaint is now under investigation,” a CNIL spokesman said, confirming a Bloomberg report. He declined to elaborate on the nature of the complaint or the identity of the plaintiff.Asked for comment, TikTok said: “Protecting TikTok users’ privacy and safety is our top priority. We are aware of the investigation by the CNIL and are fully cooperating with them.”In the United States, officials have said that TikTok poses a national security risk because of the personal data it handles. President Donald Trump has threatened to ban TikTok and has given ByteDance 45 days to negotiate a sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to Microsoft.In June, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) said it would set up a task force to assess TikTok’s activities across the bloc after a request from an EU lawmaker concerned about its data collection and security and privacy risks.In May, the Dutch privacy watchdog said it would investigate how TikTok handles the data of millions of young users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-privacy-watchdog-opens-preliminary-investigation-into-tiktok/story-uAe06CaGXEiJHtlXAIMvLK.html

The Americans have refused to extradite her to stand trial for dangerous driving in the death of 19-year-old motorcycle rider Harry Dunn.Sacoolas’ husband was an intelligence officer at RAF Croughton, a military base in central England used by U.S. forces. The crash occurred near the base.Dunn’s family has urged her to return and face British justice, and met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington as part of their campaign.Britain’s Press Association reported that lawmaker Andrea Leadsom wrote to Home Secretary Priti Patel on Monday to put forward the idea of a virtual trial or a trial in absentia as a “way to achieve closure... without undermining the U.S. decision not to accept the extradition request.”“She could remain on U.S. soil, have a virtual trial with a U.K. court, and should there be a custodial sentence, she could serve it in the U.S. under the existing prisoner transfer agreement,” Leadsom wrote.Leadsom also wrote to the solicitor general, the foreign secretary and the Crown Prosecution Service.The family’s spokesman Radd Seiger said the family “would not object” if a decision were taken to conduct a remote trial.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected the extradition request in January. He described it at the time as “final.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-lawmaker-asks-for-virtual-trial-in-diplomat-s-wife-crash/story-oDXJxvZLqtrh1idEvO2kKO.html
11-08-2020||World||Covid-19: For many Britons, Monday-to-Wednesday is the new weekend||It is a weekend atmosphere in thousands of pubs and restaurants across the UK from Monday to Wednesday, thanks to chancellor Rishi Sunak’s novel scheme that pays 50 per cent of restaurant bills up to a maximum of £10 per person, on food and non-alcoholic drinks.The scheme, intended to encourage people to eat out and help the struggling restaurant industry hit by the coronavirus pandemic, began on August 3 and runs until the end of the month. The Boris Johnson government has set aside £500 million for the scheme.In its first week, it has been used 10.5 million times, worth £50 million to the exchequer. Over 83,000 outlets have signed up offer the scheme, including pubs, restaurants, cafes, dining rooms within members’ clubs, and workplace and school canteens.Participating restaurants include many Indian restaurants. While many outlets have reported ‘berserk business’ during the three days, particularly chains such as Wetherspoons and Wagamama, Indian restaurants in areas such as Southall saw a marginal spike.Among those struggling are upmarket Indian restaurants in central London, where rents and other fixed costs are high. Indian Accent, which has branches in New Delhi and New York, and opened in Mayfair in 2017, closed due to the pandemic’s adverse effects.Says celebrity chef Cyrus Todiwala, who has restaurants in central London: “For us, due to our location the scheme has not been great. Our problem is the hesitation of people to avoid public transport, besides the congestion charge to drive into central London”.“Many London restaurants have complained to the mayor but it is of no use. So if you were to spend £30 to come to us for dinner, why would you? But many love us and take the extra trouble and costs to dine with us”, he adds.For Manoj Vasaikar of India Zing, Sunak’s scheme has driven business from Monday to Wednesday, but his restaurants have seen a sharp downturn during the weekend.He says: “We have seen a spike in business from Monday to Wednesday, but we suffer badly on Friday, Saturday. It is the same experience overall in most of the industry, but then the customer benefits, so it is fine”.Sunak described the scheme’s first-week figures as “amazing”, after official figures showed that 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and that 1.4 million workers were furloughed - the highest proportion in any sector.“Britons are eating out to help out in big numbers. And they aren’t just getting a great deal - they’re supporting the almost 2 million people employed in this sector,” Sunak said.Before Sunak rolled out the scheme, Jim Harra, chief executive of revenue and customs, questioned its value for money, writing to him: “By nature, this is a novel scheme meaning there are also particular value for money risks surrounding the level of potential losses that could arise”.The Guardian called the scheme ‘junk policy’ in an editorial: “As policy…it is glib, gimmicky and, even Mr Sunak admits, a waste of millions of pounds. Junk, then, served up by a politician who should know much better”.“(His) error is in treating the slump in trade as driven by cost, rather than caution. Discounts and VAT cuts…will not lure out those diners who are worried that they may pick up a lethal virus, or that they may be about to lose their job”.“Others will take up the government’s offer by enjoying a slap-up meal at a discount on a Wednesday night rather than at full price on a Friday, thus defeating the entire purpose of the policy”, the editorial added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-for-many-in-uk-monday-to-wednesday-is-the-new-weekend/story-OeIuDUKvk9LUGl9UzNWBJO.html

Kirill Dmitriev, head of the country’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, said Russia had already received requests from more than 20 countries for 1 billion doses of its newly-registered Covid-19 vaccine.He was speaking after President Vladimir Putin announced the approval after less than two months of human testing.The speed at which Russia is moving to roll out the vaccine has prompted some international scientists to question whether Moscow is putting national prestige before solid science and safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-dubs-new-coronavirus-vaccine-sputnik-after-soviet-satellite/story-KSKhuYQzunfxOfOXZKOd4H.html
11-08-2020||World||Hong Kong residents defend free press as China cracks down||Last year, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Hong Kong to demand full democracy, many egged on by a tabloid newspaper critical of China’s ruling Communist Party.On Tuesday, they lined up at newsstands across the city to buy that same paper, handing over 10 Hong Kong dollars ($1.25) a copy in a bid to help the Apple Daily — and press freedom — survive.The public show of support came a day after police rounded up 10 people, including the paper’s founder, and raided its headquarters. The move reinforced fears that a new national security law would be used to suppress dissent in Hong Kong after months of anti-government protests shook the city’s leadership and the central government in Beijing last year.Police have expanded their use of the law since it took effect six weeks ago, first arresting protesters with slogans deemed to be in violation and then activists over online posts. Media tycoon Jimmy Lai, the Apple Daily founder, and his Next Digital media group were the largest targets to date.That people protested by buying a newspaper rather than by taking to the streets shows how much the climate has changed since the stormy protests last year. People also bought Next Digital stock to show support, driving its price up more than 300% on Tuesday,The Apple Daily, known for its celebrity coverage as well as its condemnation of China’s authoritarian rule, remained defiant, printing 350,000 copies — five times its usual print run — after police investigators left Next Digital and told employees they could go back to work.Lines formed at newsstands Tuesday in a public show of support, and Apple Daily said it would print an additional 200,000 copies. “Apple Daily will fight on,” the newspaper said on its front page.“I do not like the way Apple Daily reports news but I think it symbolizes press freedom in Hong Kong,” Tiffany Chan said after buying a copy at a convenience store. “I cannot just sit and watch the government destroy press freedom. This is the least I can do.”One newsstand operator said he had sold 200 of his allotment of about 300 papers by late morning. On a typical day, he sells about 100 copies, he said.Hong Kong, and to a lesser degree Taiwan, have become battlegrounds for the competing world views of China and the United States. The U.S. imposed sanctions on 11 Hong Kong and Chinese officials last week, including city leader Carrie Lam, over the security law. China responded Monday by sanctioning 11 Americans, including six members of Congress.The Trump administration, which is feuding with China on multiple fronts, sent Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to Taiwan this week for the highest-level visit by a U.S. official since the United States broke off diplomatic relations to recognize Beijing as the government of China in 1979.Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu, meeting Azar on Tuesday, said the self-governing island is fortunate to have U.S. support at a time when “our life has become increasingly difficult as China continues to pressure Taiwan into accepting its political conditions, conditions that will turn Taiwan into the next Hong Kong.”The fate of Hong Kong’s 7.5 million residents ultimately lies in the hands of the Communist Party leadership in Beijing.“You can’t really worry about it, it is what it is,” said Anna Yuen, a retiree who said her family could leave if the situation really deteriorates. “But I can’t bear to leave Hong Kong. I think Hong Kong people are really admirable, especially the youth.”The fear in Hong Kong, which has its own laws and courts and greater freedoms than mainland China, is that the Communist Party wants to mold the territory over time into a city similar to those on the mainland.Press freedom is just one characteristic that separates Hong Kong from the rest of China.“If they crack down on Apple Daily today, they will go down the list of media that do not support the Communist Party or the Hong Kong government, and what will be left is just news that sings the praises of the Communist Party,” Chan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-residents-defend-free-press-as-china-cracks-down/story-GciU1HDAtf7Xe2pIdjo5YN.html

Once the vaccine clears the trials successfully, state-owned PT Bio Farma may begin production from January, President Joko Widodo said.Indonesia is betting on the success of the phase 3-trial, the final stage in the vaccine development, to fully stamp out the pandemic that’s shown little signs of easing. The country has signed up with Sinovac to secure access to a vaccine as its own efforts to develop a deterrent against the pathogen is expected to take longer.Indonesia is cooperating with multiple partners as the world’s fourth-most populous nation wants to vaccinate all its people, Jokowi, as the president is commonly known, said. A home-grown vaccine, named “red and white vaccine” after the Indonesian flag and based on the strain of coronavirus prevalent in the archipelago, is expected to be ready by middle of 2021, he said.PT Kalbe Farma, Indonesia’s largest pharmaceutical company by market value, has entered into an agreement with South Korea’s Genexine Inc. to organize clinical trials for its GX-19 vaccine. Separately, Bio Farma along with the Ministry of Research and Technology and the Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology has formed a consortium for vaccine development targeted for commercial production in early 2022.Bio Farma will ramp up its manufacturing capacity to 250 million doses by the end of the year from about 100 million now, the company said last week.The Southeast Asia’s biggest economy is still grappling with a surge in infections following the easing of partial lockdown rules since the end of May that allowed business activities to resume gradually. The number of new cases rose by 1,693 in the past 24 hours through Tuesday noon, taking the total to 128,776, official data showed. Fifty-nine more people succumbed to the disease, bringing the total to 5,824, the health ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-kicks-off-third-phase-of-sinovac-s-covid-19-vaccine-testing/story-Y5a5qoNXsyYkduSxSrYC5J.html

This will remain in place for three days, and the rest of the country will go to level 2 restrictions that include social distancing and limits on the size of gatherings.The news comes after New Zealand recorded 102 days of no community transmission of Covid-19, managing to detect cases at the border with returned travelers going into mandatory quarantine.

11-08-2020||World||Hong Kong sees fewest coronavirus cases since start of latest outbreak||Hong Kong’s worst coronavirus outbreak is showing signs of coming under control as the city reported the lowest number of new local infections since its resurgence began over a month ago.The Asian financial hub reported 32 new local cases on Tuesday, a marked drop from the high double-digit tallies of the past week. New infections have sustained a decline since the peak of 145 local cases on July 30 and have stayed below a hundred daily since Aug. 3.The drop is a reprieve for Hong Kong after a sudden flareup strained its health-care infrastructure and testing capacity, and confined its residents largely to their homes -- the smallest apartments in the world. While the city’s total outbreak of around 4,000 is still modest compared to many countries, the resurgence arrived after months of near-zero community transmission and has affected older patients than before, causing the death toll to spike.Almost 90% of Covid-19 deaths in Hong Kong happened in the past month as the outbreak entered nursing and elderly care homes -- 48 deaths as of Monday, seven times the toll of the entire first half of the year.The fall in case numbers reflects that tightened social distancing rules, which now ban public gatherings of more of two people and mandate masks in all public places, are working to slow the virus’s spread. The current measures, which also forbid dining in at restaurants between 6 p.m. and 5 a.m., have been extended to Aug. 18.China, which has tightened its political grip over the city, has sent help to boost Hong Kong’s testing and hospitalization capacity.Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on Friday that Hong Kong will offer a free, voluntary virus test to every resident as a way of identifying asymptomatic carriers who are spreading the virus silently. The ability to test the entire city of over 7 million, despite Hong Kong’s public institutions being able to process only 15,000 samples daily, reflects China’s powerful boost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-sees-fewest-coronavirus-cases-since-start-of-latest-outbreak/story-eElXyfeSwqmWWUTeCQZ6CP.html
11-08-2020||World||Mississauga city council allows broadcasting of Hanuman Chalisa, Gayatri Mantra||A city in Canada has made history by permitting local temples to broadcast sacred Hindu hymns during an auspicious period as regular worship remains impacted by restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Regular rules relating to noise bylaws disallow places of worship from using loudspeakers. However, the city of Mississauga’s council voted unanimously to relax those norms and let temples broadcast hymns like the Hanuman Chalisa or Gayatri Mantra. Mississauga lies in the Great Toronto Area and is in the province of Ontario.The city council had earlier not taken a decision on the matter and referred it to the Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Committee or DIAC, which thereafter voted in support of temporarily easing the noise bylaws. The matter returned to the city council abided by the DIAC’s decision, with all members voting in favour of the motion. Among its supporters was city Mayor Bonnie Crombie.This matter had been moved by the Hindu Forum Canada which sought permission for temples to broadcast from August 11 to September 1, for five minutes each evening at 7 pm. It had argued that this period was particularly significant for Hindus as it included Krishna Janmashthami, Onam and Ganesh Chaturthi.Among the original proponents of the measures was Indo-Canadian councillor Dipika Damerla, a former provincial Minister, who described it as a “small ask.” After the motion’s passage, she said she was “very happy” that this accommodation had been put in place for the religious group.Proponents have argued that the restrictions due to the coronavirus crisis have affected the faithful especially seniors.In fact, in April this year, many municipalities in Canada, including Mississauga, made an exception for the month of Ramzan, as restrictions similarly impacted Muslims in the country.With a precedent in place, an apex Indo-Canadian organisation has called upon cities to give similar permission to mandirs in the province of Ontario and beyond. The Canada India Foundation or CIF argued that to “be able to listen to the holy hymns and participate while being restricted to individual homes, is expected to act as a morale booster to the community.” Its chair Anil Shah underscored this argument, as he said, “We are in full agreement with the request to the various municipalities for accommodation regarding these religious events. This would be a great gesture that would strengthen our multicultural fabric even more.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mississauga-city-council-allows-broadcasting-of-hanuman-chalisa-gayatri-mantra/story-G8UXOpkigKUn2rwpagK9mO.html
11-08-2020||World||Russian Covid vaccine is safe, says Prez Putin; his daughter gets 2 shots||Russia on Tuesday became the first country to officially register a coronavirus vaccine and declare it ready for use, despite international scepticism. President Vladimir Putin said that one of his daughters has already been inoculated.Putin emphasized that the vaccine underwent the necessary tests and has proven efficient, offering a lasting immunity from the coronavirus. However, scientists at home and abroad have been sounding the alarm that the rush to start using the vaccine before Phase 3 trials — which normally last for months and involve thousands of people — could backfire.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageSpeaking at a government meeting Tuesday, Putin said that the vaccine has undergone proper testing and is safe.“I would like to repeat that it has passed all the necessary tests,” he said. “The most important thing is to ensure full safety of using the vaccine and its efficiency.”The Russian leader added that one of his two adult daughters has received two shots of the vaccine. “She has taken part in the experiment,” Putin said.Putin said that his daughter had a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 Fahrenheit) on the day of the first vaccine injection, and then it dropped to just over 37 degrees (98.6 Fahrenheit) on the following day. After the second shot she again had a slight increase in temperature, but then it was all over.Also read: Russian Covid-19 vaccine is ‘Pandora’s Box,’ industry body warns“She’s feeling well and has high number of antibodies,” Putin added. He didn’t specify which of his two daughters — Maria or Katerina — received the vaccine.Russian authorities have said that medical workers, teachers and other risk groups will be the first to be inoculated. Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said that the vaccination of doctors could start as early as this month.The Health Ministry said in Tuesday’s statement that the vaccine is expected to provide immunity from the coronavirus for up to two years.Putin emphasized that vaccination will be voluntary.Russian officials have said that large-scale production of the vaccine will start in September, and mass vaccination may begin as early as October.When the pandemic struck Russia, Putin ordered state officials to shorten the time of clinical trials for potential coronavirus vaccines.Becoming the first country in the world to develop a vaccine was a matter of national prestige for the Kremlin as it tries to assert the image of Russia as a global power. State television stations and other media have praised scientists working on it and presented the work the envy of other nations.Professor Alexander Gintsburg, head of the Gamaleya institute that developed the vaccine, raised eyebrows in May when he said that he and other researchers tried the vaccine on themselves.Human studies started June 17 among 76 volunteers. Half were injected with a vaccine in liquid form and the other half with a vaccine that came as soluble powder. Some in the first half were recruited from the military, which raised concerns that servicemen may have been pressured to participate.Amid Russia’s rush to become the first to create a vaccine, the U.S., Britain and Canada last month accused Russia of using hackers to steal vaccine research from Western labs.As the trials were declared completed, questions arose about the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness. Some experts scoffed at Russian authorities’ assurances that the vaccine drug produced the desired immune response and caused no significant side effects, pointing out that such claims need to be backed by published scientific data.The World Health Organization said all vaccine candidates should go through full stages of testing before being rolled out. Experts have warned that vaccines that are not properly tested can cause harm in many ways — from a negative impact on health to creating a false sense of security or undermining trust in vaccinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-has-developed-first-covid-19-vaccine-says-president-putin/story-O0jsaC8znG8BbxT5sTGuJL.html

Some vendors have reopened their stalls elsewhere.Wuhan has also had time to look back on its trauma, though only some memories make it into the official narrative.At a pandemic-themed exhibition, families peer through glass at autographed hazmat suits used by medical workers at the height of Wuhan’s outbreak, in an attempt to document an unprecedented period in the city’s history.China has largely brought its domestic epidemic under control, but sporadic outbreaks and a summer of severe flooding have exacerbated the economic fallout.Despite fears of a resurgence, some Wuhan residents are keen to enjoy the city’s recovery.“Now I enjoy every day as if it were the last,” says Hu Fenglian.“I don’t want to worry too much.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shadow-of-covid-19-slowly-lifts-from-epicentre-wuhan/story-B6gSwgni2GxPycptVliy8O.html
11-08-2020||World||Pakistan-Saudi Arabia tiff widens? As Islamabad returns loan, questions rise||There appears to be a shift in policy of Saudi Arabia towards Pakistan. The differences in their relations surfaced when Pakistan was made to pay back US $1 billion to Saudi Arabia last week.Pakistan has also not received the oil on deferred payments from Saudi Arabia since May as a deal signed between the two close allies for provision of US $3.2 billion worth of the fuel under the arrangement expired two months ago.Here are the developments in the past few months which are being keenly watched:• Pakistan has been insisting that Saudi Arabia should allow it to marshal the support of the Islamic world on the Kashmir issue. In February, it had asked for a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on the issue, but Saudi Arabia turned down the request. The OIC is a group of 57 Muslim countries in which Saudi Arabia holds considerable sway.• Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has been openly demanding that Saudi Arabia should convene an OIC council meeting on Kashmir after India’s move to scrap Article 370 which gave special status to the erstwhile state.• Qureshi even criticised Saudi Arabia for not heeding to its request. In a television interview, he said that if Saudi Arabia cannot support Pakistan, it will call a meeting of those Islamic countries “who stand with us on the Kashmir issue”. But the remarks drew criticism at home, with some experts saying Qureshi should have been careful.• “It should not have been expected that as Saudi Arabia is a friend of Pakistan so it will automatically be against India’s stance on Kashmir. This is not a college but an international arena,” a Pakistani journalist Amir Mateen was quoted as saying by news outlets in the country.• Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Muhammad bin Salman had signed memorandums of understanding (MoUs) worth US $20 billion during his visit to Pakistan in February 2019. Experts feel Pakistan’s continued insistence could jeopardise this entire investment; they say that the present dispensation in Islamabad should handle the issue carefully because “prince Salman is young and has impulsive behaviour”.• After Pakistan failed to gather support from the OIC members on Kashmir on May 22, Prime Minister Imran Khan had said, “The reason is that we have no voice and there is a total division amongst (us). We cannot even come together as a whole on the OIC meeting on Kashmir.”• Other experts say that even China is wary and treading a cautious line not to become involved in the Middle Eastern politics.• Pakistan has already returned US $1 billion Saudi loan - four months ahead of its repayment period - a news report said. Citing sources, it said Pakistan could also return the remaining US $2 billion cash loan, subject to availability of a similar facility from China.• The agreement over US $3 billion cash support and US $3.2 billion oil facility per annum had the provision of renewal for two more years.• The UAE had also announced a US $6.2 billion package for Pakistan in December 2018, including a US $3.2 billion oil facility. But later on, the UAE reduced its financial assistance to US $2 billion and also shelved the plan to give a US $3.2 billion oil facility on deferred payments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-saudi-arabia-tiff-widens-as-islamabad-returns-loan-questions-rise/story-SmlrxvYUdMsLAqtmsLxCLK.html
11-08-2020||World||Pakistan FM Qureshi criticised at home for slamming Saudi Arabia over Kashmir||Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi’s remarks against Saudi Arabia after Riyadh refused to interfere on Kashmir issue, have invited criticism at home.The differences in their relations surfaced when Pakistan was made to pay back USD 1 billion to Saudi Arabia. This reflected the fact that Islamabad is gradually losing the support of other Muslim countries.Recently two Pakistani journalists -- Rauf Klasra and Amir Mateen -- held a discussion on the sudden policy shift of Saudi Arabia towards Pakistan.While criticising Qureshi for making such statements, Mateen said, “Sometimes Qureshi speaks emotionally. He gets carried away.”As Pakistan, which is in a financial crisis, is dependent on Saudi Arabia, Qureshi should have been cautious of making any statements, he said.“As we are very much dependent on Saudi Arabia, we should complain only to a limit. Amid such a situation, Qureshi should have been careful because Mohammed bin Salman is young and has impulsive behaviour.”Mateen further said, “It should not have been expected that as Saudi Arabia is a friend of Pakistan so it will automatically be against India’s stance on Kashmir. This is not a college but an international arena.”The development comes even as Pakistan has been pushing for the foreign ministers’ meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) since India abrogated Article 370, which gave special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir.In a report published by Dawn, a Pakistan diplomatic source confirmed that Saudi Arabia had shown reluctance to accept Islamabad’s request for an immediate meeting of OIC foreign ministers’ on Kashmir.After Pakistan failed to gather support from the OIC members on Kashmir on May 22, Prime Minister Imran Khan said, “The reason is that we have no voice and there is a total division amongst (us). We cannot even come together as a whole on the OIC meeting on Kashmir.”Though Pakistan reportedly made attempts to push its narrative of raising the issue of rising Islamophobia in India in its agenda, Maldives, an ally of India, thwarted the move and said, “Isolated statements by motivated people and disinformation campaigns on social media should not be construed as representative of the feelings of 1.3 billion.”Maldives Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Thilmeeza Hussain, said that alleging Islamophobia in the context of India would be factually incorrect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-fm-qureshi-criticised-at-home-for-slamming-saudi-arabia-over-kashmir/story-YX6ahZUOMQwGFUHqrdtDbM.html
11-08-2020||World||New York’s true nursing home Covid-19 death toll cloaked in secrecy||Riverdale Nursing Home in the Bronx appears, on paper, to have escaped the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, with an official state count of just four deaths in its 146-bed facility.The truth, according to the home, is far worse: 21 dead, most transported to hospitals before they succumbed.“It was a cascading effect,” administrator Emil Fuzayov recalled. “One after the other.”New York’s coronavirus death toll in nursing homes, already among the highest in the nation, could actually be a significant undercount. Unlike every other state with major outbreaks, New York only counts residents who died on nursing home property and not those who were transported to hospitals and died there.That statistic that could add thousands to the state’s official care home death toll of just over 6,600. But so far the administration of Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo has refused to divulge the number, leading to speculation the state is manipulating the figures to make it appear it is doing a better than other states and to make a tragic situation less dire.“That’s a problem, bro,” state Sen. Gustavo Rivera, a Democrat, told New York Health Commissioner Howard Zucker during a legislative hearing on nursing homes earlier this month. “It seems, sir, that in this case you are choosing to define it differently so that you can look better.”How big a difference could it make? Since May, federal regulators have required nursing homes to submit data on coronavirus deaths each week, whether or not residents died in the facility or at a hospital. Because the requirement came after the height of New York’s outbreak, the available data is relatively small. According to the federal data, roughly a fifth of the state’s homes reported resident deaths from early June to mid July — a tally of 323 dead, 65 percent higher than the state’s count of 195 during that time period. Even if half that undercount had held true from the start of the pandemic, that would translate into thousands more nursing home resident deaths than the state has acknowledged.Another group of numbers also suggests an undercount. State health department surveys show 21,000 nursing home beds are lying empty this year, 13,000 more than expected — an increase of almost double the official state nursing home death tally. While some of that increase can be attributed to fewer new admissions and people pulling their loved ones out, it suggests that many others who aren’t there anymore died.However flawed New York’s count, Cuomo has not been shy about comparing it to tallies in other states.Nearly every time Cuomo is questioned about New York’s nursing home death toll, he brushes off criticism as politically motivated and notes that his state’s percentage of nursing home deaths out of its overall Covid-19 death toll is around 20%, far less than Pennsylvania’s 68%, Massachusetts’ 64% and New Jersey’s 44%.“Look at the basic facts where New York is versus other states,” Cuomo said during a briefing Monday. “You look at where New York is as a percentage of nursing home deaths, it’s all the way at the bottom of the list.”In another briefing last month, he touted New York’s percentage ranking as 35th in the nation. “Go talk to 34 other states first. Go talk to the Republican states now — Florida, Texas, Arizona — ask them what is happening in nursing homes. It’s all politics.”Boston University geriatrics expert Thomas Perls said it doesn’t make sense that nursing home resident deaths as a percentage of total deaths in many nearby states are more than triple what was reported in New York.“Whatever the cause, there is no way New York could be truly at 20%,” Perls said.A running tally by The Associated Press shows that more than 68,200 residents and staff at nursing homes and long-term facilities across the nation have died from the coronarivus, out of more than 163,000 overall deaths.For all 43 states that break out nursing home data, resident deaths make up 44% of total Covid deaths in their states, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Assuming the same proportion held in New York, that would translate to more than 11,000 nursing home deaths.To be sure, comparing coronavirus deaths in nursing homes across states can be difficult because of the differences in how states conduct their counts. New York is among several states that include probable Covid-19 deaths as well as those confirmed by a test. Some states don’t count deaths from homes where fewer than five have died. Others don’t always give precise numbers, providing ranges instead. And all ultimately rely on the nursing homes themselves to provide the raw data.“Everybody is doing it however they feel like doing it. We don’t have very good data. It’s just all over the place, all over the country,” said Toby Edelman of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit representing nursing home residents.New York health chief Zucker explained during the legislative hearing that New York only counts deaths on the nursing home property to avoid “double-counting” deaths in both the home and the hospital. And while he acknowledged the state keeps a running count of nursing home resident deaths at hospitals, he declined to provide even a rough estimate to lawmakers.“I will not provide information that I have not ensured is absolutely accurate,” Zucker said. “This is too big an issue and it’s too serious an issue.”Zucker promised to provide lawmakers the numbers as soon as that doublechecking is complete. They are still waiting. The AP has also been denied access to similar nursing home death data despite filing a public records request with the state health department nearly three months ago.Dr. Michael Wasserman, president of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine, said it is unethical of New York to not break out the deaths of nursing home residents at hospitals. “From an epidemiological and scientific perspective, there is absolutely no reason not to count them.”Nursing homes have become a particular sore point for the Cuomo administration, which has generally received praise for steps that flattened the curve of infections and New York’s highest-in-the-nation 32,781 overall deaths.But a controversial March 25 order to send recovering Covid-19 patients from hospitals into nursing homes that was designed to free up hospital bed space at the height of the pandemic has drawn withering criticism from relatives and patient advocates who contend it accelerated nursing home outbreaks.Cuomo reversed the order under pressure in early May. And his health department later released an internal report that concluded asymptomatic nursing home staffers were the real spreaders of the virus, not the 6,300 recovering patients released from hospitals into nursing homes.But epidemiologists and academics derided the study for a flawed methodology that sidestepped key questions and relied on selective stats, including the state’s official death toll figures.“We’re trying to find out what worked and what didn’t work and that means trying to find patterns,” said Bill Hammond, who works on health policy for the nonprofit Empire Center think tank. “You can’t do that if you have the wrong data.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-s-true-nursing-home-covid-19-death-toll-cloaked-in-secrecy/story-FeLJT9iTCQdaA0zhY4qmGI.html

11-08-2020||World||Trump proposes to hold G-7 summit post US presidential elections||President Donald Trump on Monday said he was “more inclined” to host the upcoming summit of the G-7, which his administration had intended to use to rally the world’s richest economies to focus on the threat from China, after the US presidential elections in November. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was to attend at the American leader’s invitation.“I’m much more inclined to do it sometime after the election; we were going to do it in September,” the president told reporters at a White House news briefing that he left briefly because of a shooting outside. He returned a few minutes later, saying things were “under control”.Continuing to talk about the G-7 Summit, Trump said, “We could do it through teleconference or we could do it through a meeting,” adding that it was only past Sunday that he had suggested to his aides to reschedule the summit to after the election in a “better …. calmer atmosphere”.The presidency of the G7 rotates annually, and Trump is this year’s chair.President Trump will continue in office if he wins, but even if he were to lose, he will still be around till the inauguration of his successor in January of 2021.Just a few minutes into the start of the briefing, Trump was escorted off the dais in the White House briefing room by the Secret Service, which confirmed a shooting involving one of its agents shortly after the president had returned to resume the briefing.“A male subject and a USSS (US Secret Service) officer were both transported to a local hospital,” the secret service said in an update, adding, “At no time during this incident was the White House complex breached or were any protectees in danger.”Trump first spoke of his plans to invite Modi and leaders of Australia, South Korea and Russia to the G-7 summit in May. He had also expressed his desire at the time to include these nations in an expanded group called “G-10 or G-11”. He had then planned to hold the summit in the week before the UN general assembly meetings around September 15.The US President extended an invitation to Modi to attend the summit in a phone call a week later. He also conveyed his “desire” to expand the group to India, which was mistaken among some policy circles in India as an invitation to the expanded group, which is call to be taken jointly by the other members.Modi had “commended President Trump for his creative and far-sighted approach, acknowledging the fact that such an expanded forum would be in keeping with the emerging realities of the post-COVID world” about the offer. And he had gone on to assure Trump of India’s willingness to “work with the US and other countries to ensure the success of the proposed Summit.”Though not a member of the G-7, India has been at some of its summits at the invitation of host countries. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had attended the 2005 summit in Gleneagles, the UK (the group was called G-8 back then and included Russia, which was thrown out in 2014 for annexing Crimea), and Prime Minister Modi attended the 2019 summit in Biarritz, France.“I’m postponing it because I don’t feel that as a G7 it properly represents what’s going on in the world,” Trump had told reporters on Air Force One on the way back from the historic launch of the first manned mission into space by a private company, SpaceX in May. “It’s a very outdated group of countries.”Alyssa Alexandra Farah, head of the president’s team on strategic communications, had told reporters then that the summit was an attempt to bring together “our traditional allies to talk about how to deal with the future of China”.The Group of Seven, called G-7, is an intergovernmental organisation of some of the world’s largest economies, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. India is a member of the larger version of the body that is called the G-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-postpones-until-after-us-elections-g-7-meet-pm-modi-was-to-attend-at-his-invitation/story-AX6zfrzP3Lv1D10R4lBGjO.html
11-08-2020||World||Lebanon prez Aoun was warned in July about explosives at port: Report||Lebanese security officials warned the prime minister and president last month that 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored in Beirut’s port posed a security risk and could destroy the capital if it exploded, according to documents seen by Reuters and senior security sources.Just over two weeks later, the industrial chemicals exploded in a massive blast that obliterated most of the port, killed at least 163 people, injured 6,000 more and destroyed some 6,000 buildings, according to municipal authorities.A report by the General Directorate of State Security about events leading up to the explosion included a reference to a private letter sent to President Michel Aoun and Prime Minister Hassan Diab on July 20.While the content of the letter was not in the report seen by Reuters, a senior security official said it summed up the findings of a judicial investigation launched in January which concluded the chemicals needed to be secured immediately.The state security report, which confirmed the correspondence to the president and the prime minister, has not previously been reported.“There was a danger that this material, if stolen, could be used in a terrorist attack,” the official told Reuters.“At the end of the investigation, Prosecutor General (Ghassan) Oweidat prepared a final report which was sent to the authorities,” he said, referring to the letter sent to the prime minister and president by the General Directorate of State Security, which oversees port security.“I warned them that this could destroy Beirut if it exploded,” said the official, who was involved in writing the letter and declined to be named.Reuters could not independently confirm his description of the letter.The prime minister’s office and the presidency did not respond to requests for comment about the July 20 letter. The prosecutor general did not respond to requests for comment.‘DO WHAT IS NECESSARY’The correspondence could fuel further criticism and public fury that the blast is just the latest, if not most dramatic, example of the government negligence and corruption that has already pushed Lebanon to economic collapse.As protests over the blast raged in Lebanon on Monday, Diab’s government resigned, though it will remain as a caretaker administration until a new cabinet is formed.The rebuilding of Beirut alone is expected to cost up to $15 billion, in a country already effectively bankrupt with total banking system losses exceeding $100 billion.Aoun confirmed last week that he had been informed about the material. He told reporters he had directed the secretary general of the supreme defence council, an umbrella group of Lebanon’s security and military agencies chaired by the president, to “do what is necessary”.“(The state security service) said it is dangerous. I am not responsible! I don’t know where it was put and I didn’t know how dangerous it was. I have no authority to deal with the port directly. There is a hierarchy and all those who knew should have known their duties to do the necessary,” Aoun said.Many questions remain over why the shipment of ammonium nitrate docked in Beirut in late 2013. Even more baffling is why such a huge stash of dangerous material, used in bombs and fertilisers, was allowed to remain there for so long.The letter sent to Lebanon’s president and prime minister followed a string of memos and letters sent to the country’s courts over the previous six years by port, custom and security officials, repeatedly urging judges to order the removal of the ammonium nitrate from its position so close to the city centre.The General Directorate of State Security’s report seen by Reuters said many requests had been submitted, without giving an exact number. It said the port’s manifest department sent several written requests to the customs directorate up until 2016 asking them to call on a judge to order the material be re-exported immediately.“But until now, no decision has been issued over this matter. After consulting one of our chemical specialists, the expert confirmed that this material is dangerous and is used to produce explosives,” the General Directorate of State Security report said.HAZARDOUS MATERIALThe road to last week’s tragedy began seven years ago, when the Rhosus, a Russian-chartered, Moldovan-flagged vessel carrying ammonium nitrate from Georgia to Mozambique, docked in Beirut to try to take on extra cargo to raise the fees for passage through the Suez Canal, according to the ship’s captain.Port authorities impounded the Rhosus on December 2013 by judicial order 2013/1031 due to outstanding debts owed to two companies that filed claims in Beirut courts, the state security report showed.In May 2014, the ship was deemed unseaworthy and its cargo was unloaded in October 2014 and warehoused in what was known as Hangar 12. The ship sank near the port’s breakwater on Feb. 18, 2018, the security report showed.Moldova lists the owner of the ship as Panama-based Briarwood Corp. Briarwood could not immediately be reached for comment.In February 2015, Nadim Zwain, a judge from the Summary Affairs Court, which deals with urgent issues, appointed an expert to inspect the cargo, according to the security report.The report said the expert concluded that the material was hazardous and, through the port authorities, requested it be transferred to the army. Reuters could not independently confirm the expert’s account.Lebanese army command rejected the request and recommended the chemicals be transferred or sold to the privately-owned Lebanese Explosives Company, the state security report said.The report did not say why the army had refused to accept the cargo. A security official told Reuters it was because they didn’t need it. The army declined to comment.The explosive company’s management told Reuters it had not been interested in purchasing confiscated material and that the firm had its own suppliers and government import licences.From then on, customs and security officials wrote to judges roughly every six months asking for the removal of the material, according to the requests seen by Reuters.Judges and customs officials contacted by Reuters declined to comment.A number of customs and port officials have since been detained as part of the investigation into the blast.‘BAD STORAGE AND BAD JUDGMENT’In January 2020, a judge launched an official investigation after it was discovered that Hangar 12 was unguarded, had a hole in its southern wall and one of its doors dislodged, meaning the hazardous material was at risk of being stolen.In his final report following the investigation, Prosecutor General Oweidat “gave orders immediately” to ensure hangar doors and holes were repaired and security provided, a second high-ranking security official who also requested anonymity said.On June 4, based on those orders, state security instructed port authorities to provide guards at Hangar 12, appoint a director for the warehouse and secure all the doors and repair the hole in the southern wall, according to the state security report and security officials.The port authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment.“The maintenance started and (port authorities) sent a team of Syrian workers (but) there was no one supervising them when they entered to fix the holes,” the security official said. During the work, sparks from the welding took hold and fire started to spread, the official said.“Given that there were fireworks stored in the same hangar, after an hour a big fire was set off by the fireworks and that spread to the material that exploded when the temperature exceeded 210 degrees,” the high-ranking security official said.The official blamed the port authorities for not supervising the repair crew and for storing fireworks alongside a vast deposit of high explosives.Reuters could not determine what happened to the workers repairing the hangar.“Only because the hangar faces the sea, the impact of the explosion was reduced. Otherwise all of Beirut would have been destroyed,” he said. “The issue is all about negligence, irresponsibility, bad storage and bad judgment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanon-prez-aoun-was-warned-in-july-about-explosives-at-port-report/story-sBj4nuoGlBeXutJ95crXaM.html
11-08-2020||World||Media tycoon Jimmy Lai’s arrest sends warning to Hong Kong’s free press||Right before China retook control of Hong Kong in 1997, tycoon Jimmy Lai started Apple Daily in part to promote democracy in the city. For 25 years the newspaper survived advertising boycotts and political pressure but never backed off its tough coverage of the Chinese government and pro-Beijing lawmakers.It may not last through the summer. Hong Kong police arrested Lai and several of his top executives on Monday and sent hundreds of officers to search the Apple Daily offices, a demonstration of the broad potential for the new national security law to silence criticism and dissent beyond pro-democracy protests and activism.Passed in June, the legislation bars “crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces” as interpreted by the Chinese government and enforced by Beijing’s new security office in Hong Kong. Lai’s arrest wasn’t entirely unexpected, but it still shook the foundations of press freedom in the financial center and raised fears about what might come next.For the global business community, which relies on the rule of law and stability that Hong Kong offers, threats to the free press are troubling, said Imogen T. Liu, a political economist affiliated with Maastricht University in the Netherlands. “Hong Kong is attractive to international investors because it has a reputation for market discipline and transparency that was institutionalized under British rule,” she said. “Free speech is part of this liberal image, along with free market competition and government non-intervention.”Hong Kong stocks rebounded Tuesday, rising 2.3% as of 10:07 a.m. Casinos were among leading gainers on news China will start issuing tourist visas to Macau. Tencent Holdings Ltd. snapped a two day decline to gain 3.9%.Lai’s Next Digital Ltd. soared as much as 210%, a day after social media posts urged investors to buy shares of the company following his arrest and police raid of his flagship newspaper.Journalists have been concerned about China’s tightening grip on free speech in Hong Kong at least since 2018, when local authorities declined to renew the work visa of the Asia news editor for the Financial Times. It was thought to be the first expulsion of a foreign journalist since the 1997 handover and suggested a bolder Chinese influence on the city.Those concerns only grew this year. After the U.S. placed restrictions on Chinese media, the government in Beijing expelled Americans working for the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post and said they weren’t welcome in Hong Kong. In July, the New York Times announced it was moving its digital news operation from Hong Kong to Seoul.The Foreign Correspondents Club, Hong Kong, which advocates for press freedom in Asia, condemned the arrests and newsroom raid on Monday, saying they “signal a dark new phase in the erosion of the city’s global reputation.” Last week the club had called for both the U.S. and the Chinese governments to stop using journalists as political canon fodder: “This downward spiral of retaliatory actions aimed at journalists helps no one, not least of all the public that needs accurate, professionally produced information now more than ever.”‘Highly unusual’That statement also said that journalists have reported delays in new or renewed visas, which it called “highly unusual for Hong Kong.” Meanwhile, local outlet the Standard reported that journalist visas were now being vetted by a “national security unit” within the Hong Kong Immigration department, a new process that more closely mirrors China’s close scrutiny of foreign media.Locally, Wilson Li Chung-chak, a freelancer for Britain’s ITV and former member of the now-disbanded student activist group Scholarism, was arrested for collusion with a foreign country or external elements, the first time a freelance journalist was charged under the new law, according to the South China Morning Post.The effects have been chilling. Selina Cheng, an investigative reporter at local news outlet HK01, said senior management has begun to restrict the kinds of stories their reporters can work on. “When editors are worried about getting into trouble they naturally won’t push reporters to do more reporting on topics they don’t feel comfortable with,” she said.Even Apple Daily had taken steps to protect its reporters and stopped printing bylines after the law passed.“Other media outlets looking at what happened to Apple Daily today know that if they speak out against the government -- like Apple Daily did -- they will face the same consequences,” said Martin Lam, a reporter who’s covered Hong Kong politics for the paper for 13 years. “They will be more cautious of what they report in the near future.”‘Exactly how the law is supposed to work’The new law has also taken aim at literature. Several books by pro-democracy activists were removed from Hong Kong libraries and are currently “under review” to see if they run afoul of the new law.“Pulling books out of the library, arresting pro-democracy activists -- this is exactly how the law is supposed to work,” said Jimmy Chan Hing-chi, a political economics professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “In the long run, as freedom of expression is undermined further and further, Hong Kong’s reputation as an international financial center may gradually erode.”Minh Bui Jones, editor-in-chief of the pan-Asian literary magazine, Mekong Review, said less than three weeks after the law passed, his printing company told him it had been ordered by authorities to stop printing the magazine. Jones’ attempts to follow up went unanswered, and he found a different printer.“I would still like to publish in Hong Kong,” said Jones, praising the printers, the location, and the legacy of other Hong Kong-based publications including the Far Eastern Economic Review. “But it’s getting harder and harder, and at some point you’ll just give up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-s-arrest-sends-warning-to-hong-kong-s-free-press/story-pqmqeuevU6fEYgzSlTW6PM.html

11-08-2020||World||As global Covid-19 tally surpasses 20 million, WHO urges people not to despair||The coronavirus pandemic chalked up another horrific milestone Monday as the world surpassed 20 million recorded cases of infection from the tiny killer that has upended life just about everywhere.The number as of 2215 GMT was 20,002,577 cases, with 733,842 deaths recorded, according to an AFP tally of official sources.In yet another staggering landmark, the death toll is expected to surpass 750,000 in a matter of days as the global health crisis that began late last year in China rages on.As more things once unthinkable became harsh reality -- having to wear a facemask in touristy spots in Paris, or reserve a spot on Copacabana beach in Rio via an app and then social distance on the sand -- the World Health Organization urged people not to despair.“Behind these statistics is a great deal of pain and suffering... But I want to be clear: there are green shoots of hope,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.“It’s never too late to turn the outbreak around,” he said.He gave examples of countries that had successfully clamped down on Covid-19, such as Rwanda and New Zealand, which said Monday it plans to open a virus-free “travel bubble” with the Cook Islands.With much of the world caught in a cycle of dispiriting outbreaks and economically crushing lockdowns, all eyes are on the race for a vaccine.A WHO overview said 165 candidate vaccines are being worked on around the world, with six reaching Phase 3 of clinical evaluation.But the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan warned that a vaccine was “only part of the answer,” pointing to polio and measles as diseases with vaccines that have not been fully eradicated.“You’ve got to be able to deliver that vaccine to a population that want and demand to have that vaccine,” he said.Europe feels the heat Infections have been rising ominously in Western Europe, which has also been sweltering through a heatwave, with temperatures soaring above 35 degrees Celsius (95 F).The blistering heat sent crowds flocking to beaches at the weekend despite health warnings about the risk of infection.In the Paris region, people aged 11 and over are now required to wear masks in crowded areas and tourists hotspots. These include the banks of the Seine River and more than 100 streets in the French capital.Marion, a 24-year-old in central Paris, said the masks are “restrictive” but necessary “if we want to avoid a second wave.” “Anything except a second lockdown,” she added.Several French towns and cities have already introduced similar measures, as well as parts of Belgium, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain.In Berlin, thousands of children returned to school on Monday after the summer break, sporting masks, which are compulsory in common areas like school courtyards.Greece meanwhile announced a night curfew for restaurants and bars in some of its top tourist destinations after its number of new cases increased.In Italy, the coronavirus spikes of its neighbours caused alarm.“France, Spain and the Balkans... Italy is surrounded by contagions,” Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza lamented.It was a different story in Pakistan, which allowed all restaurants and parks to reopen on Monday, after the country saw a drop in new cases over several weeks.Grim US, Brazil milestones As of Monday evening, the United States -- the world’s worst-hit country -- had recorded 163,370 deaths and 5,085,821 cases of infection, according to the tracker at Johns Hopkins University.As the caseload shot past five million on Sunday, President Donald Trump’s Democratic opponent in the presidential election, Joe Biden, tweeted that the number “boggles the mind and breaks the heart.”The figure came as Trump was accused of flouting the constitution by unilaterally extending a virus relief package.The package -- announced by Trump on Saturday after talks between Republican and Democrat lawmakers hit a wall -- was “absurdly unconstitutional,” senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi told CNN.But with the world’s largest economy still struggling to dig itself out of an enormous hole, Democrats appeared skittish about any legal challenge to a relief package they see as seriously inadequate.After the US, Brazil has the most cases, and over the weekend it became the second country to pass 100,000 fatalities.President Jair Bolsonaro has downplayed the coronavirus threat, and after Brazil’s latest milestone, the country’s most widely viewed TV network Globo asked: “Has the president of the republic done his duty?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-global-covid-19-tally-surpasses-20-million-who-urges-people-not-to-despair/story-AprBWEjhfclzS7iqQLR3eI.html

11-08-2020||World||‘Pushing for it very hard but not for votes’: Trump hopeful Covid-19 vaccine will be out by end of 2020||(Bloomberg) -- Even if the most optimistic projections hold true and a Covid-19 vaccine is cleared for U.S. use in November, the vast majority of Americans won’t be able to get the shots until spring or summer next year at the earliest.That likely timeline, based on interviews and remarks from top specialists including Anthony Fauci of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, means businesses, schoolchildren and families will continue to wait.In an interview, Fauci, who has also been involved with White House’s “Operation Warp Speed” vaccine program, said it may take until well into 2021 for vaccines to reach the much of the general public.“I would hope that by the time we get well into the second half of 2021 that the companies will have delivered the hundreds of millions of doses they have promised,” said Fauci.The reasons are many. US health regulators will have only a tiny sliver of the usual safety and efficacy data. The leading products require two doses, which will limit how many people early supplies can help. And government health officials are still developing a plan for who will get the shots, how they’ll be distributed, and how their effectiveness and safety will be tracked afterward.“For three, to six, to nine months, there will be more people wanting a vaccine than there are vaccines,” said Stephane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna Inc., the biotechnology company developing one of the furthest-along inoculations.Bancel said he expects his company’s product may get an emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for “a very narrow population at very high risk.” Vaccines for the general population will need full FDA approval, which will likely take significantly longer, he said in an interview.Those comments run counter to the timeline portrayed by President Donald Trump, who has said a vaccine may be ready by election day on Nov. 3.“I’m pushing everybody. If you had another president other than me, you wouldn’t be talking vaccines for two years. I will push it very hard,” Trump said last week during a radio interview with Geraldo Rivera. “But I’m not doing it for votes, I’m doing it because that’s the right thing to do and I’m doing it to save lives.”On Monday in Washington, Trump echoed his ambitious timeline: “I feel strongly that we will have a vaccine by the end of the year and it’ll be put in service maybe even as we get it, because we’re all set militarily, we’re using our military to distribute the vaccine.”Limited AccessOperation Warp Speed seeks to do what’s never been done before: research, develop and produce a vaccine for a new virus in months. It’s a monumental, risky undertaking that will probably result in billions of dollars of waste, but could shave years off of typical development timelines. But even if it’s successful, warp speed will move faster for some people than others. Two other key government officials described a gradually widening trickle of access over months and months, not the sudden, widespread availability of a vaccine. During an Aug. 7 presentation to a panel of experts convened by the National Academy of Medicine, which is helping decide who will be first in line for a shot, Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Moncef Slaoui said significant production ramp-up should start in November. It will continue accelerating over the following months until it is producing a ‘very large number of doses’ on a monthly basis in the second quarter of 2021, Slaoui said.Along with $8 billion in U.S. funds granted for vaccine development and manufacturing through Warp Speed, the Health and Defense departments have doled out contracts totaling almost $500 million to increase domestic manufacturing of vials and prefilled syringes for Covid-19 vaccines. The consulting company Deloitte also has a $15 million contract to track vaccine distribution and administration. The firm didn’t respond to a request for comment.On July 27, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins warned that the first round of vaccines will be carefully allocated.“There will be tens of millions of doses at the time that the first vaccine gets approved,” Collins said. “It won’t be enough for everybody, and so decisions will have to be made about priorities.”Vaccine trials typically require tens of thousands of patients and months of follow up to show they’re safe enough to give to healthy people. A lack of long-term data could limit access until health officials can better assess any risks.Moderna’s trial has signed up about 10% of the 30,000 people it aims to enroll, Fauci said on Aug. 6. Trial participants need to get the shots, which are spaced apart, and then be monitored to find out if they get infected or have any side effects.By the early fall, the FDA may only have a few weeks of data. That may be enough to give the shot to health-care and other front-line workers and other groups at higher risk from the virus, but it almost certainly won’t be enough for lower-risk people.That data won’t come until next year, said Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at SVB Leerink, in a July 20 note to clients.The first announcement of federal clearance for a vaccine will more likely become a political event “with the reality of the availability, effectiveness and utility of the vaccine falling far short of the promotion by government officials,” he said.Early Plans Despite the demand for a vaccine and the logistical challenges of rolling it out to hundreds of millions of Americans, the Trump administration is still early in the planning phases for how that immense effort will go.The Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are expected to be heavily involved, and the role of the private sector is less clear.“It may not be going through CVS,” Fauci told Bloomberg, referring to the drugstore chain CVS Health Corp. “The DOD together with the CDC is getting very involved in how you get the supply chain to the people. That has not yet been worked out.”The Warp Speed program is also looking at using the military, said Jonathan Hoffman, the Pentagon’s chief spokesman, said during a press briefing July 30.The Defense Department is examining “how do we take advantage of the commercial capability of the private sector to handle things like distribution, and where will either the DOD step in to help manage that process, or if necessary will DOD be required to step in and actually physically deliver items itself,” he said.At least four states, California, Minnesota, North Dakota and Florida, are helping develop the early stages of a plan to distribute vaccine once it’s available, CQ Roll Call reported on Monday. The early stage plan is meant to explore “model approaches” on vaccine distribution, the publication reported, describing the program as a highly preliminary effort.In a message to Bloomberg, California’s Department of Public Health described the program as a “joint planning mission.” Florida’s health department confirmed its participation, though said no agenda for the meeting had been set. In the meantime, companies and scientists developing the vaccines are rushing to get data to back their use, or move onto more promising targets.Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, which have a competing vaccine, are also signing up patients. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said at a Washington Post event last week that the drugmaker expects rapid approval from the FDA, at least for emergency use, and will have enough of the shot to begin distribution this fall.“The main goal right now is to make sure we have a vaccine,” Bourla said. “There are two enemies — the virus, and time.”(Adds Trump comment in the 10th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pushing-for-it-very-hard-but-not-for-votes-trump-hopeful-covid-19-vaccine-will-be-out-by-end-of-2020/story-O4uYPh62zKeu4LJlHTg6GI.html

More than 400 officers were dispatched to downtown after seeing social media posts encouraging looting in the wake of an officer-involved shooting on Sunday on the South Side, Brown said. Thirteen officers were hurt in incidents that included broken windows, stolen merchandise and shots fired at police, he said.“This was an assault on our city,” said Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot, who appeared with Brown during the press conference. “It undermines public safety and breeds a sense of insecurity among our residents. It also undermines our recovery efforts. These same stores that were hit last night, were hit previously, not just by the looting but by closures related to Covid-19.”Bus and train services were temporarily suspended in the downtown area. Downtown access was to be restricted overnight, and the city’s iconic bridges over the Chicago River were raised to limit access into the city’s loop.Some unrest had started on Sunday with a crowd growing in a South side neighbourhood following a shooting incident involving police and a 20-year-old man, who was injured but is expected to have survived, according to Brown. Police had responded to a call of a man with a gun, and the individual had pointed the gun at officers, Brown said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/looting-in-chicago-leads-to-more-than-100-arrests-cops-place-restrictions/story-eOKrWqHJu71LxlpsQl8T5M.html

High winds and waves are pounding the MV Wakashio, which was showing signs of splitting apart and dumping its remaining cargo oil into the waters surrounding Mauritius. The bulk carrier had run aground on a coral reef on July 25. and later started to leak oil.The Mauritius PM’s office said on Monday the situation was still very serious and they were preparing for “a worst case scenario”.Mauritian Wildlife Foundation manager Jean Hugues Gardenne said, “We are expecting the worst. The ship is showing really big, big cracks. We believe it will break into two at any time, at the maximum within two days. So much oil remains in the ship, so the disaster could become much worse. Helicopters are taking out the fuel little by little.”French experts arrived from the nearby island of Reunion and were deploying booms to contain any new oil spill. France sent a navy ship, military aircraft and technical advisers after Mauritius appealed for international help. Efforts were also underway to get other ships to pump oil out of the MV Wakashio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mauritius-races-to-halt-oil-spill-from-ship/story-EbBw4HGRp1LzAgojYOkZnK.html

11-08-2020||World||UN sends 50,000 tons of wheat to Lebanon to avert food crisis||The United Nations is sending grain to Lebanon to avert a food crisis following last week’s explosion in Beirut that killed 160 people and destroyed grain silos.The World Food Programme will ship 50,000 tons of wheat flour to Beirut, enough to supply Lebanon for three months, it and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, another UN body, said Tuesday. The first batch of 17,500 tons will arrive in 10 days.The shipments will go to bakeries and millers and “ensure there is no food shortage,” OCHA said.A huge blast on Aug. 4 tore through major grain silos in Beirut’s port, stoking fears of scarcities in a nation that imports nearly all its food and was already reeling from an economic crisis. The explosion, which caused billions of dollars-worth of damage, occurred next to a grain store and left the country with only six weeks of flour reserves, half the standard amount to ensure food security, according to the UN.“Grain silos have been mostly destroyed, causing fears of skyrocketing food prices,” the WFP said.Lebanon relies on privately owned mills to ship wheat from Ukraine, Russia and other European countries. The government used to buy grain from local farmers at above-market prices but hasn’t done so in years.The explosion exacerbates the plight of the Arab nation, which has been battered this year by the coronavirus pandemic and a financial meltdown. The government defaulted on around $30 billion of Eurobonds in March and has been trying to get a bailout of around $10 billion from the International Monetary Fund.Foreign exchange dried up, causing a collapse in the Lebanese pound and shortages of food and fuel. Overall inflation in June stood at 90%, and for food alone it was almost 250%, according to the government’s statistics agency.The WFP plans to expand its cash-assistance program in the country almost 10-fold to one million people. It’s also increasing the value of its food cards by 73% to 70,000 Lebanese pounds ($46 at the official exchange rate; $9.33 at the black-market rate most Lebanese people have to use) because of the high inflation.The WFP has started airlifting mobile-storage units for grain to Beirut to replace the silos until they’re repaired. The first plane landed in the city on Saturday and two more are on their way, it said.Beirut’s container terminal was only partially affected by the blast and it restarted the offloading of ships on Aug. 8, according to the UN.“WFP has the capacity to launch a shipping operation that does not require port infrastructure,” the UN said. “WFP has the capacity to ship, deliver and unload wheat flour and bulk wheat grains directly into Beirut.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-sends-50-000-tons-of-wheat-to-lebanon-to-avert-food-crisis/story-mU5CSCoWwioBjwbxw8kcXK.html

The auction is to be held on August 21, with the next bid already set at a minimum of £55,000.The glasses were sent last week to the auction house in an ordinary envelope put in its letter-box by an unnamed vendor who did not realise its value. The glasses were in the vendor’s family for nearly a century, given to his uncle by Gandhi between 1920 and 1930.The uncle was working with British Petroleum in South Africa, where Gandhi spent years before returning to India to launch the freedom struggle. “It can be presumed that these (glasses) were gifted by way of thanks from Gandhi for some good deed. A note from the vendor is included”, the auctioneer said.Stowe said research confirmed the authenticity of the spectacles, calling the item a “special piece”.The glasses are described by the auctioneer as being “of usual form, with sprung gold plated arms and prescription lenses. Jointed by a gold plated nose bar. The spectacles formed an important and somewhat iconic part of Gandhi’s overall appearance”.“It was known that he would often give away his old or unwanted pairs to those in need or those who had helped him. A rare and important pair of spectacles”, it added.Another Bristol-based company, Paul Fraser Collectibles, has put up for sale cutlery used by Gandhi during his incarceration at the Aga Khan Palace in Pune and at the house of shipping magnate Sumati Morarjee in Mumbai for £70,000.The lot on sale since 2014 includes Gandhi’s metal food bowl, two wooden spoons and a wooden fork.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bids-over-55-000-for-mahatma-gandhi-s-glasses-from-south-africa/story-Eb5wouU6HR0MdNn11gnWII.html

If he (Kaneria) wants to visit Ram Mandir and offer prayers, then he is most welcome,” said Nritya Gopal Das. “Anyone from Pakistan who has faith in lord Ram can come to Ayodhya. The deity has a global presence and is not limited to Bharat alone,” Das said. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) also welcomed spinner Kaneria’s wish and demanded special visa for him from the government of India to visit the country. “Pakistani Hindus have a blood relation with us and Kaneria’s statement proves this,” said Sharad Sharma, regional spokesperson, VHP, who operates from Karsevakpuram, Ayodhya. “We welcome every Hindu from Pakistan to Ayodhya. We owe more to them (Pakistani Hindus) as they have suffered a lot,” he said. Priest Raju Das of Hanuman Garhi invited Kaneria to lord Hanuman’s temple also. “Pakistani Hindus are the most persecuted community in the world. If Danish Kaneria wants to visit Ram Mandir, he is most welcome at Hanuman Garhi also,” said Das. Kaneria, who is the second Hindu cricketer to play for Pakistan after Anil Dalpat, tweeted several times in the last one week with the religious slogan ‘Jai Shri Ram’. In his tweet, Kaneria, said: “The beauty of Lord Ram lies in his character, not in his name. He is a symbol of the victory of right over evil. There is a wave of happiness across the world today. It is a moment of great satisfaction. #JaiShriRam.” In a recent interview to a news channel, Kaneria expressed his desire to offer prayers at the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of the temple on August 5 in a grand ceremony at Ram Janmabhoomi. Soon after PM Modi performed the Bhoomi Pujan, the former Pakistani cricketer posted an image on social media platforms featuring Ram Mandir’s digital image on a giant billboard at New York’s Times Square. Sharing the image, Kaneria had also tweeted, “Today is the historical day for Hindus across the world. Lord Ram is our ideal.” A few reports stated that the leg-spinner received backlash over the post as Islamists threatened him leading to the deletion of the tweet by the Pakistani cricketer. “There is a wave of happiness across the world today. It is a moment of great satisfaction,” the 39-year-old former spinner was quoted as saying. Being one of the most successful bowlers in Test cricket history of Pakistan with 261 wickets, Kaneria had reportedly been ‘mistreated’ by his former teammates for being a Hindu. And this was revealed by former Pakistani pacer Shoaib Akhtar, who in a chat show, had claimed how Kaneria used to be humiliated and mistreated by teammates because he was a Hindu. “Other players used to refuse to eat with him because of his Hindu faith,” Akhtar had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anyone-from-pak-who-has-faith-in-lord-ram-can-come-to-ayodhya-says-ram-janmabhoomi-trust-chief/story-8JYboUV7ihtpBkEegTveNK.html

The yajna, which started around 7:50 am, in a Shiva temple around 2 km from the former president’s ancestral house, would continue for the next two days and is being held for the speedy recovery of Mukherjee. “He used to worship in this temple since his childhood. And every time he came to the village during the Durga puja, he used to worship here. His son Abhijit Mukhrejee requested us to organize the yajna,” said Rabi Chattoraj, secretary of the temple committee, who shares a very close and cordial relation with the Mukherjee family. Every year during the Durga Puja, Mujherjee visits his ancestral house at Kirnahar in Birbhum district, around 170 km north of Kolkata and performs puja at his home. The last time he came to the village was during the 2019 Durga Puja.

Devendra Patel was arrested in Damoh district, 264 kilometres east of Bhopal, along with five of his accomplices on July 25, according to police. He tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday after which he was being treated in Damoh district hospital when he escaped from the custody.Superintendent of police (SP), Damoh, Hemant Chauhan said, “An engineering graduate Devendra was the mastermind of the loots. Three days ago, he was produced before the court after completion of police remand and was sent on judicial custody by the district court. Before he was lodged in the jail, he was tested for coronavirus when the report that came on Sunday suggested that he was Covid-19 patient. He was admitted in the district hospital on the same day. Two jail guards were present at the hospital to keep an eye on him but he succeeded in dodging them and escaped from the hospital.” “Police have registered an FIR and an investigation is going on in the matter. Six teams have been formed to track down the accused,” said Chauhan. Police have also announced a reward of Rs 10,000 for anyone who will provide information about Patel. According to police, Patel formed his gang a year ago and started looting ATMs by blowing them up with explosives. Patel had learnt the technique of looting ATMs on the internet. The gang members used to reach the targeted ATM on two bikes with their faces covered. Two of them used to overpower the ATM guard and sprayed black paint on CCTV cameras installed in the ATM booth while two of them used to connect the detonator with a battery of the bike and the remaining two used to collect the cash. It usually took about 14 minutes for them to commit the robbery. Police had finally tracked down the gang after months of investigation. But now, the hunt for Patel has started all over again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/robber-with-engineering-degree-escapes-from-hospital-under-custody-after-testing-covid-19/story-9kaCx52eue5QnMZoWUnkxJ.html

In a statement issued by the outfit’s information wing, NSCN-IM said the peace process is in a state of “simmering tension” and reaching “tipping point” because of Ravi’s “vitriolic attack” on Naga issue. “The issue is now in the court of Government of India that should come out with an undertaking that Framework Agreement (signed in August 2015) is still alive in its original form and to be handled by somebody other than RN Ravi,” the statement read. The biggest and oldest of the Naga rebel outfits, NSCN-IM had been in peace talks with central government since 1997 and signed a Framework Agreement (FA) in 2015, which was to be the basis for a final deal on the long pending Naga issue. Though peace talks with NSCN-IM and other pro-talks rebel outfits (Naga National Political Groups-NNPGs) concluded In October, 2019 a formal deal to end the decades old Naga political problem is still awaited. NSCN-IM’s accusations against Ravi come at a time when another round of meetings to thrash out a final agreement is set to begin in New Delhi from next week in which senior NSCN-IM and NNPGs leaders are expected to take part. “All the hard word of 23 years of Indo-Naga political talks having passed through six successive prime ministers is coming to a nauseating end because of the mischief that keeps boiling in the hands of this interlocutor who has become more a liability than anything,” the statement said. Stating that the actions of Ravi after he was posted as Governor of Nagaland last year as casting a “huge trust deficit”, the outfit added that he (Ravi) has “set the bridge on fire and the meeting point is something unthinkable”. NSCN-IM has been upset with actions initiated against its cadres in recent months. It also took umbrage at Ravi terming Naga rebel outfits as “armed gangs” and “underground groups” in a letter to Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio in June this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nscn-im-wants-nagaland-governor-removed-as-interlocutor-for-peace-talks/story-DNT3uPGzv5bIEJkAX1a4TO.html
11-08-2020||India||DGCA chief has no technical knowledge, 2 pilots’ unions tell Hardeep Puri to remove him||Two pilots’ unions of Air India on Tuesday called for the immediate removal of DGCA Arun Kumar because his comments on news channels reveal a “total lack of technical knowledge and amateurish view of the unfortunate accident” at Kozhikode.The Indian Commercial Pilots’ Association (ICPA) and the Indian Pilots’ Guild (IPG) said in a letter to civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri that Kumar must be replaced by a suitable candidate with substantial knowledge of the aviation sector and operational experience. The two pilots’ unions took umbrage at Kumar’s language in television interviews following the crash of an Air India Express flight in Kozhikode last week.Kumar said in a television interview that the plane’s “landing was not smooth”. In another interview, he said that “two fellows are dead...and the landing it seems was not appropriate”, the ICPA and the IPG wrote in the letter to Puri. Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe (58) was the commander of the flight with 190 people on board while Captain Akhilesh Kumar (32) was the co-pilot of the aircraft that overshot the runway on landing and crashed at the Kozhikode airport on Friday night. The two pilots were among 18 casualties. “Not only was the reference to the deceased individuals by such a senior officer of the Govt. of India as “ fellows “ highly inappropriate and distasteful but completely in violation of international norms and protocols that are required to be followed by regulatory agencies,” the unions said.“The above remarks only go to reveal his total lack of technical knowledge and amateurish view of the unfortunate accident. It is an established scientific fact that so-called “smooth” touchdowns may be counterproductive in certain adverse weather conditions and may pose a significant risk to safety. Whether a landing technique is appropriate or a contributory factor to a mishap can only be ascertained after a thorough, evidence backed investigation and not by speculative, casual remarks.”The pilots called for Kumar’s removal and pointed out the “futility of routinely appointing career bureaucrats” to head the DGCA.“We, therefore, as a body of professional aviators, have lost complete faith and confidence in Mr. Arun Kumar and thus, demand that he be replaced with immediate effect. At this juncture we would also like to point out the futility of routinely appointing career bureaucrats picked from their parent cadre, as the head of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. It is a highly specialized and technical field beyond the comprehension of non-specialists. Civil Aviation requires a domain expert to understand the complexities and technicalities involved.”The unions said that appointing a non-specialist serves no purpose and only demoralises the aviation professionals in the department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-chief-has-no-technical-knowledge-2-pilots-unions-tell-hardeep-puri-to-remove-him/story-j1NMXupGzGBeChFl0iGsfI.html

11-08-2020||India||Rajasthan truce sealed, chorus for Rahul Gandhi as Congress chief picks pace||Congress leaders on Tuesday jostled to give credit to Rahul Gandhi in ending the rebellion in its Rajasthan unit that threatened the survival of its government, and urged him to once again assume the reins of the organisation. The renewed bid to persuade Rahul Gandhi to accept the responsibility came a day after Sonia Gandhi completed one year as an interim Congress president on Monday. “The entire country witnessed as to how after 30 days now the political events in Rajasthan have come to a close. This was made possible on account of the vision and the belief of Rahul Gandhi in carrying all Congress leaders together bereft of any differences of opinion,” party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said, addressing a virtual news conference. “It was due to his farsightedness and nature of carrying along everybody that we were able to resolve the differences. He was also helped by the cooperation and assistance given by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra,” he said, praising both Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot. The crisis ended soon after Pilot met Rahul Gandhi on Monday afternoon. As a way out and to assuage the sentiments of all sides, the party then decided to form a three-member committee to address the grievances of the rebel legislators, including Pilot. In the evening, Pilot and 17 other legislators supporting him met Ahmed Patel, Priyanka Gandhi and KC Venugopal to seek an assurance that the issues raised by them would be resolved amicably. Asked if Rahul Gandhi will take up the Congress president’s post now, Surjewala said not 99% but 100% of Congress leaders and workers want him to assume the responsibility once again. “Not because he is Rahul Gandhi but because he is the person who has always shown the courage and the mettle to take on the Modi government by pointing out and criticising its anti-people policies,” he added. Referring to claims that Rahul Gandhi has refused to return as the party chief, Surjewala said, “I don’t think that anyone of us has recently spoken to him on the issue. When he resigned, he resigned on moral grounds and took moral responsibility (for the 2019 Lok Sabha election loss). What will happen in the future is not for me to comment upon. I am certain that good things will happen in future.” He added the decision will be taken by Rahul Gandhi, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) and the party at an appropriate time. Senior Congress leader from Kerala, Ramesh Chennithala, also appealed to Rahul Gandhi to once again assume the party chief’s role to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “We are passing through an unprecedented crisis and Madam Sonia Gandhi has been struggling despite her health issues to rudder these tempestuous times,” Chennithala said in a letter to Rahul Gandhi. He alleged that the combine of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah had “subverted” the basic principles of democracy, resulting in the fall of Congress governments in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh. A similar attempt made in Rajasthan was, however, thwarted by Rahul Gandhi’s swift action, Chennithala said. To match the BJP’s “crooked and robustness”, he said a young and dynamic leadership is needed at the helm of affairs. He added the nation had “appreciated” the highest democratic principles shown by him and it was time that he reconsidered the decision as the crucial assembly polls to Bihar and five other states were due in nine months. “The grassroots level workers are eagerly waiting for Rahulji to take over the reins of the party. This will infuse unmatched enthusiasm among our cadres and will catapult our party towards recapturing the past glory,” Chennithala said. “Be it the pseudo-nationalism or the ‘mismanagement’ of the Covid-19 pandemic, the high handedness of enacting the CAA (citizenship law), or the total failure of diplomacy on handling the India-China border crisis, the country heard only one dissent and that was from you,” he added. Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi also lauded Rahul Gandhi and his team for ending the stalemate in Rajasthan. “Today because of the leadership of Rahul Gandhi and the efforts of Priyanka Gandhi we have managed to keep one of our own Sachin Pilot with us. This is the democratic spirit of our party where there is room for dissent and debate,” tweeted former union minister Jitin Prasada. In a related development, the party has informed the Election Commission (EC) that Sonia Gandhi will continue to hold the post till a new president is elected. As per rules, a political party has to inform the poll body about its internal elections. In its letter, the party told the EC the process of electing a new president could not be initiated due to the coronavirus and the nationwide lockdown enforced since March 25 to contain the pandemic. Soon after Sonia Gandhi’s appointment as the party’s interim chief on August 10 last year, there were assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana in October-November followed by polls in Jharkhand and Delhi and then the Covid-19 struck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-truce-sealed-chorus-for-rahul-gandhi-as-congress-chief-picks-pace/story-hQ7aamh71hmmxtIf5wqI8N.html

11-08-2020||India||Russia continues work on Kudankulam nuclear plant, training Indian pilots for manned spaceflight||Russia has continued work on key bilateral projects with India amid disruptions caused by the Covid-19 crisis, delivering important components for the Kudankulam nuclear power plant and training Indian pilots for the Gaganyaan manned space mission. Atommash, part of the mechanical engineering division of the Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation, announced on Tuesday it had begun manufacturing a set of steam generators for the fifth power unit of the Kudankulam plant. So far, Atommash has manufactured and shipped two sets of steam generators for the third and fourth units of the Kudankulam plant. Each reactor requires four generators, which are built to high safety standards and have a heat exchange surface with 11,000 stainless pipes. Russia is building the 6,000-MW project at the site in Tamil Nadu, which will have six VVER-1000 nuclear reactors, and it is in talks with India to construct six more at a new site that is yet to be identified. Two reactors at Kudankulam are currently operational and two more are being built. India signed a framework agreement with Rosatom for constructing the fifth and sixth units in 2017. Rosatom said Indian contractor Larsen & Toubro, with the technical support of Russian experts, had completed installing the dry shielding for the reactor pressure vessel of the third unit according to schedule. This shielding prevents overheating of the reinforced concrete reactor pit structure, it added. Earlier this month, the mechanical engineering division of Rosatom began shipping crucial components for the main coolant pipeline for the fourth unit at Kudankulam. This equipment, weighing almost 350 tonnes, will be transported from Petrozavodsk to St Petersburg port, from where it will be carried by a ship about 10,000 km to Kudankulam. “We have completed the supply of equipment for the four units of the nuclear power plant in India. This year, [shipment] dates were postponed due to restrictions caused by the epidemiological situation. Despite this difficult situation, the [products were] successfully shipped and all contractual obligations to the customer were fulfilled,” said senior Rosatom official Rovshan Abbasov. “In the context of the restrictions imposed in Russia and India, Rosatom State Corporation Engineering Division, the Indian customer, Russian manufacturers, [and] the port of St Petersburg have kept on working, meeting all the measures prescribed, on the construction of the second phase of Kudankulam nuclear power plant,” said Vladimir Angelov, the director of projects in India. Meanwhile, the four Indian Air Force (IAF) pilots being trained at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC) are scheduled to complete their training in the first quarter of 2021, Roscosmos, Russia’s space agency, announced recently. The contract for their training was signed in June 2019 and they began the course on February 10. The training includes a number of courses on medical and physical issues, learning Russian, and studying the configuration and systems of the Soyuz manned spacecraft. The health status of the pilots is monitored daily, and professional GCTC doctors conduct a thorough medical examination once every three months. So far, the Indian pilots have completed training for a possible abnormal descent module landing in wooded and marshy areas during winter, on the water surface, and in the steppes in summer. In June, the pilots passed training in short-term weightlessness aboard an Il-76MDK special laboratory aircraft. They will also be trained in a hyperbaric chamber to prepare for factors such as G-force, hypoxia and pressure drop during a spaceflight. “The GCTC instructors praise the effort and high motivation of the Indian cosmonauts,” Roscosmos said. Earlier this year, the Indian pilots had gone into self-isolation purely as a precautionary measure following the detection of Covid-19 cases within the Russian space agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russia-continues-work-on-kudankulam-nuclear-plant-training-indian-pilots-for-manned-spaceflight/story-6I457MHHSYKlwsUn6qpwwK.html

11-08-2020||India||JD(U) snubs LJP says alliance in Bihar is with BJP, NDA rift widens||Ahead of high stakes Bihar assembly election, NDA camp seems to be in a disarray with junior partner LJP adopting a confrontationist stance against the lead partner JD (U), much to the delight of the five -party Opposition grouping, the Grand Alliance, in the state. The widening rift between the allies was again on display with the JDU snubbing LJP-- following its national president Chirag Paswan’s assertion that his party was ready to contest on all 243 assembly seats and his demand for a common minimum programme—by saying that party’s “alliance in Bihar is only with BJP.”In a way, the JD(U) has left the burden of dealing with a sulking LJP, with the BJP. “We have perfect understanding with the BJP on all issues, be it seat-sharing, campaigning or leadership. In fact, our relationship with the BJP is more than 15 years old. But we have never contested assembly elections along with the LJP except for the Lok Sabha polls. We don’t have any alliance with the LJP in Bihar,” said JD (U)’s principal general secretary K C Tyagi, while talking to Hindustan Times.“Our experience of working with them (LJP) is zero,” he added. Tyagi’s outburst comes after LJP president Chirag Paswan had repeatedly targeted Nitish Kumar government, terming its handling of the migrants’ crisis, Corona pandemic and now floods as inept.Also Read: Bihar flood situation worsens; 75 lakh in 16 districts affectedIn a recent interview, Chirag went on to wonder what has changed in the last 15 years in Bihar. In July, he had also echoed RJD’s views on the need to defer polls in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, a principal demand of the Opposition leaders during their meeting with the Election Commission. Chirag Paswan’s father Ram Vilas Paswan has aired a similar view on Tuesday. Chirag’s questioning of law and order under Nitish has irked the chief minister who has been trying to frame his re-election campaign in terms of “vikaswad versus Laluvad”, “15 years of NDA versus 15 years of RJD” and “LED versus lantern”. On the seat-sharing issue, Tyagi said that while it was premature to say anything, as far as BJP was concerned, the two partners did not face any difficulty during the Lok Sabha polls.Also Read: In poll-bound Bihar, it is advantage Nitish Kumar“BJP’s top leaders, Amit Shah and J P Nadda have put the stamp of approval on Nitish Kumar’s leadership. Now, who is LJP to question that? They are not bigger than PM Modi, Shah or Nadda,” he charged. In fact, senior BJP leaders including Nadda and Bihar BJP in-charge Bhupendra Yadav had earlier snubbed the LJP on leadership issue in Bihar. Tyagi also questioned Chirag’s demand for a common minimum programme.“They are part of the union cabinet. Do they have a CMP there,” he asked. NDA sources said that the JD(U) and LJP have been at loggerheads over the 12 nominated MLC seats. Another bone of contention is seat sharing between the three parties since JD (U) has staked claim on no less than 120 seats and the BJP is also eyeing to contest no less than 102 seats based on its 17 Lok Sabha seats as compared to JD(U)’s 16. Each Lok Sabha constituency has at least six assembly segments with some having even seven. Based on the same formula, LJP has also claimed 42 seats, the number of seats it contested in 2015. Even though the BJP leaders including Bhupendra Yadav have been maintaining that the alliance will contest polls unitedly, the saffron brigade faces a tough task of satisfying each partner.“NDA is unquestionably a united force which will sweep the 2020 Bihar polls leaving the opposition without enough seats to claim the position of leader of opposition. The opposition Grand Alliance is creating propaganda just for the news value but they are a fragmented and a confused lot on ground without any vision for the future,” opined BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jd-u-snubs-ljp-says-alliance-in-bihar-is-with-bjp-nda-rift-widens/story-fXDqFAkiiWN9CSzPuVxDAI.html

Wide-body aircraft operations were permitted at this airport from 2019.Concerns were raised following the 2010 Air India Express crash in Mangalore that killed 158 people on board. That year, a court of enquiry report by a former Indian Air Force chief Air Marshal BN Gokhale noted that tabletop runways require extra skill and caution. The hazard of “undershooting” and “overshooting”, in particular, can lead to grave situations, the report had said.Kozhikode airport is equipped with Runway End Safety Area (RESA) as per the International Civil Aviation Organization guidelines on safety, aviation minister Hardeep Puri had said on Monday.“Engineered Material Arrestor System (EMAS) provides safety benefit if less than standard RESA length is available or at Airports where RESA cannot be provided due to constraints. Provision of EMAS is not mandatory in a civil aerodrome as per ICAO guidelines,” Puri said.“DGCA issued a directive vide letter dated 13.03.2013 on the recommendation of the Court of Inquiry (COI) Report which stated the following fact; AAI to recalculate declared distances to provide 240m (length) of RESA by reducing Landing Distance Available (LDA) appropriately at Safety Critical Airports which can be reduced if a suitably designed Aircraft Decelerating System is provided beyond minimum 90m (length) of RESA,”Puri had said that the provision of EMAS at Mangalore and Kozhikode were examined by AAI in consultation with the DGCA, following the Air India accident at Mangalore in 2010.“Tabletop runways at both these Airports are accordingly provided with RESA of 240m & 90m in compliance to DGCA directive. Further, considering the complexities of post installation maintenance & issues related with immediate replacement of product (in case of damage to EMAS) in such a critical safety area of RWY-RESA, it was then felt that the installation/provision of EMAS may not be suitable. Presently a statutory enquiry is on. Experts will further study the situation and causes and make suitable recommendations,” Puri said.The black boxes have been recovered and their data is being examined.The civil aviation ministry’s accident investigation division, Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), will conduct a detailed investigation into the crash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aviation-regulator-bans-use-of-wide-body-aircraft-at-kozhikode-airport-during-monsoon-season/story-egNU4yEcOPidCwbVQgiPHO.html
11-08-2020||India||SC to consider BSP MLAs merger with Congress in Rajasthan on Aug 13||The Supreme Court on Tuesday posted a petition challenging the merger of six Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) legislators of Rajasthan Assembly with the Congress party for August 13 after it was informed that the issue with regard to the disqualification of the six lawmakers is pending consideration in the Rajasthan High Court. The bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said, “As the High Court is hearing the matter today and the parties have assured us that they are going to argue the matter, let the matter be argued before the High Court.” The six MLAs represented by senior advocate Kapil Sibal sought permission of the bench to withdraw a transfer petition seeking transfer of the case before the HC to the apex court. The order was passed on a petition filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Madan Dilawar who challenged the September 18, 2019 merger of the six MLAs with Congress. Senior advocate Harish Salve appeared for Dilawar and told the apex court that a Division Bench of Rajasthan HC on August 6 fixed the matter for hearing by a single judge bench on August 11. But to scuttle this hearing, the six MLAs filed a transfer petition in the apex court for transferring his petition from the HC to the Supreme Court. The six MLAs - Sandeep Yadav (Tijara), Wajib Ali (Nagar), Deepchand Kheria (Kisangarh Bas), Lakhan Singh Meena (Karauli) and Rajendra Gudha (Udaipurwati) stated that the legal issues raised in Dilawar’s petition in the HC under examination of the top court in a 2015 appeal from a Gauhati High Court order in a case titled Mr. Mithou Krose v Imtilemba Sangtam. On Monday, the bench led by Justice Mishra ordered the transfer petition to be listed before the Court. Before the hearing could begin, advocate Amit Pai, the advocate-on-record who filed the petition for the MLAs, said, “I have instructions to withdraw the petition.” The Court permitted this request. Salve said, “This is exactly why we came to Court as the matter is listed today before the HC. This Court can use its extraordinary power to order transfer of the petition from HC and decide whether the Speaker’s order approving the merger on September 18, 2019 and rejecting my petition to disqualify these six MLAs on July 29, 2020 is correct in law. In the meanwhile, the order of merger passed by the Speaker should be stayed as on the date of that order no disqualification plea against the MLAs was pending.” The BSP led by senior advocate Satish Chandra Mishra pointing to the Congress said, “They have wiped out my party in the Rajasthan Assembly.”. He supported Salve and said that for the merger of the six MLAs with Congress to be recognized, past rulings of SC held that there should be a split in the party at the national level. Only then, one-third of party members can merge with any political party, he added. Mishra claimed that the party was not heard by the HC and they could not seek disqualification of their MLAs as Rules of Procedure in the Rajasthan Assembly permits this right only to a member of the Assembly. The bench, also comprising Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari Sibal told the lawyers appearing in the case, “You argue out before the High Court. In case an adjournment is sought we will hear the matter. We will list the petition (by Dilawar) on August 13.” Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan who appeared for the Speaker said that there is no malafide in the order of the Speaker as there is a complete merger of the BSP Legislature Party with the Congress. Sibal pointed out that in Goa there was a similar precedent when most Congress MLAs joined the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-consider-bsp-mlas-merger-with-congress-in-rajasthan-on-aug-13/story-v1ak9JF1obfQojkRUTFCsJ.html
11-08-2020||India||Ordnance factory unions welcome Rajnath Singh’s import embargo, seek production rights||Union defence minister Rajnath Singh’s August 9 announcement that India will no longer import 101 types of weapons and equipment to boost the Make in India programme has been welcomed by ordnance factory workers’ unions although they are all set to strike work from October. More than 80,000 civilian employees of India’s 41 ordnance factories will go on indefinite strike from October 12 in protest against the Centre’s decision to corporatise weapon and defence equipment manufacturing units run by the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) of the Union defence ministry. The announcement was made on August 4 by the three national trade unions, including the Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh (BPMS) which is affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The other two unions, the All India Defence Employees’ Federation (AIDEF) and the Indian National Defence Workers’ Federation (INDWF) are affiliated to the Communist Party of India and the Congress respectively. Although they have welcomed the import ban, BPMS and AIDEF have demanded exclusive contract for production of certain weapons at OFB plants. “We welcome the import embargo and creation of a separate budget of about Rs. 52,000 crore for domestic capital procurement in the current fiscal. However, out of these 101 items, those already being manufactured by OFB and the ones it is capable of producing should be earmarked for OFB under the provision of Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order, 2017,” Mukesh Singh, general secretary, BPMS, told HT. “OFB’s manufacturing capacity is mentioned in the fourth report of Parliamentary standing committee on defence. OFB should also be given a 10 years roll on plan. If the government withdraws its decision to corporatise OFB plants we will withdraw the strike,” Singh added. “More than 10 items in the embargo list can be straight away manufactured by OFB. But will the government give us the contract?” said C Srikumar, general secretary, AIDEF. “We feel that the government will encourage private companies to tie up with foreign arms manufacturers to bring in foreign direct investment. Complete knocked down and semi-knocked down kits may be brought from abroad, assembled with screw driver technology and tagged as Made in India. That should not happen,” added Srikumar. “Even the UPA government was keen on encouraging indigenous production. We welcome what is happening. However, we are not going back on our decision to start indefinite strike from October 12,” said R Srinivasan, general secretary, INDWF. The OFB headquarters in Kolkata said that as part of the Atma Nirbhar Week programme, three facilities were dedicated to the nation by Rajnath Singh through video conference on Monday. These are the manufacturing facility for T-90 tank sighting devices at Dehradun, the automated assembly line for production of Pinaka rockets at Chandrapur and assembly and testing facility of the 12.7mm M2 NATO standard machine gun at Tiruchirappalli. As part of the same programme, OFB chairman Hari Mohan on Tuesday presided over the announcement of new products such as the electronic point detonation fuse for 155mm artillery ammunition at the Ambernath factory, 155mm red phosphorus shell made by the Dehu Road plant and extreme cold weather clothing system developed by the Shahjahanpur factory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ordnance-factory-unions-welcome-rajnath-singh-s-import-embargo-seek-production-rights/story-9Kxa4neQK9c5fWEHNpVANM.html

This note-worthy action further cements Israel’s commitment towards assisting India in its efforts to tackle the ongoing pandemic,” a statement released on Israeli embassy’s behalf said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has regularly touched base with his Israeli counterpart since the outbreak of the pandemic, exploring areas of cooperation for the containment of the disease. Following the agreement on collaboration between the two leaders, Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs located the most advanced medical equipment that has been developed in Israel using cutting edge technologies to fight Covid-19, the statement says.Also Read: Russia names new Covid-19 vaccine ‘Sputnik V’ in reference to Cold War space raceThe most “useful products” were then collected in coordination with AIIMS and some other equipment was contributed and some purchased with special funds allocated by the Israeli government.“We are pleased to share the best medical technology solutions from Israel with the most premier medical institute of India. We are confident that these technologies will further bolster their capabilities to tackle Covid-19.” said Dr Ron Malka, Israeli ambassador to India.Indonesia kicks off third phase of Sinovac’s Covid-19 vaccine testingThe statement added that Israel’s technological cooperation with AIIMS is more than a decade old.

11-08-2020||India||Whatever little I have accomplished has years of hard work behind it, says Ravi Sah||Actor Ravi Sah, best remembered for his extraordinary characters in critically acclaimed films like ‘Paan Singh Tomar,’ ‘Life of an Outcast’ and OTT series ‘Jamtara,’ is basking in the success of his latest thriller release. “It’s an amazing feeling to have finally created a ripple with my performance. I have never compromised on scripts and screenplay. For me if I’m not able to add nuances to the characters I am being offered, I say no to such roles. You can call me selective, choosy but that’s the way I am because if I don’t get to challenge my craft so for me all my learnings are useless. The character should have a scope for me to put in that fine distinction and make it a nothing less than a perfect character,” said Ravi over the phone. The versatile actor from Purnia, Bihar calls acting a journey which he undertook after leaving everything behind. “When I decided to be an actor it was no less than accepting asceticism and devoting myself to this craft completely. Whatever little I have accomplished has years of hard work and sleepless nights behind it.” After completing bachelors in journalism, he took up a media job. “Thereafter, I joined theatre in Bhopal, MP and that’s what has majorly contributed in my career. Then I reached Film and Television Institute of India to fine tune my skills.” Talking about is impressive iniquitous character Keval in his latest release ‘Raat Akeli Hai,’ Ravi said, “For all who have seen Dhulia in ‘Paan Singh Tomar’ or that news editor from ‘Jamatra’ were in for a surprise. When I met the makers of the film I had no clue what was coming my way. When director Honey (Trehan) narrated me the script I felt it was an Indian version of Alfred Hitchcock’s film. When I heard the role of Keval which had almost no dialogues, I knew I have got what I always looked for — a full-on challenging role. As I played a proper butcher, I went to a nearby meat shop in my area to learn his mannerisms. For me, if I am not giving everything to the character it’s of no use taking up that role. Playing a brutal, fearsome yet an intense guy that to mainly through expressions, body language and attitude was an overwhelming experience,” he tells. Ravi is desperate to go back to work, “I’m dying to go back on sets now. I feel I am wasting my golden period sitting home waiting for pandemic to get over. Thankfully my film ‘Spring thunder’, based on uranium mining mafia versus tribal rehabilitation and land acquisition, where I play the lead, is ready and now I wait for its release. Also, in the pipeline is an OTT show. Let’s see when will we be able to start shooting,” he concludes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/whatever-little-i-have-accomplished-has-years-of-hard-work-behind-it-says-ravi-sah/story-ofXixrzjQ0mhbzHNAMs8tO.html
11-08-2020||India||106 locally made trainer aircraft in India’s Rs 8,700 crore buying blitz||The defence ministry on Tuesday gave its go-ahead for the purchase of military equipment worth Rs 8,722 crore, including 106 locally made basic trainer aircraft, for the Indian Air Force to provide a push to the government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (self-reliant India movement), a defence ministry spokesperson said.Basic trainers figure on the government’s negative import list that seeks to ban the import of 101 different types of weapons, systems and ammunition over the next five years. The ministry’s defence acquisition council (DAC) accorded its acceptance of necessity (AoN) for buying 106 Hindustan Turbo Trainer-40 (HTT-40) aircraft from state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) at a meeting chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh.Under India’s defence procurement rules, AoN by the council is the first step towards buying military hardware.“With HAL having successfully developed HTT-40 prototypes and certification process underway, the DAC approved procurement of 106 basic trainers to address the training requirements of the IAF,” the ministry said in a statement. The IAF is expected to order 70 trainers initially, with the remaining 36 to be bought after the operationalisation of the HTT-40 fleet in the IAF.This is the first step in a long journey ahead, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “While it’s a thumbs-up for the design and development of the HTT-40, HAL has to rise to the occasion now and produce them to a time schedule that the IAF wants. Work ethics would require a change to do that,” Bahadur said.The HTT-40 aircraft has undergone a string of elaborate tests at HAL to demonstrate that it is safe for rookie pilots and meets the IAF’s exacting standards for trainer planes. HAL could begin the production of the trainers by early next year. Rookie pilots in IAF go through a three-stage training involving the Pilatus PC-7 MkII planes, Kiran trainers and finally the Hawk advanced jet trainers before they can fly fighter jets. As the Kirans are approaching the end of their service life, some amount of Stage 2 training is being done on the PC-7.The defence ministry in July 2019 suspended business dealings with Swiss plane maker Pilatus Aircraft Limited for one year for violation of a pre-contract integrity pact in a Rs 2,900-crore contract for 75 basic trainers, and also factoring in Indian investigations against the plane maker for alleged corruption and irregularities.The contract with Pilatus included a clause for follow-on purchase of 38 more planes. The DAC - India’s apex procurement body - also cleared the purchase of an upgraded version of the super rapid gun mount (SRGM) which is fitted as the main gun onboard warships, to improve the navy’s firepower, the statement said. This weapon will be supplied by Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL). “The upgraded version of SRGM has enhanced capability to perform against fast manoeuvring targets like missiles,” the statement said.Other defence items cleared for purchase include tank ammunition – the 125 mm APFSDS (Armour Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot). It will have 70% indigenous content. The statement said some of the other approvals given by the DAC will accelerate the purchase of AK-203 assault rifles and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) upgrades.India on Sunday announced that it will ban the import of 101 defence items over the next five years, a significant step on the long road towards achieving self-reliance in the defence sector.These include artillery guns, light military transport aircraft, conventional submarines, long-range land attack cruise missiles, assault rifles, sniper rifles, short-range surface-to-air missiles, beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, corvettes, missile destroyers, light combat helicopter, light combat aircraft, a variety of radars and different types of ammunition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/106-locally-made-trainer-aircraft-in-india-s-rs-8-700-crore-buying-blitz/story-Fep2aHN3esyY0Z1aZHSY9N.html
11-08-2020||India||‘Not detained, yet not free’: Omar underlines paradox, questions government stand||National Conference leader and former chief minister of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, Omar Abdullah, has questioned the Union Territory administration for denying it had detained several regional political leaders including those from the NC and for submitting that they had freedom to move while following certain restrictions for their own safety. The administration made the claim on Tuesday before J&K High Court while replying to a bunch of habeas corpus petitions filed by NC president Farooq Abdullah and vice president Omar Abdullah seeking release of 16 party leaders.Omar responded to the claims by saying that similar claims made by the administration last month before the Supreme Court in the case of senior Congress leader Saifuddin Soz had “exposed the lies”. ‘“None of them are detained’ yet none of them are free to leave their homes. If it’s about their security, then how come the same “precautions” aren’t taken for BJP and Apni party leaders? Soz Sb exposed the lies of the administration when they took a similar line in the SC,” Omar tweeted.Also Read: My ‘innocuous dissent’ was seen as act of ‘treason’: Shah Faesal on quitting politicsEarlier on July 31, Saifuddin Soz, a five-time member of Parliament and a former Union minister, accused the administration of falsely telling the SC that he was a free man. Soz said he was in detention since August 5 after the abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories. A video showing Soz being restrained and being pulled away by security personnel while talking to journalists on the other side of the boundary wall of his Srinagar house, also went viral.Soz has also termed his detention illegal alleging he had not been served with any official order to the effect despite several requests. He has indicated that he will challenge the administration’s submissions made in the SC through his lawyers. Omar’s and his father’s petitions are seeking release of NC general secretary Ali Mohammed Sagar, provincial president Nasir Aslam Wani, senior leader Aga Syed Mehmood and party’s chief spokesman Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi among the 16 leaders allegedly being detained at their residences illegally.4G ban to be lifted from 2 J&K districts on trial basis after Aug 15: Centre tells SCThe J&K administration today told the high court that no order of detention either under preventive detention law or substantive law was issued against any of the 16 leaders named by Abdullahs and added that they were free to move with certain precautions “as deemed fit” for their security.Omar, however, did not buy the argument and asked why the restrictive security cover was being provided selectively to some leaders and not to others. He also alleged that that the recent attacks on BJP workers in the region showed that the police was failing in its primary duty.“The administration is failing in the task of providing security to political workers, evidenced by the spree of attacks against BJP workers, because the police are too busy being jailers rather than protectors. Security is NO reason to detain people in their homes,” Omar’s second tweet said.Five BJP leaders have been killed and two others critically injured in separate attacks in the valley over the past one month, while another leader escaped a grenade attack on his house in Tral in Pulwama district on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-detained-yet-not-free-omar-underlines-paradox-questions-government-stand/story-33fvJxlVmcpQMPJgywqwML.html
11-08-2020||India||In a first after border row, India and Nepal set to hold high level meeting||An India-Nepal body overseeing the implementation of development projects funded by New Delhi is set to meet in Kathmandu next week, the first high-level contact between the two sides since ties were hit by a border row that erupted last year. The joint oversight mechanism, which was launched in 2016 and reviews progress in bilateral projects, is scheduled to hold a meeting on August 17, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The meeting between Indian envoy Vinay Mohan Kwatra and Nepal’s foreign secretary Shanker Das Bairagi, who jointly chair the mechanism, is being seen by some quarters in Kathmandu as a positive development after the border row took relations to a new low. “The mechanism will only focus on the implementation of India-funded projects in Nepal. However, it could help break the logjam in relations,” said a person. A second person described the scheduled meeting of the mechanism as “part of a regular interaction between India and Nepal”. He added, “This oversight mechanism was set up in 2016 to review ongoing bilateral economic and development projects and meets on a periodic basis.” During its seventh meeting in July last year, the mechanism reviewed the implementation of projects such cross-border rail links, petroleum pipelines, roads, bridges, integrated border check posts, energy, irrigation, and post-earthquake reconstruction. The border row erupted late last year after Nepal objected to the inclusion of Kalapani region, which is claimed by Kathmandu, in a new map of the union territory of Ladakh that was issued by India. The row was exacerbated in May, when India opened a new road to Lipulekh region on the border with Tibet, as this area too is claimed by Nepal. Nepal responded by issuing a new map that showed Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura, which are all controlled by India, as part of Nepalese territory. Kathmandu also said New Delhi has not responded to several requests for talks on the border issue, though India said a meeting couldn’t be arranged because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Nepal’s foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali told The Kathmandu Post on Tuesday: “We don’t have alternatives to talks...We can’t hold our entire ties hostage to the differences over the boundary issue.” Gyawali said Nepal is confident its partnership with India will move in a positive direction. “For the time being, the boundary issues can be isolated...Differences over one issue should not overshadow our entire bilateral relations...We believe in constructive engagement, and the upcoming meeting is just one positive step towards that end,” he added. In recent weeks, the two countries have also engaged in a war of words over the origins of historic figures such as Lord Ram and Gautam Buddha. Nepal on Sunday responded to external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s remarks that Gautam Buddha was one of the two greatest Indians for people around the world by saying historical and archaeological evidence shows the founder of Buddhism was born in Nepalese territory. India clarified that Jaishankar had referred to the shared heritage of the two countries. Last month, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli sparked a controversy with his remarks that the “real” Ayodhya is in Nepal and that Lord Ram was Nepalese. He also said Nepal had “become a victim of cultural encroachment” and its history was manipulated. Following protests in India, the Nepal government clarified Oli’s remarks were “not linked to any political subject” and there was “no intention...to hurt the feeling and sentiment of anyone”. Nischal Pandey, director of the Kathmandu-based Centre for South Asian Studies, was quoted by the Nepalese media as saying: “A weekly war of words between Indian and Nepali officials and subsequent issuance of clarifications does not bode well for bilateral ties.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-after-border-row-india-and-nepal-set-to-hold-high-level-meeting/story-2s1s6Mv7dqHkFggcxPmeRO.html
11-08-2020||India||‘Don’t bask in Modi’s glory...’: Ram Madhav tells BJP leaders in Andhra Pradesh||BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav on Tuesday warned his party leaders in Andhra Pradesh not to bask in the glory of Prime Minister Narendra Modi but work with a killer instinct to grab power in the state in 2024. “Dont try to go into the battle placing the gun on Modi’s shoulders. If you do it, you will remain in that one per cent (BJP’s vote share in 2019 assembly election).“Modi will be Prime Minister for the next 10-15 years. We will derive benefit out of his good governance and people- oriented programmes but that is not sufficient. Aim is to grow as a potent force,” Madhav said. Madhav addressed an event where MLC Somu Veerraju assumed responsibilities as the new BJP state unit president. He observed that BJP was in politics “not for charity.” As any political party, it aimed to come to power and serve the people and develop the state. The national general secretary said there was a vacuum in the opposition position in AP. “We have to fill that vacuum and work with a killer instinct so that we grab power in 2024,” he exhorted. Madhav chided the party state leadership for seeking the BJP high commands intervention on every issue. “Dont call Delhi (leadership) all the time and seek action.Delhi will do whatever needs to be done but the local party should travel the hard way and fight for the people,” he said. “For long, the BJP had been a junior partner in the state, we developed that mindset.Today we have to grow into a dominant party.For that, we have to change our mindset. We have to come on to the streets and fight in a democratic way,” Madhav, who hails from the state, stressed. Noting that there was “no strong opposition voice” in AP, Madhav said the BJP should build it. “Be it TRS (in neighbouring Telangana) or YSR Congress...they would want no opposition.We are observing the YSRC governments attitude towards opposition parties. We have to confront that as well.This is not a smooth ride,” he remarked. When people in power were abusing it, BJP should be geared up to fight it, he added. He wanted the BJP in the state to be like a constructive opposition, a critical friend. Veerraju took over as the party state president from his predecessor Kanna Lakshminarayana. Former Union Minister Daggubati Purandeswari, Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan national vice-president Vishnuvardhan Reddy, BJP state in charge Sunil Deodhar, MLC P V N Madhav and other senior leaders attended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-bask-in-modi-s-glory-ram-madhav-tells-bjp-leaders-in-andhra-pradesh/story-oRd7zDI4XmQ2EpAPUVUGNN.html

He put his rebellion in cold storage after the party high command on Monday promised to look into the issues he had him against Gehlot.He was sacked as deputy chief minister and removed as Congress chief in Rajasthan last month after his differences with Gehlot came to a head.After Pilot made his peace move on Monday, Gehlot also extended an olive branch on Tuesday saying peace and brotherhood will remain in party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haven-t-demanded-any-post-says-sachin-pilot-on-his-return-to-jaipur/story-wx9QlRAuMVWSgbFlzSiIPL.html

Md Abdul Nasir, who represented Lilong assembly constituency, Oinam Lukhoi Singh (Wangoi), P Brojen (Wangjing-Tentha), Ngamthang Haokip (Saitu), Ginsuanhau (Singhat) and Okram Henry Singh (Wangkhei) are the Congress legislators to tender their resignation citing their lack of trust in the party’s state leadership. They submitted their resignations on Monday at around 12:55 pm while the assembly was still in the session, said Henry Singh. “Later, we met the Speaker at the assembly,” he said. The resignations were accepted by Speaker Singh on Tuesday. Henry Singh explained the reason behind the move. “Even though I’m born and brought up with the Congress, I’m compelled to resign as an MLA as per the wishes of the people in my constituency.” Henry Singh, who was elected for the first time as a lawmaker on a Congress ticket in 2017, said the six legislators would quit the party soon and submit their resignation to Manipur Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) chief, Moirangthem Okendro. Earlier on Monday night, lawmaker Nasir said they resigned owing to lack of trust in the leadership of the Congress legislature party (CLP). He cited the inability of the CLP to form a state government, despite having 28 MLAs in the 60-member assembly and the party’s debacle in recent Rajya Sabha polls as the primary reasons that prompted them to quit as legislators. MLA Lukhoi said that they resigned to work for the welfare of the public amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. On Monday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition government, led by Chief Minister N Biren Singh, sailed through the trust vote in a voice vote in the assembly. In the 53-member assembly, including the Speaker, 28 ruling MLAs, including the Deputy Speaker, were present in the House during the trust vote.While out of 24 Congress MLAs, only 16, headed by opposition leader and former CM O Ibobi Singh, attended Monday’s assembly session. The 60-member Manipur Assembly was reduced to a strength of 53 after four lawmakers were disqualified under the anti-defection law and three BJP MLAs had resigned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-congress-mlas-resign-from-manipur-assembly-after-bjp-led-govt-wins-trust-vote/story-vNwfesBqcFK8eTaLP65dlO.html

Of the total funding, 500,000 euros will be used in India to provide food and livelihood assistance, emergency relief supplies, and water and sanitation services to people affected by floods. EU said this year’s monsoon rains had impacted 10.9 million people in India, and amplified their vulnerabilities amid the coronavirus pandemic. The humanitarian aid worth 1.65 million euros is on top of the 1.8 million euros announced earlier this year to support families affected by a series of disasters, including cyclone Amphan, which ravaged India and Bangladesh in May. The latest floods have affected some 17.5 million people in South Asia, destroying homes and wiping out livestock and agricultural lands, and damaging vital infrastructure, EU said. One million euros will be dedicated to addressing urgent humanitarian needs in Bangladesh, where more than two million people are in need of food assistance, water, sanitation, hygiene and emergency shelter. Some 850,000 people have been displaced and the figure is expected to increase as rains continue. In Nepal, 150,000 euros will be used to address the need for water, sanitation, shelter and essential household items following the displacement of thousands of people after heavy rains trigged landslides across the country. “The monsoon rains across South Asia have been particularly devastating this year and this urgent contribution will help our humanitarian partners on the ground in providing crucial support to those who have lost their shelters, belongings and sources of livelihood,” said Taheeni Thammannagoda, who oversees EU humanitarian programmes in Asia and the Pacific. The funding is part of EU’s Acute Large Emergency Response Tool (ALERT). Measures to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus will be incorporated in all the programmes. With the onset of the annual monsoon in June, heavy and sustained rains have caused massive floods and landslides across South Asia, killing hundreds and affecting more than 17.5 million people. Poor access to clean water has increased the risk of the spread of diseases, which is especially worrying amid the Covid-19 crisis, EU said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eu-announces-aid-worth-1-65-million-euros-for-flood-victims-in-india-bangladesh-and-nepal/story-8BcdfwDMJUHZTPX3N4uPTL.html

Efforts are on to see there is no second wave of Covid-19 in the state,” the statement quoted Thackeray as saying. The chief minister said it has been observed that after recovering from COVID-19, patients contracted some other diseases, and called for setting up a mechanism to treat such individuals.He also expressed the need to conduct research into how and why different types of virus originate.Thackeray also reiterated the demand for not holding the final year examinations for students of non-professional courses to ensure their lives are not risked in view of the current situation.He made a strong pitch for declaring students as passed by giving them aggregate marks, and called for taking a decision on it at the national-level.A decision needs to be taken in the case of final year medical education students also, he added.Thackeray also said there are 3.5 lakh beds equipped with ventilators and other facilities in the state.With no Covid-19 vaccine available so far, use of masks and observing social distancing are the only ways to tackle the disease, he added.During the meeting, Modi said 80 per cent of the Covid-19 cases in the country are from these 10 states.He said the country will emerge victorious in its fight against the pandemic if the novel coronavirus is defeated in these states, the statement said.Union ministers Rajnath Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman and Harsh Vardhan took part in the meeting.Maharashtra Public Health Minister Rajesh Tope also participated in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/efforts-on-to-prevent-second-wave-of-covid-19-in-maharashtra-uddhav-thackeray/story-oJjusiBX3Yx6M5jWsOTq1N.html

The Ganga river was flowing near the danger mark in Haridwar and Rishikesh, while the Alaknanda was flowing near the danger mark in Srinagar. The Karnprayag-Badrinath national highway was blocked at many places including Maithana, Bajpur, Nirmal Palace, Chhinka, Kshetrapal, Bhanerpani, Pagalnala, Lambagad, as heavy rain triggered landslides.In Chamoli district, 32 rural motor roads were blocked till Tuesday afternoon as debris fell and the work was underway to reopen the routes.In Bairangna area of Chamoli district, a wall of the fisheries department caved in due to overnight rain leading to the death of about one quintal of fish.Three cowsheds in Sirokhoma village of Chamoli district were damaged while electricity and drinking water supply were disrupted at many places in the district. Police kiosks near the Chamoli bus station, warehouse and electrical pole of a shop were also damaged in a minor landslide on Tuesday. After continuous rain on Monday, a 50-metre stretch of the Dehradun-Mussoorie highway caved in, blocking the movement of vehicles. However, small vehicles were allowed to move on Tuesday. Work was underway to open the vital road at the earliest.Meanwhile chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat met a delegation from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on Tuesday. The delegation included NMDA member Rajendra Singh, joint secretary Ramesh Kumar and joint advisor Naval Prakash. Discussing issues of natural disasters in the Himalayan state, Rawat said that in mountainous regions like Uttarakhand, natural disasters like forest fire and landslides cause more damage. “Providing relief to remote areas is a major challenge. For this, training is being done by the state government for the relief and rescue work in the event of a disaster. This includes training like providing first aid to the injured. I request the delegation to include training such as Trauma Training (first aid) in the ‘Disaster Mitra’ training program run by NDMA,” said Rawat. He further said that most plans and guidelines made for disaster management have been made according to the plain areas. “But the nature and impact of natural calamities in the mountainous regions is different from that of the plains, so while making guidelines, plans should be included as per the mountainous regions. Most of the houses in the mountainous areas are made of mud,” he said.“According to the current guidelines, such houses are called kachcha houses, due to which the disaster affected people get very little financial help. Such houses should be classified as pucca houses in mountainous areas,” said the chief minister. Singh said that shelters are being made in various states by the NDMA along with preparing ‘Disaster Mitras’ across the country. In Uttarakhand, training is being given to people from Haridwar and US Nagar districts as part of the ‘Disaster Mitra’ initiative. “If the state government provides land, then in each district of Uttarakhand, shelters can be made to accommodate 3,000-5,000 people affected by a disaster,” said Singh. The chief minister said that such shelters will prove to be very helpful in providing relief to the disaster affected and for this, all possible assistance will be provided by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swollen-by-rain-uttarakhand-rivers-flow-near-danger-mark-badrinath-highway-closed/story-yWJPUY1wq63mlsTQNjqJrJ.html
11-08-2020||India||Poet Rahat Indori, who had tested positive for Covid-19, passes away||Noted Urdu poet Rahat Indori, who had tested positive for coronavirus, passed away at an Indore hospital on Tuesday after suffering two heart attacks, said doctors treating him. He was 70. “He suffered two heart attacks today and could not be saved. He was admitted to hospital on Sunday, after testing positive for Covid-19. He had 60% pneumonia,” said Dr Vinod Bhandari of Sri Aurobindo Hospital.Indori’s Twitter bio describes him as “Indian Poet, Painter, Bollywood Lyricist”. Before he checked himself into the hospital for treatment, the poet had tweeted about being coronavirus positive, asking people to pray for his quick recovery. He further asked people to not call up either him or his home to enquire about his health. He had said they will be getting updates through Twitter.With a 50-year career in poetry, Indori, an Urdu scholar of great repute, was one of the biggest mushaira (poetry symposiums) stars in the country and someone who fearlessly called a spade a spade.Among the poet’s most powerful lines are “Sabhi ka khoon hai shamil yahan ki mitti mein; Kisi ke baap ka Hindustan thodi hai (Everybody’s blood mingles in the soil; Hindustan does not belong solely to one)”. The lines were used on posters and banners during the anti-CAA protests, pushing him to almost cult status.Earlier this year, his poem “Bulati hai magar jane ka nahi” went viral on social media, making him a sensation among the youth. Memes using the poem’s opening lines flooded social media during Valentine’s Day.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi mourned the passing of “Indori Sahab” with a couplet.  "अब ना मैं हूँ ना बाक़ी हैं ज़माने मेरे,फिर भी मशहूर हैं शहरों में फ़साने मेरे..."अलविदा, राहत इंदौरी साहब।Historian and author Rana Safvi termed the poet’s death a “huge huge loss to a fearless voice and to the world of poetry”. In fellow poet Gulzar’s view, Indori was the soul of a mushaira. “Mushaira loot ke le gaye is a saying in Urdu. Toh Rahat saab mushairon ke lootere the (he stole the thunder at symposiums),” Gulzar told PTI. Lyricist-writer Javed Akhtar called Indori’s death “an irreparable loss” to contemporary Urdu poetry and society at large.“Like Habib Jalib, he was from the fast disappearing tribe of poets who are never short of courage to call a spade a spade,” Akhtar said.Lyricist Varun Grover called him a “rockstar of the Indian literary world” and prince of the “mushaira” tradition.Indori wrote the lyrics of several songs, including “Chori Chori Jab Nazrein Mili” from Kareeb, “Koi jaye to le aye” from Ghatak , and “Neend Churai Meri” from Ishq.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/renowned-urdu-poet-rahat-indori-who-had-tested-positive-for-covid-19-passes-away/story-ykqcg0sbbcoQqkD8wlOPcM.html
11-08-2020||India||Sachin Pilot on big Priyanka Gandhi role in Rajasthan truce deal||Underlining that his rebellion was never “anti-party” but merely a means to articulate the happenings in the state, former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot said he has no animosity or ill will against state chief minister Ashok Gehlot. On being asked how he would respond to the “nikamma” jibe by the CM, the young leader merely laughed it off at first. Then added that he was “deeply hurt by some of the language used against me”. Asked how would he greet the CM given the bitterness when he meets him on 14th, Pilot said he has nothing but kind words to offer. In a wide-ranging interview with HT’s Sunetra Choudhury, a day after a peace deal was struck with the party high command that promised to look into all his grievances, Sachin Pilot revealed the role played by party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi.Here are the edited excerpts from the interview:Q. What have the last 30 days been like for you?About 3-4 weeks ago, I was served a notice under sedition charges. As deputy chief minister and party president, I felt it was unwarranted. A lot of us were deeply hurt by that and a few of our colleagues wanted to come to Delhi to tell the party organisation not just about the one issue, but also about many things we had been contemplating for long. Once that started, a lot of other developments happened, but I think ultimately the objective of the exercise we did was to bring the grassroots feedback to the leadership. We were well within our rights to raise the issue within the party forum and from day one we said that we were raising the issue as Congressmen, as legislators. I don’t think anything we did was at all anti-party.Q. You say it wasn’t anti-party but a lot of Congress leaders who were supporting you later said that you could have done it without going incommunicado with 18MLAs.The minute we came to Delhi to air our views, the next day itself a lot of acrimonious action started in Jaipur, a lot of FIRs, police cases. A lot of our colleagues felt they would be at the end of a lot of coercive action by the police and the administration. I want to place on record that we were here in Delhi, wanting to place our views and wanting to be heard. I think the reactions that came out from Jaipur and the actions that followed, it didn’t give any confidence to the legislators that we are moving in the right direction. As far as the opposition party is concerned, trying to take advantage of what is going on, they have done some politics. We had made ourselves very clear from the beginning that there was no question of leaving the party or joining any other party. I know there was a lot of speculation and stories. I came here as deputy CM and the party thought it right to remove me from this position, which is fine. Because the CM can choose his cabinet. But I wasn’t even critical of the government, but the working style, the functioning, the governance style of the chief minister - which needed altering as we have elections three years later.Q. Let’s go back to the sequence of events on July 10. You came to alert the party and the events overtook what happened. Couldn’t you have spoken to the Gandhis then like you did yesterday?There are people in different hierarchies responsible for the communication within the party leadership in Delhi and Rajasthan. Those channels didn’t work out very well as we all know in hindsight. Because the actions were being taken very quickly in Jaipur, between the notices and court cases and suspensions, it just came to pass that we had to do what we had to do. Because if we didn’t fight and stand up for what we believed in, we wouldn’t be here today. I think at the right time everyone decided to talk and I’m very happy that the Congress president has now assured all of us that a time-bound roadmap is being evolved to redress all the issues that were raised.Q. So when you were incommunicado, what was the objective in your head?First of all, all of us were here in Delhi and were never incommunicado, we were talking to people, we were moving around. I met a lot of colleagues and it was not as if anyone was bound anywhere. But yes, some of my colleagues felt apprehensive of the police. That’s why all this lockjam came about. The kinds of things that were said while we were here making our grievances heard, it wasn’t charitable, to say the least.Q. When your former boss was saying that you are nothing but a good looking face, that your qualifications were just that you spoke English and otherwise you were “nikamma”, “nakkara”, at that time did you think of an option? That maybe you need to look at another party?No, no, not for a moment. But I have to admit when I heard some of the language used against me, it did deeply hurt me. I felt I was wronged and aggrieved and then to hear the things that I heard. To say the least, it wasn’t charitable. And was unparliamentary, of course. But two wrongs don’t make a right, I’m not going to retort in the same tone and tenor. It’s unbecoming of people in public life to take the level of discourse to a point where people think it’s unbecoming. I chose not to respond. There’s no place for name-calling, it has to be issue based. Even the harshest critic wouldn’t have used some of the language that was used. I swallowed that bitter pill and it was the best thing to do at the time.Q. But they say that they have evidence that the BJP was in touch with you. What would you say about that?I have heard this for a long time but it’s very easy to make allegations. Our actions, our words are commitment are unwavering but it suits some people’s objectives to plant stories, to see a narrative where none exists.Q. But throughout this time the Congress said that their door was open so what made you talk to them on Monday and not before?How is it possible? I know that everyone was saying but actions were totally opposite. That doesn’t seem to be in harmony. A lot of our colleagues who were ministers were now police suspects. Those actions were also a major aspect of what went on in the past few weeks.Q. Would you care to share the role Priyanka Gandhi Vadra played in the entire episode, she was in touch with you throughout?She did come last night when all the MLAs were there and she had a long detailed discussion with every single one of them. We appreciated her taking time out and as a general secretary of the party, she’s played a role. I met Rahulji and Priyanka Gandhi yesterday in Mr Gandhi’s house and as then party president, it was Rahul Gandhi who said to me that I should work as deputy CM as we left the choice of CM to the party president. He chose Mr Gehlot as chief minister and he did lean on me to become as deputy and continue as party president. But in the last 18 months what has transpired, it was important to say those things. I had to share, because it was important for the party to know. Sadly, it went on for too long.Q. Can you elaborate what went on?I don’t think I should in the media. Whatever I had to say, I told the party leadership and they’ve formed a committee. That committee will take a decision in a time-bound fashion on our grievances - broadly governance, leadership issues, participation, space to workers and MLAs.Q. The CM said in the 18 months since the Rajasthan government was formed, he’s never spoken with you. Is that true?I didn’t say that, the CM has said that. But it gives you an insight of what was happening there. When I was party president for five years, I didn’t seem to have those disqualifications and negativities attached to me. Just in the 18 months, they have come to the fore. Bringing a party back to power when we were 21 MLAs and elections were lost when Ashokji was CM. At that time, Rahul Gandhiji asked me to be deputy CM and he showed faith in me. Even though I was younger than the other leaders, it was my responsibility to take everyone along. There were differences even then but as head of the family, I left no stone unturned to carry everyone under one umbrella. I think the same course for the head of the government. If someone has a grievance, you have to resolve that. You can’t sort of do the things that have happened in the recent past. When he says we haven’t spoken, it sums it up for you but I have never shown any disrespect to CM Ashok Gehlot. He is much older than I am in age and I have regards for him as a person. But I am well within my rights to point out things in terms of governance.Q. But for those who say it was CM Gehlot who held the numbers and Sachin Pilot couldn’t get the numbers together?It was never a competition about who’s got more. Whoever the party makes CM, will have the majority. The number of MLAs and leaders who had things to say were depending on me to be their voice. I did that. Ashok Gehlot was made CM by the party and I accepted that decision when I became deputy CM. But the events of that 18 months carry some meaning and that’s what I wanted to convey.Q. Was it too much of a price that you paid? Thirty days later, you are no longer the deputy CM or PCC chief? Do you regret it?If you are taking a position just to have a house and a car, I don’t think it’s worth anyone’s time as a political person. You are there to do a job, to do governance, to deliver development, and if you don’t have the space and the resources and the authority to do that, then mere positions don’t matter. I have said that whatever the party wants me to do, I am happy to do it, I have done it for more than 20 years and leadership can decide what my role can or cannot be.Q. What will you tell the CM when you meet him on the 14th?I have nothing but kind words to offer to him and warmth at a personal level. Professionally, our objectives should remain the same which is to deliver to the expectations of the people of Rajasthan. I have no animosity, no ill-will, no negative sentiment towards him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-pilot-on-big-priyanka-gandhi-role-in-rajasthan-truce-deal/story-dK1AUDsRgsPsX4rbeEL69M.html
11-08-2020||India||‘No formal inquiry into Galwan Valley clash’: Government denies report||The government of India has rejected reports that the Indian Army had conducted a formal inquiry into the June 15 clashes with Chinese soldiers at Galwan Valley and a report following the probe had been submitted. A denial issued by the government’s press information bureau on Tuesday afternoon categorically stated that “no no such inquiry has been conducted or ordered by the Indian Army”.20 Indian soldiers had died along with an unknown number of casualties in the People’s Liberation of Army (PLA) when Indian soldiers’ objections to Chinese attempts to erect a structure on the Indian side of the disputed Line of Actual Control resulted in an attack by their Chinese counterparts in the eastern Ladakh sector. Earlier today, there were reports that “a formal Court of Inquiry (CoI) had been conducted by senior officers headed by 15 Corp Commander, Lt. Gen BS Raju, “into the standoff at Galwan, orders that preceded the incident and as well as actions taken by troops after they came under attack by the PLA while verifying the disengagement process”. Claim: Economic Times says the #Army has conducted a formal inquiry into the Galwan valley clash on June 15 and a report has been submitted#PIBFactCheck: no such inquiry has been conducted or ordered by #IndianArmy@adgpi pic.twitter.com/9cpUGVNOZ8The report further claimed that further action is now awaited after the submission of the report. It also quoted sources to say that the inquiry was “necessary” to evaluate if standing operating orders need to be “modified” to prevent a repeat of the incident.Also Read: Maintaining peace with India a diplomatic priority, says China amid Ladakh border tensionFollowing the clash, which involved use of rudimentary weapons such as wired clubs and stones due to an existing agreement between the two countries banning the use of firearms by patrolling troops, it was reported that the government had given the armed forces complete operational freedom to defend the country’s territorial integrity.Since the bloody conflict on June 15, India and China have engaged in several rounds of diplomatic and military talks for disengagement and de-escalation of troops from the confrontation areas, however, China continues to drag its feet in vacating some strategic areas India considers part of its own territory. Considering China’s reluctance, top Indian military brass has told a Parliamentary panel that the forces were ready for a long haul with deployment in forward areas of the LAC during harsh winter months to not counter Chinese aggression.Also Read: Ban on China imports: Possible spike in dumping a concernChief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat led armed forces leadership has said that the de-escalation between the two sides may take a longer time but the Indian side was ready for any eventuality and have made arrangements for it in the Ladakh sector, officials have said.The Chinese have brought in more than 40,000 troops and have been maintaining that strength since April-May timeframe.India is also well-prepared and has asked China to disengage from friction points and Depsang Plains and has built up heavily to counter any further Chinese misadventure there.The officials said that the Indian Army has moved in around two additional divisions in the Ladakh sector where already two formations are deployed for guarding against both Pakistan and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-formal-inquiry-into-galwan-valley-clash-government-denies-newspaper-report/story-n5WyGfSoIwLjDPn64oiFkP.html
11-08-2020||India||Indian-origin man jailed in Singapore for molesting woman jogger||A 60-year-old Indian-origin man in Singapore was jailed for four years and three months on Tuesday for molesting a woman jogger, according to a media report. Delivery driver Kannan Sukumaran was watching a pornographic video inside the van at about 7.30 pm on May 12 this year when he spotted the victim -- a 36-year-old woman -- jogging alone along the pavement. “The accused was further aroused by the sight of the victim, and he decided to approach her,” Deputy Public Prosecutor Kor Zhen Hong was quoted as saying by Channel News Asia. He groped the woman and tried to push her towards nearby bushes beside the pavement, but the woman resisted. In the course of the struggle, Sukumaran punched the woman once on her chest. She fell and cut her left elbow. She tried to kick Sukumaran away and began shouting for help, court documents said. Another jogger, a 39-year-old woman, heard the victim’s shouts for help and approached her. When Sukumaran saw that passers-by were responding to the victim, he ran to his van and drove off. A second jogger noted the van’s registration number and called the police. Paramedics attended to the victim but she did not want to be taken to the hospital. Sukumaran was later arrested at his home. On one charge of aggravated outrage of modesty, Sukumaran was sentenced to four years and three months’ jail, the channel reported. The prosecutor asked for four-and-a-half years’ jail. The prosecutor asked for jail time in lieu of caning, noting that Kannan would have known before committing the offence that he would be exempted from caning due to his age. For aggravated outrage of modesty, he could have been jailed between two years and 10 years. He was not caned as he is above 50 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-origin-man-jailed-in-singapore-for-molesting-woman-jogger/story-c3MbushrP7guvGvW5y0JGJ.html

11-08-2020||India||Telangana, Andhra CMs urge PM Modi to help states boost medical infrastructure for pandemics||The Telugu states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh on Tuesday appealed to the Centre to take measures for strengthening of medical infrastructure to tackle pandemics like Covid-19 and provide cost-effective treatment to the people. Expressing his views during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s video conference with various chief ministers, Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said the Covid-19 experience had taught the country a lesson about the urgent need to step up the medical facilities for a better future with a visionary approach. “Strategic planning should be done to create comprehensive medical facilities in the country with a joint strategy by both the state and central governments. A comprehensive study has to be made in consultation with institutions like Indian Medical Association on what an ideal doctor-people ratio was and how many medical colleges the country required,” Rao said. Stating that the country had never experienced any Corona-like situation in the past, the Telangana chief minister said there was uncertainty as to how long this pandemic would last. “While dealing with the present situation, we should focus on how we are going to deal with such a situation in the future. There is every possibility that a Corona like virus may come up again in future. Hence, we have to take measures now to face any eventuality in the future,” he said. Explaining the measures taken by the state government, the chief minister said, “We have taken all the measures to contain Coronavirus. The recovery rate in the State is 71% while the death rate is 0.7%. We have increased the number of tests many folds. We have kept ready an adequate number of beds, medicines, staff and other equipment,” KCR said. Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, too, urged the Centre to extend cooperation to the states to enhance the medical infrastructure to treat epidemics like Covid-19. “Andhra Pradesh is a newly formed state. We don’t have tier-1 cities like Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai and so, there is no largescale medical infrastructure like in our neighbouring states. That is why we need massive assistance from the Centre to improve our medical facilities to a considerable extent,” Jagan said. He reminded that Andhra Pradesh had begun with zero virology testing facility for Covid-19 in March and had now established testing labs in all the 13 districts. “There are 37,189 beds, including 11,000 oxygen-equipped, available in 138 public and private hospitals to treat the Covid-19 persons. Apart from these, there are 109 Covid care centres with a capacity to accommodate 56,000 people,” he said. Jagan claimed that Andhra Pradesh had been conducting 47,459 Covid-19 tears for every 10 lakhs population. The death rate in the state was only 0.89. More than 25 lakh tests were conducted in the 140 days since the first Coronavirus case was reported in the state on March 22. The state is reporting between 9,000 and 10,000 positive cases every day because of the large number of tests conducted, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-andhra-cms-urge-pm-modi-to-help-states-boost-medical-infrastructure-for-pandemics/story-U5M0izuSMWGOo6i8RTABlJ.html
11-08-2020||India||‘If these 10 states beat Covid, India can win’: PM Modi to chief ministers||India’s victory against the Covid-19 pandemic now depends on the performance of 10 states that account for 80% of active cases, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a group of chief ministers during a virtual meeting on Tuesday. With more than 22.68 lakh crore cases in India till Monday, Modi gave the examples of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to underline how the situation can be improved. He emphasised the need for greater cooperation between states and the Centre for more effective Covid-19 management. He also said the government’s efforts are showing results. Nitish Kumar (Bihar), Yogi Adityanath (UP), Mamata Banerjee (West Bengal), Tamil Nadu’s EK Palaniswami, K Chandrasekhar Rao of Telangana, Maharashtra’s Uddhav Thackeray, Amarinder Singh of Punjab and Gujarat’s Vijay Rupani were the chief ministers who attended the meeting. Defence minister Rajnath Singh too joined the meeting. “In some districts of Delhi, Haryana and UP, Covid-19 had posed a major problem at some stage. Then we had a review meeting and an expert committee chaired by home minister Amit Shah was constituted. As a result, we were able to achieve almost everything that we wanted to,” Modi told the chief ministers. In Delhi, Shah’s panel stepped up testing and sero-surveillance, redefined containment zones, and took several other measures to improve the situation. While Modi underlined that containment, contact tracing and surveillance hold the key in the battle against the Coronavirus, he said that once infected persons are detected, there is an urgent need to diagnose people who may have been infected by them within the next 72 hours. Modi hailed the effort of states and maintained that they can play an important role in the country’s battle against Covid-19. He pointed out that the average fatality rate, or death rate for Covid-19 patients is continuously going down while the rate of recovery is increasing with each passing day, adding that the government’s efforts are showing results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-these-10-states-beat-covid-india-can-win-pm-tells-chief-ministers/story-j7cIEh88ItI5bZDhlyOYEJ.html
11-08-2020||India||Environment ministry says 17 lakh comments on draft EIA notification||New Delhi: The union environment ministry has received nearly 17 lakh objections, comments and suggestions to the draft environment impact assessment (EIA) notification of 2020 till Tuesday, including some repetitive emails. Tuesday was the last date for submitting objections and suggestions to the contentious draft regulation, according to a Delhi high court order. The ministry’s EIA division has been tasked with studying the issues raised by people in their submissions and coming out with a final notification. The notification is also being considered in the Delhi high court. “It will take us some time to consider the issues raised by these comments and suggestions. Letters have gone to the minister (Prakash Javadekar), many have come to me and to other officials. Many of them are repetitive,” said environment secretary RP Gupta. The environment ministry has also held meetings and discussions with several EIA consultants, industry bodies and companies, whose comments are being considered separately.A total of 100 environmental groups, organisations and individuals, who are part of a national campaign to oppose the draft EIA notification, have over the last week addressed emails to 785 Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs from 28 states and eight union territories, they said in a statement on Tuesday.“We are calling upon them to take a stand against the anti-environment and anti-people draft EIA notification 2020 and demand its immediate withdrawal. As elected political representatives, these ministers are duty bound to protect the interests of the people and the nation and its resources, which this draft legislation is bound to adversely impact. We have called upon the ministers to write to the Ministry of Environment Forest & Climate Change (MoEFCC) to demand withdrawal of the draft EIA notification 2020 and demand instead that strong environmental governance be put in place in consultation with the people, for protecting the ecology and natural resources of our country for present and future generations,” they said.“On March 18, the environment ministry made an amendment to Clause 5 (3) d of the environment protection rules, which gives the ministry 725 days to finalise the draft notification from the date it was first issued. In 2006, this was 365 days and was amended to 545 in 2017. Given the number of reactions the ministry has received and the demand for a more democratic process, it will be important for the ministry to reconsider the issuance of a final notification based on this draft. The comments can be used to set up a revised process which can be built on the comments received and to reach out to places where the news of the current amendments are yet to reach,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research. The draft has become an issue of political debate. On Sunday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the draft EIA notification is “not only disgraceful, it is dangerous.” The hashtags #IndiaNotForSale and #LootoftheNation were trending on Twitter, with people drawing attention to concerns with the draft notification and demanding its withdrawal. “Not only does it have the potential to reverse many of the hard-fought gains that have been won over the years in the battle to protect our environment, it could potentially unleash widespread environmental destruction and mayhem across India,” Gandhi wrote in a lengthy post on a social media platform.“Campaigning against a draft which is not a final notification yet is unnecessary and premature,” Union environment minister Javadekar told journalists in an audio message.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/environment-ministry-says-17-lakh-comments-on-draft-eia-notification/story-hIZhPzTM185fplOCeAAjGI.html

Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said on Saturday that 149 people have been admitted to hospitals, 23 have been discharged, while three are critically injured in the B737 plane crash.

Satyanand Prasad was sleeping on the ground floor when more than half a dozen masked robbers entered his house at Dobhra-Par locality in Nawada.Police said the robbers tied Satyanand to the cot on which he was sleeping and stuffed a piece of cloth in his mouth. The robbers then hit him with pistol butts and blunt objects on head leaving him bleeding profusely.The miscreants then entered another room and started searching for valuables. The noise woke up Satyanand’s minor son Roshan. The robbers then attacked the boy and slit his throat, killing him on the spot. Roshan was a ninth standard student of a school in Rajgir in Nalanda district. Police said the robbers locked Prasad’s wife and daughter in another room and looted cash and valuables worth Rs 10 lakh before fleeing. Soon after the incident came to light, senior police officers, including Nawada’s superintendent of police Hariprasath S rushed to the spot. Police recovered a sharp edge weapon from the room of Roshan which was allegedly used used in the crime. Police suspect that the robbers gained entry to one of the rooms through a window adjoining the roof by cutting open the grille. Police also suspect that the robbery was pre-planned and was committed by professional dacoits, who might have killed the teenager after he resisted their bid to loot or identified the gang members. “Satyanand has been shifted to PMCH for better treatment. FSL and dog squad were pressed into service while CCTVs are being scanned by the experts,” Hariprasath said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trader-s-son-killed-during-violent-robbery-in-bihar-s-nawada/story-87BBfSqQSTcUoEyGiOf0gO.html
11-08-2020||India||Three Independent MLAs make peace with Ashok Gehlot government||The three Independent lawmakers with whom the ruling Congress had temporarily snapped its ties following allegations of horse-trading on Tuesday met Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday. The Independent legislators, Om Prakash Hudla, Khushveer Singh and Suresh Tak, were missing in action amid the bitter internal power tussle between sacked deputy CM Sachin Pilot, who enjoyed the backing 18 Congress lawmakers, and the Gehlot government. Their absence had also fuelled speculations about their alleged role in horse-trading to topple the Congress government. “We are and will remain with Gehlot. There was a misunderstanding, which has been sorted,” said Tak after meeting with CM Gehlot. He explained the reason behind playing truant. “I was in Delhi and was waiting for the truth to emerge. We were nowhere involved in the alleged horse-trading,” he said, “We were upset, but not anymore. We had extended support to the Gehlot government during the Rajya Sabha polls without any pre-condition. Horse-trading is a cock-and-bull story, as we were away. We were hurt that the CM didn’t trust us. Besides, a case was lodged against us,” said Tak, who represents the Kishangarh seat in the Rajasthan Assembly. Khushveer Singh, a member of the Rajasthan legislative assembly (MLA) from Marwar Junction (Pali) constituency, too, reposed his faith in Gehlot. “It is a coincidence that I had met CM Gehlot and left for Gujarat to undergo treatment. My doctor had twice suspected that I could be suffering from cancer. I was unwell, which was known to the people in my constituency,” he said. He claimed that he is innocent and has not been “in contact with anyone”. “The law will take its own course, as the case was filed by the Special Operations Group (SOG) of Rajasthan Police and the Anti-corruption Bureau (ACB). I have full faith in the law. If I am guilty, then I must be punished. Besides, I have always supported CM Gehlot,” he added. Om Prakash Hudla, an MLA from Mahua constituency, too, echoed the other two Independent lawmakers. “A case was lodged against us, which the state government has since withdrawn. This led to tension. We are happy that the government has withdrawn the case. All misunderstandings were cleared today. We are keen to develop our constituencies and we discussed those issues with the CM,” Hudla said. The meeting was held ahead of the upcoming assembly session, which is slated to start from Friday (August 14).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-three-independent-mlas-make-peace-with-gehlot-government/story-791LmbNAKNOQt10NZgV0bN.html

Some 85,000 will be fired and later on more need to be fired,’ he was seen saying in the video.The opposition Congress criticised Hegde’s remarks, saying the comments only showed his own worth. The party also said that the Centre was out to privatise everything and this indicated its inability to govern.Hegde has been known to make controversial statements in the past as well.Earlier this year, he said that the freedom movement led by Mahatma Gandhi was a “drama”, drawing severe criticism from the opposition parties including the Congress which even asked Prime Minister Modi to make his stand clear on Hegde’s remarks. The former minister,however, later sought to down play the controversy, saying he never made any reference to any political party or Mahatma Gandhi and was just trying to “categorise freedom struggle”.In January 2019, Hegde had called Congress leader Dinesh Gundu Rao as someone who “went after a Muslim lady”, an indirect reference to Rao’s wife Tabassum. A few days later, he was reported to have described then Congress president Rahul Gandhi a “hybrid specimen” who, the BJP leader claimed, had a father who is a Muslim and a mother who is a Christian. Later the same year, he labelled a former IAS officer as a traitor and asked him to go to Pakistan.In 2018, Hegde had declared that the Constitution would be amended to remove the word ‘secular’ from the preamble, though later he apologised for the comment, saying it had been ‘twisted’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsnl-s-85-000-employees-traitors-should-be-fired-bjp-lawmaker-anantkumar-hegde/story-I9dSizHbrc4x3UY2eUz7fM.html

Ajay Yadav, Raipur’s superintendent of police, said the accused was arrested after a case was lodged by her parents.“The accused, Arshad Rahmani (27), who was a teacher at a madarsa (an educational institution), used to visit the victim’s house to teach Arabic to her younger sister. On Sunday, the accused allegedly sexually assaulted her and fled away,” Mamta Sharma Ali, Khamardih police station house officer, told reporters. “We have registered a case under Indian Penal Code Sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) and relevant provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and arrested the accused on Monday,” Ali said. They are investigating the case, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-tutor-arrested-for-raping-9-year-old-girl/story-1s4a7t3Ql28L7AuxgN0YOP.html
11-08-2020||India||My ‘innocuous dissent’ was seen as act of ‘treason’: Shah Faesal on quitting politics||Shah Faesal, the first resident of Jammu and Kashmir who topped the civil services exam in 2009, on Tuesday said his decision to join politics last year had done more harm than benefit as his “innocuous act” of dissent was seen as an “act of treason”.A day after announcing that he was quitting politics, the 37-year-old defended his decision saying “we evolve with time” and abrogation of the special status on August 5 last year brought forth a new political reality in Kashmir.Faesal had brought glory to the erstwhile state by standing first in the civil services exam and was seen as a role model for youths. He, however, resigned from the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) in January last year.“While in detention I thought a lot about it. And I realised that I am not the person who can promise to people that I can undo these decisions,” Faesal, who was released after being kept under preventive detention and later booked under the draconian Public Safety Act (PSA), told PTI from Srinagar.Faesal said he was clear that the 1949 national consensus kept Article 370 in the Constitution and the 2019 consensus abrogated it.“I told myself that I can’t do politics by selling false dreams of undoing these decisions and it’s better to quit and tell the truth to the people,” he said in written replies.The doctor-turned-bureaucrat’s political career ended suddenly with the Jammu and Kashmir People’s Movement (JKPM), a party launched by him in February last year, announcing on Monday that he had stepped aside from its leadership and quit politics. The party’s vice-president Feroze Peerzada was nominated as its interim president till formal elections can be held for the post.About his decision of forming a political party, Faesal said he wanted to revive democratic politics in Jammu and Kashmir.“But soon after quitting (IAS), I realised that my innocuous act of dissent was being seen as an act of treason. It had done more harm than the benefit,” he said, adding that his act had discouraged a lot of civil services aspirants and his colleagues felt betrayed by him. “It upset me a lot,” Faesal said.Unsure about what the future has in store for him, Faesal said he always dreamt of a peaceful Jammu and Kashmir where there are best opportunities for education, health and employment.“But I don’t know how that is going to happen now. As of now, I am not sure about my next steps in life,” he said.Faesal had resigned from IAS before joining politics but his resignation has not yet been accepted, pending disposal of a show cause notice given to him by the government in 2018 for his controversial tweets. His name still figures in the list of ‘serving’ IAS officers on the official website of the Department of Personnel.His decision to quit politics has prompted speculation that he may want to go back to government service if permitted.The officials in the Home and Personnel ministry had said Fesal needs to first submit his explanation on the charges levelled against him after which the decision of accepting or rejecting his resignation would be taken. Asked whether he was keen on re-joining the service, Faesal said, “It is a prerogative of the government... I have always said that I want to work within the system. Let’s see what is in store for me... fingers crossed.” Faesal, a 2010 batch officer, was critical of the scrapping of Article 370 of the Constitution on August 5 last year and was arrested from Delhi airport days later while he was boarding a flight to Turkey. He was subsequently taken into preventive detention and later booked under the draconian PSA, from which he was released in June.

The SHO was, subsequently, fined Rs 500, officials said.“Wearing a face mask protects a person, his family members and the public (from the disease). If our officials do not adhere to these basic points, then what message we are going to give to the society,” Mishra said on Tuesday. “Through this challan, we have tried to send a message to all police officials and personnel in the district that they are not above the public. If we commit any fault, then we should also come within the ambit of the same law,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop-issuing-challans-for-not-wearing-masks-fined-as-he-himself-was-without-one/story-8foRL7Bh17pVOjr6xipdQO.html

On its, part, the Bihar government defended a parallel probe by the state police alleging that Maharashtra police have “not co-operated” with Bihar police in the case, according to PTI.Earlier Rhea’s counsel, senior advocate Shyam Divan had pointed out to the bench of Justice Hrishikesh Roy that there was considerable delay of over 38 days in lodging of the FIR at Patna.Watch: Sushant Singh Rajput death case: Six mysteries that CBI needs to solveDivan added that all allegations made by Rajput’s father to police in Patna were related to Mumbai, where Sushant and Rhea lived. He also argued that the Mumbai Police had recorded statements of 56 persons in the case and the probe had made substantial progress while questioning the parallel probe by Bihar police.The FIR registered in Patna accuses Rhea of illegal confinement, embezzlement, abetment to suicide among other charges and the probe in the case has now been transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation.Rhea had earlier expressed apprehension that she had been proclaimed guilty in an alleged media trial and denied allegations that she had diverted any money belonging to Sushant, with whom she had a live-in relationship.Also Read: Sooraj Pancholi files police complaint against those linking him to Sushant Singh Rajput, Disha Salian deaths Sushant’s family has however argued that they were forced to request for a probe by Bihar police in the case due to an alleged cover-up by the Mumbai police, which had not registered an FIR even more than a month after the actor’s death. They have now told CBI to add the charge of murder to the FIR registered by the agency after taking over the probe from Patna police. The hearing in the case is going on, on August 5, the top court had said that the truth behind the “unfortunate” death of the “gifted and talented artist” should come out.Bihar and Maharashtra government have also been made party to the case which has become a political flashpoint between the two states that have traded barbs accusing each other.The 34-year-old Bollywood actor was found dead in his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rhea-alleges-state-interference-bias-among-reasons-to-transfer-sushant-case-to-mumbai/story-HxIHBJISj5V48eVQOcOe2H.html

11-08-2020||India||Arrival of leopard cubs gives boost to Nagpur rescue centre’s animal adoption policy||The Gorewada rescue centre in Nagpur, Maharashtra, updated its animal adoption policy on Monday after the arrival of four abandoned leopard cubs in July. The adoption of these captive animals will help them live in national parks and reserves because the Maharashtra government will continue to own them. However, all their expenses, including upkeep, will be borne by those who will adopt them for a month or a year. There is an option to renew the adoption clause. However, the adoptive person will not have any say regarding the animal’s diet, medicines, its size of cage, etc. Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), Borivali, had introduced a similar adoption scheme in 2014.So far, 20 animals have been adopted under this scheme at a total cost of Rs 16.6 lakh annually.Some of the high-profile adoptive individuals are Maharashtra environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray and his brother Tejas, Union minister Ramdas Athawale, actress Raveena Tandon, and former cricketer Sandeep Patil, among others. A forest department official said a similar initiative would be implemented in other state-run rescue centres in a bid to boost conservation. “Talks are on to implement the scheme at Melghat Tiger Reserve for elephant adoption and at the Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre in Junnar,” the official said. The Central Zoo Authority (CZA) had approved the scheme in 2013, as a viable option to provide financial assistance to rescue centres and zoological parks in the country and create more awareness among the public for the conservation of captive animals. Launched in October 2017 at Gorewada, the scheme had led to a one-year adoption of the only male tiger, Sahebrao, who had lost his paw during a poaching incident and brought to the rescue centre for treatment. Other animals were adopted for a maximum of one month. “There have been no takers for this scheme until recently, when four abandoned leopard cubs were brought to the rescue centre on July 16,” said Nandkishore Kale, divisional manager, Gorewada project. The state forest department’s longest-ever reunion attempt for these cubs with their mother over 16 days failed at Akola, forcing the authorities to relocate them to the Gorewada rescue centre. “We were flooded with calls about their upkeep and whether they would survive. We decided to include them in our adoption scheme with an annual cost for upkeep of Rs 50,000 for each cub,” said Kale. Soon, three of the four cubs, including a male and two females, were adopted on August 4 by two wildlife enthusiasts, Dr. Roshan Bhivapurkar and Ayushi Deshmukh, and also a private firm, AR Construction. “This gave us the impetus to further improvise the scheme,” Kale added. At present, nine tigers are up for adoption at Rs 30,000 per month and Rs 3.5 lakh for an annual package for each animal. The corresponding rate for 23 leopards is Rs 13,000 for a month for each animal and Rs 1.5 lakh annually. A two-month-old male leopard can be adopted for Rs 50,000 a year. While 10 sloth bears, including adults, are at Rs 75,000 per month for each animal and Rs 2 lakh annually. So far at SGNP, 12 leopards have been adopted at a cost of Rs. 1.2 lakh each annually; three rusty-spotted cats at Rs. 50,000 a year each; three spotted deer at Rs10,000 each a year; one Nilgai (blue bull) at Rs. 30,000 a year; and one four-horned antelope (chousingha) at Rs 10,000 a year. At present, the park has five leopards, five tigers (Rs 3.1 lakh per tiger per year), and three lions (Rs 3 lakh per lion per year) up for adoption. “We appeal to wildlife lovers to come forward and adopt the remaining animals for their upkeep,” said Vijay Barabde, superintendent of safaris and range forest officer, SGNP. Experts said that the fund allocation towards the conservation of captive animals was insufficient. “Raising money through such innovative schemes for captive animals is welcome, but at the moment these rescue centres were meeting expenses for only food and a few essential things. Their healthcare is rudimentary at best,” said Kishor Rithe, a member of the State Board of Wildlife (SBWL) and also a part of the governing council of the Maharashtra Zoo Authority (MZA). CZA norms stipulate that there should be enough wildlife veterinarians in proportion to the number of animals and adequate space for captive cages. “But these centres cannot afford to recruit an adequate number of wildlife veterinarians and are also struggling to get the required space,” said Rithe. Sceptics said the scheme is a spectacle and has a misplaced notion of conservation. “These schemes have become a status symbol and photo opportunities for those adopting these animals rather than allocating funds for conservation. More focus is needed to spend time and understand requirements for each animal adopted rather than paying and leaving responsibilities with the department, which this scheme lacks,” said Krishna Tiwari, the founder of Forest and Wildlife Conservation Society, which was set up in 2012 in a bid to promote sustainable and equitable development. Terms and conditions to adopt animals at rescue centres in Maharashtra · One animal can be adopted for a year · The amount paid towards adoption will be non-refundable and interested persons or company should pay it through a demand draft· Maharashtra government will own the animal· The adoptive person’s name will be displayed outside the adoptee animal’s cage· The adoptive person will be allowed to visit the animal once a week · The adoptive person will not be allowed to put any conditions regarding the animal’s diet, medicines, size of cages, etc. · The person will be provided with an adoption certificate on completion of the adoption term(Source: SGNP, Borivali & Gorewada rescue centre, Nagpur)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arrival-of-leopard-cubs-gives-boost-to-nagpur-rescue-centre-s-animal-adoption-policy/story-PzBiGWLIhUdu3xH5KgBPTO.html
11-08-2020||India||In Bengal, women fight back online abuse in wake of Sushant Rajput death||Actor Rhea Chakraborty, who is being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case, moved the Supreme Court on Monday over “unfair media trial”, while far away in West Bengal there were strong reactions to thousands of hateful social media posts from various parts of the country against Bengali women in general. The posts started appearing around 10 days ago and many prominent women and citizens in Bengal are countering the trend. They have been joined by women leaders of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“We condemn this. Whether Rhea Chakraborty had anything to do with the death is a subject of probe. How can all Bengali women be treated like this on social media,” Mausam Benazir Noor, TMC Rajya Sabha member and vice-chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Women, told HT. “The Centre must take action to stop these posts,” added Noor, who is also a lawyer. The Bengal unit of the BJP reacted sharply as well.“When it comes to serving mankind people remember the name of Asia’s first woman doctor Kadambini Devi. People pay homage to legendary freedom fighters such as Matangini Hazra. We cannot forget revolutionary Leela Roy, Bengal’s only woman member in the Constituent Assembly. Let us stop this nonsense. Bengalis across genders have always been the best of the souls and minds,” said Agnimitra Paul, president of the state BJP Mahila Morcha (women’s front).Kolkata-based social activist Saswati Ghosh said attempts to shame all Bengali women can also be a sign of jealousy since they have earned laurels in every field. Rupa Chakraborty Khan, a resident of Uttarpara in Bengal’s Hooghly district, has lodged a police complaint against such posts and trolling. “How can people indulge in such senseless generalisation. Bengali women are being called witches and gold diggers on Facebook and Twitter. I could not sit quiet,” she said. One of the viral tweets that people in Bengal have reacted to was posted on July 31 by Barkha Trehan, who describes herself as “Voice of Men” and “Hindu entrepreneur.” “STAY SAFE MEN / BOYS. Bengali girls are dominating, they know how to make guys fall for them. They catch big fish, good looking highly paid guys. If you want to be her servant and financer and are okay to leave your family and join her family then go ahead,” wrote Trehan. Reacting to this, popular actress and TMC Lok Sabha member Nusrat Jahan tweeted, “We “Bengali Girls” also run around – cook n conquer the world. Stop disgracing a community for your Agendas. I’m sure you don’t know your Maach-Masala-Mishti (fish, spices and sweets) well.” The hate tweets triggered reaction from cities across India. Though most people opposed the hatred, Rhea Chakraborty faced ire and public trial. Rishi Bagree, a BJP supporter with 1,84,000 followers, wrote, “It’s wrong to target Bengali Girls for something wrong done by #RheaChakroborty.”“I am from Bengal and supports @itsSSR. Want his case to be thoroughly investigated but targeting every Bengali girl just because Rhea is Bengali is utter madness,” tweeted Shibangi Hazra who is part of the Justice for SSR (Sushant Singh Rajput) movement on social media. On August 7, Prity Kunwar, a Supreme Court lawyer, tweeted, “…Ppl may say whatever but since the last 51 days, I have seen as many Bengali girls in this campaign as any other. A dirty fish has maligned the entire pond. But don’t let some cynics affect you.”Krishna Prakash, whose Twitter identity includes the words “nationalist Hindu,” wrote, “A woman is a woman..either it be Bengali, Bihari or Marathi..And dominating girls doesn’t mean that they are criminals like #RheaChakroborty..Stop your regional dirty politics here..Respect the woman..Every woman is Durga either its Bengali or Marathi.”Shiela Gangopadhyay, whose twitter name comes with the prefix ‘Chowkidar’ made popular in 2019 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, wrote, “Bengali girls are Simple, honest, sincere, like any other girl from any corner of the world!.... ”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bengal-women-fight-back-online-abuse-in-wake-of-sushant-rajput-death/story-FaT8ilU9iZDtf2dEMP9nRJ.html
11-08-2020||India||PM Modi urges states to ramp up testing, says their role is crucial in Covid-19 fight||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday pointed out the significance of each and every state in controlling the spread of the coronavirus disease in the country as he urged at least six of them to increase the number of tests to diagnose Covid-19.PM Modi held a video conference with the chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, which have added the bulk of cases to the country’s Covid-19 tally. The number of coronavirus infection crossed the 2.26-million mark, which includes more than 45,000 deaths, on Tuesday.Maharashtra continues to be the worst-hit state in the country with Covid-19 cases, followed by Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Apart from these three states, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh have reported the highest number of coronavirus disease cases and deaths in the last 24 hours.“Today 80% of the country’s active cases are from these 10 states that is why their role is very important in the fight against Corona. The number of active cases has exceeded 6 lakh and most of them are from these 10 states,” PM Modi said during the review meeting of the coronavirus situation in the regions.“There is a need to increase testing in states where the testing rate is low and where the positivity rate is high. A special emphasis has been given on increasing testing particularly in Bihar, Gujarat, UP, West Bengal and Telangana during reviews,” he said in the virtual meeting which started at 11am.Modi said that a view has emerged that the 10 states defeat the coronavirus pandemic, the country will also win. “The path to success has been achieved by the results after continuously monitoring the ground reality in your states. I am confident that with the strength of your experience, the country will win this battle and there will be a new beginning,” he said.The Prime Minister also pointed out that containment, contact tracing and surveillance are the most effective weapon against the viral disease. He also stressed on the importance of timely diagnosis of Covid-19, citing experts that if a person is diagnosed within 72 hours then the spread can be controlled to a great extent. Aarogya Setu, the contact tracing mobile application, is another effective way to tackle the disease.“The percentage of active cases has decreased and the recovery rate has increased and so this means that our efforts are proving effective. The most important thing is that it has also increased people’s trust and confidence and their fears have come down,” he added.The chief ministers on their part have asked Modi for a liberal financial package and to remove the cap on spending funds from the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF) to bridge the collection gap caused by the pandemic.“The information about the ground realities get strengthened after talking to you and we get to know that we are moving in the right direction. Therefore it was imperative that the 10 states needed to sit together and review and discuss. And today we have also got to learn a lot from each other’s experiences through this discussion,” PM Modi said during the meeting with the chief ministers.PM has held several such virtual meetings with the chief ministers to review the pandemic situation and the last one was held in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-urges-states-to-ramp-up-testing-says-their-role-is-crucial-in-fight-against-covid-19/story-JWgEi35lzZ30WScJgvSbtI.html

Drilling and workover operation also continue to be affected at few of the locations due to forceful closure of operation.”The gas well suffered a blowout on May 27 and caught fire on June 9 which still continues to rage despite efforts to douse it. OIL said preparations are continuing to cap the well. A second attempt to cap the blowout and the fire failed on Monday due to technical glitches. OIL plans to make another bid on Tuesday.“Following the snapping of one of the Bull Lines of the Athey wagon yesterday, the Bull Lines were removed and sent to OIL’s Engineering Workshop for repairing job. The Lines were repaired overnight and already transferred to the well site this morning. Load testing of the Bull Lines are planned today after rig up with the Athey wagon. Servicing and pressure testing of the BOP stack is also planned for today. All safety precautions are being maintained and are in place. All efforts are being taken to control the well at the earliest,” the statement said.The blowout and the subsequent fire at the gas well have caused damages to nearby areas. “Total number of families surveyed for assessment of damage for compensation till 10.08.2020 both combined in Doomdooma and Tinsukia Circle is 2,756,” OIL said.Two OIL companies have died in the fire while three foreign experts suffered injuries in an explosion last month.Oil India, the country’s second largest hydrocarbon exploration and production public sector company also said that environmental impact assessment (EIA) study on various parameters are being carried out by various agencies such as TERI, ERM, CSIR-NEIST, IIT-Guwahati apart from OIL’s in-house monitoring of air quality/noise level/gas presence.

The last assembly session was adjourned after nationwide lockdown restrictions were enforced from March 25 to contain the spread of the contagion. “A glass panel will separate two legislators amid strict compliance of social distancing norms and other precautionary norms such as periodic sanitisation drive. Additional seats have been organised for 11 lawmakers via the glass partition,” said CS Gangrade, principal secretary, Chhattisgarh Assembly. An assembly official, requesting anonymity, pointed out that the state government would have to incur an additional expenditure of around Rs 20 lakh for the special arrangement during the upcoming assembly session. “However, the exact amount is yet to be ascertained,” he added. “Plans are also afoot to reduce the assembly staff, as only those essential to conduct the assembly proceedings will be asked to report for work. Hectic parleys are in progress to work out the modalities,” said Gangrade. “Each MLA (a member of the Chhattisgarh legislative assembly) will be given sanitisers. The personnel will ensure that no lawmaker skips the sanitising drive,” he said. “A legislator will be allowed to enter the assembly premises only with a driver in a bid to rein in overcrowding,” he added. The press and visitors’ gallery will remain closed during the upcoming assembly proceedings. “A section of media persons, who are from news agencies, may be allowed to attend. However, a final call on this is yet to be taken,” Gangrade said. However, the Chhattisgarh unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – the main opposition in the state --- has alleged that the ruling Congress government is deliberately planning to bar the media persons from attending the upcoming assembly session in a bid to ensure that it doesn’t face any uncomfortable question on the floor of the House, including the Covid-19 management. “The arrangements that are in the works for the lawmakers can also be made for media persons. The government is scared of facing the media. A minister is ensuring that the media is barred from attending the assembly proceedings,” alleged Ajay Chandrakar, a former minister and a state BJP leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhupesh-baghel-led-govt-to-incur-rs-20-lakh-additional-expenses-to-hold-four-day-assembly-session-amid-covid-19/story-58Nb4BpgWEw664calHJ77O.html

Although the amendment was applicable to Hindu daughters as coparceners who died after coming of the act, there was no clarity on whether it will have retrospective effect. In 2016, the Supreme Court decided that such right will not be retrospective in Prakash v Phulwati case whiles in 2018 another bench of the court in Danamma v Amar held it to be retrospective.Answering the reference, the bench said, “Daughters cannot be deprived of their right to equality conferred by Section 6 of the Act.”“Daughter is always a loving daughter for the rest of their life,” Justice Mishra said.The bench said that daughters will have the right over parental property even if the coparecenor had died prior to the coming into force of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005.The amendment came into effect on September 9, 2005.

11-08-2020||India||Draft EIA objections: Aaditya Thackeray says ‘voice of people and mother nature must be heard’||Maharashtra environment minister Aaditya Thackeray has raised objection over the draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification, 2020, issued by the Centre, citing that it “fails to align with the 2016 Paris climate agreement” and poses a threat to the “goal of sustainable growth”. Thackeray has drawn the attention of Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar in a three-page letter and stated that the Central government must hear the voice of the locals hit hard by a project and also the “unheard voice of Mother Nature”. The draft EIA has been facing opposition from environmentalists, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and some opposition parties, who have alleged that the Central government is diluting the green clearance norms. Thackeray’s letter pointed out his objections over several factors, including an exemption for “environmentally destructive activities such as coal prospecting, crushing, and screening of iron ore, seismic surveys for oil and gas exploration, etc.”; no public consultation for up to 50% in existing projects; and no EIA process for expansion up to 25% in ongoing ventures. He highlighted that India is one of the most susceptible countries to climate change and it would hit hard those living in coastal areas because of rising sea levels and an increase of salinity in river waters, posing a threat to the livelihoods of millions. “By diluting the nature and scope of scrutiny of environmental impacts of proposed projects, and by not considering climate change impact in the decision-making processes, the proposed notification goes against the mandate given to the government under Section 3 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986,” the letter stated. It added: “The voice of the public such as the locals affected by a project and the unheard voice of Mother Nature must be heard by the government. It is the public’s interest that must be upheld rather those of clearances, and the environment is at the core of people’s interest … I urge you to take these issues into consideration. The notification, in its present form, fails to align with the 2016 Paris climate agreement and poses a great threat to our goal of achieving sustainable growth.” He noted that if the projects are passed in this ecologically-sensitive region such as the Konkan coast, which is home to 28 million people, without extensive public deliberations, then it would have an adverse impact on the region’s biodiversity, the livelihood of the fisher folks, and agricultural produce. “The Sahayadris or the Western Ghats is listed in the world’s eight ‘hottest hotspots’ of biological diversity. They spread across Maharashtra and five other states and are home to 325 globally threatened flora, fauna, birds and many other species,” the letter warned. Earlier, Thackeray had opposed a coal mine proposed by Centre near the Tadoba tiger sanctuary in Maharashtra’s Chandrapur district. The ruling Shiv Sena, a part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, had also stopped the construction of a power plant in Ratnagiri and a Metro rail depot at ecologically-sensitive Aarey Colony in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/draft-eia-objections-aaditya-thackeray-says-voice-of-people-and-mother-nature-must-be-heard/story-NQQkLabxFX2tCmsXEVlzoJ.html

11-08-2020||India||In meeting with PM Modi, states seek more funds to tackle Covid-19; some ask for removal of spending cap||The chief ministers of various states asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to remove the cap on spending funds from the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF) to meet the challenges posed by the coronavirus disease and other things.The requests were made during a video conference between PM Modi and chief ministers of various states which was held to discuss the situation arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic.Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh said that the current cap of 35 per cent in SDRF for Covid-19 related expenditure, as per the guidelines of the Union home ministry, doesn’t allow the state governments to tackle the pandemic effectively.He also sought a liberal financial package for states to fill the collection gap caused by the pandemic, and also flexibility on Covid-related terms of expenditure in SDRF, news agency ANI reported quoting a statement from the chief minister’s office.Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami asked for an additional ad-hoc grant. “As we have already fully exhausted State Disaster Response & Mitigation fund, I also request an ad-hoc grant of Rs 1,000 crore from NDRF immediately to fight pandemic,” Palaniswami said at the meeting, according to ANI.The demand to remove cap from SDRF was made by Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan too during a meeting with PM Modi on the flood situation.Apart from Tamil Nadu and Punjab, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar also attended the meeting on Tuesday.Defence minister Rajnath Singh was also present in the review meeting.PM Modi has held several meetings with the chief ministers over the Covid-19 situation after the announcement of the first lockdown in March this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-meeting-with-pm-modi-states-seek-more-funds-to-tackle-covid-19-some-ask-for-removal-of-spending-cap/story-wnkMgrtWez9I9WxGQA9VSM.html
11-08-2020||India||Rajasthan truce sealed, Ashok Gehlot talks ‘peace, brotherhood’ in party||Peace and brotherhood will remain in party, underscored Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday, a day after Sachin Pilot sealed a truce deal with the party high command that also promised to look into the issues raised by him against the state CM.“If any MLA is annoyed with me, then it is my responsibility to address that. I have kept doing this in the past and will do this now also,” CM Gehlot told reporters before leaving for Jaisalmer, where the MLAs were moved fearing poaching by the BJP.The change in tune is in stark contrast to the belligerence shown by Gehlot while attacking his former Number 2 in the government in the not too distant past. Using particularly harsh language against the young Pilot, Gehlot called him “nikamma, nakkara”.“I imbibed certain values from my family, no matter how much I oppose anyone, I’ve never used such language. Ashok Gehlot ji is elder to me and I respect him personally, but I have the right to raise work-related concerns,” Sachin Pilot told reporters today.On Monday, Pilot met former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi to end the revolt in the state unit that threatened the survival of the Ashok Gehlot government. The patch up in the party came ahead of an assembly session in Rajasthan on August 14. Pilot was sacked as deputy chief minister and removed as Congress chief in Rajasthan last month after his differences with Gehlot came to a head.“Peace and brotherhood will remain in our party. A three-member committee has been formed (by Congress) to resolve the grievances. The BJP tried its best to topple the government, but in the end, all our party MLAs are together, not even one has left us,” said CM Gehlot this morning. Congress president Sonia Gandhi decided on Monday to form a three-member committee to look into grievances of its rebel leaders in Rajasthan.The panel at the All India Congress Committee (AICC) level will have senior leaders as its members and it will “hear all the sides and also go into the details of the political turmoil” in the state.The committee will also discuss the possible changes in the organisation and the government, a Congress leader said, adding that the names of the committee members and the timeframe will be announced soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-truce-sealed-ashok-gehlot-talks-peace-brotherhood-in-party/story-T1FYuNzJTfeDXawFVQl2cL.html

11-08-2020||India||2 Indians on China-bound VBM flight found to be asymptomatic Covid-19 patients||Two Indians who flew into the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on a special Air India flight on August 6 have been quarantined after they were found to be asymptomatic patients of Covid-19, Chinese health authorities have said.The diagnosis of the disease on an in-bound flight from India could lead Beijing to again stop Indians from flying to China during the inward journey of special repatriation flights.The August 6 Air India flight was part of New Delhi’s Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) flights meant to repatriate Indians stranded abroad; it flew in those Indians who wanted to return to China for work, and had the requisite permissions from the Chinese government.China did not allow several Indians, including families of diplomats, from taking an earlier VBM flight from New Delhi to Guangzhou city in end-June because two Indians had tested positive for Covid-19 on a Shanghai-bound special flight that landed on June 21.After the two Indians were diagnosed with Covid-19 in June, Chinese authorities gave permission only for an empty flight from India to land in the southern city of Guangzhou to repatriate Indians.Beijing only agreed to allow Indians on the August 6 flight after intense negotiations with Indian diplomats and putting in place strict health protocols – including three medical tests – for in-bound passengers from India.According to the local Chinese health commission, the two Indians found to be asymptomatic – infected but without symptoms – were a 40-year-old woman and a 55-year-old man.The diagnosis was done following tests at the Guangzhou airport under the “closed-loop management” system.Both Indians were sent for “isolation treatment” at a designated Guangzhou hospital, the statement from the health authorities said.Despite new clusters of Covid-19 breaking out in the cities of Beijing, Urumqi and Dalian since June, China has seemingly brought the coronavirus outbreak under control within the country.A number of “imported” cases of the disease are, however, being diagnosed daily, mostly among Chinese nationals returning from abroad.Chinese health authority said Tuesday that it received reports of 44 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on the Chinese mainland Monday, including 31 imported cases and 13 locally transmitted ones.By the end of Monday, a total of 2,200 imported cases had been reported on the mainland.Of them, according to official news agency, Xinhua, 2,046 had been discharged from hospitals after recovery, and 154 remained hospitalised, with one in serious condition. No deaths from the imported cases had been reported.As of Monday, the overall confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland had reached 84,712, including 794 patients who were still being treated, with 44 in severe conditions.Altogether 79,284 people had been discharged after recovery, and 4,634 had died of the disease on the mainland, the national health commission (NHC) said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-indians-on-china-bound-vbm-flight-found-to-be-asymptomatic-covid-19-patients/story-EHpZ6atNInJ67Gl0CEGYrO.html

He said while speaking to reporters Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi patiently heard the grievances he and other legislators had and that he was assured that a road map will be chalked out to solve them.The 42-year-old leader also spoke about the comments made by his former boss, Gehlot. During the turf war, Gehlot had admitted in an interview that he has not been on talking terms with his former Number 2 for the last 18 months. He had also called Pilot “nikamma (worthless) and nakaara (good for nothing)”.Watch: Sachin Pilot’s response to Ashok Gehlot’s ‘nikamma’ jibe “I have imbibed certain values in my life from my family. No matter how much I oppose anyone, even if it were my bitter enemy, I have never used such language. Ashok Gehlot ji is elder to me and I have respected him personally but I have the right to raise my concerns over work-related and governance issues if see some discrepancy,” Pilot said.“I was hurt but don’t want to respond to it. I think there should be dialogue, decency and a Lakshman Rekha in public discourse and I haven’t crossed that Lakshman Rekha in the 20 years of my poltical career,” he said.“All want to say is that the truth has come out after the kind of allegations that were levelled.”Pilot’s rebellion ended after his meeting with Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi on Monday, putting an end to a month-long uncertainty involving dramatic legal and political flashpoints in Rajasthan.“...Shri Sachin Pilot has committed to working in the interest of the Congress party and the Congress government in Rajasthan,” the statement issued by KC Venugopal, Congress general secretary in charge of the organisation, said.The Congress had removed Pilot as the deputy chief minister and state Congress president on July 14 and two of his supporters were suspended from the party.Gehlot alleged that the BJP was trying to dislodge his government and his camp also said the BJP was helping Pilot. While the BJP repeatedly blamed the Congress’s internal rift for the Rajasthan crisis, Pilot said he would not join the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-was-hurt-says-sachin-pilot-over-ashok-gehlot-s-jibes-during-turf-war/story-NEcBn9yu9u1Nh3NyaMj85M.html
11-08-2020||India||Authorities can’t curtail validity of passports issued to persons facing prosecution: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) last week reiterated that the passport authorities are not allowed to curtail the validity of passports issued to persons facing the prosecution in India, unless a specific period is mentioned in court orders concerned. The two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices SC Gupte and Abhay Ahuja, said under Rule 12 of the Passport Rules, 1980, the minimum period of validity of a passport other than for a child below 15 years of age is 10 years. The bench cited that there are at least two earlier HC judgements declaring that this period cannot be curtailed in case of a person facing criminal cases, unless a certain period is specified in the court order granting no-objection for renewal of the passport. The clarification came on a petition filed by Roshan Menezes, a merchant navy sailor from Mumbai, who had moved HC challenging action on the part of the passport authorities to renew his passport only for a year, as opposed to the usual period of 10 years prescribed under the Passports Rules, 1980. The period of validity was curtailed because of the pendency of criminal prosecution against him under before the metropolitan magistrate court at Borivali. During the pendency of the criminal case, Menezes’ passport had expired on June 17, 2019. On the basis of the magisterial order of December 4, 2019, passport authorities had issued him a fresh passport in January, but it is valid only for a year, prompting Menezes to move HC. Before HC, passport authorities took a stand that the passport valid for a year was issued to Menezes in accordance with a notification issued by the central government under provisions of the Passport Act, 1980, on August 25, 1993.The government notification had laid down rules for issuance of passports to persons against whom criminal proceedings are pending in India, providing that passports should be issued to persons facing prosecutions in the country valid only for a period specified in the court order concerned, or for a period of one year, where the order does not specify any period. HC, however, held that the authorities could not have curtailed the validity period to one year in view of two earlier court decisions, especially when no period was specified in the magisterial order. The bench has directed the authorities to extend within four weeks the validity of Menezes’ passport to the usual 10 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/passport-authorities-cannot-curtail-validity-of-passports-issued-to-persons-facing-prosecution-bombay-hc/story-HTXgo0V7VkvRxvNVUZ5tJK.html

The fraudster duped him by asking him to update his bank account’s Know-Your-Customer (KYC) information. Srikumar Prasad (50), who has filed a first information report (FIR) at Antop Hill police station about the scam, was asked to download a quick support application on his mobile phone and to fill his credit and debit card details in it, leading to a loss of Rs 1.91 lakh in a series of seven-eight fraudulent transactions. Prasad, who lives in the CGS colony in Antop Hill area along with his wife and two children, received a message from an unknown number at around 9:30 am on Sunday, stating that his bank account’s KYC update is pending. He was told that if he did not update the KYC information, then he would not be able to make transactions from his debit and credit cards. The message also stated that he had to call or send an SMS (short message service) on the given number to complete the KYC verification procedure. Prasad followed the instructions and called on the number, but no one answered his call, said a police officer. “On Sunday, at around 3:30 pm, a person claiming to be the bank’s employee called Prasad purportedly to help him update his KYC. The person told him that he was busy with office work in the morning and could not answer his call,” said an officer from Antop Hill police station. “The fraudster explained the KYC update process and asked Prasad to download an application, quick support, from the Google play store, and to fill his credit and debit card details in it. Prasad downloaded the application and punched in all the details in the app. Soon, he received an OTP (one-time-password) number on his mobile phone that he shared with the fraudster, who siphoned off Rs. 1.91 lakh from his bank account,” said the official. Prasad received a call from his bank, alerting him about the fraudulent transactions. Later, he blocked his bank account and filed a complaint with Antop Hill police station following which a case was registered under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, for cheating. “We have been appealing to the public to never share their confidential bank details with anyone, even if someone claims to be a bank employee. The KYC update is not permitted on the mobile phone and even bank employees are not permitted to ask any personal details related to a customer’s account,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-gst-superintendent-duped-of-rs-1-91-lakh-in-kyc-fraud/story-f1Sw8yqceqhpNX3OPXtnFL.html

11-08-2020||India||Maharashtra sees improvement in Covid-19 recovery rate amid no sign of flattening of curve||Maharashtra coronavirus disease (Covid-19) recovery rate has been improving amid no sign of flattening of the viral outbreak curve. State health department data showed that 3,58,421 Covid-19 patients have recovered from their viral infection and discharged from various healthcare facilities in the state to date. On Sunday (August 9), Maharashtra reported the highest single-day recovery tally of 13,348 Covid-19 patients and 6,711 on the following day. In the past five days, 52,900 Covid-19 patients have recovered, as compared to 56,248 new cases reported during the corresponding period. The number of Covid-19 patients recovered from viral infection between August 6 and 10 is 10,854, 10,906, 11,081, 13,348 and 6,711, respectively While the daily new Covid-19 cases recorded during the corresponding period are 11,514, 10,483, 12,822, 12,248, and 9,181, respectively, the data showed.At present, Maharashtra’s Covid-19 recovery rate is 68.33%, as compared to the national average of 69.80%. On July 11, the state’s recovery rate was at 55.55%. On Monday, Maharashtra recorded 9,181 new Covid-19 cases, as the state’s tally rose to 524,513, including 147,735 active cases. The viral outbreak-related death toll stands at 18,050, including 293 fresh fatalities on Monday. Gujarat and Maharashtra have the worst case fatality rate (CFR) in the country at 3.74% and 3.44%, respectively. The surge in the viral outbreak cases and a lack of robust healthcare infrastructure in Maharashtra has prompted the state government to set up makeshift facilities amid plans to ramp up the facilities shortly. Last week, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had directed the state authorities to develop field hospitals in all the major cities of Maharashtra. “We want to be prepared, if Covid-19 cases further rise as the existing healthcare infrastructure is overburdened,” said a state health department official. Thackeray had also sought the support of the Central government to set up an infectious disease hospital and research facility near Mumbai. He had put forth the demand during his recent interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union health minister Harsh Vardhan at the virtual launch of Covid-19 testing facilities in Noida, Mumbai, and Kolkata.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-sees-improvement-in-covid-19-recovery-rate-amid-no-sign-of-flattening-of-curve/story-blRfEXgMOsjEtpFZ50kdoI.html

The CM’s remarks came a day after a three-member party was formed by Congress president to look into the ‘grievances’ of its rebel leaders in Rajasthan.Gehlot also said that his government will complete its full term.“Peace and brotherhood will remain in our party. BJP tried its best to topple the government, but in the end, all our party MLAs are together, not even one has left us,” Gehlot told media before leaving for a Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting scheduled later in the day in Jaisalmer.He added that the future road map will be decided according to the decisions taken on Monday. “The high command has constituted a three member committee to look into the grievance of them (dissidents). Decisions were taken yesterday and now accordingly the future road map will be decided,” the CM said. Hitting out at the Bharatiya Janata Party, Gehlot said that over 100 MLAs stayed united despite all efforts of by the BJP to topple the government. “They (BJP) tried everything from horse trading to threatening but all stood tall.” He said the BJP had faced defeat and the people, workers and MLAs have shown that their (BJP’s) conspiracy will not succeed. Gehlot accused the saffron party of doing politics in the name of religion, saying the BJP divides and wins polls.Ashok Gehlot exuded confidence that his government will complete its full term.“The Congress is united and the government will run for five years. We have the mandate,” said Gehlot.“I have told them (MLAs) that I will take care of you all as guardian till I am alive. They have faith on high command and me, which will be maintained,” he added. Earlier, Gehlot met three independent MLAs - Suresh Tak, Om Prakash Hudla and Khushveer Singh - at his residence. Tak said they told the chief minister that they were with him.On Monday, rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot met former party president Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi following which the three-member panel was formed. “They have had a frank, open and conclusive discussion. Shri Sachin Pilot has committed to working in the interest of the Congress party and the Congress government in Rajasthan,” Congress general secretary KC Venugopal said in a statement hours after Sachin Pilot’s meeting with Rahul Gandhi.Later on Monday night, welcoming the decision to form a panel, Pilot said that he was not after any post and thought certain issues had to be raised for the benefit. The crisis in Rajasthan Congress that had been brewing for nearly a month when Sachin Pilot was sacked as deputy chief minister as well Rajasthan Congress president on July 14, appears to have been diffused after Monday’s development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-tried-to-topple-govt-but-no-one-has-left-rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot/story-iGtL2p2Ok4D6nS8P9FyYCL.html

Also Read: From habeas corpus to 4G services in Jammu and Kashmir: Pleas in Supreme Court“Overall situation is still not conducive to lift the restrictions in J-K,” Venugopal said.Venugopal said the restrictions will be lifted for two months in two districts, which have low intensity of terrorist activities, but on an experimental basis. The step will be reviewed periodically every week, Venugopal added.The Supreme court was hearing a petition filed by Foundation for Media Professionals, a non-government organisation, in June seeking the initiation of contempt proceedings against the Centre and J-K administration for the failure to comply with the top court’s May 11 directions to review restrictions on mobile internet speed in the union territory. The top court closed the contempt case while appreciating the stand take by the Centre.“This is a good stand by the respondent,” justice R Subhash Reddy, who was on the bench, remarked.“This is a step forward,” petitioner’s counsel Huzefa Ahmadi acknowledged.However, the court asked the Centre to respond to an interim application by the petitioner which pointed out that the government is not publishing on public domain, copy of orders reviewing internet restrictions.As per the Supreme Court’s January 10 judgment on Anuradha Bhasin’s case, orders by government authorities imposing restrictions on internet have to be put out in public domain. The Centre has to file it’s response within two weeks after which the matter will be heard.In its last hearing, the top court had said that the Centre should explore the possibility of restoring 4G mobile internet services in Jammu and Kashmir in view of the statements of GC Murmu, the former lieutenant governor of the Union territory, backing the restoration.Also Read: Election Commission’s rare reprimand for Kashmir Lt Guv over remarks on timing of elections“L-G Murmu has said that there is no difficulty in restoring 4G. You have to give an explanation to that,” justice R Subhash Reddy told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Jammu & Kashmir administration, last Friday.Murmu, who was succeeded by Manoj Sinha as the lieutenant governor on Friday, had said on July 24 the restoration of 4G services will not be a problem and Pakistan will continue with its propaganda even if the mobile internet speed is restricted to 2G. The Centre has cited Islamabad’s propaganda while justifying the restrictions.The Centre on July 28 told the Supreme Court it will verify media reports that said Murmu has advocated the restoration of high-speed 4G internet services. This came days after the Centre filed an affidavit before the court on July 21, saying a special panel constituted as per the latter’s May 11 order has decided against any relaxations for now. The government said the restrictions would continue for two more months before they are reviewed again. It added the panel constituted for the review on June 10 considered all aspects of the matter, including terror strikes, before deciding to continue the restrictions on 4G services.Also Read: 4G restoration in J&K: Govt to verify reports on L-G GC Murmu’s commentThe Supreme Court on May 11 passed its order after the NGO in April challenged restrictions on mobile internet speed to 2G. The NGO sought restoration of 4G services saying patients, doctors, and the general public were unable to access the latest information, guidelines, advisories and restrictions about Covid-19 pandemic because of the restrictions. It pointed out that slow internet speeds make telemedicine, or online consultation, impossible.It had refrained from passing directions to restore 4G services and instead ordered a constitution of the panel comprising high-level government officers, including the Union home secretary, to take a call on the matter.The NGO in June filed the contempt petition saying there was no information available whether the constitution of the panel was notified and whether it has conducted any meetings or passed any orders.A communications blackout and a lockdown were imposed in Jammu and Kashmir in August last year as part of measures to prevent protests against the Centre’s move to divest the region of its special status. Most of the restrictions have since been eased even as mobile internet remains restricted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4g-ban-to-be-lifted-in-j-k-from-august-16-one-district-at-a-time-centre-tells-sc/story-wjVNJeIv1QxyyRKsW2CXBL.html

Here’s everything you need to know about the global efforts being made to find a vaccine fast for Covid-19:• In India, an expert committee on vaccine administration will meet on Wednesday to consider “logistics and ethical aspects” of procurement and administration of vaccines against Covid-19, the Uniomn health ministry said today. The committee will be chaired by NITI Aayog’s Dr VK Paul. The coronavirus disease has infected more than 2.2 million people and killed over 44,000 in India.• According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), three Indian vaccines are in different phases of clinical testing at present. Two of these vaccines - Bharat Biotech vaccine and DNA vaccine of Zydus Cadila have completed phase 1 and will begin phase 2 clinical trials, said the ICMR.• Oxford vaccine, being manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII) got approval for phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, which are starting within a week at 17 sites, the institute said.• Karnataka’s deputy chief minister Dr CN Ashwath Narayan said on Tuesday that the state government is very keen to establish an Immunology and Vaccine Research Centre in Bengaluru in collaboration with the Emory Vaccine Centre of Atlanta University.• Serum Institute of India (SII) had said last week that it has entered into a new partnership with international vaccine alliance Gavi and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to accelerate manufacturing and delivery of up to 100 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines for India as well as other low and middle-income countries. SII CEO Adar Poonawalla told a TV channel that the company will start manufacturing the vaccines by end of August.• Globally, Russia is racing ahead to allow civilian use of a potential coronavirus vaccine before clinical trials are complete. The government plans to give a vaccine developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute conditional registration as early as this week, which would open the door to civilian use. This has led an industry body to call this rush dangerous for the common people. Yet less than 100 people had officially received the inoculation against the epidemic by early August and its widespread use could be dangerous, the Association of Clinical Trials Organizations said in a letter sent to Health Minister Mikhail Murashko on Monday.• Meanwhile, Moderna has become the first company in the world to begin phase 3 testing of its coronavirus vaccine. The tests are being carried out at its facilities in the United States. The tests started on July 27 and the company plans to enroll 30,000 study subjects.• Pfizer too started its combined phase 2 and 3 study on July 27 and hopes to enroll 30,000 volunteers by September. The company’s CEO Albert Bourla said they have vaccinated more than 2,000 people by first week of August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-latest-updates-3-indian-vaccines-under-trial-russia-to-allow-civilian-use-this-week/story-eUNncepriH354QPlOjXflK.html

11-08-2020||India||‘Unfair’ for her to carry this burden indefinitely: Tharoor on Sonia completing 1 year as Cong interim chief||New Delhi [India], Aug 11 (ANI): Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said that he welcomed Sonia Gandhi’s re-appointment as interim president but said that it is unfair for her to ‘carry the burden’ of the party.“We should be clear about our leadership going forward. I welcomed Sonia Ji’s appointment as interim president last year. But I do believe it is unfair to her to expect her to carry this burden indefinitely,” Tharoor told ANI on being asked about the completion of one-year of Sonia’s tenure as party’s interim president. “If Rahul Gandhi is ready to resume the leadership, he only has to withdraw his resignation. I think party workers, Congress Working Committee (CWC) and everyone will accept that because he was the incumbent President elected in December 2017,” he said.Tharoor asserted if Rahul Gandhi was not willing to come back then the party members like to have a clear cut decision as soon as possible.“If he (Rahul Gandhi) says no I do not want to come back, then the question that many of the party members are asking - How long can we carry on like this?” - that is the question. We would ideally like a clear cut decision as soon as possible,” he said.The Congress on Sunday said that Sonia Gandhi will continue to remain as the party’s interim president beyond August 10 and will continue to occupy the post till the procedure to elect a new president is completed.“Sonia Gandhi Ji is the president, she will continue till such time as a proper procedure is implemented and it will be implemented in the not too distant future,” Abhishek Manu Singhvi told reporters at a press conference held through video conferencing today.The senior leader said that “This is very clear that neither politics nor political parties permit or tolerate a vacuum. Just like nature abhors a vacuum, political parties cannot function in a vacuum. It is true that the tenure is expiring tomorrow. There is a laid down procedure in the party constitution for elections. As you know, it goes through the CWC etc.” As Sachin pilot has called truce with Congress to end the political turmoil in Rajasthan, Tharoor said, “Whatever Sachin’s frustrations were, at no stage, he was against the party and against the values and principles and national leaders of the party. He talked about his specific issue within the state. In all fairness, his was a specific problem in a specific set of circumstances and not a denunciation of the congress party. So congress has every reason to keep its brightest talent within it.”Stressing that reconciliation is the best way forward, he said: “I would agree that reconciliation is the best way forward. People can have legitimate ambition for positions but at the end of the day why we are in politics in order to change the country for the better. What we are seeing in the country under the BJP rule is something that the Congress must resist.”“Yes, we may have frustrations within the party but to my mind, those frustrations could be dealt with and in the cases of Rajasthan if there is a win-win situation for everybody then all of us would be happy,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unfair-for-her-to-carry-this-burden-indefinitely-tharoor-on-sonia-completing-1-year-as-cong-interim-chief/story-PvfsTy7Pqp6IrzYmDB0dSL.html
11-08-2020||India||DGCA suspends two senior executives of AirAsia India over safety violations||Aviation regulator DGCA has suspended two senior executives of AirAsia India for a period of three months over “safety violations”, said a senior official on Tuesday.The suspension was carried out a week ago, the official said.In June this year, one of the AirAsia India’s former pilots -- who runs a YouTube channel called Flying Beast -- alleged violations of safety norms by the low-cost airline.“We had issued a show cause notice to two AirAsia India executives -- Head of Operations Manish Uppal and Head of Flight Safety Mukesh Nema -- in June only. It has been decided now to suspend them for a period of three months,” the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) official said.AirAsia India did not respond to PTI’s request for a statement on this matter.Captain Gaurav Taneja, a popular Youtuber, tweeted on June 14 that he has been suspended by AirAsia India “for standing up for safe operations of an aircraft and its passengers”. On June 15, he posted a detailed video on YouTube titled “Reasons behind suspension from my pilot job”.Taneja alleged in the video that the airline has asked its pilots to do 98 per cent of landings in “Flap 3” mode, which allows it to save fuel. He said if a pilot does not do 98 per cent of landings in “Flap 3” mode, the airline considers it a violation of its standard operating procedure (SOP).Flaps are part of wings of an aircraft and they are engaged to create a drag during a landing or a take-off.Taneja gave the example of the Imphal airport, where the plane descends more steeply as compared to other airports when approaching for landing. He said when an aircraft is coming down steeply, it needs to have a drag so that it remains slow, and in these circumstances a pilot has to do a “Flap full” landing.“In order to achieve targets, what would people do? They will do Flap 3 landings without giving consideration whether it is safe or unsafe. This directly impacts the passenger safety,” he had claimed in his YouTube video.“If something happens during a Flap 3 landing, then the question would be asked to the pilot if he or she cares more about saving fuel or 180 passengers’‘ lives, Taneja had said.On June 15, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said on Twitter that it had taken note of the concerns raised by some stakeholders “against a particular airline and its approach to safety”.“DGCA has already started an investigation into the issues flagged and shall take appropriate action based on the outcome of the said investigation,” it added.Senior DGCA officials had confirmed on June 15 itself that AirAsia India was under investigation after Taneja’s allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-suspends-two-senior-executives-of-airasia-india-over-safety-violations/story-TDCBjGuSatjqofIHoR4JxJ.html

It will also be very beneficial for the economy,” Gandhi tweet translated from Hindi read.The former Congress president also attached a graph showing the growth in the demand for jobs under MGNREGA from May 2013 to the corresponding month this year.“Will the suit-boot-robbery government understand the pain of the poor?” he asked.The Congress’ NYAY scheme promises poor households Rs 72,000 a year, no taxes will be raised and the middle class won’t have to bear the brunt of funding this scheme.Gandhi had promised then that 20% of the poorest families in the country would get Rs 72,000 each annually under the scheme if the party win the parliamentary elections. The scheme was envisaged to cover five crore families and benefit nearly 25 crore people and each family would earn at least Rs 12,000 every month. The total estimated expenditures of the scheme were around Rs 3.5 lakh crore.The Congress party had recommended the implementation of its NYAY scheme in March as well after Prime Minister announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-suggests-mgnrega-nyay-to-help-poor-then-shoots-a-question/story-isOWqQ3mBI569JgyIvCuPJ.html

However, the hospital authorities referred the baby to SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack on Monday as his condition turned serious.But soon after the 108 ambulance, with infant and his parents onboard, left the PRM Medical College and Hospital, the driver and the pharmacist decided to have lunch break at a roadside dhaba. The couple said that both of them promised come back quickly.After waiting in the ambulance for an hour, Biranjan Behera, the father of the child went to the eatery where the driver and the pharmacist were having lunch. However, they fobbed him off saying they were aware of the condition of the child.“They came after about 90 minutes and by then it was all over. Had the driver and the pharmacist not taken a long lunch-break my nephew would have been alive now,” claimed Paramanand Behera, maternal uncle of the deceased child.After the ambulance resumed its journey for Cuttack, the child’s condition turned more serious and at Krishanachandrapur area, 10 km from Baripada, it collapsed. The baby was admitted to the Krishanachandrapur community health centre, where the doctor declared the baby dead on arrival.Enraged, the parents and other people attacked the pharmacist and the driver. They also lodged a complaint against them at the police outpost of Krishanachandrapur.However, Sayan Bose, district coordinator of Ziqitza Healthcare Limited that operates the fleet of 108 ambulance, denied of any delay by the ambulance driver. “They had gone for lunch for just 20 minutes,” he said.Last month, a 46-year-old man in Berhampur town of Odisha died after his relatives and the ambulance driver fought over the latter’s delay in arrival. In another incident last month, a 42-year-old man in Berhampur town died at his home after an ambulance driver refused to take him to hospital suspecting that he was a Covid-19 patient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infant-dies-in-ambulance-in-odisha-couple-claims-driver-took-long-lunch-break/story-Oa6I9Refk8Oaeu3p8J0vCK.html
11-08-2020||India||Andaman optical fiber may pitch India as alternative to China in ASEAN region||The submarine optical fibre from Chennai to Port Blair that promises fifth-generation (5G) connectivity, the latest in cellular wireless technology, to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands could be the first step for India to set up an alternative to China for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries to gain international connectivity, experts say. The project, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, promises a 2,300-km submarine optical fibre cable network that will connect the islands of Andaman and Nicobar Islands to Chennai. The submarine fibre network is estimated to cost Rs 1,224 crore and a bulk of the fibre being sourced from NEC Corporation Japan, which also provided technical assistance during the installation, said a department of telecommunications (DoT) official. When I visited Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 2018, people complained about poor internet. A 2300 kms long submarine cable inaugurated today changes that! In quick time and challenging geographies, the cable is all set to transform lives. Kudos to those who worked on this! pic.twitter.com/XK7MgXyAtyAccording to experts, the move will open up a host of opportunities for India in the ASEAN region, where China provides a majority of the submarine optical fibre.“This will open up more opportunities for India to interact with ASEAN countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos,” said Shyamal Ghosh, former secretary, DoT. “The PM had set up a line of credit to explore such options in 2017, but due to bureaucratic bottlenecks there has been no progress so far,” he said. A DoT official said that the department was working towards connecting neighbouring countries with the fibre, but said it would not fall under the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) project, which is providing submarine optical fibre connectivity in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. Ghosh cited that the inability of the countries to provide a sovereign guarantee for the line of credit because private companies mostly run the telecom sector and that proved to be a major hurdle. “These (ASEAN) countries are also looking for an alternative, as they don’t want to put all their eggs in the same basket,” he said. “In Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the network will provide a stable connection as the previously used satellite was more dependent on the availability of bandwidth, especially because the islands emerge as an important strategic point in the Indian Ocean region (IOR),” he added. RK Bhatnagar, a former technological adviser to DoT, said the submarine network in the second phase of connections could easily extend to countries such as Singapore and Thailand. “India is already having an offer of $1 billion line of credit for digital connectivity with ASEAN countries. Countries such as Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam can take advantage to have their OFC (optical fibre cable) digital highways connecting to the north-eastern states through a protected ring architecture and extension by 700 kilometres (km). Myanmar and other ASEAN countries can enjoy better international bandwidth option via the north-eastern states,” said Bhatnagar. He also exuded optimism that the move would be useful after the country graduates to 5G technology. “The cable system with the incremental submarine of 1,050 km can take connectivity to the nearest port of Thailand. Greater Nicobar, the last Indian island, is less than 175 km from Rando Island in Sumatra, Indonesia. India stands to gain politically if 1,925 km of incremental submarine cable can connect three ASEAN countries such as Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia. This distance is even less than 2,300 km from Chennai to Andaman and Nicobar islands. The project can be funded through the ASEAN line of credit,” he added. Both Ghosh and Bhatnagar believe that the extension of the cable network could bring in increased opportunities for trade and revenue generation for the country. “This system route, if extended, to three countries, as suggested along with OFC ring architecture in select ASEAN countries will bring in many more projects for the Indian domestic manufacturing industry,” Bhatnagar said. The project launched on Monday aims to provide high-speed internet to boost the island’s capabilities in terms of disaster mitigation, relief work and enable access to high-speed internet connectivity. At present, this is the only undersea optical fibre cable network owned by the Indian government. Private undersea networks already exist in Mumbai and Chennai, some of which the government had partnered earlier before Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL) was merged with Tata Communications. The project has been completed under the DoT’s initiative USOF, which was set up under the Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Act, 2003. The government, in terms of policy decisions, spearheads the USOF, whose contributors include private players such as DoT licencees Airtel, Vodafone, Reliance Jio and Tata Telecom. All these telecom companies contribute a mandatory 5% of their licence fee adjusted gross revenue (AGR) to the fund and will now be able to lease the fibre to provide connections in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. According to DoT officials familiar with the matter, the USOF collects nearly Rs 8,000 crore annually. The USOF has also led initiatives to connect military and paramilitary forces via satellite connectivity such as Very Small Aperture Satellites (VSAT) in the past. The project aims to establish 1,409 connections in remote areas and has already established 183 of them, said DoT officials familiar with the matter. Mobile coverage, which is still under the tender process, would also be provided under USOF to remote villages in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-inaugurates-optical-fibre-project-to-provide-international-connectivity-to-asean-nations/story-ANoK30ADYbfaP4xPZuDx7J.html

He said that the Election Commission is taking all the necessary precautions in the wake of the coronavirus disease.The political parties in Bihar, including Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), had urged the poll panel to postpone the elections in the state. The LJP had written a letter to the Election Commission saying it is not advisable to put lives of lakhs of people at risk by holding elections at this time.Congress leader Akhilesh Prasad Singh had also said on Sunday that the current situation in Bihar is not conducive for Assembly elections. In the wake of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Singh said he believes that the safety of people should be given paramount importance.“The safety of a person and society is the topmost important. The current situation in Bihar and the rest of the country is pathetic.

The truth behind their missing must be unearthed as quickly as possible,” he remarked.The JKAP president hoped that the government will assign the probe to a sitting judge who can lead the investigations while taking all the factors into consideration. Bukhari expressed solidarity with the families of the three missing labourers and assured them of all possible help in tracing their loved ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jkap-s-altaf-bukhari-demands-high-level-probe-into-disappearance-of-3-rajouri-labourers/story-0te8iXFxpz4tD0U0pIVJgK.html
11-08-2020||India||MP police arrest serial killer after studying old murder files||Police in Madhya Pradesh’s Datia have arrested an alleged serial killer, who murdered at least four people including three in less than two years and may have been involved in more such crimes, officials said on Monday.The alleged accused Jugal Kishor Dheemar, 32, a resident of Bhander town of Datia district, 405km north of state capital of Bhopal, was arrested on Sunday, said police. Dheemar was arrested in connection with the three murders, including a double murder, on the ground of the similar method of the crime he had adopted more than a decade ago, said police. It was a modus operandi of the accused--smashing the victims’ heads with a wooden rod to kill them--which sent Dheemar behind the bar, said Aman Singh Rathor, Datia’s superintendent of police. “In October 2018, a middle-aged couple, Yakub Beg and Salma Beg, residents of Bohrana Mohalla, Bhander, were found dead at their home. Their heads were smashed with a wooden rod which was recovered from the spot of the crime by the police,” Rathor said.A special team was formed to arrest the criminal but the police couldn’t found any clue. In June this year, a 46-year-old Aganwadi worker Lodha Bai, a resident of Peerbali Mohalla of Bhander, was found dead in her house. Her head was also smashed with a wooden rod, he added.“In both the cases, we didn’t find any strong evidence but the modus operandi was found common. Police team read the case diaries of murders that had taken place at least in the past 15 years and they found that a 35-year-old man Irfan Khan had been killed in the same manner in 2009 by Dheemar. Dheemar was arrested in 2009. He was released on bail three years ago. The matter is pending before the court,” he added. “During investigation, local residents told the police team about their suspicion on Dheemar’s unusual behaviour. Police arrested him on Sunday and during the interrogation, he confessed to have committed the murders,” said Rathor. “Dheemar told the police that he had killed Yakub and Salma because they had scolded him for sitting in the verandah of their house. He killed the Anganwadi worker as she had scolded him when he accidentally almost fell on her while walking. He killed all the three during the night when they were sleeping in their homes. He had committed loot also in these two houses,” he said. He was produced before a court on Monday, which sent him to police remand for three days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-police-arrest-serial-killer-after-studying-old-murder-files/story-0VATyrFAsJJF2hNkOzAGhL.html
11-08-2020||India||Chart plan to recover AGR dues: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Monday directed the government to prepare a plan to recover adjusted gross revenue (AGR)-related dues from bankrupt telecom operators, including Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), Aircel Group and Videocon Communications Ltd. While observing that recovery of dues may not be possible from telcos undergoing insolvency, the apex court asked the government whether spectrum can be sold under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The case has been adjourned to August 14. The court, however, did not mention the order reserved on the staggered payment of dues by Vodafone Idea Ltd, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Tata Teleservices. Both Vodafone and Airtel have sought 15 years to clear the dues, while Tata Teleservices wants 7-10 years. However, recovery of the dues face a major hurdle. The department of telecom (DoT) is classified as an operational creditor, RCom said in its affidavit to the apex court. This would mean DoT will be pushed lower down the pecking order in trying to recover its dues under insolvency proceedings, as financial creditors are prioritised under these proceedings. For instance, the winning bidder for RCom’s spectrum, real estate, enterprise and data centre business UV Asset Reconstruction Co., has offered ₹14,000 crore for these assets. DoT may recover next to nothing on its outstanding dues of ₹25,199 crore from RCom if this resolution plan is approved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chart-plan-to-recover-agr-dues-supreme-court/story-gZVqW1JP7WoxAd4HxqWi9N.html
11-08-2020||India||New L-G Manoj Sinha fuels hope of political revival in J&K||The appointment of Manoj Sinha, a former union minister and a senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, as the new lieutenant governor of Jammu and Kashmir, replacing bureaucrat GC Murmu, has raised expectations that political activity in the region, suspended since it was stripped of its special status and converted into a Union territory (UT) a year ago, is on the verge of being revived.Regional parties in J&K have a long list of demands starting with a resumption of a dialogue between them and the central government. Three days after Parliament passed bills to effectively revoke Article 370, which conferred special status on J&K, and Article 35A, which empowered the state legislature to define permanent citizens for whom government jobs and property ownership was reserved, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 8, 2019, assured people of the erstwhile state that they would elect their own political representatives.“Your representative will be elected by you; he will be one of you. The MLAs would be elected just as they used to be elected earlier. The cabinet would just be as it used to be earlier. The chief ministers would just be as they were before,” the PM said.The erstwhile state was converted into two UTs, J&K and Ladakh, with effect from October 31.Unlike J&K, Ladakh will not have its own legislature. A year later, although a host of political leaders including two former chief ministers National Conference’s Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah have been set free from detention that began on the eve of the constitutional changes pushed through on August 5 last year, political activity largely stays suspended. A third former CM and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader, Mehbooba Mufti, continues to be in detention and most leaders said they are still not allowed to leave home without the permission of the police. The appointment of career politician Sinha as lieutenant governor, announced on August 6, is being read as a signal that the Centre is keen to revive political activity and pave the way for the beginning of a new political chapter following the formation of the UT. The former state has been without a government since the collapse of the PDP-BJP coalition in June 2018. The process of electing a new assembly cannot start before the process of delimitation exercise, mandated by the J&K Reorganisation Act, is complete. The political landscape of J&K itself is in the midst of a churn. The regional parties, National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), are grappling with the conditions imposed by the changed scenario, the Congress is barely noticeable and the BJP has been aggressively trying to expand its footprint in the UT, particularly in the Kashmir Valley. A new political entity, the Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party, led by Altaf Bukhari , a former minister, created some buzz. but is yet to emerge as an alternative to the regional parties, while the Jammu and Kashmir Political Movement (Independent) came and went in a flash. Parties that were launched in recent times, including the Jammu and Kashmir People’s Movement started by former IAS officer Shah Faesal, and Sajjad Lone’s J&K Peoples Conference barely found a mention after their founder-leaders were placed under detention. Lone was set free recently and on Monday, Faesal told India Today that he is “ending” his “short gig with politics.” Soon after taking over, Sinha told journalists in the Valley that there is a need “to establish a dialogue with the common people of Jammu and Kashmir…”“There will be no discrimination against anyone and there should be peace and stability,” he said. The governor’s statement has not enthused the local politicians, who complain of being sidelined. Wahid Para, spokesperson for the PDP who was in detention until recently, said: “We are battling for space and freedom of leadership. Kashmir is leaderless and representatives are restricted from speaking and moving freely. There’s silence and absence of political activity. On one hand, they talk of Naya Kashmir and on the other hand Kashmiris are feeling left out since no one is talking to us. I wonder what Governor Sahib will do.” Davinder Rana, a spokesperson of the National Conference, said the lieutenant governor’s political experience should serve to act as a bridge between the people and the administration. “His political experience will only be useful if he can use it to reach out to the people at the grassroots, understand them and their aspirations and convey these to the policymakers in Delhi who, in turn, can draft policies that meet the aspirations of the people and lead to their political social and economic empowerment with dignity and honour,” Rana said. Former CM and NC leader Omar Abdullah recently wrote that he would not be contesting polls till the statehood of J&K is restored. While the BJP says the political vacuum is temporary, Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for Studies of Developing Societies said it is too early to even say there is a vacuum in the UT. “We cannot say regional parties have lost significance unless there is an election to prove so. And political activity has been put on hold so that the centre gets full control of the region.” A senior BJP leader, however, asserted that political activity in the UT will be revived. “Whenever there is a political vacuum, new leadership emerges,” the leader said on condition of anonymity“Post-Independence, an attempt was made to make the people believe they were special, but at the same time there were no deliverables,” the BJP leader said. The leader did not reject the possibility of old alliances being rekindled and leaders who have been written off getting back in the saddle. While people in the UT, particularly in the Valley, have questioned the outcome of the reorganization, criticising the government for failing to check terror attacks, provide internet services and create jobs , the government has defended the move by pointing to the benefits that have reached the Scheduled Castes and Tribes, Gorkhas, West Pakistani Refugees and Pakistan-Occupied Jammu and Kashmir displaced persons, who were excluded from caste-based reservation in jobs and educational institutions, voting rights in the state and property rights. “There has been a change. Unheard voices of the Gujars and the Bakarwals, the refugees are now being heard. Discrimination that existed for decades has ended, so the benefits outweigh the concerns that a section of people and politicians in the Valley have about the scrapping of Articles 370 and 35A,” said the BJP leader quoted above. The PM too has been critical of Articles 370 and 35A for having “given nothing but secessionism, terrorism, nepotism and widespread corruption on a large scale to Jammu-Kashmir” and as “a weapon used by Pakistan to flare up the emotions of some people.” In Jammu, where the scrapping of the special status drew a mixed response but the demand for restoring statehood is unequivocal, the BJP says delimitation, which will add more assembly seats to the Jammu region, will change the political fortunes of the region. “The hegemony of the Kashmiri politicians will be over and the regional aspirations of Jammu will no longer be ignored,” said a local BJP leader. “There is nothing on the ground to suggest that. In the absence of a statutory arrangement in place to press for equal sharing of resources and jobs between the two regions, Jammu could still be at the mercy of whichever party comes to power,” said former bureaucrat and commentator KB Jandial. BJP’s national general secretary P Murlidhar Rao said the polity of J&K will now be redefined. “Politics will now have to adhere to the true spirit of the Indian Constitution and the definition of secularism will have to be reflected in the Valley. The practice of delegitimizing and derecognising the minorities in the Valley will end.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-l-g-manoj-sinha-fuels-hope-of-political-revival-in-j-k/story-IJbawdcfRzNyPxLSCRuv1K.html
11-08-2020||India||The many rebellions of Congress leaders||Over the years, the Congress has seen scores of rebellions and defections by party men more senior and prized than Sachin Pilot. But never in recent memory has a disaffected leader been as assiduously wooed as the former Rajasthan deputy chief minister after his revolt against Ashok Gehlot. The Congress leadership’s peace overtures to Pilot -- including his latest meeting with Rahul Gandhi -- were unprecedented also in the light of the chief minister’s majority support in the legislature party: 100-plus loyalists against a mutinous 20-odd. Party spokespersons described Pilot as a “valued” colleague, as “family” while advocating dialogue to sort out the misunderstandings or grievances he has with Gehlot. To be sure, this may also have been made possible by the lack of options before Pilot once it became clear he couldn’t get more legislators to switch to his camp. Albeit on a much smaller scale, the clamor -- it seemed to lose steam after the initial burst on Twitter by Congress leaders of Pilot’s generation -- to not let him leave was reminiscent of 1999. That was when Sonia Gandhi quit as Congress president after the Sharad Pawar-led rebellion on the issue of her foreign origin. The only difference: she resigned, and Pilot was sacked from the positions he held for ignoring the party’s urgings to bury the hatchet.To be fair, much of Pilot’s insubordination, if that’s the word, was unattributed. Personally remaining incommunicado, his was a proxy media offensive against Gehlot’s “excesses” to marginalise his faction. A thread that ran common to these off-the-record conversations was the assertion that Pilot had no plans to cross over to the Bharatiya Janata Party; and that his battle was against the CM, not the party’s central command. It’s another matter that bipartisan observers saw circumstantial evidence flying in the face of his claim of no truck with the BJP.Be that as it may, these averments, which could’ve been tactics to skirt disciplinary action or make the party complacent, distinguished l’affaire Pilot from past intraparty ferments. The Congress For Democracy (CFD), formed by Jagjivan Ram and HN Bahuguna before the 1977 elections, was a frontal denouncement of Indira Gandhi’s Emergency. Before that, Chandra Shekhar, the original Young Turk of Indian politics, chose jail over a ministerial berth by refusing to back suspension of democratic freedoms under the draconian 1975 proclamation. In the early phase of her long innings, Indira, then a relative neophyte, fought the powerful syndicate of Congress old guard in 1966-67 to become Prime Minister. The group that wanted her tamed included such stalwarts as Morarji Desai, K Kamaraj and S Nijalingappa. She had to wait till the 1969 presidential poll to put her “stamp of supremacy” on the party. The turning point came when her candidate, VV Giri defeated the syndicate’s nominee, Sanjeeva Reddy.That’s now a bygone era. Today’s Congress is without even the truncated strength bequeathed to it by PV Narasimha Rao, who ran a good minority regime but paid scant attention to the health of the organisation he led by default after Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination. The period, made difficult by the 1992 Ayodhya episode, witnessed senior functionaries leaving the party in a veritable procession. The breakaway group led by ND Tiwari had people like Arjun Singh and Natwar Singh in it. They rejoined the Congress in 1998 after Rao ceased to be its president, and his successor Sitaram Kesri was dispensed with to make room for Sonia Gandhi. The Congress she inherited was a pale copy of the one headed by her husband. With over 400 seats in the Lok Sabha, Rajiv Gandhi appeared unstoppable when elected PM in 1984. The sheen wore off fast as charges of graft (read Bofors) and other missteps (read Shah Bano; opening of temple doors in Ayodhya) which clouded the initiatives for which he’s remembered: advent of information technology; empowerment of Panchayati Raj institutions; warding off global pressure to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). In the second half of Rajiv’s rule, his former defence and finance minister, VP Singh declared an all-out war, using the Bofors scam to marshal the entire Opposition against the Congress. The Janata Dal that formed the government in 1989 under Singh was founded a year earlier. Besides him, the trinity that unraveled the legislatively formidable Rajiv dispensation included the latter’s ambitious cousin, Arun Nehru and Arif Mohammad Khan, who fell out with him when the government gave in to the hardline lobby in the Shah Bano case. From the memoirs of Giani Zail Singh and PC Alexander, it is evident that Arun Nehru engineered Pranab Mukherjee’s ouster from Rajiv’s inner circle after the 1984 elections in the wake of Indira’s assassination. That saw Mukherjee forming his own party-- before merging it with the Congress in 1989. In Rajiv’s own words, the reconciliation happened when he realised that many things told to him about his mother’s trusted men, such as Mukherjee and RK Dhawan, were untrue. The episode could be a lesson for the incumbent high command on the risks of being misled by those they trust. Like Mukherjee, who rose to be India’s President, other Congress biggies who formed their own parties but later returned to the Congress were former Kerala CMs K Karunakaran and AK Antony. An ace party hand, GK Moopanar floated his Tamil Mannila Congress in the 1990s. But for the DMK’s opposition, he could’ve been the PM of the United Front government in 1996. Another Indira loyalist, VC Shukla’s homecoming happened in 2004 after stints in Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party and the BJP. He also served as a minister under VP Singh and Chandra Shekhar. The restlessness of talented people in the Congress today is largely the work of its fixation with the Nehru-Gandhi name, which has undoubtedly kept it from falling apart, besides fetching it power on Sonia Gandhi’s watch from 2004 to 2014. But in the absence of the glue of power, even that utilitarian value of the “first family” came unstuck with a string of debilitating defections: Hemata Biswa Sarma, Jaganmohan Reddy and Jyotiradtiya Scindia, to name a few (and whose decisions to part ways has seriously dented the party).That brings Pilot back into the narrative. In his early forties, he hasn’t left the Congress and seems to have returned to the fold after keeping the party on the tenterhooks for weeks. Perhaps Pilot’s terms of entente were unrealistic. After all, a CM with majority support in the legislature could not be removed at his asking. He needed to agree to a middle ground. And seems to have.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-many-rebellions-of-congress-leaders/story-K0yzMHAggMyW2wjWWLXqAK.html

A similar method was also adopted for the selection of the firm for Central Vista project in 2019, which was awarded to Gujarat based-HCP design. CP Kukreja Architects was also among the shortlisted bidders for the Central Vista project. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 25 inaugurated the National War Memorial. The plan to construct a National War Memorial has been under consideration since 1961 at the apex level. “The consideration acquired momentum in 2014 and after a deliberate process the Union Cabinet on 7 October 2015 approved construction of National War Memorial & Museum (NWM&M) within the National capital’s Lutyen’s zone,” the war memorial’s website states. For the memorial a two stage Global competition was held in 2016-17 and Chennai based WeBe Design Lab Chennai was appointed the project consultant. A similar competition was held for the museum, but it soon turned controversial with the runner-up accusing the winner of plagiarism, and the battle ending up in court. Now, CPWD seems to have decided to push ahead with the project for the museum. “India has a rich military heritage. The gallantry of Indian soldiers is recognized world over. Since Independence, the Indian Armed Forces have fought four major wars to defend national borders and uphold our national interests. The Armed Forces have also won laurels and glory while operating in UN mandated peace missions, combating terror and insurgency and during conduct of Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Operations,” the CPWD tender said.“A National War Museum has been planned in New Delhi as tribute to Indian soldiers and to showcase the nation’s military culture, customs, traditions and history. The Museum is envisaged to be world class, state of the art building which will be a ‘must visit’ landmark for those visiting New Delhi,” it added.According to the tender, the consultant should adhere to the Central Vista Committee Guidelines and Lutyens Bungalow Zone Guidelines while carrying out the consultancy work.“A pre-bid meeting was held on March 16 by CPWD officials with senior officials from the defence ministry and around 15 interested firms. Followed by this five firms had evinced interest and presented their designs and two qualified for the financial bids,” a senior official said. The firm for the museum will soon be selected, the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-shortlists-consultants-for-national-war-museum/story-GAxh53jFAzxFJ8bl3MfPvK.html
11-08-2020||India||India to send 4 officers to UN to boost diplomatic presence||India has decided to upgrade its diplomatic presence at the UN before taking over as a non-permanent member of the Security Council in January 2021 by appointing an additional deputy permanent representative (DPR) and a counsellor to handle UNSC matters. External affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar will personally review India’s stint at the UNSC every month.According to South Block, R Ravindran, a 1999 batch Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officer and presently joint secretary (Central and West Africa), will join the Indian Permanent Mission to the UN in New York with a rank equivalent to that of a DPR. Pratik Mathur, a 2007 IFS officer and deputy secretary (PMO), will join as a counsellor. While the mission is headed by T S Tirumurti and has Nagaraj Naidu as DPR, the two officers will join the group before the 75th UN General Assembly opens on September 15,2020. Preparatory work for new non-permanent members begins months before they formally join the UNSC.Ravindran served in the office of the Indian permanent representative to the UN under Hardeep Singh Puri, now minister of civil aviation, urban development and commerce, who headed the mission when India was a non-permanent member in 2011-2012. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already spelled out India’s approach at the UNSC by spelling out a 5S approach -- Samman (respect), Samvad (dialogue), Sahyog (cooperation) , Shanti (global peace) and Samiriddhi (global prosperity) -- with the overall objective of a “New Orientation of a Reformed Multilateral System.”While India got 184 out of 192 valid votes cast for the UNSC seat, the vote numbers surprised New Delhi as India’s adversaries, particularly Pakistan, Turkey, Malaysai and backed by Islamabad’s all-weather friend Chinam had spread negativity about the revocation of article 370 in Kashmir on August 5 last year. “Our understanding is that India got these many votes as its forces stood up to China at Galwan in East Ladakh in June. Although only 129 votes are required, India got additional votes for having the capacity to fight for its territory,” said a senior government official.It was a reference to the violent brawl that took place in Galwan on June 15 in which heavily outnumbered Indian soldiers fought back against Chinese troops. India lost 20 men in the skirmish and China suffered an unspecified number of casualties. From conversations with a bunch of diplomats, it is quite evident that India is set to play a constructive role at the UNSC without forgetting that it is still waiting to become a permanent member of the Council after 75 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-send-4-officers-to-un-to-boost-diplomatic-presence/story-ayFfk7eiyeywz9vOMxrgLO.html
11-08-2020||India||Rafales practising night-flying in Himachal Pradesh||The five newly acquired top-of-the-line Rafale fighter jets from France are being kept away from the 1,597-km long Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Ladakh sector out of concern that People’s Liberation Army (PLA) radars in occupied Aksai Chin could identify their frequency signatures and jam the signals in a worst-case scenario.The Rafales, based in Ambala, are understood to be practising night flying in the mountainous terrain of Himachal Pradesh so that the Golden Arrows squadron, with its Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles and SCALP air-to-ground standoff weapons will be ready if the situation deteriorates on the LAC.According to South Block officials, the Rafale fighters are “fully operational,” with the first 18 platforms to be placed in Ambala and the next 18 fighters to be based in the Hashimara airbase near the border with Bhutan. Military aviation experts say the Rafales can also be used for training purposes in the Ladakh sector as all these fighters are equipped with programmable signal processors (PSP) or the capacity to change signal frequencies in the event of hostilities.“Even though the Chinese PLA have placed their electronic intelligence radars on mountain tops in occupied Aksai Chin area for clear line of sight, the wartime signature of Rafale will be different from that in practice mode. The PLA aircraft detection radars are good as they have been manufactured, keeping the US air force in mind,” an expert said, requesting anonymity.Although Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military interlocutors are engaged in a constant dialogue for total disengagement of troops in eastern Ladakh, the three services are not only focused on the western sector but also the remaining part of the LAC as well as on the high seas. Last week, Army Chief General M.M. Naravane made it clear to central and eastern army commanders that they should not be caught by surprise by the PLA on the LAC and should be in the highest state of military preparedness.The Indian Navy has also been directed to monitor the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean to ensure that Chinese PLA warships are kept at bay from the Indian sea board and island territories. The surface and undersea assets are on operational alert with Chinese ships being monitored from the Malacca Straits to the Gulf of Aden.Although the Chinese PLA’s air activity has reduced in the Ladakh sector as compared to the first week of July after the Galwan Valley flare-up in June, the Indian Air Force is taking no chances and is watching the Lhasa Gonggar and Hotan airbases in particular. On June 15, a violent brawl flared between Indian and Chinese solders in Galwan in eastern Ladakh, leaving 20 Indian soldiers dead and an unspecified number of Chinese casualties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rafales-practising-night-flying-in-himachal-pradesh/story-cf5IDColAqhc186UPr1XaN.html
11-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||According to a report by the American Academy of Pediatrics released over the weekend, the number of Covid-19 cases among children increased by 97,078 in the US between July 16 and July 20. This number, according to the report, is 29% of all cases among children reported since the start of the pandemic, and represents a 40% increase (there were 241,904 cases among children on July 16 and this went up to 338,982 by July 30). Overall, according to data from worldometers.info, the US saw the addition of 22% of its total cases as on July 30 in the period between July 16 and July 30. Clearly, infections among children (albeit on a lower base), have grown faster than in the total population (including children) in this period. The report considered children to be those under the age of 17 or 19 (although two states set the ceiling at 14 and one considered young people till the age of 24).The American Academy of Pediatrics report is relevant in that country given the debate over the reopening of schools. For that reason, it is relevant in India, too, where, as HT reported late last week, there has been a plan for school reopenings ready for at least a month, although there has been no decision on the timing of this (some reports have suggested that it could be September 1 for students in Classes 11 and 12).Similar data for India isn’t available. Neither the Indian Council of Medical Research nor the Union health ministry release caseload data by age groups on a regular basis. They did so once in April, but since then, while they have released data on deaths by age groups at least thrice, they have not shared details of cases. According to people familiar with the data, though, the proportion of children (those under the age of 18) in the caseload was around 8% at the end of July, when India had around 1.7 million cases. In the absence of more granular details, it is difficult to assess whether this number has been rising in recent weeks. Still, while the information isn’t in the public domain, it is available, which means the government can analyse whether cases among children have been on the rise even as India’s overall caseload has soared -- just the kind of input that should go into a decision on reopening schools. The data also shows that the majority of infections (till the end of July) were among people below the age of 45, but that the majority of deaths (till August 4), among those over the age of 45 – but that’s another story.The issue of school openings is a controversial one around the world; it is also one that has vexed governments. Most governments believe (and justifiably so) that keeping schools closed disadvantages the already disadvantaged. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson distilled these sentiments in an article published in the Mail on Sunday. He cited research that claimed that “the attainment gap between children from economically deprived households and their peers could widen by more than a third” and referred to UN secretary general Antonio Guterres’s comments last week about this being a “generational catastrophe that could waste untold human potential, undermine decades of progress, and exacerbate entrenched inequalities”. He added that keeping schools closed “a moment longer than absolutely necessary is socially intolerable, economically unsustainable and morally indefensible”.All of Johnson’s observations are valid – and they are perhaps not out of place in a country that has seen a sharp fall in cases. According to the New York Times database, the seven-day average of daily new cases in the UK was 876 (on Sunday). That’s higher than the 500-level the average was at in early July, but far off peaks seen in April and May.The reason why the issue has become as controversial as it has in the US is because the country is considering reopening amidst a clear second wave (which is just coming off its peak). India’s challenge is even tougher, and from both ends – the digital divide is real and affects many children who go to government schools and even most of those who study in private schools under the government’s Right To Education law; and the number of coronavirus disease cases in the country continues to rise. India ended Monday with 51,127 new cases, and a total of 2,263,864 cases thus far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-UXvMnUNxTDtWzPSSxmWYqN.html
11-08-2020||India||62% cases but only 13% fatalities among those below 45 years||Around six out of every 10 (62%) infections of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India have been among people below the age of 45 years, but Covid-19 patients above 45 years of age account for nearly nine in 10 (87%) of all deaths, shows government data.The findings about the age-wise distribution of infections and deaths in India appear to be in line with what scientists have observed about the global trends of the disease — it disproportionally infects younger people, while it severely affects those who are older. Officials, however, have not released new data about the break-up of cases based on gender and comorbidities.The unreleased case data from the Union ministry of health and family welfare, accessed by HT, also shows that more than half (54%) of the people infected in India are between the ages of 18 and 44, while half (50%) the people who succumbed to the disease are above 60 years of age.  The data for age-wise breakup of cases pertains to the time when India had 1.7 million cases (July 31, according to HT’s dashboard), officials from the health department who did not wish to be identified said. “The India data also corroborates what experts have found globally that the disease is relatively less common among children, and mostly affects the adult population. Older adults, and those with comorbidities, are at a higher risk of developing severe form of the disease, hence, need to be more careful,” said a health ministry official, who asked not to be named.People between the ages of 26 and 44 years are the single largest group of people who have been infected with Sars-CoV-2 (40%). This is followed by people between 45 years and 60 years (26%). Meanwhile, with 8% infected, the under-17 age group has the least proportion of infections. “What we need to understand about this virus is that it is highly contagious and everyone is equally exposed. In children, however, in terms of overall numbers the infections are less. It may seem like those who are more likely to be mobile are the ones most affected but we are seeing that even if one family member is infected and brings the infection home then all family members are likely to contract the infection. That’s the level of transmissibility we see,” said Sanjay Rai, professor, community medicine department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. The government has not released data on breakup of cases based on age since April. But since then, they have released data on deaths split by age groups at least thrice — on May 1, June 2, and July 10 , during the health ministry’s press briefings on Covid-19 . Most deaths — 50% — are in the age group of 60 years and above, followed by 37% deaths among people between 45 years and 60 years in age. About 11% of people who succumbed to the disease were between 26 and 44 years of age and 1% each belonged to the 18 - 25 years and below 17 years cohorts. This set of data was released by the government on August 4.The latest mortality data also shows 68% of the Covid-19 deaths in the country are among men and 32% are of women. “It is a new virus and there is lots that is not known about the disease; however, the evidence before us currently suggests that having co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and also obesity is a key factor in determining whether a positive case will develop serious illness or not. It also contributes to overall deaths due to Covid-19, with a large number of those dying due to Covid-19 having found to be suffering from at least one of these health conditions. Comorbidities interfere in the recovery process,” said Dr Srikant Sharma, consultant, medicine department, Moolchand hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/62-cases-but-only-13-fatalities-among-those-below-45-years/story-ApwNkJiijl9UomOAm1RNQJ.html
11-08-2020||India||Amidst Idukki landslide debris, 2 dogs search for their ‘best friends’||This is the story of four dogs, and while, like all dog stories, it is about love, devotion, and duty, it isn’t a happy one. The four dogs have been a constant presence at Rajamalai in Kerala’s Idukki district, the site of a landslide that has claimed at least 45 lives. Two have been there for three days now, ever since the landslide on Friday. Local breeds, they are searching for their humans. Some rescue workers tried to offer them food, but they seem to have no interest in that. Finally, some locals coaxed them into eating a few bites, said Muniyandi, a plantation worker who has been at the site of the landslide since Saturday. In the early hours of Friday, a portion of the Pettimalai hills, near the hill-station Munnar, caved in, razing at least 30 houses of poor plantation workers, claiming at least 45 lives. At least 28, including the humans of the two dogs, are still missing. “The pets’ plight has moved everyone. Whenever a body is extricated, they rush to the spot . Then they return to the shade under the rocks, waiting for the next,” said MJ Babu, a senior journalist from Munnar. Some people tried to take the dogs, one black and the other grey, to their houses, but the canines have stood their ground. Also on the site is Maya, a Belgian Malinois from Kerala Police who has helped discover at least six bodies under the rubble, and her colleague, Dona, a Labrador Retriever whose speciality is finding survivors (unfortunately, Dona has had little luck so far). Maya is still in training but has surprised even her handler P Prabhat. Kerala’s director general of police Lokanth Behra, who had a brief stint with the National Investigation Agency before joining the post, said the canine squad has 150 trained dogs that are specialists in sniffing out bodies, explosives, gold and so on.“ Maya has done wonders on her first assignment itself and she will be rewarded properly,” said the state police chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amidst-idukki-landslide-debris-2-dogs-search-for-their-best-friends/story-IB3O2lPZ3RX8f3g9O4uNWP.html
11-08-2020||India||Boost for CM Ashok Gehlot as Sachin Pilot mutiny all but over||Former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, whose rebellion raised questions about the stability of the Congress government in the state, appeared to have agreed to a truce after his meeting with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi on Monday, putting an end to a month-long uncertainty involving dramatic legal and political flashpoints in the western state.Pilot expressed his “grievances in detail” in the “open and conclusive discussion” with former party president Gandhi, the Congress said in a statement, while declaring the formation of a three-member committee to look into the issues raised by the 42-year-old leader and the 18 other rebel legislators who backed him.“...Shri Sachin Pilot has committed to working in the interest of the Congress party and the Congress government in Rajasthan,” the statement issued by KC Venugopal, Congress general secretary in charge of the organisation, said.  Leaders close to Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, who has had differences with Pilot on a number of issues since the Congress-led government came to power in December 2018, said Gehlot will accept the high command’s decision and termed Pilot’s move as a “face-saver”. Pilot’s apparent softening of stance not only bolsters Gehlot politically and eliminates any possible threat to his government but also gives a much-needed breather to the Congress, which has been suffering due to a perceived generational gap between its old and young leaders at a time when it is also struggling to stay relevant nationally in the face of an aggressive Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) . At one point, a rapprochement looked distant with Gehlot launching a personal attack on Pilot , but Monday’s meeting changed all that. The meeting, which came four days ahead of the beginning of a crucial assembly session in the state, took place for over two hours after noon at the 12, Tughlaq Road residence of Gandhi, a leader from the Pilot camp familiar with the details told HT, requesting anonymity. He also confirmed the presence of Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. “The Gandhis did save the day for the Gehlot government,” the person quoted above said, confirming a peaceful resolution. “They [the Congress leadership] assured Pilot that the issues he had would be looked into,” he said.“The Congress leadership appreciated that Pilot did not respond to utterances by the chief minister and other leaders owing allegiance to him. All issues that his supporters raised will also be looked into,” said the leader. “Pilot also stressed that the grievances of his people should be addressed, they should get respect and their work should get done and he categorically stated that he does not want any post.” Later in the day, Pilot said “we raised issues of principles before the Congress leadership, and welcome their assurance of a time-bound redressal of our grievances”. Asserting that he is not after any post and that the party can take back any position given to him, Pilot told the media that he thought certain issues had to be raised for the benefit of the party.“While a lot of unparliamentarily words were used, I have chosen to maintain the dignity of the discourse,” Pilot told HT. He also said he was set to head back for Jaipur on Tuesday. Pilot has given up his claim to chief ministership, a second Congress leader HT spoke to said, though there was no word on this from the former deputy chief minister’s team. It was the first time that Gandhi met Pilot since the now-dismissed deputy chief minister left Jaipur on July 12. Since then, he has camped at various places in the national capital region — from Faridabad to Manesar — with the Congress legislators backing him. The state Congress unit and Pilot and his team have also been locked in a legal battle over the speaker’s powers in initiating disqualification proceedings against them. It was not immediately clear whether Pilot will be given a responsibility at the central level as part of the peace formula. Pilot and the legislators supporting him are expected to attend the crucial assembly session beginning August 14. Confident of its numbers, the Gehlot government was expected to take a floor test in the House. But, in view of the latest developments, it is not sure if that will be required. On Monday, seven-time legislator Bhanwarlal Sharma, a key member of the Pilot camp who was suspended by the Congress, met Gehlot to assure him of his support.“It [the session] is on the 14th; so there is time left. We will be making an announcement soon,” said another leader from the Pilot camp.The second Congress leader said it was Pilot who sought a meeting with the central leadership. This leader said Pilot has been speaking to senior leaders Ahmad Patel and Venugopal.Asked if Rajasthan will be out of bounds for Pilot, another party functionary said: “We are not aware of any promise given to him by Rahul Gandhi. What transpired between them at the personal level is not known to us.”A section in the Congress believes Pilot had a rethink because of a difference of opinion within his group; some of them were worried that Pilot did not have the numbers to destabilise Gehlot’s government. Rajasthan-based political analyst Narayan Bareth said the developments are lesson for the Congress that it should promote only those who have risen through the ranks. “Pilot should also realise that the organisation and its ideology are more important than any post,” he said. The crisis in Rajasthan surfaced after Pilot received a notice from the special operations group of Rajasthan Police on July 10, triggering a revolt that has been in the offing for months. It asked him to record his statement regarding an alleged attempt to topple the Congress government. Though the Congress said a similar notice was sent to Gehlot, leaders close to Pilot called it a “joke”; for it is the chief minister who is in charge of the home department that oversees the police force. Pilot’s camp said the notice was yet another move to “humiliate” the deputy chief minister and “undermine” his authority. The Congress removed Pilot as the deputy chief minister and state Congress president on July 14 and two of his supporters, including Sharma, were suspended from the party. Gehlot alleged that the Centre’s ruling BJP was trying to topple his government and his camp also said the BJP was helping Pilot. While the BJP repeatedly blamed the Congress’s internal rift for the Rajasthan crisis, Pilot said publicly that he would not join the BJP. As the spotlight turned to the numbers amidst possibilities of a floor test, the Gehlot camp appeared to have the support of 101 legislators (though this did not include speaker CP Joshi) in the 200-member assembly. Pilot had the backing of 18 other Congress MLAs and three independents. Bhanwarlal Meghwal, one Congress MLA said to be close to Pilot, is indisposed. The BJP and its ally Rashtriya Loktrantrik Party have 75 seats. On the day the Rajasthan crisis appeared to have been resolved, state BJP president Satish Poonia sharpened his attack on Gehlot, asking him to quit on moral grounds. “I had said on day one that it is the infighting of the Congress and they kept running from one place to another. There should be an audit of it in ‘janta ki adalat’,” Poonia told reporters at the party office in Jaipur, referring to allegations that his party was involved in the mutiny. “In this entire episode, the one who is actually a villain tried to become a hero. Ashok Gehlot should quit as the chief minister on moral grounds as it would lead to the solution of a lot of problems.” (with inputs from HTC in Jaipur)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boost-for-cm-gehlot-as-pilot-mutiny-all-but-over/story-f5WRk4bYZosfzo1LFQAKnL.html
11-08-2020||India||Ban on China imports: Possible spike in dumping a concern||India is on alert against a possible increase in the dumping of Chinese products, either directly or through third countries, in the Indian market as major economies move to impose restrictions on Chinese imports, two officials aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity. An investigation has already confirmed dumping of Chinese polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a raw material to manufacture bottles for packaging of food and beverages, after the US, Canada, Brazil and Argentina restricted its imports from China. The finance ministry will take appropriate remedial actions soon based on a final investigation report, the officials cited above, who work in two different economic ministries, said.Another cause of concern is a recent executive order by US President Donald Trump directing the federal government to purchase essential drugs from only American manufacturers. The move could block a major market for Chinese drug manufacturers and prompt them to push their products into the Indian market, they said.“As the government agencies as well as the domestic industry are vigilant, adoption of any illegal means by Chinese firms to access Indian market would be foiled,” one of the officials said.There is no blanket ban on Chinese imports, provided Beijing follows rules, does not engage in dumping to hurt Indian industries, and does not pose a threat to India’s national security. “All critical items are still imported [from China]. Actions are initiated against only those Chinese products that hurt domestic companies. It is the duty of the government to protect Indian businesses,” the first official said. He cited the example of PET resin being domped from China. “It is hurting domestic firms such as RIL [Reliance Industries Ltd]. On the basis of a complaint from the industry, DGTR (Directorate General of Trade Remedies) investigated the matter and its preliminary report found dumping by the Chinese firms,” a second official said. The preliminary investigation report of DGTR, issued on August 5, confirmed the development. Proposing to impose an anti-dumping duty on import of Chinese PET resin, DGTR said on Wednesday: “Information provided by the petitioners shows that trade remedial measures have been invoked by USA, Canada, Brazil and Argentina against Chinese imports of subject goods [PET resin] show the pattern of dumping by the concerned producers/exporters of the subject country [China]. The petitioners have emphasized that the closure of these markets to the exporters indicates threat of increased dumping and further injury to the domestic industry.”Officials said a similar situation may emerge for the Indian pharmaceutical sector after President Trump’s executive order. “Over the course of the next four years, we will bring our pharmaceutical and medical supply chains home and we will end reliance on China and other foreign nations,” a PTI report from Washington said on Friday. quoting Trump.China and India are twoof the world’s biggest pharmaceutical exporters. While China has a near monopoly in active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), India is the largest exporter of generic medicines, the second official said. “The US market will squeeze and Indian pharmaceutical manufacturers will face stiff competition from Chinese products in almost all markets. The government’s effort to revive domestic API manufacturing may also get affected by influx of cheaper Chinese products,” he added.Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner of consulting firm DVS Advisors LLP, said: “India has always been the dumping ground for Chinese products. With America restricting imports from China, more things could be dumped in India. India has always been using both tariff-based and non-tariff based approach to limit the dumping of Chinese goods but often in vain.”“Improving the cost- effective domestic manufacturing capabilities, establishing an integrated value-added supply chain and more importantly favourable regulatory regimes are solutions for fostering domestic manufacturing in the long run,” he added.He said more and more countries are reducing their import dependence on China either by encouraging domestic manufacturing like India through the Atmnirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-Reliant India Initiative) or through an outright ban on imports like the America First policy of Trump.Deepak Sood secretary general of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Assocham) said: “When it comes to pharmaceuticals, our critical imports from China relate to APIs. The Indian government has come up with several effective measures to boost self-reliance in these crucial areas as well. For the rest of pharma products, our domestic industry can compete with the Chinese within and outside India. Even for APIs, we expect to soon catch up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ban-on-china-imports-possible-spike-in-dumping-a-concern/story-OgNY7mG4eF3l9kWwHruExN.html
11-08-2020||India||At launch, PM Modi hails optical fibre project||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday launched the first undersea optical fibre project for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which will provide high-speed broadband connections in the Union territory at par with services available in the mainland, and likely open up new opportunities for India in South-east Asia .“From Chennai to Port Blair, Port Blair to Little Andaman and Port Blair to Swaraj Dweep, this service has started in large parts of Andaman Nicobar from today,” Modi said after inaugurating the project through video conferencing. On December 30, 2018, the Prime Minister had laid the foundation for the 2,312-kilometre-long submarine optical fibre cable project connecting Chennai and Port Blair, capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.The project has been implemented at a cost of Rs 1,224 crore.Besides Port Blair, it will connect other islands including Swaraj Dweep (Havelock), Long Island, Rangat, Little Andaman, Kamorta, Car Nicobar and Greater Nicobar.A bulk of the fibre used in the project has been sourced from NEC Corporation of Japan, which also provided technical assistance during the installation, said a Department of Telecommunications (DoT) official, requesting anonymity. “The optical fibre connectivity project to connect Andaman and Nicobar with the rest of the country and the world is a symbol of our commitment towards ease of living,” Modi said.According to official data, an internet speed of 400 gigabyte (Gb) per second will be provided in Port Blair and 200 Gb per second in other islands. The project will give a boost to 4G mobile services and digital services like tele-education, tele-health, e-governance services and tourism on the islands.“High impact projects are being expanded in 12 islands of Andaman and Nicobar. Issue of mobile and internet connectivity have been resolved today. Apart from this, physical connectivity through road, air, and water are being strengthened,” Modi said.The optical fibre facility will enable thousands of families in the Union territory to access education and banking services, and shop and consult doctors online.The project will open up a host of opportunities for India in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) region, positioning it as an alternative to China, experts said. A majority of the submarine optical fibre for international connectivity in the region is now provided by China. “This will open up more opportunities for India to interact with ASEAN countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos,” said former DoT secretary Shyamal Ghosh. “The PM had set up a line of credit to explore such options in 2017 but due to bureaucratic bottlenecks that hasn’t been able to move forward.” Ghosh added that the inability of the countries to provide a sovereign guarantee for the line of credit, given that private companies mostly run the telecom sector, was a hurdle. “These countries are also looking for an alternative, they don’t want to put all their eggs in the same basked,” he said. “In Andaman and Nicobar, the network will provide a stable connection as the previously used satellite was more dependent on availability of bandwidth, especially as the islands emerge as an important strategic and critical point in the Indian ocean.” According former DoT technology advisor RK Bhatnagar, the submarine network in the second phase of connections could easily extend to countries like Singapore and Thailand. “India is already having an offer of $1 billion line of credit for digital connectivity of ASEAN countries. Countries like Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam can take advantage to have their OFC digital highways connecting to India’s Northeastern states through protected ring architecture and extension by 700 kms provides Myanmar, other ASEAN countries and even India’s Northeastern states with better International bandwidth options,” said Bhatnagar, adding that this will be useful when India moves to 5G Networks. The minister of Telecom Ravi Shankar Prasad added that the DoT aims to provide connectivity in remote and difficult areas. Prasad informed that a tender for 354 uncovered villages in the strategic, remote and border areas of the country has been finalised and is under implementation in 144 villages of the Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh and remaining villages in the States of Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttrakhand, Himachal Pradesh and other priority areas of Gujarat. “These villages have been strategically choosen to cover border area connectivity on mobile. After commissioning of these villages, there will be no uncovered villages in UTs of J&K, Ladakh for mobile connectivity. Satellite based DSPTs (Digital Satellite Phone Terminal) are also being provided at 1347 sites for Army, BRO, BSF, CRPF, ITBP, SSB etc. Out of which 183 sites are already commissioned and remaining are in process,” he said.The project launched on Monday aims to provide high-speed internet to boost the islands’ capabilities in terms of disaster mitigation, relief work and enable access to high-speed internet connectivity. This is the only undersea optical fiber cable network to be owned by the Indian government in the country presently. Private undersea networks already exist in Mumbai and Chennai, some of which the government had partnered with before Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd was merged with Tata Communications.

11-08-2020||India||Smuggling accused Swapna Suresh’s bail plea rejected||A National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Kochi on Monday rejected the bail application of main accused in Kerala gold smuggling case Swapna Suresh and ordered that provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act will remain in the case. Meanwhile, investigating the UAE leg of the case, a team of NIA officials reached Dubai on Sunday night to interrogate a key accused , Faisal Fareed , currently in custody of the police there, and pick up evidence gathered by the authorities there, people familiar with the matter said. Apart from Fareed, who is believed to be the man who sent gold in diplomatic baggage from Dubai, the two-member NIA team will question a few other suspects who have been taken into custody by Dubai police, the officials said. One of the officials, who asked not to be named, said that Fareed’s firm was contracted in the UAE to clear and send diplomatic baggage to India. It is suspected that Fareed also set up a network of hawala dealers and couriers to help sell the gold once it was in Kerala. Fareed is an Indian hailing from Kerala’s Thrissur but resides in UAE. The anti-terror probe agency , last month, also approached Interpol seeking a “blue notice” against Fareed. A blue notice is issued to collect additional information about a person’s identity, location or activities in relation to a crime. Investigations by NIA have revealed that Fareed forged the seal and emblem of the UAE embassy to ensure diplomatic protection for the baggage and the gold coming here was to be used for terror activities. During its stay in Dubai, NIA team will also seek details of shell companies, which were used for transferring the money, as well as hawala operators linked to gold smuggling. UAE authorities are believed to have carried out some investigation into the matter on India’s request and will likely to hand over their findings to the NIA team. In Kochi, where the bail application was heard last week, Suresh’s counsel opposed the invoking of UAPA against her, saying no terror angle was involved and the case only dealt with economic offences but Assistant Solicitor General P Vijaykumar , appearing for NIA contended that major proceeds from the smuggling were diverted to fund anti-national activities. After a week-long hearing, unusual in bail petitions, the court posted the decision for Monday. This is the first time UAPA is being imposed in the country in a smuggling case. “Earlier smuggling came under the Customs Act but after the amendment in UAPA, money laundering and serious economic offences that affect country’s stability also come under it. True, this is first time UAPA is implied in smuggling case,” said Supreme Court lawyer M R Abhilash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smuggling-accused-suresh-s-bail-plea-rejected/story-MlQS88LSuSMCKYIrfkbJfO.html
11-08-2020||India||Govt unveils steps for self-reliance in defence sector||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday outlined a raft of initiatives and activities planned during the week to give a push to the government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (self-reliant India movement) and cut dependence on imported military hardware --- from upgrading the facilities of defence public sector undertakings and modernisation of shipyards to launching locally-made defence items and signing of new memoranda of understanding with the private sector to boost indigenisation. During a virtual launch of some of the initiatives as part of the Atmanirbhar Week celebrations, Singh said the government has made “timely and thoughtful interventions” during the Covid-19 pandemic including issuing a negative list for imports, raising the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in the defence sector and creating a separate budget for domestic capital procurement to promote self-reliance. From artillery guns to light military transport aircraft and conventional submarines to long-range land attack cruise missiles, India on Sunday announced that it would ban the import of 101 different types of weapons, systems and ammunition over the next five years. “This list of negative items contains not only small items but weapon systems of high and critical technology. More such items will be added to this list shortly, which will save crores of rupees in imports,” the minister said. It is an established fact that military balance between adversaries cannot be measured or evaluated on imported systems that reflect the degree to which a country’s security has been outsourced, said former army vice chief Lieutenant General AS Lamba (retd). “With focus on research and development, new defence technologies and defence manufacturing, the negative import list released on Sunday reflects an aggressive and compelling strategy towards indigenisation,” Lamba said. Lamba added that India’s leap towards military industrialisation will alter the dynamics of not only the country’s capability , but its export programme as well. The Pinaka rocket complex at Ordnance Factory Chanda in Maharashtra is upgrading its facilities to meet the army’s enhanced requirement of rockets, and Bharat Electronics Limited has indigenised the Maareech integration facility for manufacturing, integration and testing of the anti-torpedo defence system designed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation, the defence ministry said in a statement. It added that the Kolkata-based Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers Ltd has enhanced its capacities to meet the production requirement for the ongoing P-17A project to build warships. Also, a steel preparation shop was inaugurated at the Goa Shipyard on Monday for indigenous construction of glass reinforced plastic (GRP) hulls for minesweeping vessels. Imports account for 60-65% of the country’s military requirements and India has signed contracts worth billions of dollars during the last decade for weapons and systems including fighter jets, air defence missile systems, submarine hunter planes, attack helicopters, heavy-lift choppers and lightweight howitzers. India was the third-biggest military spender in the world last year after the United States and China, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) said in a report released in April. The ongoing border row with China in eastern Ladakh has lent fresh urgency to develop a robust defence industrial base to boost the military’s capabilities with locally-made weapons and systems. The focus on self-reliance in the defence sector comes at a time when India is making emergency military purchases from several countries including the United States, Russia, Israel and France. The border conflict has forced India to speed up the purchase of military hardware including fighter jets, smart air-to-ground weapons, missiles, rockets, multi-mission drones, air defence systems, GPS-guided artillery ammunition, tank ammunition and even assault rifles. ...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-unveils-steps-for-self-reliance-in-defence-sector/story-OQzTJkuYbDBHfms4uBIOEK.html
11-08-2020||India||BJP wants security for J&K cadre||After the killing of five party workers in two months by terror groups stoked panic among its cadre in the Kashmir Valley, the Jammu and Kashmir unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has sought more secure living spaces for senior functionaries and public representatives at the panchayat and district levels. According to a party functionary who spoke on condition of anonymity, the demand for “safe spaces” in Srinagar and other district headquarters was placed before BJP president JP Nadda last week. “There is a clear targeted killing of BJP workers; the party is working on measures that will be taken to address the concerns of the workers in the Valley. For now, they have been urged to remain cautious and avoid travelling unless it is urgent,” said a senior BJP leader in Delhi.There are intelligence inputs that attacks could intensify in the run-up to Independence Day, the functionary said. Since the killing of Ajay Bharti, a Congress man and the sarpanch of Lukbawan village in south Kashmir’s Larkipora area in June, five BJP workers have been gunned down.The victims include Wasim Bari, his brother Umar Bashir and father Bashir Ahmed, who were all shot outside their shop in Bandipora in July. Sarpanch Sajad Ahmad Khanday was killed in Kulgam on Friday and on Monday, party worker Abdul Hamid Najar in Budgam succumbed to bullet injuries he suffered in an attack.“Six others have been injured in attacks,” said a BJP functionary based in Kashmir. While a number of Sarpanchs and block development council (BDC) officials have been provided accommodation away from their home districts and villages, local BJP leaders believe there is a need to consider construction of safe houses at district headquarters where their families can be housed as well. “When the panchayat member of the BDC visit their homes they become sitting ducks for terrorists. There is no doubt that the number of panchayat representatives runs into thousands, and providing security will be difficult; but some steps have to be taken to assure the workers who have opted to work for the development of the people,” said the Kashmir-based BJP functionary quoted above. Killing of political workers in the Valley started soon after the eruption of terrorism in the former state in the late-1990s. The National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party claim to have lost hundreds of party workers to terror attacks over the past three decades. Hina Bhatt, who contested the 2014 general elections on a BJP ticket and is currently the vice chairperson of the Khadi Village Industries Board, said political party workers on the ground are a “soft target” and their killing is used to send a message to discourage others from joining the political mainstream. “When the NC and the PDP were in power, their workers and functionaries were targeted; now it is the BJP workers who are being attacked. A lot of people in the Valley are joining the BJP, which is a setback for the terror groups,” she said. The increase in attacks against political workers, Bhatt said, is also retaliation against a crackdown on terrorists in the Valley. “In the last one year so many terrorists have been killed, so this is the easiest way to demoralise those who support the government and party workers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-wants-security-for-j-k-cadre/story-OEhFzTqO59KebvG3dm3SqN.html

Faesal formed the party in March 2019.In a statement on Monday, the Peoples Movement said Faesal had stepped down as party president and vice president Feroze Peerzada had been appointed to replace him: ‘’State Executive Committee of J&K Peoples Movement (JKPM) in an online meeting today discussed the ongoing political developments in the state. In the said meeting, request of Dr. Shah Faesal to spare him from the organisational responsibilities was discussed. Dr Shah Faesal had informed State Executive Members that he is not in a position to continue with political activities and wants to be freed from the responsibilities of the organisation,” the statement said.“Keeping in view this request, it was decided to accept his request so that he can better continue with his life and contribute whichever way he chooses,’’ it added .Faesal resigned as an IAS officer in 2018, citing personnel reasons. He was detained at Delhi airport on August 4, 2019 after he reached the national capital from Srinagar, a day before Parliament pushed through constitutional changes revoking Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and bifurcating it into two Union territories, J&K and Ladakh.In his first comments after resigning, Faesal told India Today: “I am ending my short gig with politics. I don’t want to take Kashmiris down the garden path. Let truth be told.”“There is a new reality in Kashmir and we have to come to terms with it. As a member of IAS, I have been a stakeholder in the future of this nation. I can’t imagine why some people would be anti-India. I can’t be seen as a traitor to a nation that has given me everything in life. I want to move on and start afresh. In whatsoever position that is,” Faesal said.He said he was taking it one day at a time, “Life can’t stop. We have huge challenges of poverty, illiteracy, inequality and unemployment in front of us. I can’t waste my life in chasing illusions when there is so much to be done for the ordinary people. Where will I go next, only time will tell. But as of now, I am sure that I need to move and spread some positivity in my life and in the lives of others.”Faesal is still under house arrest. After his arrest, he was first detained int Centaur Hotel, which was declared a sub- jail, along with other political prisoners and then moved to the MLAs Hostel; In February, the Public Safety Act was invoked against him, but was revoked before he was released in June. He was subsequently put under house arrest.Shah Faesal was the IAS topper of 2010 and worked in various positions in the Jammu and & Kashmir administration. The government has not accepted his resignation yet.Though some of his friends said he could rejoin the government, some others believe he wants to go to the US or UK for further studies.The Peoples Movement statement also said the party had accepted the resignation of chairman Javed Mustafa Mir. a former minister who left the People’s Democratic Party to join Faesal’s group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/faesal-ends-political-gig-resigns-from-party/story-gx5s910w6UAVTN4l4ALutN.html
11-08-2020||India||500 people and 100 elephants die due to conflict each year: Centre||The Union environment ministry on Monday said at least 500 people and 100 elephants die in India due to human-elephant conflict annually. While releasing a document on the best practices of conflict management and a portal on addressing conflict, ministry officials said there are 30,000 elephants in the wild in India and 2,700 in captivity.Soumitra Dasgupta, additional director general of forests (wildlife), said financial contribution to states for payment of compensation and other conflict mitigation strategies increased by 30% this financial year compared to the previous year. “New elephant reserves have been declared and elephant corridors have also been identified in the past five years to address the problem. Elephants have also been included in appendix 1 of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals to ensure better conservation.”Sanjay Kumar, director general of forests, said the population and distribution of elephants in India was expanding. “New interactions are happening now leading to more conflict. They are migrating to newer areas. We are trying to identify research methodologies to understand how the population can remain stable in new areas,” he said.The portal and the document was released by Union environment minister, Prakash Javadekar. “We do not kill animals in India. Animals are revered here. So we have to devise good conflict management practices. We have already started a fodder and water augmentation programme in elephant areas,” Javadekar said. “In the last 20 to 30 years elephants have moved to new areas. From Jharkhand and Odisha they have moved to southern West Bengal. Quite a large dispersal had taken place in the 1980’s and another in recent years. They have moved from Jharkhand to Chhattisgarh and very recently to Madhya Pradesh. These are not elephant areas. I think we should try to prevent their movement through human dominated areas. We had advised earlier also that zonation is required for elephant movement which can help reduce conflict,” said R Sukumar, an ecologist specialising in elephants at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/500-people-and-100-elephants-die-due-to-conflict-each-year-centre/story-ctmxG05VAngJtsAUdeDO9I.html

11-08-2020||India||‘De-escalation may take longer, Army prepared’||Top brass of the Indian military including Chief of Defence Staff general Bipin Rawat informed a committee of lawmakers on Monday that the de-escalation in Ladakh, where Chinese troops transgressed in June, forcing India to deploy heavily along the Line of Actual Control, may be a long-drawn process but that the Indian armed forces is prepared for it and has made all arrangements for troop deployment in the harsh winter. The top general and three-star Generals who attended the meeting also emphasised that the Indian armed forces is prepared to face any onslaught but at the same time efforts are also on to bridge the trust deficit with China, whose transgression resulted in a bloody conflict in Galwan valley on June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers including a colonel, and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers dead. Apart from Gen. Rawat, at least four three-star Generals including Vice Chief of Indian army, Lt. Gen S K Saini were also present. Reversing the trust deficit created by the brutal clash at Galwan Valley will also be enormously hard, and it is expected to be an impediment to the disengagement and de-escalation processes, HT reported on July 3. Military negotiations with China have hit a roadblock due to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s reluctance to vacate positions held by it in what New Delhi claims as Indian territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/de-escalation-may-take-longer-army-prepared/story-c5eMVZYrmvOCCWbXS2YA4K.html
11-08-2020||India||Supreme Court to hear 6 BSP MLAs’ transfer plea today||The Supreme Court on Tuesday will hear a petition by six former legislators of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Rajasthan demanding the transfer of a petition seeking their disqualification from the Rajasthan high court to the apex court.The six members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) had merged with the Congress in 2019 for which they faced disqualification petitions filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Madan Dilawar. Rajasthan assembly speaker CP Joshi rejected the disqualification pleas on July 29. This prompted Dilawar to approach the Rajasthan high court, which issued notice to Joshi on July 30 but refused to stay the speaker’s directive. In a related development, the Congress party approached the high court to be added as a party to the proceedings there. This matter is also listed on Tuesday when the HC could decide the fate of the six BSP MLAs — Sandeep Yadav (Tijara), Wajib Ali (Nagar), Deepchand Kheria (Kishangarh Bas), Lakhan Singh Meena (Karauli) and Rajendra Gudha (Udaipurwati) ahead of a crucial special assembly session called by chief minister Ashok Gehlot beginning August 14. While the proceedings remain pending in the high court, Dilawar filed an appeal in the Supreme Court to stay the speaker’s July 29 order. A stay could be crucial in the event chief minister Ashok Gehlot, who has faced a rebellion by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 other MLAs of his party, faces a trust vote in the House. Senior advocate Harish Salve appeared for Dilawar before an apex bench of justices Arun Mishra, BR Gavai and Krishna Murari. He said the issue in focus is whether the six MLAs could merge their political party with the Congress when their original political party, BSP, headed by Mayawati ,has refused to sanction the merger. The merger took place on September 16, 2019 and was approved by the speaker on September 18, 2019. The bench told Salve that the Rajasthan high court had issued notices on Dilawar’s petition and the matter is pending there. Salve informed the Court that to delay the proceedings there, the six BSP MLAs have sought to transfer the petition pending with HC to the Supreme Court. “Their petition (filed on August 8) is pending in the Supreme Court and they are not moving for listing it. Obviously they want to claim in HC that the matter is pending in the Supreme Court.” The six MLAs have sought a transfer on the grounds that the legal issues raised in Dilawar’s petition before the HC are under consideration of the top court in another case from Assam, in a case titled Mr. Mithou Krose v Imtilemba Sangtam. The bench sought details of the petition and directed that it be listed on Tuesday along with Dilawar’s plea.Salve pointed out that the speaker wrongly dismissed the disqualification pleas filed by him in July this year accepting the merger of the six MLAs with Congress. According to Dilawar, the six MLAs were elected to the Rajasthan assembly on a BSP ticket in December 2018. They ought to be disqualified on the grounds of defection under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, Salve said. But the six MLAs have claimed that as per paragraph 4 of the Tenth Schedule, when two-thirds of the members of a political party within the assembly merges with another political party in the House, the members will be immune from disqualification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-6-bsp-mlas-transfer-plea-today/story-Wq2XbFFeghik0sC6OM0cGN.html
11-08-2020||India||Kerala landslide toll at 48; 22 still missing||The toll in Rajamalai landslide in Idukki district went up to 48 on Monday with the recovery of six more bodies while 22 are still missing, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said. He said some bodies were recovered from a river and rescue work is still going on despite inclement weather. Rejecting criticism from Opposition parties, who questioned his delay in visiting the affected district, Vijayan said he will visit the spot at an appropriate time. “There is no discrimination between plane crash victims and those affected by landslide. What the government announced in the latter case is only an interim relief and it will be raised further. Some parties are whipping it up unnecessarily to create confusion among people,” he said. Opposition Congress and BJP had questioned discrepancy in relief in twin tragedies that struck Kerala on Friday. While the CM had announced Rs 10 lakh relief for families of the dead in the plane crash, landslide victims were given only Rs 2 lakh. But Vijayan said the government will ensure rehabilitation of affected plantation workers. He also said rescue work will continue till the recovery of the last body. But an official of the Kannan Devan Hills Plantation Limited, which owns the estate, said it will be difficult to ascertain exact number of people trapped in the landslide as some houses had guests and children, studying outside Idukki, who came home due to the lockdown. The official cited that few who died were not on company’s records, indicating that the toll may go up. Most of the victims hail from south Tamil Nadu districts but are settled in plantation areas for work for more than two generations. Six temporary workers engaged by the Eravikulam National Park are also among the victims. The forest department said the epicentre of the landslide can be Shola forest which can be ascertained only after weather clears up. Besides people, they fear there could be a loss of wildlife as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-landslide-toll-at-48-22-still-missing/story-4X4XUOR2rwYIoVzNO0pvML.html
11-08-2020||India||PM Modi reviews situation in six flood-affected states||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday underlined the need for a better coordination between the central and state agencies to have a permanent system for forecasting of floods.He also stressed on extensive use of innovative technologies for improving the forecast-and-warning system.The prime minister made these remarks at a virtual meeting with the chief ministers and representatives of six states to review the flood situation in various parts of the country.The states that attended the meeting, which was convened to review their preparedness to deal with the southwest monsoon and the current flood situation in the country, were Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala.A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said at the meeting, Modi highlighted that the investments in localised early warning systems should be increased so that the people of an area can be cautioned on time in case of a threatening situation such as breached river embankments, inundation or lightning.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar drew the Prime Minister’s attention to the non-cooperation by Nepal in carrying out annual maintenance work on embankments falling on the other side of the international border, across Darbhanga and Madhepura districts, and also pitched for the removal of 25% cap on the amount to be spent for extending gratuitous relief to affected people in times of natural calamities.Kumar said, “Floods in north Bihar are invariably caused by heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of rivers originating from Nepal. But in the absence of required co-operation from the neighbouring country, despite reaching out on official level, embankment repair works could not be completed on schedule in May and got extended to June-end this year.”Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government demanded setting up of a committee under the prime minister for tackling crisis situations in states and ensuring a better coordination. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray also sought an immediate central assistance for Maharashtra in view of the June 3 Cyclone Nisarga that caused widespread damage in the state’s coastal districts and the August 5 downpour and heavy winds that battered Mumbai.The Karnataka government said it requested the prime minister to provide an additional special assistance of Rs 4,000 crore to handle the flood situation in the southern state.Representing the state government at the meeting, Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai said that according to an initial assessment, the state had suffered a loss of Rs 4,000 crore due to the floods. “It is a preliminary estimate because the rains are continuing. A proper survey has to be done,” he said.The meet, which lasted for nearly an hour and a half, was also attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh, health minister Harsh Vardhan, ministers of state for home Nityanand Rai and G Kishan Reddy, and senior officers of the central ministries and organisations concerned.The prime minister asserted that in view of the COVID-19 situation, the states must ensure that people follow all health precautions such as wearing of face masks, hand sanitisation and maintaining an adequate physical distance with each other while undertaking rescue efforts.He said the relief material must include provisions for hand washing and sanitising and face masks for the affected people. Special provisions should be made for elderly people, pregnant women and people with co-morbidities, he observed.Modi said the states should ensure that all development and infrastructure projects are built with resilience to withstand local disasters and help reduce the consequential losses.The prime minister pointed out that over the last few years, forecasting agencies such as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Central Water Commission (CWC) are making concerted efforts to make better and more usable flood forecasts.They are trying to provide not only rainfall and river-level forecasts, but also location-specific forecasts of inundation, he added.Pilot projects are underway to use innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence to improve the location-specific forecasts, for which the states should provide the necessary information to these agencies and timely disseminate the warnings to the local communities, Modi said.“The prime minister emphasised on better coordination between all central and state agencies to have a permanent system for forecasting of floods and extensive use of innovative technologies for improving forecast and warning system,” the PMO statement said.The chief ministers of Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Kerala and the home minister of Karnataka gave updates on the flood situation and rescue efforts in their respective states, according to the statement.They lauded the efforts of central agencies, including the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), for a timely deployment of teams and rescuing people.The states also put forward some suggestions for short-term and long-term measures to mitigate the effects of floods.The prime minister directed officials to take action on the suggestions.He said the Centre will continue to provide support to the states and Union territories to strengthen their capabilities in dealing with various disasters.According to those present at the meet, Modi said he would have visited all the states but could not due to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-reviews-situation-in-six-flood-affected-states/story-IXW8wtLHWn92CZYdvb15JK.html

Petitioner (Rhea Chakraborty) is already convicted by media even before a foul play in the death of Sushant Singh Rajput is established. Extreme trauma and infringement of privacy of the rights of petitioner is caused due to constant sensationalisation of this case,” the affidavit filed through advocate Malak Manish Bhatt stated.The apex court is slated to hear on Tuesday Chakraborty’s petition seeking transfer of the case registered against her in connection with Rajput’s death from Patna to Mumbai.In its probe, the Mumbai Police found the cause of death as “asphyxia due to hanging” and filed an accidental death report (ADR) to begin an investigation. Chakraborty, who was in a live-in relationship with Rajput for a year till she shifted to her house on June 8, was also questioned by the Mumbai police.The investigation by Mumbai police was ongoing when Rajput’s father, KK Singh, filed a police complaint at Rajeev Nagar police station in Patna on July 25 against Chakraborty, accusing her of abetting his son’s alleged suicide. His father also alleged that Chakraborty illegally transferred Rs 15 crore from Rajput’s bank account and mentally harassed him.Patna police registered an FIR on July 25 based on Singh’s complaint for offences relating to abetment of suicide, cheating and criminal intimidation.Chakraborty moved the top court on July 29 challenging the jurisdiction of the Bihar police in the matter, saying that the alleged crime took place in Mumbai.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) took over the probe on August 5 based on a request by the Bihar police.The Maharashtra government has, however, opposed it stating Bihar did not have jurisdiction to refer the case to CBI since the cause of action arose in Mumbai.“Investigation into financial scams of thousands of crores by Enforcement Directorate and CBI never see the light of the day and at drop of a hat, cases get registered even without there being a jurisdiction in the foundational case. Petitioner urges that she should be protected and not be made scapegoat of political agendas,” Chakraborty submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-rhea-blames-media-polls-in-sc-plea/story-u0R97JgmotnsN5wC8XS5OJ.html
11-08-2020||India||India crosses 1.5 million recoveries: Health data||India’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) recoveries have crossed 1.5 million, a milestone the Union heakth ministry attributes to its strategy of aggressive testing, tracking and treatment of people infected by the virus.With record single-day recoveries of 54,859 on Sunday (according to the ministry’s database), the national recovery rate among Covid-19 patients has now touched almost 70%.“Recovery of 15,35,743 Covid-19 patients has been made possible because of the policy of testing aggressively, tracking comprehensively and treating efficiently. Better ambulance services, focus on standard of care and use of non-invasive oxygen have given the desired results,” the ministry said in a statement on Monday.Effective patient management has also led to India’s case fatality rate (CFR) dropping to 2%, the ministry claimed; the government aims to bring it down to 1%. On both parameters India has done better than the world. The global CFR was 3.69% on Sunday and the recovery rate, 64.42%. “The record-high recoveries have ensured that the actual caseload of the country viz. the active cases has reduced and currently comprises only 28.66% of the total positive cases,” the ministry added in its statement.“It suggests we are improving at various levels of care including at the societal level as well as in hospitals. It suggests that we have learnt to take care of our positive cases; we have learnt how soon to act and what works and what doesn’t. We are able to provide more organized and systematic treatment clinically. Those involved in Covid-19 management are learning by the day by reading and from each other,” said Dr VK Paul, a member of the government’s policy think tank Niti Ayog, and chairman of one of the national Covid task forces.To be sure, aggressive testing and tracking through house- to-house surveys and well implemented containment strategies and surveillance in these areas may lead to an initial increase in positive cases but it reduces over time with well implemented strategies, according to experts in the health ministry managing Covid-19 situation.India performed 719,364 Covid-19 tests on Saturday, taking the total testing closer to the Indian Council of Medical Research‘s (ICMR) target of one million per day by the end of August, HT reported on Monday.Virologists agree that it is normal for the number of Covid-19-positive cases to spike when testing goes up.“It is normal to see an immediate surge in the positivity rate when testing is ramped up manifold. It means all cases are being successfully identified, and after a prolonged period of time the percentage starts going down as people are tracked and isolated in time so that they do not pass on the infection,” says Dr T Jacob John, former head of the virology department at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu. According to government data, around 10 Indian states account for at least 80% of the new Covid-19 cases. Many of the new cases are coming from the hinterland and the peninsula. “What is worrisome is that the infection is spreading to newer areas, especially rural areas. The spillage is indeed a cause for concern and needs to be addressed. They should have taken steps earlier when the movement of people had begun because this was the fear that the infection might spread to rural areas from the cities,” said John.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-crosses-1-5-million-recoveries-health-data/story-yK73WE637ea3yULMbSSmSI.html
11-08-2020||India||Centre should take steps to undo economic disruption: Manmohan Singh||Protecting people’s livelihood, making adequate capital available for businesses and ensuring the autonomy of the financial sector are the three steps the government should take “immediately” to undo the economic disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in an interview to BBC, urging the government to consider significant amounts of direct cash transfers to the public.The former PM and the senior Congress leader warned that the disruptions due to the lockdown to prevent infections would lead to a prolonged slowdown and that it was important to strategise the response, including by measures such as offering credit guarantees to businesses and making financial institutions more robust. The interview was done over email, the BBC reported in a story published on Monday based on the exchange.Speaking about the economic slowdown, he said it was caused by a humanitarian crisis and a “deep and prolonged economic slowdown” was “inevitable”. India’s gross domestic product (GDP) slowed to 4.2% in fiscal 2019-20, the lowest in 11 years. It followed precipitous growth contractions reported by the US and European countries after the pandemic closed shops, factories and restaurants, signalling a period of recession. The US economy posted a second-quarter contraction of 9.5%, the worst figure on record.India is expected to report its April-June GDP numbers by the end of this month. Economists expect its economy to contract by at least 5% this year (2020-21) especially because the country had seen a hard lockdown for two full months of the quarter (April and May).The BBC report quoting Singh said India followed what other nations were doing and “perhaps a lockdown at that stage was an inevitable choice”. “But the government’s shock and awe approach to the lockdown has caused tremendous pain to people. The suddenness of the announcement and the stringency of the lockdown were thoughtless and insensitive,” the report quoting Singh said. “Public health emergencies such as this are best dealt with locally by local administrators and public health officials, with broad guidelines from the Centre. Perhaps, we should have devolved the Covid-19 battle to the state and local administrations much sooner,” Singh told BBC. Singh said higher borrowing was inevitable and that “we must not be shy of borrowing, but we must be prudent on how we use that borrowing”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-should-take-steps-to-undo-economic-disruption-manmohan/story-EBafgIAKgMMHDJaMK40RIJ.html
11-08-2020||India||Ex-President on ventilator support after testing Covid positive||Former President Pranab Mukherjee, 84, was put on ventilator support on Monday after undergoing a brain surgery at the Army Research and Referral hospital, where he was admitted in the morning after testing positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19). He tested positive while undergoing routine check-up.“On a visit to the hospital for a separate procedure, I have tested positive for Covid-19 today. I request the people who came in contact with me in the last week, to please self isolate and get tested for Covid-19,” Mukherjee tweeted on Monday afternoon. Officials aware of the developments said the former president was on ventilator after undergoing a successful brain surgery for removal of a clot. Mukherjee, president between 2012 and 2017, kept his public interactions minimal after the pandemic struck the country in January. In his Rajaji Marg residence in New Delhi, he stopped all gatherings and only met a handful of people. According to the officials quoted above, he is under close monitoring in the hospital. Army R&R has been Mukherjee’s preferred hospital for treatment since he became the defence minister in 2004. President Ram Nath Kovind spoke to his daughter, Congress leader Sharmistha Mukherjee, and inquired about the health of her father. Kovind and many Indian leaders wished him a speedy recovery. Mukherjee underwent an angioplasty – a procedure to open blocked or narrowed coronary arteries – at the same hospital in 2014. He had decided not to contest the 2017 presidential elections citing “advanced age and failing health.” Defence minister Rajnath Singh visited the R&R Hospital and enquired about the former president’s health. While west Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee expressed concern about Mukherjee’s health and wished him well, senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Union minister Piyush Goel and many others wished Mukherjee a speedy recovery. Minister of railways Piyush Goyal tweeted, “I pray for the well being and speedy recovery of Shri Pranab Mukherjee. I am confident he will be successful in recovering from the virus quickly. Wishing him strength and good health.” “Please take care sir. We are praying for your speedy recovery and good health @CitiznMukherjee,” tweeted Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Abhijeet Mukherjee, a Congress leader and the former president’s son, tweeted, “I wish my father a speedy recovery! I appeal to all my countrymen to pray for his speedy recovery & good health.” Several leaders from across the political spectrum also wished Mukherjee an early recovery. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted, “I have come to know former President of India Sh. Pranab Mukherjee has tested positive for Covid-19...concerned about his health. Wish him a speedy recovery.” Last year, Mukherjee was awarded the Bharat Ratna, the country’s highest civilian award.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ex-president-on-ventilator-support-after-testing-covid-positive/story-8jQsjBXRsepcfnOXJ6VNGM.html
11-08-2020||India||Not after any post, welcome Congress leadership’s assurance, says Sachin Pilot||Former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot said on Monday he chose to maintain the “dignity of the discourse” on the political situation in Rajasthan even as he was surprised by personal attacks on a few occasions. “While a lot of unparliamentarily words were used, I have chosen to maintain the dignity of the discourse,” Pilot told HT.After he appeared to have agreed to a truce following a meeting with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Pilot spoke to the media at night and he said he thought certain issues had to be raised for the benefit of the party.“We raised issues of principles before Congress leadership and welcome their assurance of time-bound redressal of our grievances,” Pilot said. Stressing that he was not after any post, Pilot said it was the party that allotted a position and could take it back as well.Pilot also spoke on the Congress’s decision to form a three-member panel to resolve issues raised by the rebels. “(Congress president) Sonia Gandhi Ji heard all our concerns and the governance issues that we raised. Formation of the three-member committee by the Congress President is a welcome step. I think all the issues will be resolved,” he said.Meanwhile, Congress leader said a formula for Pilot’s return was being worked out, according to news agency PTI.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said “the political crisis in Rajasthan Congress stands resolved amicably by the intervention of none other than Rahul Gandhi himself”.“This is reflective of steadfast unity in Congress party and the commitment of Congress legislators to never fall prey to BJP’s evil designs to defeat democracy,” he told PTI.However, Congress leaders ruled out that Ashok Gehlot will be replaced as Rajasthan chief minister or Pilot will be reinstated as the party’s Rajasthan chief, a post which was filled immediately after the Congress sacked Pilot following his open revolt against Gehlot last month.A section of Congress of said Rahul Gandhi will decide Pilot’s role in the organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-after-any-post-welcome-cong-leadership-s-assurance-says-pilot/story-oFBemBuj5CuRV5e1nLzBgI.html
11-08-2020||India||Three-member panel to address rebels’ grievances||Congress president Sonia Gandhi decided on Monday to form a three-member committee to look into grievances of its rebel leaders in Rajasthan after Sachin Pilot met former party chief Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi to end a revolt that threatened chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s government. The panel at the All India Congress Committee (AICC) level will have senior leaders as its members and it will “hear all the sides and also go into the details of the political turmoil” in the state before submitting its report, including a possible solution, to the Congress high command. The committee will also discuss the possible changes in the organisation and the government, a Congress leader said, adding that the names of the committee members and the timeframe will be announced soon. In a statement, KC Venugopal, Congress general secretary in charge of the organisation, said Pilot met with Gandhi and expressed his grievances in detail. “They have had a frank, open and conclusive discussion. Shri Sachin Pilot has committed to working in the interest of the Congress party and the Congress government in Rajasthan,” he said. “Following this meeting, Congress president Sonia Gandhi has decided that the AICC will constitute a three member committee to address the issues raised by Shri Sachin Pilot and the aggrieved MLAs and arrive at an appropriate resolution thereof,” added Venugopal. Congress leaders familiar with the development, however, ruled out that Pilot will be given back the positions he held till July 14, when he was sacked as the deputy chief minister and also removed as the Rajasthan Congress president. Leaders close to the Pilot camp termed Monday’s development a “win-win situation” for the rebels. “The Congress leadership appreciated that Pilot did not respond to utterances by the chief minister and other leaders owing allegiance to him. All issues that his supporters had raised will also be looked into,” said a leader close to the former deputy chief minister. “The leadership also took cognisance that Pilot all along maintained that he will never join the BJP. Pilot is happy with the developments so far and is also confident that he will get his due in the future. Inevitability of it one cannot deny. Diwali will come if not today but in future definitely. If he agreed to come back, there must be some reason,” the leader added. “Pilot also stressed that the grievances of his people should be addressed, they should get respect and their work should get done and he categorically stated that he does not want any post,” he said. “The leadership also recognised the fact that if Pilot goes the government will certainly fall and the party will lose another state,” the leader further added. Pilot and the legislators supporting him are expected to attend the assembly session, beginning August 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-member-panel-to-address-rebels-grievances/story-knBBWS0Wae3AKpRTDiCYbP.html
11-08-2020||India||Ashok Gehlot emerges stronger as Congress bridges Rajasthan rift||The resolution of the Rajasthan battle within the Congress on Monday brings to an end the possibility of a split in the party and cements its position in the state, boosts the morale of the rank and file, provides a mechanism for conflict resolution, and re-establishes the centrality of the Gandhis in mediating party disputes — for now. All of this will make Congress leaders, struggling with a series of successive setbacks, smile. But the Rajasthan battle was essentially a political and personal battle between chief minister Ashok Gehlot and the former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot. And it is clear that Gehlot has won more than he has lost. First, examine Pilot’s actions, objectives and current political position. The resolution on Monday was not the outcome Pilot was hoping for. He set out to dislodge Gehlot as CM and take over. He threw down the gauntlet of an open rebellion, defying the party’s instruction to attend legislative party meetings or returning to Rajasthan. His loyalists publicly, and he privately, spoke out consistently against Gehlot. He staked his deputy chief ministership and state presidency in the battle. And he appeared to entertain options of a political life outside the Congress, with some suggesting that he had plans for a regional party. At the end of the episode, Pilot has not been able to oust Gehlot, who arguably is even more strongly entrenched in his position as CM. Pilot has also lost control of the party organisation in the state — a key source of power. He is no longer deputy CM. His hold over rebel legislators is proven to have been limited, as they were getting restless and wanted to return to the party when it became clear that the Gehlot government may survive. His expectation that there may be over 30 legislators who would back him did not bear out. And all he has, at the moment, to show for his rebellion, is an intra-Congress committee to examine his grievances. As Congress leaders know, setting up a committee is often a way to provide a face-saver but freeze the problem. But political lives hinge on hope. And so Pilot will be hoping that the fact that there will be a mechanism to listen to his complaints will give him a new start in the party. He will hope that his linkages with Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi — they enabled his return — will prove to be a source of power in the future. And he will hope that with age on his side (he is only 42) , the Congress’s commitment that his grievances will be address will translate into a secure political future in Rajasthan, if not now, then later. What about Gehlot? The entire crisis has established Gehlot as a powerful regional leader of the Congress, with formidable control over the party machine in Rajasthan. The fact that he took a clear position against Pilot and the rebel legislators — and kept his government intact — will rank as an achievement. Gehlot consolidated his legislators, shuffling them between resorts to prevent any defection; he launched an offensive against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and linked Pilot to BJP’s designs; he got Pilot sacked from both the government and as state president and swiftly moved in to take control of the state organisation by appointing a loyalist; he displayed the confidence to call for an assembly session and took on the Governor on the issue; and he managed to keep the Congress central leadership on his side — despite the fact that there was sympathy for Pilot. These strategies have paid off. Gehlot will survive as CM; he won’t have to worry about Pilot, at least for the time being, becoming a destabilising factor. The CM is understood to have wanted Pilot out of the party entirely — and Pilot’s return may not please him. But this, for now, will only be a minor irritant in a larger win. And what about the Gandhis? The fact that the resolution happened on August 10 — exactly a year since Sonia Gandhi took charge as president of the party for what was considered an interim period but has stretched — may be just a coincidence. But while Sonia is in charge, it was Rahul Gandhi, who formally stepped away from organisational matters last year, and Priyanka, whose formal mandate does not extend to Rajasthan, who brought an end to the crisis. Their supporters will suggest that this, once again, shows the family’s centrality in reconciling conflicts — especially since Rahul Gandhi has been criticised for his inability to do so in a range of other states, where leaders once close to him have left the party. As the Rajasthan drama ends, CM Gehlot will be smiling — while keeping a sharp eye on his rival, Pilot, to ensure doesn’t present future challenges. Pilot will be torn between a sense of having failed to achieve his mission, with a hope for a better future with the patronage of the Gandhi siblings. And the Gandhis and their supporters will be happy to see the Congress keep another government back in the party, with no defections, and foiling the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) hopes of bagging yet another state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-emerges-stronger-as-cong-bridges-rajasthan-rift/story-vv9xunxvw1RHt9pE5Fh76L.html
11-08-2020||India||Indian Rafales practise mountain night flying for Ladakh in Himachal Pradesh||India’s newly-acquired five Rafale fighters are practising night flying in the mountainous terrain of Himachal Pradesh so that the Golden Arrows squadron with its Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile and SCALP air-to-ground stand-off weapon will be ready if the situation deteriorates on the 1,597 km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Ladakh sector, people familiar with the matter said.The first batch of Rafale fighters, which landed at the Indian Air Force air base at Ambala on July 29, are “fully operational” with the first 18 platforms to be placed in Ambala and the next 18 fighters to be based in Hasimara air base near the border with Bhutan. India has contracted to purchase 36 jets made by Dassault Aviation, South Block officials said.A government official said the top-of-the-line fighter jets are staying away from the LAC lest the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) radars in occupied Aksai Chin identify their frequency signatures and use it to jam in the worst case scenario.Also Read: Rafale is a game changer, Chinese J 20 does not come close, says former air chief DhanoaMilitary aviation experts, however, say that Rafales can also be used for training in Ladakh sector as all these fighters are equipped with programmable signal processors (PSP) or the capacity to change signal frequencies in the event of hostilities.“Even though the Chinese PLA have placed their electronic intelligence radars on mountain tops in the occupied Aksai Chin area for a clear line of sight, the war-time signature of Rafale will be different from that in practise mode. The PLA aircraft detection radars are good as they have been manufactured keeping the US air force in mind,” said an expert.The Rafale jets are armed with Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, MICA multi-mission air-to-air missiles and Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles — weapons that will allow fighter pilots to attack air and ground targets from standoff ranges and fill a significant capability gap.Also Read: Rafale vs J-20: Ex-IAF chief Dhanoa calls China’s bluff with ‘two simple questions’The Meteor missiles have a no-escape zone believed to be three times greater than that of current medium-range air-to-air missiles. The missile system, powered by a unique rocket-ramjet motor, has a range of over 120 kilometres.The SCALP is a deep-strike cruise missile with pinpoint terminal accuracy through its highly accurate seeker and target recognition system.Even though the India-China diplomatic and military interlocutors are in constant dialogue for total disengagement of troops in eastern Ladakh, the three services are not only focused on western sector but also the remaining part of the LAC as well as the high seas. Last week, Army Chief General MM Naravane made it clear to central and eastern army commanders that they should not be caught by surprise by the PLA on the LAC and should be in the highest state of military preparedness.The Indian Navy has also been told to monitor the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean to ensure that Chinese PLA warships are kept at bay from the Indian seaboard and island territories. The surface and undersea assets are on operational alert with Chinese ships being monitored from Malacca Straits to Gulf of Aden.Even though the Chinese PLA air activity has reduced in the Ladakh sector as compared to the first week of July post Galwan flare-up, the Indian Air Force is taking no chances and is tracking the air movements, particularly at Lhasa Gonggar airbase in the Tibet region and Hotan airbase in China’s Xinjiang region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-rafales-practise-mountain-night-flying-for-ladakh-in-himachal-pradesh/story-4pQA6tKKXDsgHYLyaKdq1H.html
11-08-2020||India||Israeli scientists coming to India with 4 potential Covid breakthrough tech||A special flight of Israeli scientists is heading to India this week to work with their counterparts to finalise four breakthrough pandemic-related technologies to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 pathogen that causes coronavirus. These include two Covid-19 tests that could give results in minutes from a saliva sample. A third that could tell if a person has incipient Covid by listening to their voice. And a fourth, a virus detector that uses radio waves on a breath sample.The Israelis will work out of AIIMS in the national capital Delhi. “The first phase of testing of these technologies was done in Israel. The last stage will now be carried out in India,” said Israel’s ambassador to India, Ron Malka. One technology is a new Covid test that uses polyamino acids to produce a result in 30 minutes, said Dani Gold, head of Israel’s Directorate of Defence Research and Development.“This will mean you can be tested as you enter an airport, a mall or anywhere and be cleared. Real-time testing would allow the economy to open again.”A second, inexpensive biochemical test that can be used at home and gives a result in 30 minutes. Both can work with a saliva sample.The third technology uses artificial intelligence (AI) to listen to a person’s voice and determine if he or she has first stage Covid. “It plays on the fact Covid attacks the respiratory system. One could even do the diagnosis through a cell phone,” said Gold. The third method is a breath analyser. “One would breathe into a tube. We put the tube into a machine which uses terahertz radio frequencies and an algorithm to tell if you have the virus.”The project is led by Gold and K VijayRaghavan, principal scientific advisor to Prime Minister Modi. The funding, logistics, cooperation and results are mutual, said Malkin.The Israeli and Indian scientists will carry out 4,000-5,000 tests of each technology in India to determine if they can work. Indian scientists will also be contributing on the algorithm side.“India is an AI (artificial intelligence)) superpower,” said Gold. “With these tests, hopefully we will be able to mature the technology and deploy it across the board.”The airplane will also bring cutting-edge technologies and equipment to help India, including robots, telemedicine, special sanitising equipment and so on. Noting that India had helped in evacuating thousands of Israelis and provided emergency medical supplies in the early days of the pandemic, Malkin said, the new cooperation was “part of our strong bilateral friendship.” PM Modi and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu have spoken three times since the viral crisis broke out.Gold said the Israeli team would be in India for about “a week and a half.”Gold is famous in Israel for having invented the vaunted Iron Dome anti-missile defence system that provides a city-sized coverage against Katyusha-style rockets and mortar bombs, shooting down the incoming threats with small interceptor missiles.Malkin, in response to a question, said he was unaware of any special arms purchases by India from Israel because of the border clashes between India and China.“The two countries have had long-standing defence relations,” he said. “Relations have grown rapidly across many sectors, ranging from agriculture to defence, and now health.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indo-israeli-scientists-to-work-on-4-covid-tests-through-voice-breath-and-saliva/story-DDBLV1mQATYh9m070sAlyK.html
11-08-2020||Editorials||The importance of flood forecasting||On Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting with chief ministers and ministers of Kerala, Karnataka, Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra to review the flood situation in these states. During the meeting, PM emphasised the need for better coordination between central and state agencies to have a permanent system for forecasting floods and the extensive use of innovative technologies to improve the forecast and warning system. Mr Modi’s recommendations are significant because every year floods upend lives and livelihoods and destroy critical infrastructure and biodiversity. They also put enormous stress on finances.While the government’s Central Water Commission (CWC) has modernised its flood management system over the years, there are still massive gaps that need to be filled to make it a much more responsive system. Two types of measures are taken for flood protection: Structural (embankments, dams, reservoirs, and natural detention basins), and non-structural (flood forecasting and warning, floodplain zoning).There are several problems with both. On the structural side, the management of reservoirs and dams, maintenance of embankments and data collection on a river’s silt-bearing capacity have to be improved. On the non-structural side, data on river flow and discharge must be enhanced; the installation and maintenance of technical equipment such as gauges have to be expedited. Also critical is how the information on floods is given to the public; it has to be timely, useful (location) and in a non-technical language. Finally, an independent evaluation of the flood forecasting system must be put in place to identify the gaps in the system, and ensure that CWC performs its role better than it is doing now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-importance-of-flood-forecasting/story-WY5XYzspBByXKyDFgqqzZN.html
