Covid-19 has presented India with an unprecedented opportunity to help restructure its economy and reshape regional cooperation and integration towards a more sustainable path. In a just-released report from the Centre for Policy Research, India as the Engine of Recovery for South Asia: A Multi-Sectoral Plan for India’s COVID-19 Diplomacy in the Region that we have co-authored with our colleagues, Shyam Saran and Sandeep Bhardwaj, we look at India’s agenda-setting role more closely to map the road ahead as India prepares to assume the G20 presidency in 2022. There are three fundamental reasons why India’s Neighbourhood First policy needs reorientation. To begin with, there are dire warnings of a “pandemic depression” with growth projections worldwide revised heavily downward, and an estimated 42 million people within South Asia out of 100 million worldwide already driven back to extreme poverty.Second, the ongoing global slowdown is projected to hit South Asia’s major export earnings — business services, textiles, transport equipment, labour and tourism, severely. This is compounded by a 22% decline in remittances to South Asia mainly from the Gulf, serious problems of finance and capital, as well as what the World Health Organization has termed “supply nationalism” severely disrupting global supply chains. Third, China is using Covid-19 diplomacy to take several strategic initiatives vis-à-vis India’s neighbours in South Asia that require a commensurate response.In what meaningful ways can India’s Covid-19 diplomacy re-purpose South Asian regionalism in the post-Covid-19 era? There are five critical steps that India can take to invest in a robust regional action plan. To begin with, India could leverage regional trade, connectivity and investment, and strengthen the South Asian Free Trade Agreement as a game-changer for the region. One step that could dramatically galvanise economic energies would be to lower barriers to intra-regional food trade and encourage regional supply chains. Given that over 70% of South Asia’s population is dependent on subsistence agriculture and allied services, its impact could be the equivalent of a rising tide.This single trade policy measure should be supplemented by a series of trade facilitation measures that could uplift Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s call for atmanirbharta (self-reliance) from the national to a regional level as an extension of India’s Neighbourhood First policy. These range from offers of freer transit trade through the region, the development of supply and logistic chains, digital data interchange, single-window and digitised clearance systems, risk assessment and minimisation measures, wider use of trade lines of credit (presently abysmally low), denser connectivity, smoother cross-border inspections, and reduced transaction costs, using technology as a force multiplier.Another area that India could take the lead is in the sectors of health and food security. PM Modi has already taken a laudable initiative in convening a virtual summit of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) leaders on March 15 to deal with the pandemic. However, its medium-term impact has fallen short of the kind of impact India made in response to the 2004 tsunami in the region. It has also been overtaken by the more aggressive Covid-19 diplomacy of China that has included a meeting of foreign ministers of Afghanistan, China, Pakistan and Nepal with offers of sharing its Covid-19 vaccine under development as early as September, duty-free access to its market, and barely-concealed strategic overtones. Although Covid-19 has not led to a visible food crisis, regional food security is another area that India could take a major initiative in with an eye to the future. Measures in this area could include using its ample food reserves of 83 million MT to put in place a South Asian food safety net to deal with crises augmenting access to the Saarc Food Bank that currently stands at less than 500,000 MT. A fourth initiative India could take is to provide an ecological blueprint for South Asia with a focus on the protection of biodiversity and dealing with the climate crisis. The linkage between pandemics and ecology also needs to be acknowledged. The growing risk of the transmission of zoonotic diseases such as HIV, Ebola, Sars, H5N1 and Nipah virus underline the risks posed by habitat fragmentation, degradation and wet markets. Last but not least, India can increase the convening capacity of sub-regional initiatives such as the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation. The border regions can be effective partners in shaping India’s regional engagement by steering sectoral regional dialogues on cross-border trade, transport and health.PM Modi’s call for a regional response to the pandemic is an intuitive one. But at the end of the day, the clichéd refrain of turning a crisis into an opportunity will hinge on New Delhi’s willingness to co-design a collective road map for South Asia. India will do well to remember that it can fuel its own national recovery by being the economic engine of the neighbourhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-must-take-the-lead-in-south-asia-analysis/story-pr5Pp9DIWAHdXI8T154UBM.html
25-08-2020||News||Designing a new framework for paid period leaves | Analysis||The recent announcement of paid period leave for female employees by an Indian unicorn has once again thrust the issue of mandatory menstrual leave into the spotlight. Many activists feel that menstrual leave should be a paid leave granted by law, like maternity leave. The support for period leave rests on a sound rights-based argument — that workplaces need to accommodate for biological differences between co-workers. Period leave allows women to rightfully rest during their menstrual cycle. It is well-documented that women experience a wide range of health complications during their monthly cycle — cramps, back and muscle pains, bloating, headaches, nausea, among others. These symptoms can assume greater severity for women suffering from chronic conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis. While the experience of a period is different for different women, and certainly differs month-to-month for the same woman, period leave is thought to be a means to legitimise the physical toll of a painful monthly cycle, to be taken if required, a means to create equity at the workplace. It is also cited as a way of normalising conversations around menstruation.However, to achieve the stated objectives, we cannot ignore the economics of a period leave. We need to be clear where the funding for menstrual leaves comes from. If menstrual leave is structured like maternity leave, it threatens to increase the cost of hiring women. This has implications in the long-run. Teamlease Services found that 1.1-1.8 million women lost their jobs in 2018-19 across 10 major sectors owing to the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act 2016 which doubled paid maternity leave from three to six months. Similarly, there are other costs associated with hiring women that lead to unsaid but rampant discrimination. It is well-known that many employers in India are hesitant to hire women for jobs that require frequent travel as they need to make special arrangements for their safety. Essentially, society’s failure to keep women reasonably safe leads to a public cost internalised by employers as a private cost.Paid period leave can further exacerbate this situation. Even if this by itself does not keep women out of jobs, it can lead to discrimination in hiring and promotion and raise the barriers for women to enter and climb the corporate ladder. It also creates grounds for companies to offer lower in-hand salaries to women, justifying it on the basis that the cost to company for women and men should be equal. Further, we need to be cognisant of who menstrual leave would benefit and who it could potentially keep out of the workforce. About 55% of urban working women were in regular, salaried employment in 2018-19. Of these, 71% had no written job contract, 51% were not eligible for paid leave, and 53% were not eligible for any social security benefit. Period leave will not touch the lives of millions of casual women workers in the informal economy in both urban and rural areas. By increasing the costs of hiring women, we, in fact, risk keeping them out of the workforce. Now let’s examine the second assertion, ie, normalising conversation around menstruation. Gender specialist and menstrual health educator Mayuri Bhattacharjee notes that, “Period leave does nothing to reduce the biases and taboos around menstruation.” The explicit term “period leave” creates a demarcation, rather than allowing it to be a type of sick leave — thereby allowing a judgment to be passed on the severity of the “sickness” or as many women experience in domestic spaces, legitimate complaints getting passed off as “pre-menstrual syndrome”. Further, like any other health-related information, it should be a person’s right to decide how open they would like to be about their experience. Given these apprehensions, we need to find a balance between creating space for women to seek period leave when required and ensuring that it doesn’t become another ground for employers to favour men over women. A good solution might be to increase the number of paid sick leaves by law for both men and women (but keeping it equal). While it increases the overall cost of doing business in India, it treats men and women at par. Changing the goal from menstrual leave to increasing the number of sick leaves will also let women take charge of how much they’d like to disclose about their menstrual health. Paid sick leaves can be viewed as a form of social security.In the interim, we can also experiment with other middle-path solutions. The pandemic has demonstrated the potential of remote working to many employers. In industries where remote working has proven to be effective, employers can be encouraged to institute work-from-home policies that allow employees to work remotely for a fixed number of days in a month. This flexibility will ensure that women can work from the comfort of their home, in case they find it inconvenient to travel or work from office during their period. While the intentions of those campaigning for menstrual leave are laudable, we must be cognisant of the unintended consequences that may arise from such a policy. No amount of safeguards in the maternity law have been able to guard against the ex-ante discrimination against women when they are being considered for a job, for a promotion, for a salary raise. We must learn from this experience and to improve working conditions of the 10% women who are in the formal workforce, we must not forget about the remaining 90% women workers who are in the informal sector for whom such policies threaten to become the gatekeepers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/designing-a-new-framework-for-paid-period-leaves-analysis/story-fHAzp65zaoNfxw7NxALRxN.html

25-08-2020||Mumbai||State plans to bear excess amount from inflated power bills||Citizens are likely to get some relief in the coming months as the Maharashtra government is likely to provide a waiver in electricity bills. The state government has planned to bear the financial burden of the surplus amount from the inflated bills for three months of the lockdown period — April May and June. According to the proposal moved by the state energy department, the state has divided the waiver into three slabs based on power consumption by each household. It will bear the entire cost of usage is up to 100 units in excess to the usage of the corresponding period last year. For 101-300 units, it has proposed to waive off 75% of the excessive amount and 50% if units in excess are up to 500, said, a senior official requesting anonymity.The proposal which is likely to cost around ₹1,100 crore is likely to come up for discussion in the next cabinet meeting.Officials said that giving waiver means the amount is going to be adjusted in the next month bill as it is not possible to provide cash. “The waiver will be implemented in the form of adjustment in the next power bill. The excess amount will be deducted from the current power bill and people will have to pay only the remaining amount,” an official said.The proposal applies to both private and government power distribution companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-plans-to-bear-excess-amount-from-inflated-power-bills/story-Vb6Pchoy04j4Kr1S8mEkWI.html

25-08-2020||Mumbai||Provide unsold, ready, affordable housing stock for purchase: Report||To give a directional plan to the Maharashtra government to solve the problems of overcrowding, inadequate housing, slum rehabilitation and high-density in cities, Mumbai-based NGO, Praja Foundation, on Tuesday, released a working paper on ‘The Need for Adequate Housing for All - Recovery and Development in Maharashtra’s Cities Post Covid-19’. The paper looks at resolving the issues related to the housing via four key strategies.The strategies include government-led rehousing in existing unsold ready stock to reduce slum density, relocation of labour-intensive businesses to reduce slum density, new adequate housing on government-owned land through community land reserves (CLR) and new adequate housing in peripheral areas around the city starting with improved connectivity through a strengthened public transport network.Milind Mhaske, director at Praja said, “In the short term, to tackle the issue of density in big slum clusters, the government can provide existing unsold and ready affordable housing stock for purchase and lease in the metropolitan region at construction cost to beneficiaries in lieu of their current dwelling (but with a larger area) and compensate developers accordingly.” The paper states that of the total unsold units in Mumbai, Pune and Thane, 34% are affordable housing. It further states, “If the unsold affordable units in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) are offered to households in Dharavi; around 18% of the population can be relocated.”It also states that since 70% of the population in Dharavi is employed within the slum, “shifting of businesses along with better working and living conditions offered to workers will de-densify the existing area.”The paper emphasises on using untapped land in the metropolitan region and the eastern waterfront of Mumbai to create more affordable housing. It states that even if 10% of the land under the eastern waterfront is used for affordable housing, 11,000-12,000 units can be added in the city.It talks about the formation of CLR, which will act as a non-profit organisation that undertakes construction/redevelopment of the property. “In case of sale or management of lease, the flat is returned to the CLR which further sells/leases it to those beneficiaries who are currently living in inadequate housing such as slums. This ensures that the property is continued to be used for affordable housing,” said Shirish Patel, a noted urban planner.At 31,700 people per sq km, Mumbai is the second-most populous city in the world after Bangladesh’s Dhaka, as per the UN-Habitat. As per the slum population census of 2011, the density increases to 86,306 people per sq km. The paper further calculates the median annual income of a household to be around ₹4.74 lakhs but the cost of an affordable house to be almost four times the median annual income at an estimated ₹18.99 lakhs, emphasising on the need to prioritize housing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/provide-unsold-ready-affordable-housing-stock-for-purchase-report/story-5nTBqxxQwfZ5MrvbITYGJO.html
25-08-2020||Mumbai||Inquiry committee highlights violation of Univ Act; MU sends show-cause notice to 2 officials||The annual senate meet of the University of Mumbai (MU), which deals with approval of a new perspective plan, was on Tuesday taken over by a report tabled by the special committee put together to look into the ₹141 crore of varsity funds that was invested in the form of fixed deposits in Yes Bank, earlier this year. The inquiry committee in its report has highlighted the gross violation of the account code of the State Universities Act and based on its recommendations, MU has sent show-cause notices to both the varsity’s Finance and Accounts official Malati Ingole, as well as the deputy registrar accounts Rajendra Ambawade. Both were involved in this decision. A spokesperson for MU further stated that Ambawade has also been sent on forced leave pending further inquiry.This matter was first highlighted in the senate meeting held in March 2020, where a member of the senate had raised concern over the university’s funds being stuck in Yes Bank, days after the Reserve Bank of India put Yes Bank under moratorium. The university, in its reply, had revealed that the money— ₹141 crores— (part development fund and part excess fund) were deposited in various banks in 2019 as well as 2020.A committee put together to inquire into this matter tabled their report at the senate meeting on Tuesday and one of the highlights of the findings shows that the decision to invest ₹141 crores in Yes Bank barely five days before it shut down was made solely by the deputy registrar, without the presence of higher authorities or their permission.“This was done, despite rules in place under the Maharashtra Universities Act that only an investment committee appointed by the Finance & Accounts (F&A) committee can decide the policy of investment of funds of the university,” stated the report. “Documents pertaining to dates—February 11, 20 and 29 shows that only section officers and the deputy registrar have signed the quotations and no signature of F&A officer or the registrar appears on the documents.”The report further highlights the lack of coordination between the F&A department and other competent authorities as many financial sanctions were taken post-facto despite the universities act demanding pre-sanctions by higher-ranked university authorities.“The deputy registrar-accounts has over-performed his duty and willfully assumed, exercised powers which were not delegated to the post he is holding. Not only did he assumed powers of F&A officer but also acted as an alternative to all competent authorities by making decisions about investments of university funds… He is worthy of charge of causing damage to the interest of the university, misappropriation of university finance, determined disobedience of account code and willful negligence,” stated the report by the inquiry committee.BOX:The annual perspective plan, which has proposed 18 new colleges for the 2020-21 academic year was not tabled by the senate until 10:30 pm on Tuesday. These 18 proposed colleges also include a night college and two Arts/Commerce/Science colleges in Mumbai city and suburbs. The final approval depends on the decision of the university senate, said a spokesperson for MU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/inquiry-committee-highlights-violation-of-univ-act-mu-sends-show-cause-notice-to-2-officials/story-xxeriHFYY4TBxhKLy91DrO.html
25-08-2020||Gurugram||Govt school teacher who developed apps with students selected for national award||For the last two decades, Manoj Singh Lakra has been teaching Hindi to students in government schools across the city while simultaneously encouraging them to embrace technology. Lakhra, currently an elementary headmaster at Government Senior Secondary School, Bajghera, is among the 47 teachers in the country selected for the National Awards to Teachers, 2020. A Najafgarh resident, the 48-year-old is a native of Chudani village in Jhajjar and has been a teacher since 2001. He is best known for his contribution towards the creation of multiple mobile phone applications that are being used across schools in the state. Under his guidance, students of Class 9 created six mobile apps in 2014. Two of these, an app for managing mid-day meals and another for the generation of e-mark sheets, were even adopted by the education department and are being used by schools across the state. In 2017, he collaborated with students in creating a GPS driven solar-plate summer helmet, which was aimed at improving compliance with road safety measures. This particular project was also awarded at the national level. Lakra said that even though he was not trained in science and technology, he was driven by the urge of lending support to students who were not as well-versed with technology as students of private schools. “I might be a Hindi teacher by qualification but I always took an interest in sciences. I took the help of online tutorials and other resources for assisting students. We don’t get much time during the day due to back-to-back classes. Therefore, we hold discussions in extra classes after school hours,” said Lakra. He said that the award was a recognition of the efforts that he had made along with the students. “Children in government schools often don’t come from backgrounds where technological devices are available to all. Despite all the challenges, our students and teachers have been striving to embrace technology and use it for useful purposes. This award will encourage more students and teachers to use science and technology in ways that will benefit society,” said Lakra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/govt-school-teacher-who-developed-apps-with-students-selected-for-national-award/story-zGOIFi8AUd7s3eoCHwuXhN.html
25-08-2020||Gurugram||College students await clarity on practical, final semester exams||College students in state universities are in a fix with uncertainty prevailing over practical exams for first- and second-year students, even as the final semester students await clarity on guidelines for online and offline examinations. While Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, to which government colleges in the city are affiliated, has asked final-year students to choose between online and offline modes of examination, junior students awaiting their results and subsequent promotion. Deepakshi Antil, a final-year student of history honours, said that students are frustrated since a lot of time has already elapsed and wanted the university to issue a final schedule with guidelines. “We have been waiting for clarity for months now. Many of us now want the exams to be over, regardless of the mode. We only hope that the exams are conducted without any chaos and we can start applying for jobs soon,” said Antil. She said that while there were concerns regarding patchy internet connectivity, physical visits to centres would be also fraught with risks. “Students have concerns about both physical safety and online exams but we don’t have much of a choice. We can’t skip the exams if the university chooses to conduct them,” said Antil. MDU, on Tuesday, said that it will be conducting terminal semester exams both in online and offline mode for final-year students of government colleges in September. Students are required to register their preference for the mode of examination by Saturday though an online survey initiated by the university. Students, however, are yet to receive the guidelines regarding the exams.Satyamanyu Yadav, principal of Government College in Sector 9, said that while the department was prepared to conduct examinations in both modes, the schedule would be shared once it gets an idea about the preferences of students. “Some students might have concerns pertaining to online exams. At the same time, we have received many calls from parents and students who have expressed their reservations about physical visits to centres. There are students who can’t travel due to various reasons. All this will be taken into account before exams are conducted,” said Yadav. Besides final-year students, first- and second-year students are also awaiting clarity over the fate of practical exams in some courses. Srishti Yadav, a second-year BSc student of Government Girls College in Sector 14, said that multiple orders pertaining to practical exams had been issued and withdrawn in the past week. “Every alternate day, we are told that practical exams will be conducted and given a schedule, only for the order to be withdrawn. There is no final word, and due to the constant back and forth, our result cannot be declared,” said Yadav. Pooja Khullar, principal, Dronacharya Government College, said that Gurugram University had asked city-based colleges to conduct practical exams for first- and second-year students, but the state government’s guidelines did not permit students to visit colleges. “Practical exams in some courses cannot take place online. At the same time, we are unsure about calling students to colleges due to safety concerns. We are trying to get the exams conducted in an offline-online mode but so far, details regarding the same are yet to be finalised,” said Khullar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/college-students-await-clarity-on-practical-final-semester-exams/story-7W2FZvnKnPI2anTXS0pV2M.html
25-08-2020||Gurugram||Two held for several murders; targeted people for loot||The police on Monday night arrested two men accused of committing several murders in a fortnight over two months ago in Gurugram and Rewari. The police said between June 25 and July 8, the arrested duo and their two aides, who are at large, murdered four people with the alleged intention of robbing them. In all the cases, the accused men stabbed the victims with a knife before robbing them of their belongings including phones and cash. According to the police, the accused men were part of a gang of “seasoned criminals”, who targeted people for the prime purpose of loot and murdered them to minimise chances of getting caught subsequently. The police said at least two of the accused had earlier been arrested and were released on bail. According to the police, the crime branch of Farrukh Nagar arrested the suspects, Ashok Chauhan, 24, hailing from Mainpuri district of Uttar Pradesh, and Mahesh, a native of Katihar, Bihar from New Colony area on Monday night after a tip-off. Preliminary probe has revealed that on June 27 night, the arrested duo and their two aides, identified as Ayush alias Mayank and Vishal, had trespassed into a house in Surya Vihar, Sector 9, and murdered one Guddu Singh, who ran a travel business, and his wife Renu. The couple was tied up and stabbed multiple times with knives, said the police, adding that the suspects stole ₹60,000 from the victims. The following day, the victims’ landlord had filed a complaint after a neighbour had reported that foul smell was emanating from the house and the main door was left ajar. The police had found the dead bodies in separate rooms of the house, in a pool of blood, and booked unidentified persons for murder at Sector 9 A police station. The police said two days before the double murder, on June 25 around 8.30 pm, the four accused men had offered a lift to a mechanic, Ikramul, from Sidharawali in their car and snatched his mobile phone and some cash after stabbing him in the neck with a knife. They had thrown him from the car in a drain in Sector 99 and fled. He survived after he was rushed to the Civil Hospital by commuters. On July 7, Uttam Singh, 19, who worked as a supplier in an automobile company in sector 37, was on his way to his residence in sector 10 A, when he was offered a lift on a motorcycle by Ayush and Vishal. They slit his throat with a knife and stole ₹6,000 cash from him. Singh’s body was found dumped in a vacant plot in Sector 92 and a case of murder was lodged against unidentified persons at Sector 10 A police station. Using a similar modus operandi, on July 8, the same duo had picked up a man from Kapriwas Chowk on the pretext of dropping him to Rewari. He was stabbed to death and the suspects stole his phone and ₹10,000 cash. His body was found dumped in Sector 6, Dharuhera in Rewari. Preet Pal, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, “The accused men have been involved in at least four heinous crimes in Gurugram and Rewari. Prima facie, the suspects said that the motive in these crimes was loot and robbery. Two suspects are still at large. We are checking their criminal record and shall write to police in other jurisdictions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-held-for-several-murders-targeted-people-for-loot/story-rUT0UuOOkeOoiJEU9UHmTI.html
25-08-2020||City||Gurugram: Amid rising Covid-19 cases, containment zones increase from seven to 54||Gurugram With Covid-19 cases ticking up in Gurugram, the district administration has added 47 new containment zones to existing seven zones notified on August 18. There are now 54 containment zones in the district, according to a statement issued by the district health department on Tuesday. “The chief medical officer has observed that the public at large, especially those in congested areas, is not following the health etiquettes and not taking Covid-19 seriously which may be disastrous later,” said the statement. The drastic increase in containment zones comes three days after the state government issued an order for shutting offices, malls and markets on weekends, except those dealing in essential goods. “The current positivity rate is 6.84%, and imposing some restrictions are critical to control the pace at which Covid-19 cases have been increasing. The daily growth rate is 0.69%,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. In the containment zones, movement of people will be restricted except for essential services. There will be barricading at the entry and exit points of a containment zone, officials said. Jacubpura, Sector 12 under Patel Nagar PHC has also been notified as a large outbreak area by the administration.Though the district’s current positivity rate is less than Faridabad’s 10.9% and Panipat’s 8.5%, it is higher than the overall positivity rate of the state which is 5.7%, according to the official figures.In Gurugram, the total count of people infected with Sars-CoV-2 virus has reached 11,162, with 114 new cases reported on Tuesday. Of the total cases, 10,173 have recovered while 858 are active. The Covid-19 toll stands at 131. The number of weekly new cases has started increasing in the district. From 468 cases (August 1-7) to 573 new cases (August 8-14) , Gurugram registered an increase of more than 20% on a weekly basis. The cases rose further from August 15-21 when 648 positive cases were detected in the district, shows the data. From August 22 till Tuesday, at least 406 cases have been reported. Notably, in June, 1,000 average weekly cases were reported. To prevent June-like situations, the health department has identified two to five Covid-19 affected areas under each of the 19 Urban Primary Health Centres ( UPHCs). According to Yadav, testing will be more focused on the worst-affected PHCs. The data shows that between July 28 and August 25, a maximum of 591 cases have been reported from Wazirabad, 543 from Laxman Vihar, 504 from Sohna, 412 from Chanderlok and 342 from Rajiv Nagar. In each of these areas, there are at least five containment zones. Out of the 54, there is one containment zone each in Sohna, Pataudi and Farukkhnagar. According to the statement, a containment zone will be considered de-notified after the tentative period of 14 days provided no new positive case is reported from the zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-amid-rising-covid-19-cases-containment-zones-increase-from-seven-to-54/story-BTdIEdjHPSvegNyDZ7d92M.html

No casualty was reported, but goods and machinery worth lakhs were completely gutted.The firefighters said that a lot of cotton and polyester were stocked in the building that had a single entry due to which they had trouble dousing the flames.The hosiery unit was situated in a narrow street and water was also not available in the nearby areas, so the tenders had to be refilled from Sundar Nagar fire station and King Palace. The fire tenders were refilled nearly 150 times during the operation.Sub-fire officer (SFO) Maninder Singh said, “The operation continued till 5pm on Tuesday. There was so much heat in the building and the flames had also engulfed the basement, due to which it was difficult to enter the building. There was a lot of smoke. The firefighters had to bring down a few walls of the factory for dousing the flames. Nothing much can be said about whether firesafety arrangements were made by the owner or not as everything was damaged, but we saw a few fire extinguishers.”EVENING RUSH DELAYED OPERATIONThe fire fighters deputed at different stations in the city faced trouble reaching at the spot on Monday evening because there was a traffic jam on city roads, as the residents were rushing back to their houses before imposition of night curfew from 7pm onwards.Residents living nearby accused that the firefighters reached an hour late due to which the fire spread. As per information, the tender from Sundar Nagar station reached the spot in 15-20 minutes, while the tenders from other stations took an hour to reach after an alert was received at 6.40pm.Fire station officer Shristi Nath said, “The firefighters from Sundar Nagar station were first to reach the spot. As it was a major fire, the sub-fire officer asked the other stations to send more tenders. It took some time for firefighters from other stations to reach the spot due to evening rush on city roads. However the operation was commenced by the team of Sundar Nagar station.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/40-firefighters-10-tenders-douse-flames-at-ludhiana-hosiery-unit-in-22-hours/story-488nYNTd5ShiUcVlyDXSaI.html
25-08-2020||City||Armed robbers ram stolen SUV into police car in Pataudi||Two armed robbers rammed a stolen SUV into a police car, dragging it for 20 metres, before giving the police a slip by running off into a millet field in Pataudi area on Monday late night, said the police. According to the police, two gunshots were fired by the policemen in defence and one of them hit the bonnet of the SUV driven by the suspects. No arrests have been made so far. According to the police, around 8.30pm, Vinod Saharan, a Hisar resident, was returning home after meeting a friend in Sector 4, IMT Manesar. He had parked his car near Aliyar Chowk for an errand, when one of the suspects allegedly snatched his car keys and decamped with his SUV. The police said Saharan filed a police complaint at IMT Manesar police station, following which the crime branch in Manesar was informed. The police said the stolen car had a GPS device installed and using assistance from the local police, the crime branch traced the location of the stolen car to Faridpur Karola Road in Pataudi by 11.30pm. In the FIR registered on the complaint of a police official at Pataudi, the official stated that when crime branch officials reached the location in Pataudi, they signalled the suspects to stop the car. “Instead of stopping, they drove the stolen car towards us and rammed it head on into the police car, which was dragged for 20 metres and pushed off the road. Two armed suspects waved a gun and threatened to shoot at us. One of the police officials fired two gunshots at the tyres of the SUV in retaliation. A gunshot hit the bonnet while the other hit the road,” stated the police official. The police said since the doors of their vehicle got jammed due to the collision, the suspects ran off into the nearby millet and cotton fields and managed to escape. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, “An extensive search operation was carried out by the police for over four hours but the suspects took advantage of the dark and managed to escape. The SUV has been recovered.” A case was registered against the unidentified suspects under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) , 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code, relevant sections of The Arms Act and section 3 of The Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act at the Pataudi police station early morning on Tuesday said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/armed-robbers-ram-stolen-suv-into-police-car-in-pataudi/story-zSOfYL3S7PFzVh9WsSLEGI.html
25-08-2020||Gurugram||Developer of Sector 67 housing complex issued notice after residents complain of deficiencies||A team from the department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Tuesday visited Shree Vardhman Mantra housing project in Sector 67 and inspected the site, after 850 families living in the residential complex raised multiple issues such as lack of occupation certificate, erratic power connection and high maintenance charges. The residents said that they had raised the matter with the department several times but no action was taken. Shree Vardhman project in Sector 67 was launched in 2010 and delivery of flats was promised in 2014 but, in reality, the possession was given to buyers only in 2019, said the residents. The project has around 1,350 flats, out which 850 have been handed over to buyers. This was the first low-cost affordable housing project in Gurugram under the policy which was in force prior to 2014.Pawan Kaushik, general secretary, Shree Vardhman Builder Buyers Association, said the colony doesn’t have proper residential power connection and depends on commercial connection for which the charges are high. “The colony depends on diesel generators for around 13 to 14 hours daily and it costs around ₹23 per unit, which is very expensive,” he said. Another resident said that the colony is yet to receive the occupancy certificate despite 850 families living there. “The club has not been constructed and the residents have to pay ₹2,800 per month as maintenance fee despite getting little service in return. We want the authorities to take action for the deficiency in services and infrastructure,” he said. RS Bhath, district town planner (DTP), who visited the colony in Sector 67, said that he inspected the Shree Vardhman Mantra project spread over 11 acres and listened to problems of residents. “The residents have complained about no regular power connection, lack of occupancy certificate and high maintenance charges. We have issued a notice to.developer to reply within a week. All efforts would be made to resolve the issues of residents,” he said.Sachin Jain, director, Shree Vardhman Group, which has developed the project, did not reply to phone calls and messages by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtp-issues-notice-to-developer-of-housing-complex-in-sector-67-regarding-deficiencies-in-project/story-v2LcCwalDXzrNIZ16GSy6L.html
25-08-2020||Gurugram||Police to launch campaign against underage driving, seek help from schools||Two days after a minor drove his car into a motorcycle killing its 49-year-old rider near Cybercity, police said that they will launch a campaign on Friday to discourage underage driving and will also seek the help of schools.Police said they will take strict action against parents whose wards were caught driving and the vehicles will be impounded with hefty fines. Under the Motor Vehicles Act, which was amended last year, the offence invites a penalty of ₹25,000. Not only is the offender tried in a juvenile court, even the parents/guardians face up to three-year imprisonment. The vehicle’s registration is also cancelled.There have been several accidents in Gurugram over the last few years in which people have lost their lives due to minors driving vehicles. In 2019, the offence had caused 401 fatalities, the year before that it was 469, and in 2017 it was 484.Gurugram’s police commissioner KK Rao said, “We have decided to start a campaign starting Friday where we have decided to take strict action against them and their parents for their irresponsible approach and risking life of others.”Police said despite repeated attempts and special drives, many parents do not take the issue seriously and still allow their children to drive without even attaining a driving licence. Rao said the parents of erring children will be called to the police station after they are caught as police cannot take the minor to a police station and the vehicle will be impounded and will be penalised. Chander Mohan, deputy commissioner of police (East), said, “We have given enough warnings but now any child caught driving even inside the residential will be apprehended. Parents are allowing them to drive for their own convenience to go to tuition or visiting their friend’s place but now this practice will need to be stopped.” Mohan said they were also contacting school principals and will request them to mention in their online classes. “The students will not be allowed to take part in any of the school’s curricular activities if caught driving and will be punished by the school management,” he said.Sudha Goyal, director, Scottish High International School, said that they have not received any official order from the police but they will start informing parents starting Wednesday through their online classes. “We will support police in this campaign and will send circular to parents to ensure they do not allow students to drive,” she said. Rohit Mann, director, Lancers International School said that they will also inform parents. “We will try to engage children in online activities regarding the underage driving and will plan a quiz around this subject so that it’s easier for them to understand why they should not drive before the licence age,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/police-to-launch-campaign-against-underage-driving-seek-help-from-schools/story-v46zMlm2MTTQ4AzhIjKANK.html

25-08-2020||City||Action likely against illegal farmhouses on Aravalli land in Bandhwari||Gurugram The department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Tuesday morning carried out a site inspection of Bandhwari village, about 20km from Gurugram city, where several farmhouses are alleged to have come up illegally on Aravalli land.Officials said that action would be taken against those farmhouses which have been built in violation of multiple environmental and municipal laws. Besides, such structures also violate the Supreme Court’s directives calling for protection of the Aravalli range. RS Bath, district town planner who oversaw the inspection, said that he found five or six fully constructed farmhouses, with similar number of structures under construction. In addition, boundary walls have been erected at 10 other places to demarcate individual plots, he said. “Two to three tin sheds and electricity poles were also found erected in some of the plots. These are clear violations of the Haryana Controlled Areas Act (1963) as well as the Haryana Urban Areas Act (1975) which come under the purview of the town and country planning department and the municipal corporation. We have apprised the DTCP director of the matter. Action will be taken as per law immediately,” said Bath.A district-level DTCP official, requesting anonymity, said, “We will have to track down the individual violators and serve them show cause notices as per the law. The process leading to demolition of the illegal structures will take three to four weeks.” The official added that the department was also trying to ascertain the status of an access road carved out in the area through a now flattened Aravalli hillock. The district town planner said that the department is trying to “determine whether the road comes under the purview of the revenue department, so action can be taken accordingly”.“There seems to be no prior permission or clearance for these constructions in Bandhwari. Change of land use in Gurugram requires our express permission, which has not been granted to any of the properties,” Bath said. The district forest department, too, is preparing a report to ascertain whether any part of the encroachments lie on forest land. “It does not seem like it, but we are scrutinising revenue records just to make sure. We are also liable to take action if any trees have been felled in the area without permission. Even if the land is not notified under Punjab Land Preservation Act (1900), which gives it legal forest status, the land is largely ‘gair mumkin pahar’, or Aravalli land, as per a May 1992 notification by the Union environment ministry. One needs permission from the Centre to do any non-forestry activity in the area,” said Jai Kumar, district forest officer, Gurugram.The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), which is empowered to enforce the Aravalli Notification, 1992, in Gurugram, said it is probing the matter of unauthorised farmhouses coming up in the district. “If there has been any unauthorised construction on gair mumkin pahad land, or any other land use category that is classified as Aravalli, we will initiate prosecution under the Enviornment Protection Act (1986) against the violators,” said Kuldeep Singh, HSPCB’s regional officer in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/action-likely-against-illegal-farmhouses-on-aravalli-land-in-bandhwari/story-Fvw7ct9Wbdl946tpOnAeLJ.html
25-08-2020||City||Three robberies reported along Ambala-Delhi highway in 72 hours||Three robberies have been reported within 72 hours on the Ambala-Delhi highway, police said on Tuesday.In the recent case, a Rohtak man’s car was snatched in broad daylight in Ambala Cantonment on Monday. The incident happened when Bharat, a civil engineer from Mumbai, was travelling to Rohtak from Chandigarh along with his wife, and had halted at a showroom on the highway.The duo took the car along with his wife’s purse containing ₹1.7 lakh, a mobile phone, two gold rings and other cards and documents, Bharat told the police.

25-08-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC waiting on 390 more trucks to begin 100% waste segregation at source||A quick turnaround in the municipal corporation’s poor waste management record in the city is unlikely with MC officials claiming that complete waste segregation will begin only after an additional 390 waste segregation trucks are bought.It will take at least two months before the trucks are bought and made operational. Currently, the civic body has 100 waste segregation vehicles, but many of these couldn’t be used because the segregation drive failed to kickstart in many sectors.Chandigarh failed to break into top 10 in the Swachh Survekshan 2020 rankings mainly because of poor waste management. City’s score in the service-level progress parameter, which mainly comprises performance in solid waste management, dropped from 90% last year to 76.33% this year.The MC has a poor track record in waste collection, segregation and processing. More than 5 lakh metric tonne (MT) legacy waste is dumped at Dadumajra site, and an additional 25,000 MT is lying at the waste processing plant in there. Lack of segregation at source was one of the major disputes between the private firm, earlier running the plant, and the MC.MC commissioner KK Yadav said, “As soon as we get the 390 waste segregation vehicles, we will begin with the perfect model under which 100% segregation at source will be done. Right now, it is an average model.”‘TECHNICAL ISSUES LED TO DELAY’On the delay in procuring the vehicles, Yadav said, “First, there was an issue regarding compliance with BS-VI norms. Then the pandemic hit. There were also some technical issues with the tender floated for procuring the vehicles. We are anticipating that by October we will get them.”The procurement of the additional 390 vehicles is still pending with the technical committee of Chandigarh Smart City Limited. Recently, CSCL had approved two firms in the technical bid out of the four that had applied. After financial bids are opened, the allotment of tender will take place.Even though it is yet to begin the segregation drive in urban areas, the MC had submitted with the Swachh Bharat Mission that 92.3% waste was segregated at source and 95% was being processed.In a report of the Centre for Science and Environment on Solid Waste Management released by the Swachh Bharat Mission, the MC had submitted that 100% waste segregation at source had been implemented in 24 of the 26 wards in the city.The report stated that against 479 MT waste produced in the city in a day, 455 MT was processed daily. But in reality, only 120 MT is being processed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-waiting-on-390-more-trucks-to-begin-100-waste-segregation-at-source/story-wEqnMeAeleSLGGahlnwMvL.html

The three persons booked for criminal conspiracy include the husband of Modinagar MLA. Denying the allegations, the MLA hinted at political conspiracy to frame her husband.On Monday evening, 26-year-old Akshay Kumar was called outside his house by a few persons who fired several gunshots at him and fled the spot (near Tibra road in Modinagar town). The police said the victim was rushed to the hospital which is run by the MLA Dr Manju Siwach and her husband Dr Devendra Siwach. The victim was declared brought dead at the hospital.“The victim suffered several gunshots and succumbed to the injuries. His body was sent for an autopsy. Soon after the incident, local residents along with the victim’s family members jammed the main road for about an hour, but left the spot after being pacified by the police. They gave a police complaint and named eight persons, including three for criminal conspiracy,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural).The victim was arrested last year in a murder case and was out on bail on health grounds, the police said.The five persons named in the FIR for murder and rioting are Ashwini Singh, Vikas Singh, Sappu Gurjar, Amit Kumar alias Chuhiya and Aditya Kumar alias Vasu. The three named for criminal conspiracy are Ruby Singh, who is wife of suspect Vikas, Dr Devendra Shiwach, and Ashish Kumar who is the husband of a local pradhan of Tibra village. “The victim has several cases against his name and had been to jail for killing a man named Dipendra Kumar alias Dippan . Kumar was granted bail in November on health grounds,” Jadaun added.The police said that most of the suspects named in the FIR were from Dipendra’s family or were known to him.“Ruby Dipendra’s sister and Vikas’ wife. Dipendra was murdered in April , 2019 and since then Akshay had been in jail and came out on bail in November, 2019. Earlier, Akshay and Dipendra were friends but they became rivals after a dispute regarding a canteen which they ran together,” Jadaun added.MLA Dr Manju Siwach, denied all charges against her husband and said that it is up to the police to conduct a free and fair probe.“I can only say that my husband’s name has been dragged unnecessarily into the incident. The victim’s family had brought him to our hospital and the on-duty doctor declared him brought dead. After that, my husband also had a look at the patient but he was already dead. Out of nowhere, onTuesday the victim’s family has named my husband in the case. I am sure that it is due to some political motives,” Dr Manju Siwach, said. “One of the reasons I could think of is that after the last year’s murder case, Akshay’s family had approached us to pressurise the police to lodge a counter FIR against Dipendra’s family. But we had denied to interfere in the matter and to take any side. Now, I want the police to probe the ongoing case in a free and fair manner ,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/26-year-old-gunned-down-in-modinagar-victim-s-family-names-mla-s-husband-in-conspiracy/story-NdTCIbZElafnwomrIIdAbK.html
25-08-2020||Noida||Region likely to witness heavy rainfall from Wednesday||Noida and Ghaziabad are likely to experience another spell of moderate to heavy rainfall from Wednesday evening, according to forecasts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).According to the weather analysts, the rains will last at least till Friday and are likely to be as intense as the downpour that marred Noida and Ghaziabad last week. The IMD added that the rainfall may lead to disruption of traffic flow in the two cities with many major roads expected to be inundated in the next two days.“The low-pressure monsoon line of the trough is moving towards Delhi-NCR region and there are chances of convergence of favourable monsoon winds over the region over the next three days(starting Wednesday). Due to such favourable weather conditions, the rainfall activities are likely to increase over the entire region including the NCR and western Uttar Pradesh that includes Noida and Ghaziabad. There are high chances of moderate to heavy rainfall over the next three days. The major rainfall activity is likely to happen on Thursday. The rainfall will, however, not cease and continue for some more days,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. “Heavy rains also could lead to water-logging in low lying areas, street and roads in the two cities. It’s advisable to check traffic congestion before stepping outside,” he added.The rainfall below 15mm is considered light, between 15 and 64.5 mm is moderate and above 64.5mm is heavy.The low-pressure monsoon line which leads to the rains in the region oscillates around north-west India. According to the IMD, while it’s moving towards Delhi-NCR, there are also chances of convergence of moist easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal and south-westerly winds from the Arabian sea. The cumulative effect of the convergence and monsoon trough over NCR, like last week’s heavy rainfall, is likely to cause rainfall, the IMD official said.Till Tuesday, Gautam Budh Nagar had witnessed an average daily rainfall (starting June 1) of 65.3mm (34.2 mm till Thursday last week) against an expected 404.2 mm, putting the district at an 85% deficit. The neighbouring Ghaziabad district has experienced an average daily rainfall of 165.9mm— a 59% deficit.Meanwhile, the maximum temperatures are likely to hover around 30 degrees in the next few days, officials said.On Tuesday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 32.2 degree Celsius, against 34.2 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The minimum temperature was at 25.8 degrees Celsius against 26.2 degrees a day earlier. The humidity levels oscillated between 74% and 85%.Meanwhile, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Tuesday recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 47, on a scaled of 0 to 500, in Noida. This so far this year, has been the second time when the city experienced air quality in the ‘good’ category. The first time the city breathed ‘good’ air was on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/region-likely-to-witness-heavy-rainfall-from-wednesday/story-ZrPaKbEpaGWp9CoFR0Y7iM.html

25-08-2020||City||Noida: Tea vendor alleges assault by two cops; inquiry ordered||Noida The Gautam Budh Nagar police have ordered an inquiry against a sub-inspector and a constable deployed with Sector 20 police station after a tea vendor alleged that they assaulted him and asked for money. The incident came to fore on Monday when a purported audio of the vendor was circulated on social media. In the audio, he has claimed that a sub-inspector of the Atta police post and a constable assaulted him when he tried to open his shop. He has also alleged that the two cops demanded money. “They first asked me for ₹10,000 and settled on ₹5,000. I tried to give them less, but they didn’t take it. Eventually I didn’t pay them,” said the victim in his audio. The audio was shared on the Noida police’s social media page after which they took cognizance of the matter. The commissioner of police handed over the inquiry into the matter to Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police, zone 1. “I have spoken to the victim and the person who shared the audio on social media. Their statements have been recorded. It seems the personnel in question had gone to the area for a raid on August 23, and that is when the incident allegedly occurred. I will speak to the cops in question as well and then we will know more about the incident,” said the ACP.

But to make it easy for students during the times of Covid-19 pandemic, the CET will not be conducted in pen-and-paper mode. It will be conducted in computer mode through the Ministry of Education body EdCIL, which is similar to NTA.” Earlier, the university conducted entrance tests in pen-paper mode by itself.Verma also said, “All measures of social distancing and sanitization will be taken at these centres so that students can safely write their papers.”As per the notification signed by controller of examinations Prodyut Bhattacharya, the exams will be conducted at four centres — Delhi-NCR, Chandigarh, Lucknow, and Jaipur.

25-08-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana fourth Punjab district to launch Tree for Gun scheme||The Tree for Gun scheme was launched here on Tuesday to check groundwater depletion by planting saplings, making Ludhiana the fourth district after Ferozepur, Patiala and Sangrur to launch this nature friendly initiative.Launching the scheme at the local district administrative complex, divisional commissioner Chander Gaind, who was accompanied by Ludhiana DC Varinder Kumar Sharma and other officials, said that the motive was to encourage people to plant saplings besides increasing the green cover of the district by growing at least 54,000 saplings annually.Rolling out the plan to plant 10 saplings for getting a gun licence to unite people against deforestation, Gaind, who had launched the initiative in Patiala in July, said people applying for licences will be required to submit a selfie with each sapling as proof.After a month, before the application is sent for police clearance and dope test, the applicant will have to furnish fresh photographs as evidence of the health of the plants, he added.32,111 licences issuedThe divisional commissioner said the district administration had issued 32,111 arms licences till date and received 230 applications for licences. More than 10,000 applicants applied to the administration annually to renew their licences. Gaind said keeping in view this figure; as many as 53,425 saplings could be planted in the district per annum and 2.64 lakh saplings at the state level.The country had 732 districts and if each district gets 200 such applications then around one crore saplings could be planted in the country, which would mean greening a sizeable area.Applicants not having their own land could choose public places (Educational Institutions, religious places, spots near roads) for the saplings, provided they took the responsibility for its nurturing and care. Plants requiring low water consumption such as Amla, Neem, Babool, Seesham etc should be planted to contribute towards Jal Shakti Abhiyan, Gaind advised, urging people to avoid species such as eucalyptus.Speaking on the occasion, Sharma assured Gaind of the programme’s success in the district, with proper execution and monitoring of the planted trees and random checking by employees concerned to ensure compulsory plantation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-fourth-punjab-district-to-launch-tree-for-gun-scheme/story-LcFX40GGjqFTW93s0NcFrK.html

The DCW in a statement said when a team of its members and local police reached the spot, the woman was lying on the floor with her feet bound by iron chains. The woman lives with her three children aged 5, 7 and 1 years. She alleged that her husband had been torturing her and she has been kept chained for the past six months. The DCW said it got to know about the woman from a ground volunteer, who informed the commission that the woman was kept chained and was living in a miserable condition in Trilokpuri. “ The woman has been married for 11 years. The room in which the woman was kept had no fan and had a terrible stench as she was made to lie in her own excreta. She was tortured and beaten so brutally that her mental health has also deteriorated. Her husband was not in the house when the team reached there and found the woman lying in torn clothes,” a DCW member said. A video shared by the DCW shows the woman sitting on the floor, bound by iron chains with a lock. In the video, the woman is heard saying, while pointing to the wounds on her legs, “I have been married for 11 years. After I had my third child, my husband and in-laws who live nearby started torturing me. My husband beats me up badly.” According to DCW officials, the woman’s husband runs a flour mill. “The woman was perfectly fine earlier and it was after the third child that her husband and in-laws started torturing her,” a DCW member said. The DCW also spoke to the children, who confirmed that their father beats up their mother. The woman was freed in the morning and taken to Kalyanpuri police station. Later she was taken to a hospital for treatment. DCW said they will help in her rehabilitation.A senior police officer said, “The woman’s statement has been recorded.

25-08-2020||City||Delhi riots: Court dismisses bail plea of law student||New Delhi: A Delhi court on Tuesday dismissed a bail application of an accused, arrested in two cases related to communal violence in north-east Delhi in February, saying he should have been more vigilant towards his conduct being a law student.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav dismissed the bail pleas of Tanveer Malik in cases related to two persons receiving gunshot injuries during the riots in Dayalpur area on February 25.Ajay (aged about 30 years) and Prince (19) received gunshot injuries during the communal violence. The court said Malik has been clearly identified to be part of “riotous mob” by prosecution witnesses Prashant, Harish Chander, Kuldeep Bansal, constable Pawan and constable Saudan in both the cases.“It is apparent on record that the injured and public witnesses are persons from the same locality. The applicant (Malik), if released on bail at this stage, then the possibility of him threatening or intimidating the public witnesses cannot be ruled out.“It makes no difference at this stage that the applicant is entitled to bail just because he is a law student or that his father is a practising lawyer. In that case, he should have been more vigilant towards his conduct. He is clearly seen involved in at least three cases of rioting,” the court said in its order.During the hearing held through video conferencing, advocate Javed Akhtar, appearing for Malik, told the court that no recovery of any sort has been effected from him and was not visible in any of the CCTV footage.The advocate further argued that the call detail record location relied upon by the police clearly showed that at or around the place of incident, he was busy talking to his friends and family members.Malik was initially arrested in another case wherein one Ajay Goswami had suffered gunshot injuries during the riots, his lawyer said.Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the state, opposed the bail application saying the case was “sensitive” in nature, which involved the riots around the house of main accused Tahir Hussain. The public prosecutor further claimed that the accused persons in furtherance of criminal conspiracy committed the act of riots in the area of Khajuri Khas and Dayalpur and a “sense of terror” was created in the minds of general public. They not only mobilized the mob into a group of rioters by way of provoking their religious feelings, but also provided logistic support like lathis, dandas, stones, acids, knives, swords, fire arms, pistols, for committing riots in the area and to eliminate the members of other Community, Prasad claimed.He further said that the CDR of the accused duly showed his presence at the spot on the day of incident and he has been clearly and categorically identified by the injured persons to be a part of the riotous mob, who was allegedly present near the house of Hussain, having a gun in his hand and firing indiscriminately. The alleged role attributed to Malik in the matter by the witnesses was of indiscriminately firing at the persons belonging to other community and inciting the religious feelings of a particular community so as to cause maximum damage to the persons of other community, the public prosecutor said.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

25-08-2020||City||Pipeline project on CISF road delayed by four months, daily commuters suffer||The Covid-19 pandemic has affected the UP Jal Nigam’s plan to flow treated wastewater into the Hindon river. The project, that was to be completed by July, now is likely to be completed only by the end of November. The pipelines would take water from three sewage treatment plants (STPs) at Indirapuram of capacities 56 million litres a day (mLD), 48MLD and 72 MLD. Work began in February, but the pandemic and the ensuing lockdown hampered its progress. “There was no work for about two to three months due to the lockdown. We also have to undertake shifting of drains and the Ganga water pipelines in the process. We think that the work will be expedited in October when Ganga water supplies are stopped due to maintenance of the Upper Ganga Canal,” said GS Srivastava, chief engineer of UP Jal Nigam. He added that the work was about 60% complete at present. The project was taken up under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme. At present, the treated water from the three STPs is taken through a drain but the high volume of discharge from the three STPs often overflooded the CISF Road. For the project, one side of the CISF Road was dug up, causing major snarls over a 2.5-km stretch. The road caters to traffic from the Mohan Nagar Link Road, Hindon canal rod, Vasundhara and Indirapuram and connects it directly to NH-9. “As a result of the work, one side of the CISF Road is closed and the other side caters to both side traffic. During peak hours, there are frequent jams. In monsoon season, the situation becomes worse,” said BK Pandey, a resident of Vaishali. “The entire area is in a complete mess and affects large number of commuters and residents in Indirapuram. We had suggested that the CISF Road be made a one-way and the traffic from Link Road and Vasundhra should be diverted to Canal Road. But the traffic police has not responded,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of federation of association of apartment owners. The traffic police on their part said that their personnel have been put on duty on the CISF Road. “The diversion is not feasible as it will lead to longer travel for those who wish to go to nearby areas in Indirapuram. Further, there are chances that many vehicles will move on internal roads of Indirapuram locality and create problems for local residents,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic). “At the CISF Road, there are low lying areas which results in water logging during rain. This often leads to slow traffic. Our personnel remain deployed to control traffic. At present we have no alternative but to control traffic through our personnel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pipeline-project-on-cisf-road-delayed-by-four-months-daily-commuters-suffer/story-4IKbQJfLYKaqphdWH1V02M.html

Street vendors operate in many developed nations such as the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. We will develop a system for setting up weekly markets so that tourists from countries like the US visit our weekly markets. Our weekly markets will be presented as one of the most attractive tourist places in Delhi,” he said.Kejriwal held the meeting to take feedback on how weekly markets are operating after the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on August 21 allowed them to operate for a week on a trial basis.The chief minister said the Delhi government will soon create a proper management system so that more and more people are attracted to the city’s weekly markets. He took the example of Chandni Chowk, which has been redeveloped to make it more pedestrian-friendly and prohibit motor vehicles on a 1.5-km stretch.“We have some restrictions on us now because of Corona, but we will do this as soon as the situation settles down a little. I also realise that a lot of you are going through a difficult phase, but we have to support each other in this phase,” he said.Kejriwal requested the associations to maintain social distancing in the markets. “If you fail to do that, government officials might pressure you or take action against you, and this will affect your customer strength. Please appoint your volunteers with the heads of weekly markets for maintaining social distancing in the markets,” he said.The chief minister said public opinion is very important for businesses, and if the public starts complaining about no social distancing in the markets, it will pose a problem in the future.“This is also important so that the opening of markets on a trial basis is soon converted into a permanent plan by the lieutenant-governor (LG), and I will be able to advocate for the permanent opening of all weekly markets in Delhi. We have many plans for operating weekly markets in the city,” Kejriwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/can-make-our-weekly-markets-tourist-attractions-kejriwal/story-BSlpi8KfU4PBgwHScNPLYP.html

Officials of the district health department said the survey will start from August 28 and will go on for five days wherein a total of at least 1,500 people in the age group of 18-59 years will be tested for antibodies. “The five-day long survey will start from August 28. We have been asked to form 10 teams comprising of one doctor besides other staff for sample collection. Teams from King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow will also come to the district for the survey. We are expecting that about 1,500 samples to be taken up with prior consent for testing during the survey. The samples will be sent to KGMU for testing,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.Last week, the Uttar Pradesh government had decided to launch serological surveillance or sero-surveillance in 11 districts, including Ghaziabad. The other districts are Kanpur City, Varanasi, Ghaziabad, Agra, Kaushambi, Prayagraj, Gorakhpur, Meerut, Moradabad, Lucknow and Baghpat, During the exercise, random people will also be checked for antibodies for others viral infections such as hepatitis-B and hepatitis-C simultaneously.Initially, the sero survey was supposed to start from August 26, but will now start from August 28 in the state.As per a list sent by the state health department, the survey will be conducted in 45 wards in Ghaziabadout of which 39 are in urban areas. The 39 urban wards also include 12 wards that falling under the jurisdiction of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation area. The twelve wards are: Garima Garden (ward 64), Shalimar Garden Main (ward 37), DLF Colony (ward 10), Makanpur, near Indirapuram, (ward 57), Govindpuram (ward 30), Ghookhna (ward 13), Dundahera, near Crossings Republik, (ward 27), Nehru Nagar 2(ward 8), Patel Nagar (ward 19), Arthala (ward 38), Sudamapuri (ward 7) and Rahul Vihar (Siddharth Vihar) (ward 2).Apart from these 12 wards, three wards under Dasna nagar panchayat, five under nagar palika of Loni, seven wards in Muradnagar, six under Modinagar nagar palika, and three nagar panchayat of Niwari among others will be included in the sero survey.The 45 different wards have an overall population of about 70,493 persons.Overall, across the 11 districts, the state officials have selected 495 wards for the sero-surveillance.A Covid-19 serological survey checks for an immune response against the coronavirus in the form of antibodies in the blood of a random sample of the population. It can help establish how far the disease had spread and how many people fought the virus without showing symptoms.Cities such as Delhi and Mumbai too had conducted the exercises. The latest in Delhi had found that around 29% of the population had antibodies to fight off the virus.Antibodies generally appear around two weeks after a person has been infected and is expected to last several months. “The survey will help in assessing the status of immunity which has developed in a population which has been exposed to Covid-19. Assessment of their age group, work and travel history will also be made. This is will help us form policies for prevention and treatment. The areas have been selected on random basis,” an officer from the state health department, who did not wish to be named, said.In Ghaziabad, the total Covid-19 cases till August 25 stood at 7,464 which is about 0.16% out of the district’s total population of 44 lakh (official estimate).

On August 24, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey directed incident commanders (who supervise containment zones) to carry out surprise inspection in their respective zones. They found 11 senior officers -- designated as magistrates to supervise the surveillance -- missing from duty. “I have directed that the one-day salary of the 11 officers be withheld and they have also been asked to submit their clarification with regard to their absence from the duty. Unit in-charges and supervisors too were found missing and their salaries will be withheld till further orders. The surprise inspections will be conducted in future too and action will be taken accordingly,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. The 861 surveillance teams are supervised by 174 supervisors who in turn report to 23 magistrates. The 11 erring officers, according to the list provided by the district administration include the district’s top officers for basic education, statistics, supplies, agriculture, excise, panchayati raj, horticulture, the chief engineer of UP Jal Nigam, the additional regional transport officer (enforcement), the assistant director (electrical safety), and the chief veterinary officer. According to official records, the surveillance teams since July 13 have surveyed about 282,945 people and found 63 suspected cases till August 25. Another survey conducted by block level officers in the district scanned 1,954,103 and could identify only 14 Covid-19 positive cases between June 1 to August 25. The findings that officers have been lax at their jobs have put question marks over these results. This prompted the district administration to clamp down on such allegations. “When we have deployed people to identify cases, we need results in terms of identification of possible positive cases in order to break the chain of infection,” said Pandey. “Further, I have also directed the surveillance teams to also gather information of people with co-morbid conditions so that they do not end up with health complication.”He added that 11,655 persons receiving old age pensions and another 17,253 retired persons in the district would also be brought under the ambit of surveys. During a special survey, on directions of the UP government, conducted from July 2 to July 12, the surveillance teams had gathered information of about 13748 persons having different co-morbid conditions like diabetes (8002), blood pressure (4254), cancer (227), heart ailments (988) and kidney ailments (277) across the district which surveying 38.38 lakh population. Further, the administration has also directed that patients in home isolation should be supplied with the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and deworming tablets ivermectin, as per a state government order of August 6. Both are not a cure for Covid-19, but had been shown to help some patients. They do, however, come with restrictions and government agencies expect patients to inform them of any underlying conditions before they administer the drugs.The rapid response teams (RRTs) have been asked to provide government supply of HCQ and Ivermectin to patients in home isolation and also to their caregiver and family members. The HCQ is not to be given to patients with co-morbidities and both medicines should not be given to children and pregnant women. The six RRTs at our integrated command and control centre will daily monitor whether the field RRT teams have supplied these medicines to patients in home isolation or not,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. The district magistrate said that even if the patients in home isolation purchased the HCQ and Ivermectin on their own, it will be ensured that RRT teams will provide them with free government supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/11-officers-found-missing-from-covid-19-duties-dm-orders-their-salaries-be-cut/story-9SYmIAGh4AcJo9TbiP7bHI.html

25-08-2020||Chandigarh||PAU to hold virtual kisan mela for Rabi season||Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) will be cancelling its kisan mela (farmers’ fair) for the Rabi season and instead organising a virtual mela because of social distancing issues during the Covid-19 pandemic.The university, which had earlier cancelled the mela for Kharif crops in March, will reach out to farmers through mobile applications, webinars and YouTube videos.PAU experts are planning to hold a month-long programme to educate people on various farming techniques and methods to be adopted in the coming season.Confirming the development, PAU vice-chancellor (VC) Baldev Singh Dhillon said, “We have decided to bring the kisan mela to farmers’ houses across the northern region with the help of technology.”He said as necessity was the mother of all inventions, PAU was “laying emphasis on communication technology tools such as PAU Kisan App, PAU Kisan Portal, PAU Farm inputs, Kheti Sandesh, PAU agro advisory bulletin, PAU live streaming Webinar, facebook page, PAU YouTube channel, WhatsApp groups and Kisan mobile advisory service (KMAS) developed by PAU for rapid diffusion of improved agriculture knowledge to farming communities.” The PAU kisan melas, which began as kisan divas in 1967 at Gurdaspur, attract a large number of farmers from across and outside the state. Over three lakh farmers were estimated to have visited the two-day mela in Ludhiana in September last year.The fairs also also generate huge revenues for the university as many national and international companies vie for space to display their products.Workshop on ZoomIn order to expand its digital footprint, PAU’s Directorate of Extension Education also conducted its annual research and extension specialists’ workshop on Rabi Crops online. It was organised by the Directorate of Extension Education, at PAU through the online Zoom application.In his address, the chief guest, Dr Dhillon expressed delight at the impressive online presence of 408 participants and congratulated the scientists of PAU, kisan vikas kendras (KVKs), the agriculture department and the farmers for accomplishing the task of wheat harvesting and marketing in an exemplary manner, despite the nationwide lockdown.Dr Dhillon also said deliberations were continuing on how Rabi crops would be made available to farmers. “Online payment modes are being discussed. We are thinking of sending the seeds at KVKs located across the state,” he added.Kharif is harvested in September and rice is the principal Kharif crop. Rabi is sown after October and its principal crop is wheat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pau-to-hold-virtual-kisan-mela-for-rabi-season/story-2byQfNDjOEjt8alayCXeJO.html

The accused, who dropped out of school after Class 5, was produced before the juvenile justice board and sent to a reformation home. His mother works in a factory while the father is bedridden, said police.It was around 9:30am that the victim’s grandmother made a call to the police control room to report the incident at Deep Complex in Hallomajra.CCTV footage showed the two chasing each other. The accused tripped following which they came to blows. He can later be seen going home and returning with a kitchen knife with which he stabbed his friend in the back.Police rushed the victim to hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Cops said he used stay with his father and grandmother after his mother deserted the family. On getting a lead that the accused had run towards a forest area near the mosque in Ram Darbar, police launched a search operation. The boy, however, had returned to Hallomajra and was apprehended later. The knife was also recovered from the forest area on revelation made by him. The juvenile reportedly told police that the two had an argument on Monday too, and his friend had slapped him. It was to avenge the slap that he stabbed him, he allegedly said. A case of murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered at the Sector 31 police station. The victim’s body is kept in the mortuary and the postmortem would be conducted after receiving his Covid-19 test report, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/juvenile-stabs-14-yr-old-friend-to-death-to-avenge-slap-in-chandigarh-s-hallomajra/story-HBJOJ8dkISlorH40VHzFrK.html

NDRF commandant Alok Kumar who carried out the rescue operation said, “We felt happy to rescue Bangi safe and sound. Once we located him with the help of sniffer dogs, we ensured that the debris removal work was done smoothly and slowly as there was a possibility of debris falling on the head. He is fine and doing well.” While Bangi suffered minor injuries, his first reaction after being brought out of the debris was to smile at his rescuers, the NDRF team said.According to Prajit Salunke of the Salunke Rescue Team, a private group from Mahad, Bangi was under a collapsed piece of wall. “He smiled at us and it was a beautiful sight. The citizens and rescue workers clapped for he was rescued alive,” said Salunke. The child was immediately bundled into an ambulance and taken to the hospital where he inquired about his mother.His mother is one of deceased, whose body was retrieved by the NDRF earlier during the day. His paternal aunt Rupasa said Bangi was trapped under the debris along with his two sisters and mother. “His sisters are still trapped under the rubble. I pray for everyone’s survival,” she said. A 10-year-old building collapsed on Monday evening with 25 people initially trapped. The NDRF has so far rescued seven persons while the search is still on for others. District collector Nidhi Chaudhary said, “Despite the challenges, the administration supported by all the stakeholders did a good a job in rescuing the child. We are doing our level best to remove the debris from the spot at the earliest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-19-hours-under-debris-4-year-old-rescued-from-mahad-building-collapse/story-VzIYMVlXj1iQY9saWRx1OP.html

25-08-2020||City||Mahad incident revives tragic memories of Savitri river bridge collapse||Mahad  When the five-storied building in Mahad came crashing down on Monday, many in this industrial town recalled how the swollen Savitri river had claimed 40 lives in August of 2016. It was 10 pm on August 2 when 106-year-old bridge on the Savitri river near Mahad collapsed. Two state transport buses and an SUV carrying at least 40 people were washed away as the driver did not gauge that a portion of the road had given way. Some bodies were recovered from as far as 150km from the spot during an 11-day long search and rescue operation. While the British era bridge on the Savitri was too old, there is a common link between the two incidents. Despite the bridge being old, the government failed to carry out a structural audit. In the latest incident, the building constructed in 2013 was not old, but gave in. Despite previous warnings by locals, no action was taken, which could have prevented the incident. “If the Savitri river tragedy was unforgettable, so is the latest one. Both incidents have created long lasting impact on our mind,” said Amit Dahave, a 60-year-old grocery shop owner in Mahad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mahad-incident-revives-tragic-memories-of-savitri-river-bridge-collapse/story-3U2tbMY6YXDqDGWhK0LNVO.html
25-08-2020||Pune||PCMC fines teachers for missing Covid duties||The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) continued to take action against school teachers at PCMC schools for avoiding Covid duties. Until June,74 teachers were given a showcause notice. Three teachers were also fined earlier this month.“Civic chief Shravan Hardikar has fined three teachers of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation schools for failing to attend the Covid survey duty earlier this month. The teachers were issued showcause notices and were told to give a reply,” according to a PCMC official. Generally, teachers have been assigned work to assist doctors and health care workers. Duties include a door-to-door screening of residents, Covid surveys, and sending WhatsApp awareness messages to the public. In two months (July and August), a number of teachers were fined by PCMC. “The civic body keeps fining those who are avoiding Covid duties. It is a must for all PCMC teachers, they have been given rotational duties,” said Jyotsna Shinde, administration officer, education department, PCMC. Shinde added, “If a teacher continues to miss Covid duties, strict action will be taken against them. Currently, most of the teachers have been given show cause notices but we are thinking to take more strict actions if teachers keep on repeating such mistakes.” “Duty is given to all the teachers and it is compulsory. None of the teachers should give false reason and ignore duties,” she said. Box YCMH doctors protest against PCMCDoctors at the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital (YCMH) wore black bands to protest against the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC).On Saturday in the general body meeting, many corporators talked disrespectfully with Dr Rajendra Wable, dean of YCMH hospital and that’s why doctors protested on Monday. However, work continued at the hospital.The letter from YCMH stated, “It is not the first-time senior doctors were disrespected in a general body meeting. Since the last two years our doctors have been treated in the same way. Corporators should give us respect, we are doing duty devotionally even during Covid times. Due to such foul language our sentiments have been hurt and that’s why we are working today with black bands.”Dr Wable was not available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pcmc-fines-teachers-for-missing-covid-duties/story-bAFmLwqdsFMAfndorLvkwM.html

The court issued the directions after it was informed by the state that a similar petition, the one filed by a Pune resident at the principal seat in Mumbai, was being heard at the other two seats of the HC.After advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni submitted that it would be appropriate to club all the petitions together and they be heard together at the principal seat in Mumbai, the court allowed the same. HC directed the state to proceed to club all petitions and place them before the chief justice next month.A division bench of justice AA Sayed and justice NR Borkar while hearing the public interest litigation filed by Pune resident Dhyandeshwar Darwatkar was informed by advocate Shekhar Jagtap that though the earlier bench of the HC had directed the state to inform about the policy framed to curb begging and for the welfare of women and children, the state had failed to respond.However, Kumbhakoni drew the attention of the bench to various petitions filed at the Nagpur and Aurangabad bench of the HC and submitted that the petitions had sought similar reliefs as the current petitioner and some orders had also been passed with regards to the grievances raised by the petitioners in those cases. In light of these submissions, Kumbhakoni requested that the court allow all petitions to be clubbed together and heard at one seat as it would avoid repetition and also save the time of the court.After hearing the submissions, the court allowed the state to club all petitions and posted the matter for hearing in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-to-hear-multiple-petitions-seeking-a-curb-on-begging-welfare-of-women-and-children-next-month/story-dDIbbrnZEVfaupT53Q8VBL.html

25-08-2020||Mumbai||Ajit Pawar must respond to allegations of unequal distribution of development funds: Sena corners deputy CM||In a move to corner Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on the issue of unequal distribution of development funds, the Shiv Sena, in an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, said that the state finance minister must respond to the allegations of Congress legislators. In the past, Shiv Sena legislators have also voiced their disappointment to chief minister and Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray over the unavailability of funds for their constituencies. They have alleged that Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) legislators get priority over legislators of the two other parties (Shiv Sena and the Congress) that are part of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Sena MP and Saamana editor Sanjay Raut told reporters that though Pawar is the finance minister, the three parties of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi can sit together to resolve the issue. Raut said that earlier, Thorat and senior Congress minister Ashok Chavan spoke to the chief minister about the distribution of funds.“Maharashtra Congress chief and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat called me and said that Congress MLAs are unhappy with the unequal distribution of funds. He said that it is important that funds are distributed equally, as this is a three-party government. I think the stand he has taken is appropriate. At the end of the day, when a legislator develops his constituency, it leads to the development of the State… at the end the three parties will meet and find a solution,” Raut told reporters.In an editorial in Saamana, the party had said, “Congress [leaders] say that NCP gets more importance in the government and that NCP has taken more of the development funds. What do we say on this? Finance minister Ajit Pawar alone can respond to these allegations.”Congress’ Jalna MLA Kailash Gorantyal has threatened to go on a hunger strike over constituency development funds. He has claimed that he has the support of 10 other Congress legislators, who he has not named. He added that Congress constituencies are given a step-motherly treatment in the distribution of funds. However, Pawar reportedly spoke to Gorantyal on Tuesday and the legislator has decided to call off his protest.The Sena, however, took a dim view of the 11 Congress legislators from Maharashtra protesting against the government and said that it is akin to raising questions against Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, who supported the formation of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government. The Sena, in the editorial, said there is “instability and unease” within the Congress, but it needs to play the role of an active opposition party. The editorial in the Marathi daily said that the MVA government will complete its full five-year term, and the opposition party in Maharashtra need not rejoice over the display of resentment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ajit-pawar-must-respond-to-allegations-of-unequal-distribution-of-development-funds-sena-corners-deputy-cm/story-OnSoH723TPohZpH1KHCUaJ.html
25-08-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab to procure 170 lakh tonnes paddy; goes online for smooth milling operations||Chandigarh: Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, all rice delivery operations in Punjab, including allotment, registration and physical verification of rice mills, will be managed and monitored online, under the new Punjab Custom Milling Policy for paddy for the 2020-21 kharif season. The state cabinet on Tuesday approved the new policy, aimed at ensuring seamless milling of paddy and delivery of rice into the Central Pool from more than 4,150 mills operating in the state. The state is expected to procure 170 lakh metric tonnes (MTs) of paddy during the season beginning on October 1, with a total area under paddy sowing this year at 26.6 lakh hectares. Last year, 29.2 lakh hectares was under paddy cultivation. www.anaajkharid.in PORTAL LAUNCHEDThe state government will launch a dedicated portal, www.anaajkharid.in, for smooth paddy procurement. The whole gamut of yearly procurement operations – from allotment of mills, their registration, application of release order and deposit of fee, besides all important monitoring of stocks, will be done online now on, according to an official spokesperson. State procuring agencies, including Pungrain, Markfed, Punsup, Punjab State Warehousing Corporation (PSWC) and rice-millers and other stakeholders will operate and interact on the website, with the department of food, civil supplies and consumer affairs acting as the nodal department. The spokesperson said that under the policy, the sole criterion for allotment of free paddy to mills this season would be the miller’s performance in the previous year (kharif marketing season 2019-20), and an additional percentage-wise incentive would be provided to mills as per their date of delivery of rice against milling of custom-milled paddy, including RO paddy in the previous year. Mills that had completed their entire milling by January 31, 2020, would be eligible for additional 15% of free paddy milled in 2019-20, as per the policy. Those who had completed delivery of rice by February 28, 2020, would get an additional 10% of free paddy. ENHANCED BANK GUARANTEE The government has also enhanced the bank guarantee for security of the stocks and millers will be required to furnish enhanced bank guarantee, equal to value of 10% of acquisition cost of allocable free paddy above 3,000 metric tonnes (MTs), as against 5% on 5,000 MTs last year. “Lowering of the threshold limit for submission of bank guarantee will bring an additional 1,000 mills within the direct monitoring ambit,” the spokesperson said. In addition, a miller will have to purchase a minimum of 150 MTs of paddy in his own account or deposit an amount of Rs 5 lakh (non-refundable) in state treasury and Rs 5 lakh in the form of refundable security online in Pungrain account. Another measure to guard against any paddy diversion is the decision to bring RO paddy into the ambit of custom milling security (CMR). Millers will be required to deposit Rs 125 for each MT for every paddy stored or part therefore, including RO paddy, with the agency concerned. To tackle the issue of moisture content in CMR, the policy stipulates compulsory installation of dryer and sortex for a new mill and/or in case of enhancement of capacity. The target is to complete the custom milling of paddy and delivering all due rice to Food Corporation of India by March 31, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-to-procure-170-lakh-tonnes-paddy-goes-online-for-smooth-milling-operations/story-HQqoQnFgo3eMuXaXWx6vJJ.html

The face value of the seized notes is Rs 1.34 lakh. Officers from the Shamserganj police station arrested 38-year-old Kabirul Sheikh from the Dhulian Ghat area. Though the counterfeit notes have a face value of only Rs 1.35 lakh, the arrest is being seen as a proof that FICN smugglers are active during the pandemic. The district is located along the Indo-Bangladesh border and the smuggling of illegal firearms and narcotics is reported intermittently from several areas. Cows are also smuggled into Bangladesh. Police said Sheikh is a resident of the Baishnabnagar area in adjoining Malda district.

Others who attended the programme include Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar, Thaverchand Gehlot, Prahlad Singh Patel and VK Singh, chief minister Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chouhan and PWD minister Gopal Bhargava, besides officers of the ministry of road transport and highways and the Madhya Pradesh government.In his address, Gadkari spoke of how these road projects would change the lives of people not only in Madhya Pradesh but other states connected through these roads as well. This would result in better transport and significant reduction in travel time and fuel expenses, he added.He said the highway projects were being built with a view to reduce traffic and accidents in the future.Expressing concern over the death of 0.15 million people in 0.5 million road accidents every year across the country, Gadkari said 40% of those killed in these accidents were aged 18 to 24 years. Appreciating Tamil Nadu for its work on black spots in the state where significant number of road accidents take place, he asked chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to work on black spots in Madhya Pradesh. Underlining the need of more drivers in the country, he said there should be one driving school in every district.Chief minister Chouhan urged the Union minister to formally approve Chambal Progressway, the upgrading of six highways worth Rs 1,569 crore, and 65 other small projects worth Rs 182 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/gadkari-inaugurates-26-road-projects-and-lays-foundation-of-19-others-in-madhya-pradesh/story-yjj4w5THxCKn2hZg6poGuN.html

25-08-2020||Kolkata||Facebook page demanding ex-Meghalaya governer as BJP’s Bengal CM face surfaces||A Facebook page, created on Monday night and called “Tathagata Roy for CM”, has caused embarrassment for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) less than 48 hours after Kailash Vijayvargiya, the party’s national general secretary, had announced that nobody would be projected as the chief ministerial candidate for the crucial West Bengal assembly polls slated to be held next year. The page had very few views until Tuesday afternoon. A photograph of Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, the founder of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS) and the BJP’s icon, was posted on the home page. Vijayvargiya is one of the BJP leaders, who look after the organisational affairs of the party’s Bengal unit on behalf of the central leadership. Roy had met Vijayvargiya in Kolkata on Monday afternoon and expressed his wish to actively work for the party. After the meeting he said that he did not aspire for any post and would serve in any role that the leadership assigns. Roy had to give up the party membership because he had served as the governor of Tripura and Meghalaya. He returned to Kolkata on Sunday and is supposed to apply for the party membership again. Around Monday midnight, one of the posts in the Facebook page ridiculed Vijayvargiya, suggesting that he is an outsider and questioning his right to decide who would be the chief ministerial face in poll-bound Bengal. Roy (74) had served as the governor of Tripura from 2015 to 2018 and then of Meghalaya from 2018 until Satya Pal Malik succeeded him on August 19. Roy, a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and known for his penchant for making controversial statements, was the president of the Bengal unit of the BJP between 2002 and 2006. Roy did not respond to calls from HT on Tuesday afternoon. Jay Prakash Majumdar, one of the senior vice-presidents of the state BJP, said, “Whoever has created the page is not aware of how the party operates. It must have been done by our political rivals. But if people in the BJP are responsible, then I must say they are completely oblivious and not even distantly connected with the organisation.” The BJP would not project anyone as its chief ministerial candidate, Vijayvargiya had announced in Kolkata on Sunday. “The achievements of the Narendra Modi government will be our face and it will ensure our victory. After the polls, elected BJP lawmakers can select their leader,” said Vijayvargiya, who is in the city to attend a series of meetings where strengths and weaknesses of district units in south Bengal are being evaluated. A silent campaign over the BJP’s ‘prospective chief ministerial face’ for the 2021 election had become a thorn in the flesh for the leadership, a number of BJP leaders told HT. “We strongly suspect that the campaign was started by a section of party leaders, who are pursuing personal agenda. It became the subject of widespread gossip and speculative news items, helping the ruling TMC (Trinamool Congress) to project our Bengal unit as a divided house. All this will end with Vijayvargiya’s announcement,” a BJP leader, who requested anonymity, had told HT on Sunday. Quoting unnamed “BJP sources,” numerous news portals, social media pages and vernacular dailies have named a prominent sports personality, a BJP Rajya Sabha member, a Union minister, a member of a right-wing think tank and, last but not the least, a monk from the Ramakrishna Mission as the possible chief ministerial candidate against TMC leader and Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. While the monk dismissed the rumour, the others were evasive about engaging in any debate on this issue. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/facebook-page-demanding-ex-meghalaya-governer-as-bjp-s-bengal-cm-face-surfaces/story-GvWHTPrStdwPMpiyH09PaO.html

Officials said Mohammad Javed Bangi was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he asked for his mother, whose body was later retrieved from the rubble. They added the boy has suffered minor injuries.Also read: Police to file FIR against 5 in building collapseHis aunt, Rupasa, said the boy was trapped under the debris along with his two sisters and mother. “His three family members are still trapped under the rubble. I pray for everyone’s survival,” she said before the body of the boy’s mother was recovered.The 10-year-old building collapsed on Monday evening and around 25 people were initially trapped. The rescuers have so far saved seven people while the search is still on for others.Officials said the boy was rescued at 1:15 pm on Tuesday.

25-08-2020||Mumbai||BMC to prepare master plan to create tourism facilities around Mithi river||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities have chalked out elaborate plans for the over 15-kilometre (km)-long Mithi river, which is often denigrated as Mumbai’s garbage-strewn nullah that starts from Powai and empties into the Arabian sea near Mahim. The civic body is working on a master plan to create tourism facilities around the river, including recreational boating facilities on the river or at artificial holding ponds built near it. The plan includes constructing recreational facilities such as mangrove parks and gardens and encouraging aquatic life in the water body. The river that snakes through Kurla, Saki Nakka, and Vakola is often less of a river and more of a sewer because of garbage, sewage, plastic and pollutants. It is among the most polluted water bodies in Mumbai. The BMC has failed to clean the river for more than a decade. The 2005 deluge had brought Mithi’s deplorable plight to limelight. The civic body officials told HT that creating tourism facilities around the river is part of the plan to rejuvenate it. The master plan will be prepared by a consultant while factoring in all ground realities. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said, “We are going to appoint a consultant for creating holding ponds and to develop a tourism ecosystem around the river. This is a part of the plan for the river’s rejuvenation. We are drafting a comprehensive master plan for this exercise.’’A BMC official conceded that the waste discharged illegally in to the river would be a challenge, but plans are afoot to divert sewage into municipal pumping stations and block the ingress from where the pollutants enter the river in line with the suggestions of a Swedish consultant. The artificial holding pond plan was mooted by the BMC last year on the lines of Japan. The holding pond will be used to store the excess rainwater from the Vehar, Tulsi, and Powai lakes, instead of discharging into the river that overflows during monsoon.The BMC is working on several aspects for the river’s rejuvenation, including encouraging aquatic life, increasing green belt along its banks around Powai and Jogeshwari Vikhroli Link Road. The bid document prepared by BMC cites assessment on the possibilities of the urban development for commercial and public activities along the river banks and boating facilities in a bid to boost tourism.The plans are in consonance with BMC’s budget for 2020-21 that had proposed for a separate allocation for tourism. The civic body had set aside Rs 183 crore to boost tourism in Mumbai.Environmental and civic activists are sceptical of the BMC’s ambitious plan.Nikhil Desai, a civic activist from Mumbai, said, “Mithi river is filthy. A reveller, who wants to go there for a boating excursion, will fall unconscious, unless there is a major transformation. The civic body’s priority must be to stop the sewer and industrial waste entering the river and polluting it. Navigation in the river is only possible, if wanton pollution of the river can be stopped at the earliest. Though crores have been spent on the exercise, the results have not been encouraging to date.”Zeeshan Usman, a ferry owner from the Gateway of India in Colaba, said, “On paper, it appears to be an ideal plan. In several countries, rivers and seas have been interlinked for transport and tourism purposes. However, nothing can be done unless encroachments are removed and a concerted bid is mounted to prevent the indiscriminate dumping of waste into the river.”Both the Maharashtra government and the BMC authorities have come under fire several times over their shoddy handling of industrial waste being consistently dumped into the river, especially after the 2005 deluge, when the river overflowed and Mumbai was marooned for days on end.In August 2017, the Supreme Court (SC) had reprimanded the state government for turning the river into a “garbage-strewn drain”. The apex court had said that no effective steps appear to have been taken by the state government to restore the river even more than a decade after the floods had brought Mumbai down to its knees. The SC had asked the government to deposit Rs 50 lakh with it for setting up an expert committee to salvage the polluted river..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-prepare-master-plan-to-create-tourism-facilities-around-mithi-river/story-owKlxYzQyEn9lPAHtp4CzH.html
25-08-2020||Mumbai||BMC issues notice to Railways after Matunga resident highlights ‘indiscriminate’ tree felling||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) garden department has asked the Western Railway authorities to clarify the allegations of tree felling at the Matunga Railway Colony on Tulsi Pipe Road.The notice was issued by the BMC following a complaint filed by advocate and tree activist Deepak Chattopadhyay, who had alleged that around 10 trees were chopped in the residential colony and no action was taken by the railway authorities, despite repeated reminders. “Without any permission from the BMC or the railways, a few residents had hired a private contractor to cut trees and use the vacant area to park their vehicles. These incidents are commonplace,” said Chattopadhyay.He cited that the move is a violation of the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975. “The Act mandates that a proposal be submitted to the BMC garden department even before a single tree can be felled. However, no such proposal was submitted. Mumbai, a city starved of green spaces, is further losing its tree cover because of such rampant illegal activities,” alleged Chattopadhyay.Rupesh Poojari, a BMC tree officer from G (North) ward, who had inspected the site, said he had found six to seven trees either hacked or their branches sawed off at the location cited by Chattopadhyay in his complaint. “We checked our records. However, we did not find a copy of any permission issued by our department,” he said.Dayandev Mundhe, assistant superintendent, BMC’s garden department, said, “We issued a notice to the Western Railway authorities, seeking an explanation about the matter. If they are unable to present the permission for the felling of trees, action will be taken for the violation of the 1975 Act,” he said.The Western Railway authorities denied allegations of the felling of trees. “We have not received any notice from the BMC. No tree felling has ever been carried out without the BMC’s permission. If a private party is involved, then it is within the BMC’s jurisdiction to take action,” said Sumit Thakur, chief public relations officer (CPRO), Western Railway.Chattopadhyay pointed out this was not the first time that such violations had occurred in the railway colony. “Around 30 trees have been felled in the residential complex to make space for parking vehicles. There is scant regard for the environmental consequences,” he said.A 2020 July study by Indian and Chinese institutes found a 42.5% drop in Mumbai’s green cover between 1988 and 2018. The ratio of green spaces to total geographical area had fallen from 46.7% in 1988 to 26.67% in 2018 due to rampant and unplanned developmental activities. “We need stringent regulation on arbitrary tree cutting and the formulation of a policy at the district level that encourages social forestry and urban green belts at the earliest,” said Pankaj Kumar, one of the authors of the study and an assistant professor at Delhi School of Economics (DSE).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-issues-notice-to-railways-after-matunga-resident-highlights-indiscriminate-tree-felling/story-i18sRaZeFGGGB3BhWxtezO.html

At around 5 pm on Sunday, Jayshree Jain (61) had gone to buy vegetables near Maheshwari Bhavan at Lokhandwala in Andheri (West), when a man came from behind and snatched her gold chain worth Rs 65,500 and then fled in an auto-rickshaw, said Oshiwara police officials, who have registered a first information report (FIR) in the case. The passersby, who had tried to chase the auto-rickshaw, had taken down the four digits of the vehicle’s registration number, said the police. “We scanned CCTV (closed circuit TV) camera footage of that area and managed to get the missing digits of the vehicle’s registration number with the help of the traffic police personnel. Later, we tracked down and arrested the auto-rickshaw driver, Laxman Pujari (35),” said Kiran Pawar, assistant police inspector (API), Oshiwara police station. Pujari gave details about the chain snatchers, Raju Das (31) and Lata Kale (40) , who are husband and wife, respectively. The couple was arrested on Monday evening, Pawar said. Pujari told the police that he and Kale were waiting in the vehicle, while Das snatched the chain. All the three accused are residents of Gazdhar Bandh area in Santacruz (West). Dayanand Bangar, senior police inspector, Oshiwara police station, said,” Pujari has seven cases of theft, burglary and chain snatching registered against him at various police stations in Mumbai. However, we have not found any criminal record against Das and Kale until now.” The accused will be produced before a local court later in the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/three-persons-including-husband-and-wife-arrested-for-chain-snatching-in-oshiwara/story-mdpXufIPeI1CCqi4wOzRQO.html
25-08-2020||Delhi||Overcast skies in Delhi, light rain likely||Dark clouds shrouded the skies in the national capital on Tuesday morning, with the Met department forecasting light rain during the day. The cloud cover is expected to keep the maximum temperature below the 34 degrees Celsius mark, the weatherman said. The national capital is likely to witness another spell of “moderate to heavy rain” between Wednesday and Friday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of the IMD, said the monsoon trough is likely to shift northwards and will remain close to Delhi-NCR from Tuesday evening to Friday. Under its influence, convergence of lower-level easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal and south westerly winds from the Arabian Sea will take place over northwest India, he said. Widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy showers are likely to occur over northwest India during the period. “One or two spells of moderate rain, thundershowers with isolated heavy rain may occur between Wednesday night and Friday afternoon,” he said. Delhi has recorded 213.3 mm rainfall against the normal of 210.6 mm in August so far. Overall, it has gauged 531.9 mm precipitation against the normal of 486.7 mm since June 1, when monsoon season starts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/overcast-skies-in-delhi-light-rain-likely/story-jPhUGwvjCTYK27Xa8nzNIL.html
25-08-2020||Delhi||BJP-led corporations launch mega dengue awareness campaign in Delhi||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations in the national capital will launch a mega campaign to create awareness about dengue and other vector-borne diseases on Tuesday morning. Jai Prakash, mayor, North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), along with BJP national vice-president Shyam Jaju will participate at a programme on Flagstaff Road in front of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence, while Anamika Mithilesh, mayor, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), will start the campaign from the Civic Centre.Also read: Bengal braces for three-pronged attack of Covid, flood and dengueWith municipal elections scheduled in 2022, the BJP has put its entire state machinery behind the campaign, as the party is hoping to win a fourth consecutive term.The BJP has been ruling the three corporations in Delhi since 2007. Last August, the Aam Aadmi Party(AAP)-led Delhi government had launched a campaign — “10 Hafte-10 Baje-10 Minute” — to tackle the number of dengue, chikungunya and other vector-borne disease cases in Delhi. CM Kejriwal had urged the public to check their residence every Sunday for mosquito breeding. Several celebrities had also supported the campaign. This time around, the BJP is leaving nothing to chance. The party has asked its leaders, including all seven Members of Parliament (MPs) from Delhi, members of the Delhi legislative assembly (MLAs) to participate in the month-long campaign. “It was the municipal corporations, which did everything to control dengue and chikungunya. We were doing the work on the ground but the government took credit. They hijacked it. This time we are set not only to take measures to control dengue, chikungunya and malaria cases, but also to spread awareness among masses about these vector-borne diseases. The public should also know that MCDs are working for them tirelessly,” said mayor Jai Prakash.He said the importance of campaign could be gauged from the fact that all seven MPs, BJP MLAs and state BJP leadership would take part in the campaign and “convey the message” to the masses.BJP MPs Manoj Tiwari, Meenakshi Lekhi and Hans Raj Hans will spread awareness among masses about vector-borne diseases at Civil Lines, Karol Bagh, and Narela, respectively. All eight party MLAs have been asked to campaign in their areas. The Delhi government’s campaign last year had led to a tussle between the AAP and the BJP. While the BJP had accused the ruling party of taking away the credit from municipal officials, who have worked hard to limit the number of vector-borne disease cases, the AAP had accused the BJP of trying to negate Delhi government’s campaign to combat dengue by “politicising the seasonal disease”. Spread of vector-borne diseases is a major issue in the national capital. According to civic records, in 2015, as many as 15,867 dengue cases were reported and 60 people had died. The number of dengue cases in 2019 was controlled at 2,036 and two deaths were reported. The AAP has already started its preparations for the civic polls. According to AAP functionaries, the party has started strengthening its workforce on the ground for civic elections. The AAP has also started cornering BJP-ruled municipalities on issues such as corruption, laxity of work, and sanitation, among others.According to civic records, till August 17, 41 cases of dengue, 26 cases of chikungunya and 48 cases of malaria has been reported in the national capital. No death has been reported due to dengue, chikungunya and malaria to date in Delhi.Mayor Mithilesh said, “Municipal staff and BJP leaders will visit households in different areas and appeal to the public not to let water accumulation happen to prevent mosquito breeding. We will also distribute pamphlets carrying information about preventive measures to be taken by people for dengue, malaria and chikungunya.”The domestic breeding checkers (DBC) and sanitation employees will visit every household to check water accumulation in the buildings. The fogging exercises and spray of anti-larva solution has already started in most of the localities of the city and it will be intensified.Vikas Goel, an AAP member and the leader of opposition in NDMC, described the move as an eye wash and a “photo opportunity” for BJP leaders.“Instead of such photo opportunities they should do some work on the ground. They should make efforts for continuous fogging, in-house checking and spray of anti-larva chemicals to prevent breeding of mosquitoes,” alleged Goel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bjp-led-corporations-launch-mega-dengue-awareness-campaign-in-delhi/story-gCbUhfgkTxoUveP3tncZfO.html

25-08-2020||Delhi||Third serological survey in Delhi from Sept 1 to 5||The third serological survey in Delhi will be held between September 1 and 5 and around 17,000 people are expected to be surveyed, officials aware of the matter said on Tuesday.“Samples will be collected from all the 11 districts of Delhi and across all age groups. Around 17,000 samples will be collected,” said a health department official, who did not want to be named.Also read: Why Delhi sero survey findings don’t mean you are safeThe number of samples to be collected will be more than the second serological survey. They will lesser than those collected for the first survey led by the National Centre for Disease Control.The first survey was held between June 27 and July 10 during which 22.86% of people were found to have developed antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19. The second survey was done between August 1 and 7 and antibodies were found among 29.1% of people surveyed.In the first survey, samples were collected from 21,387 people and in the second from 15,000. The second survey showed a prevalence of antibodies among women in Delhi was more (32.2%) when compared to men (28.3%).According to the second survey report, the prevalence of antibodies among those aged less than 18 were found to be 34.7%, those between 18-50 28.5% and those above 50 31.2%. Officials said even if the third survey finds the prevalence of antibodies in around 35% of Delhi’s population, the Covid-19 management strategies would largely remain unchanged.“Whether there is a high prevalence of antibodies in one district and lower in another, both cases would need the same strategy of the test, track, and treat. Active surveillance and contact tracing will have to continue and high-risk group and special surveillance groups will have to be checked on frequently,” said a health official, who did not want to be named.The Covid-19 positivity rate has started rising again in Delhi. As many as 7.4% of all tests conducted in the last week came positive, the highest in over a month, suggesting that Delhi may be facing a fresh challenge to control the outbreak it had contained to a considerable extent.The positivity rate is a crucial metric as experts say it shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and when coupled with an increase in new cases, it indicates that the virus is spreading fast.The national capital reported 1,061 cases and 13 deaths as per Monday’s Covid-19 bulletin, taking the total number of infections in the city to 162,527 and fatalities to 4,313.Dr. Lalit Kant, a former head of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said Delhi’s positivity rate has once again started to gradually increase which means the infection is still spreading in the city.“At this juncture, Delhi cannot be complacent. Testing numbers should not decline. More and more testing is the key to managing Covid-19 and the mode of testing should preferably be RT-PCR [reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction],” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/third-sero-survey-in-delhi-from-sept-1-and-5/story-id0omqZZXvMpr1WbWPaVzK.html

25-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra liquor excise drops to Rs 3,384 crore from an estimated Rs 6,415 crore||The Maharashtra government has been able to earn only Rs 3,384 crore as excise duty from the sale of liquor in the last four months (April to July 2020) in the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown.This amount is substantially low as the state needs to generate an average of Rs 6,415 crore every four months to meet its annual target of Rs 19,245 crore.Also read: Haryana excise officials admit to shortfall in liquor stocks before SETThe state excise department attributed the shortfall to a variety of reasons. “The wine shops have still not fully opened. Even the restaurants have still not reopened,” said excise commissioner Kantilal Umap. “Due to Covid-19 pandemic, many people stopped drinking chilled beer, whose sales took a big hit,” said Umap. However he said that the state government is working out various ways to meet this shortfall and shore up the revenues.Excise duty is one of the biggest revenues for the state government as it netted Rs 15,434 crore during the last financial year (April 2019-March 2020). This was the reason that the cash-strapped state government allowed opening of liquor shops from May 4. In order to curtail huge crowds at vends, the state even allowed home delivery of liquor.However, it has still not allowed opening of hotels and restaurants which have been shut for the past five months.Meanwhile, wine merchants and hotel owners are bearing the brunt of low sales. “Lakhs of migrant workers who left for their native towns were one of our major clientele and this factor has affected our sales substantially.” “In addition, people visited each other and indulged in social drinking which has completely stopped now,” said Arvind Miskin, president, Association of Progressive Retail Liquor Vendors, a body of wine shop owners. There are 15,000 restaurants, 1,685 wine shops, 5,000 beer shops and 4,045 country liquor bars in the state which serve liquor. Restaurant owners are all for reopening of their establishments. “Liquor revenue will increase substantially once we are allowed to start our business,” said Shivanand Shetty, president, Indian Hotels and Restaurant Association (AHAR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-liquor-excise-drops-to-rs-3-384-crore-from-an-estimated-rs-6-415-crore/story-IGDOA6DC2aQ4iW6vtMxEwI.html

According to the police, the laundry business of the victim’s relative took a hit due to the lockdown, owing to which the latter started a bakery. However, this affected the business of the three accused, whose shops are located near the shop of the victim’s relative, Amarbahadur Kanojia. The accused have been identified as Salluddin Ansari, 25, his brother Kashimuddin, 28, and relative Mohammed Ansari, 20.

25-08-2020||City||30 villages in Thane receive contaminated water||Residents from around 30 villages in Thane’s Shahapur have complained of receiving contaminated water at their homes for the past two months. They have alleged that despite several complaints to the zilla parishad, the issue has not been resolved. Almost 75% of villagers have fallen ill in the past two months after drinking the contaminated water, said residents. The villages have been supplied with water of the Bhatsa river from a direct pipeline without purification. The zilla parishad representatives have claimed that owing to the lack of funds, their proposal to install purification plants has not been going moving ahead. Manik Awhad, deputy engineer, Shahapur, said, “The proposal to install purification plants in these villages is not moving ahead owing to lack of funds. There is a purification plant at Cherapoli village, but it’s not functional. So we have sanctioned money for its repair and restoration. Also, we are soon in the process of starting water ATMs plants in every village to provide drinking water facilities for the locals.” With many residents at home owing to the lockdown, their more need for water and locals have been buying bottled water or calling water tanks for supply of water. However, they are facing difficulties to find the supply owing to the lockdown. As many residents have either lost their jobs or face salary cuts, it has become difficult for them to pay for water. Shahapur-based social worker Baban Harne has helped some poor families in getting water. “Villages under around 30 gram panchayats face this problem every monsoon. Residents get muddy water, which they cannot even use to wash clothes or utensils. Earlier, villagers used to order tankers for water supply, but this year, most of them have lost their jobs or cannot go out to earn due to closure of train services. How will they buy water, which is the most essential thing in life? Most of the villagers have suffered from stomach infections and other diseases due to contaminated water,” said Harne. Forty-year-old Jagdish Pawar, one of the villagers, said that during monsoon the river gets muddy and residents receive the muddy water into their homes. “We can’t even wash our hands from the water. This year we have been facing more problems. In the first three months [of the lockdown], we used all our savings to run our homes, owing to which by monsoon, we don’t have much money left to order 5 litres of water for eight members of family,” said Pawar. According to the villagers, the muddy water has damaged most of their equipment such as motor pump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/30-villages-in-thane-receive-contaminated-water/story-0IXvvrqnhHExs1KRKn4SsO.html
25-08-2020||Mumbai||HC directs state, railways to deposit compensation of dead policeman||The Bombay high court has directed the state and railways to deposit the compensation amount accruing in the name of a railway police personnel who died of Covid-19 in the court. The daughter of the police personnel had approached the court seeking proportionate distribution of the compensation amount between the two wives and daughters of the policeman. The court directed the first wife and her daughter to be present for the hearing, without which, the petition could not be decided and posted the matter for hearing on Tuesday. A division bench of justice S J Kathawalla and justice Madhav Jamdar, while hearing the petition filed by a woman, was informed by advocate Prerak Sharma that the father of the petitioner was serving as an assistant sub-inspector with the Maharashtra Railway Police Force till his untimely death due to Covid-19 on May 30. Sharma submitted that it was only when his client’s mother wrote to the railway authorities to provide her with the employment, gratuity, pension benefits accruing in her late husband’s name, she came to know that there was a similar letter written by another woman who also claimed to be the dead policeman’s wife, having one daughter. Sharma added that both marriages were registered with the Registrar of Marriages and under section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, his client being the child of the second wife had a right to family pension and death-cum-retirement gratuity, hence she and her mother should get an equal proportion in the compensation that has been disbursed by the state government and the railways in the name of her father. On its part, deputy commissioner of police, Pradeep Chavan, West zone, Railways, submitted that they had already collected the compensation and other benefits for their demised personnel and were willing to hand it over the beneficiary, as per court orders. The state also submitted that it had expedited the disbursal of the compensation and would hand it over as per court orders. After hearing the submissions, the court sought the presence of the first wife and daughter as without them the court could not decide on the distribution of the compensation on Tuesday and directed the railways to deposit the compensation amount in the court within a week. The court also asked the state to inform when it would be able to deposit the compensation amount of ₹60 lakhs with the court and posted the matter for hearing on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-directs-state-railways-to-deposit-compensation-of-dead-policeman/story-dAZjw92WWOR6dbduQrp9JJ.html

Officers said that Rawat is an associate of gangster Yusuf Suleiman Kadri alias Yusuf Bachkana from the past 10 years and arranged for shooters to murder the developer at the gangster’s behest for ₹10 lakh. “Bachkana allegedly gave Rawat the contract over a financial dispute with the developer. The plot to kill the real estate developer was laid down in June,” said an officer from crime branch. Bachkana, who worked for gangster Ravi Pujari, is currently serving life sentence at Hindalga central jail in Belgavi district of Karnataka for the murder of a builder, said officers. Rawat’s name cropped up after the seven people arrested by Karnataka Police in connection with the real estate developer’s murder revealed his name and claimed that they were given the contract by Rawat. A police team from Karnataka then came to Mumbai and nabbed Rawat from Borivli area with the help of Mumbai crime branch officers. “We alerted our informant and found out that Rawat was in touch with Bachkana and was still working with him despite the latter being in Karnataka jail. During his interrogation, Rawat confessed that he was given a contract of ₹10 lakh to arrange shooters. After scrutinising Rawat’s bank account, we found that ₹2 lakh was transferred into his account before the murder,” said police inspector Sagar Sivalkar of unit 12 of the crime branch.

25-08-2020||Mumbai||BMC to now get 50,000 more rapid antigen kits for city||After using over 72,000 of the one lakh rapid antigen kits obtained in the first week of July, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) now plans to procure 50,000 more kits by September, as it looks to ramp up testing from next week. The civic body conducts antigen tests majorly on frontline workers, shopkeepers and vendors in containment zones and high-risk contacts. The kits deliver test results within 15-20 minutes, but are less sensitive compared to RT-PCR tests. If a symptomatic patient is tested negative through the rapid antigen test, the patient is tested again through RT-PCR. As of August 23, 72,515 antigen tests have been conducted, of which 4,105 have come positive. Of the total Covid tests conducted daily, more than 50% are rapid antigen tests. More than 2,000 antigen tests are carried out by BMC on a daily basis, which is apart from the ones conducted by private labs. BMC has issued an expression of interest for procurement of next instalment of antigen kits. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We are conducting antigen tests on a much larger scale. For now, we have issued a requirement of 50,000 kits and will procure more in the future.” A senior civic official said, “We are going to continue aggressive testing through antigen kits. The 50,000 kits are expected to be received by September. Recently, all ward officers were given a target of completing 1,000 tests daily. These tests will majorly involve antigen kits as well as RT-PCR tests wherever it is required.” Meanwhile, on Monday, Mumbai reported 743 new Covid-19 cases, the lowest single-day figure in August. The previous lowest daily count recorded was on July 28, when the city saw only 700 cases. There were 20 deaths due to Covid-19 on Monday, taking the toll to 7,442. Of the 137, 096 cases recorded in the city so far, 18,267 are active. The case fatality ratio of the city is 5.4%, and the recovery rate stands at 81%. As per BMC’s data, of the 20 deaths, 1 was of a patient below 40 years of age, six were between 40 and 60 years and 13 above 60 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/civic-body-to-now-get-50-000-more-rapid-antigen-kits-for-city/story-nOT1u19iWRvOL1U5x3Zl8H.html
25-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Metro to explore non-fare sources such as advertising, land monetisation for revenue||At a time when metros across the country are facing losses owing to the lockdown, the Maha Mumbai Metro Operation Corporation Limited (MMMOCL) is exploring at non-fare revenue sources for the Metro 2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E) corridors, expected to be operational by May 2021. MMMOCL, which will be operating all metro corridors in the future, has invited bids to undertake a study of the upcoming 30 stations on the two corridors and suggest measures to “maximise the revenue”. The documents released by the MMMOCL states, “Public transport projects like metro are capital and maintenance intensive, hence will not be financially sustainable only depending on fare box revenues. The Metro Rail Policy adopted by the government of India stipulates the exploitation of various alternate revenue sources and opportunities such as advertising, commercial utilisation of land around metro station premises, transit-oriented developments (ToD), value-captured tax/financing, digital marketing etc.” DK Sharma, managing director, MMMOCL said, “We are expecting some out of the box ideas to maximise our revenue sources. The consultant will be expected to do a detailed study of all the stations.” Mumbai’s first metro line (Versova-Ghatkopar) is also reeling under losses since its inception. Last week, HT reported that Reliance Infrastructure, which owns a major stake in the company, wants to sell the stakes of the metro. According to sources, the metro is facing losses worth ₹80 lakh to ₹1 crore each day. As per a recent study conducted by a consultant appointed by the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation, metros across India are facing losses owing to various reasons, including sub-optimal monetisation of non-fare revenue options such as commercial space leasing, advertisement space leasing, property development, land monetisation, etc. due to various constraints, including regulatory and contractual restrictions. Sudeept Maiti, senior manager from the World Resources Institute (WRI) said, “Non-fare revenue becomes crucial for any metro, which is a very high-investment project. Many cities have started exploring ideas around non-fare revenue but have not yet been able to achieve significant revenue shares. One example would be to look at the Hong Kong model, where approximately 40% of the revenue is via non-fare box.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-metro-to-explore-non-fare-sources-such-as-advertising-land-monetisation-for-revenue/story-KZEQXEcq6Mfgt24kgJgihP.html

Kisan Rail was first operated between Devlali in Maharashtra and Bihar’s Muzaffarpur railway stations on August 7. The train, which was operated once a week, will now run twice a week. The second train will connect Sangola in Solapur district of Maharashtra to Muzaffarpur in Bihar.The train on its third run on August 21 transported 235.44 tonnes of produce which included pomegranate, lemon, cauliflower, garlic and eggs. “The train has got a good response from farmers and is being operated with assurance of faster and cheaper transportation, providing a seamless supply chain and preventing destruction of perishable farm produce, thus leading to increase in income of farmers. Prior to Kisan Rail, farmers largely depended on road transport,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, CR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kisan-rail-to-operate-twice-a-week/story-ztIiSoKn4KGQLTjGLhSv5M.html
25-08-2020||Mumbai||Maha nears 700,000 cases as recoveries cross 500,000 mark||Maharashtra inched closer to the 700,000 mark for Covid-19 cases with 11,015 new infections on Monday, taking its count to 693,398. Active cases also rose to 168,126, which is 24.24% of the total cases reported so far. Death toll of the state reached 22,465 with 212 more fatalities reported on Monday, of which 164 were reported in the past 48 hours, 19 were from the past week, while the remaining 29 deaths were from the period before that, health officials said.The single-day toll was the lowest since July 20, when 176 deaths were reported. On July 27, the state reported 227 casualties. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, meanwhile, cautioned people about the possibility of a second wave of the pandemic. The state also crossed the 500,000 mark for Covid recoveries after 14,219 patients recovered in the past 24 hours, taking the count to 502,490. This has led to improvement of recovery rate of the state to 72.47%, against the national average of 75.27%. Maharashtra continues to face a surge in Covid-19 cases as the number of fresh cases is yet to flatten. It has recorded over 14,000 cases for three consecutive days past week on August 20, 21 and 22. In the past 24 days of August, it recorded 271,719 cases, highest in any month, so far. It also accounted for 11,321 per day, on an average. With seven more days to go, it is likely to rise even further. The state has reported 247,392 cases in July, 102,172 cases in June, 57,157 cases in May, 10,196 cases in April and 302 cases in March.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday said that the state is going through its most crucial phase. “We are facing very challenging situation as festivals and monsoon, which lead to spread in other diseases, have come at the same time and thus local authorities will have to be more vigilant even if cases are reducing at some places,” Thackeray said, while holding a review meeting of the Covid-19 situation of Thane, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli municipal corporations where the Covid-19 cases had shot up since early June. He was in Thane on Monday. Chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said that the peak is coming in different cities at different time and they are hoping flattening of the curve soon. “Going by the experience of other countries, number of cases flatten after reaching peak and then start declining after sometime. In our state, peak is coming in different cities at different time. For instance, cases have flattened in Mumbai, but Pune, Solapur and Sangli are currently experiencing a peak,” he told HT.“Even in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) cases have started coming down. Hopefully, cases will be flattened in the coming days,” he added.State health minister Rajesh Tope has recently said they expect the downward trend of the Covid-19 infection after mid-September. Chief minister is concerned of second wave and has asked local authorities to remain vigilant. “The recurrence of the second wave is observed in some of the countries in the world whenever authorities go negligent. We have granted relaxations for some activities and the efforts are being made to make day-to-day activities smooth, but we have to remain alert,” the CM cautioned.Meanwhile, the state is contemplating on opening up intrastate and interstate movement, following directives from the central government.Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on August 22 has written to chief secretaries of all states saying that there should be no restrictions on inter-state and intra-state movement of people and goods. The letter also mentions that any such restriction would amount to a violation of guidelines issued earlier by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) during the unlock phases.The chief secretary has said that they will be allowing free intrastate movement after Ganesh Chaturthi. “We have already allowed intrastate movement. The condition for obtaining e-pass for travelling will also be scrapped. A decision on this is likely to be taken after Ganesh festival,” the chief secretary told HT on Sunday.Officials are wary that the move could further lead to spread in cases due to free movement of people “Opening of intrastate and interstate movement is nothing, but removing all travel restrictions. It will allow people to move freely and ultimately increase their movement. It is not advisable when the cases are already at a peak,” said an official from state health department.State transport minister Anil Pawar, too, said that it will put further strain on the existing health infrastructure. “The state is yet to take decision on this but allowing intrastate and interstate travel will put more strain on the health infrastructure,” he opined.However, chief minister said that they won’t be taking any decision, which will lead to withdrawal of existing relaxations. “Since June we have started Mission Begin Again and have given many relaxations in rural and urban areas, but whatever is not possible is not possible. We won’t be taking any decision hastily. We will not take a decision until and unless we are sure that it won’t being negative impact. No decision will be taken, which will lead to withdrawal of existing relaxations,” Thackeray told reporters.On Monday, Mumbai recorded 743 cases, taking its tally to 137,096.

Thackeray during the review meeting held in Thane stressed that the administration should keep a close watch on asymptomatic patients as well. “There should be contact with the Covid-19 recovered patients for one month. The symptoms of corona are changing day by day. The attention must be paid to asymptomatic patients,” the CM said in the review.Thackeray also stressed on dealing with monsoon-related ailments, condition of roads, garbage disposal and other issues within the municipal corporations. The CM also called for increased coordination between elected representatives and authorities along with greater involvement of locals for public awareness campaigns. “Now it is necessary to focus on monsoon-related diseases, potholes, roads and garbage along with other issues. If the municipal corporations, the health department, police and revenue authorities and the elected representatives work together, then we can defeat corona,” a note from the Chief Minister’s Office quoted the CM.Currently, 34,820 people have been kept at institutional quarantine facilities and 1,230,982 people are home quarantined across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-nears-700-000-cases-as-recoveries-cross-500-000-mark/story-pTzi1jjjLyBSAgOIfq1D6O.html
25-08-2020||Mumbai||Implementation of NEP 2020: Maharashtra education department holds consultations||Days after the Union cabinet passed the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, the Maharashtra education department has been holding several consultations with experts and stakeholders over its implementation in the state. On Tuesday, officials from the education department will hold a meeting with the representatives of private schools to get their feedback and suggestions on the issue. Over the past two weeks, several consultations were held with educationists, heads of various non-governmental organisations (NGO) and other stakeholders such as schools, colleges and standalone education institutes. “Various meetings were conducted with experts, and several suggestions have come to the government over the past few days. They will now be studied by a committee which would be formed to come up guidelines on the implementation of NEP,” said an official from the education department. On August 21, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray directed the formation of a committee to look into the implementation of the policy in Maharashtra. Meanwhile, teachers across the country have been asked to submit their feedback on the new policy introduced by the Centre. Some of the key themes under which suggestions have been invited include early childhood care, foundational literacy and numeracy, curtailing dropout rates, curriculum and pedagogy, teachers’ issues, inclusive education and use of technology in education. “In a state like Maharashtra, the implementation of the policy has to be in a phased manner because of the large number of students and the diversity in the learning backgrounds involved,” said a teacher from a suburban school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/implementation-of-nep-2020-maharashtra-education-department-holds-consultations/story-GLMhKFvG3PL29c23VsAneL.html
25-08-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death case: CBI continues to quiz staff, friend||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) continued its investigation into allegations of abetment in the case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. This is the fourth day of the Central agency’s probe into the incident and it has not made any major breakthrough so far. On Monday, CBI questioned members of Rajput’s staff, including cook Neeraj Singh, domestic help Keshav Bachner, as well as Rajput’s friend and creative content manager Siddharth Pithani. The interviews were conducted at the Defence Research and Development Organisation’s guest house in Santacruz (East). CBI officials also went to Rajput’s flat in Bandra with the four people who had been present in the apartment on the day Rajput died – Singh, Bachner, Pithani and Rajput’s domestic help Dipesh Sawant. This is the second time since Saturday that CBI has returned to Rajput’s home. Another CBI team visited Waterstone Resort in Andheri (East) where Rajput had spent two months last year. A few employees of the resort were questioned. On Monday afternoon, a CBI team also visited Cooper Hospital and met the team of doctors who had conducted the autopsy. Rajput was found dead in his Bandra apartment on June 14 and a case of accidental death was registered by Mumbai Police. The post-mortem report concluded Rajput had died by suicide. The probe into Rajput’s death was handed over to CBI by the Supreme Court on August 19, after the court upheld the validity of a first information report (FIR) lodged by Bihar Police in response to a complaint filed in Patna by Rajput’s father, KK Singh. Singh accused actor Rhea Chakraborty of abetment to suicide and misappropriation of funds. Chakraborty’s lawyer said she and her family have not received any summons from the CBI, so far, in connection with the case. “…If they receive a summon, they will appear before the agency,” Satish Maneshinde said.A senior CBI official said that after four days in Mumbai, CBI has not made any major breakthrough in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-cbi-continues-to-quiz-staff-friend/story-p42Lr9IABgX6FNSIa4ELiO.html

BMC sent two queries to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) about the trial on Saturday. The queries were raised by the ethics committee of King Edward Memorial (KEM) and BYL Nair hospitals which have been selected to run the trial in Mumbai.A civic official, requesting anonymity, said, “We have sent two queries to ICMR asking about the budget and insurance of the volunteers who will participate in the trial. The insurance amount has to be similar across the country. So, the council needs to inform us about the insurance amount.”Both the hospitals are waiting for the final nod from their respective ethics committee to begin clinical trials of the promising Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. After a nod from the ethics committees and a response from ICMR, the trials can start.“We are expecting to hear from ICMR by tomorrow (Tuesday). If the queries get resolved, we will start the trial by this weekend,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-sends-queries-to-icmr-about-covishield-trials/story-TrjO1jNrXHP3feTMiFKaGL.html
25-08-2020||Mumbai||AIIB’s ₹3,500-crore fillip to Railways’ MUTP-3 project in Mumbai Metropolitan Region||In a major boost towards upgrading the suburban railway network in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) along with the Maharashtra government on Monday signed a loan agreement of ₹3,500 crore ($500 million) with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) for railway projects under the Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP)-3.The total cost of the project is ₹10,947 crore of which ₹3,500 crore will be financed by AIIB. “The loan from the AIIB has a five-year grace period [for repayment] and a maturity of 30 years,” said a senior MRVC official, on condition of anonymity.MUTP-3 aims to expand the suburban railway network, improve the services and east-west connectivity in MMR.The projects under MUTP-3 will include a new suburban railway corridor between Panvel and Karjat railway stations for an estimated cost of ₹2,783 crore; procurement of 47 air-conditioned (AC) local trains worth ₹3,491 crore; quadrupling of the railway line between Virar and Dahanu stations for ₹3,578 crore; elevating railway corridor between Airoli and Kalwa stations for ₹476 crore; controlling midsection trespassing for ₹551 crore; and providing technical support for ₹69 crore. Of the remaining amount for the projects under MUTP-3, ₹2,629 crore will be taken on lease from the Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC), while the rest of the cost will be shared by the railway ministry and the Maharashtra government. The Maharashtra government and MRVC in August signed a Subsidiary Finance Agreement (SFA) for projects under MUTP-3. Welcoming the move, transport experts stated that railways and the state government should work in sync to start the on-ground work instantly for the project. “Projects under MUTP-3 are very crucial as Mumbai is now overburdened and after projects under MUTP-3 materialise, the population will shift to MMR, which is necessary. The state government should work alongside railways and provide support in land acquisition and rehabilitation. The projects should not be delayed,” said transport expert AV Shenoy. MRVC has started work on the midsection trespass control on the railway lines and the tendering process for other projects is also being initiated. The land acquisition for the projects started in 2019, while the on-ground work is likely to start after monsoon this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aiib-s-3-700-crore-fillip-to-railways-mutp-3-project-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region/story-A06flSqtNfS295BFYd1VIK.html
25-08-2020||City||Man complains against civic staff over misleading Covid test report||A 37-year-old man from Kalyan, who got tested for Covid-19 using a rapid antigen kit at a civic hospital in Kalyan (East) on August 11, complained that he was told he tested positive and was asked to go to a quarantine centre, but the test result was not provided to him. A week later, when he got the hardcopy of the report from the hospital, it showed he was negative for the infection. Rupesh Dwivedi has written to Kalyan Dombivli municipal commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi citing that civic staff at Geeta Harkisandas Dalal Hospital had said that he tested positive for Covid around 45 minutes after the test and asked him to be ready to move to Tata Amantra quarantine centre. Dwivedi, a banker by profession, had decided to get tested on his own in a bid to keep his mother, who underwent a bypass surgery earlier this month, safe. “When I asked them to show me the hardcopy of the test result, they did not show it and kept insisting that I get quarantined at the institution. In fact, even before the tested me, they had asked me to go home and pack so that I could be shifted to a quarantine centre, which was shocking,” Dwivedi said. The next day, Dwivedi got RT-PCR, which is more accurate than rapid antigen test, and some other tests at Metropolis Lab in Kalyan (West) and the report came negative. “I did not go to the quarantine centre as they did not give me the test report. Considering that my antigen test was positive as reported by KDMC, I continued with extra precaution and got several tests done, all of which came negative,” said Dwivedi. After repeated request and follow ups, the hospital gave him the hard copy of the test report on August 17 which showed he was negative, he claimed. “I have spent ₹14,000 for the tests and the mental stress was unbearable. I couldn’t even meet my mother. Later when I complained, one KDMC official claimed that they hadn’t told me that my report was positive. I want the civic body to look into the matter and take action,” added Dwivedi. Civic chief Vijay Suryavanshi did not respond when asked about the complaint.However, KDMC epidemic officer Pratibha Panpatil said, “The person tested negative in antigen test. But since he had symptoms, we had asked him to go to a quarantine centre where he would get RT-PCR test done for free. If a patient tests negative in antigen testing but has symptoms, we ask them to get RT-PCR test done. The patient took the message wrong and refused to go to the centre.”“Whatever tests he carried out was his choice. We did not ask him to get the tests done at a private lab. The only mistake my staff did was not providing the report on time to the patient which led to miscommunication. For this I have warned the staff,” added Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-complains-against-civic-staff-over-misleading-covid-test-report/story-PBNp37YUI71wOfqRwKowhO.html
25-08-2020||Mumbai||Varsity insists on form submission on campus; LLM students object||Even as the Apex court is yet to decide on the fate of examinations for end of term final-year students of professional and non-professional courses, students of LLM colleges affiliated with the University of Mumbai (MU) are facing fresh trouble as the university is insisting on physical submission of exam forms and exam fees at the varsity’s Fort campus.Several students have raised objection to the decision and requested that the procedure be conducted online in view of the Covid-19 situation in the state and city. Several students have cited that they are stuck in their hometowns due to the pandemic and the ensuing travel restrictions. However, the university has not responded yet. On Monday, officials at the examination department of MU told HT that it has decided to give concession of time to students who are currently in their hometowns and cannot travel. “Processes like applying for re-evaluation is being conducted online but applying for the upcoming examination session -- ATKT or fresh examination -- is only possible physically, which is unfair. Some of my friends, who are stuck in Punjab and other states, have been trying to convince other friends to visit the university campus and complete the process,” said Harshal Nahata, an LLM student who is currently stuck in his hometown in Chhattisgarh. Since June, several LLM students have taken up this matter with the university, state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant as well as other senior officials in the state education department, hoping for some relief. MU, meanwhile, has extended the deadline for completion of the application process over three times but the students have to complete it through physically visiting the campus.“At a time when Covid-19 cases are rising and the government is still unclear about the status of examinations, we don’t see why LLM students are submitting exam forms and fees. But the university seems adamant,” said another LLM aspirant on the condition of anonymity. For now, without releasing any official circular, MU officials confirmed concession of time for students. “We got complaints from some students who are either stuck in a remote town of Maharashtra or in other states. Therefore, they have not managed to submit their examination forms as well as fees. In such cases, we are going to allow them to finish this process later on once travel restrictions are eased and the students are back in the city for examinations,” said Vinod Patil controller of examinations, MU.Students, however, said they won’t believe this decision until the university released an official notification or circular clarifying the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/varsity-insists-on-form-submission-on-campus-llm-students-object/story-DpWgkcvHDdB1H8FR8GVCJJ.html
25-08-2020||City||Woman found with her throat slit in Taloja home||An unidentified person on Monday killed a 45-year-old woman by slitting her throat at her apartment. Police suspect someone known to her may have murdered the woman.“Her body was found in the kitchen. Based on injury wounds, her throat was slit with a sharp weapon,” said Kashinath Chavan, senior inspector of Taloja police adding that the murder weapon was not found at her apartment.According to police, Rekha Sharma, 45, stayed with her husband and 14-year-old son at their Taloja Phase-1 apartment in Sector 11. On Monday, at around 9am, her husband, who works as a mason, had left for work and her son was at his sister’s house. Police suspect the killer may have been waiting for her husband to leave before he entered her apartment and slit her throat. This was Sharma’s second marriage and she has three children including two daughters and a 14-year-old son from her first husband. Both daughters are married. Her first husband died by suicide around three months ago, in West Bengal, said police.After around 10 am, Sharma’s daughter was trying to call her mother, but she did not answer her phone. She then called her step-father and eventually went there to open the door using a duplicate key.“On seeing the body, the watchman of the society alerted the police. We are checking the CCTV footage to identify any suspicious person entering the building around the time of the murder. We suspect the killer to be someone known to the woman,” said Ravindra Gidde, assistant commissioner of police, Panvel division.The victim had recently taken to selling onions and potatoes during the lockdown, said police. Officers are investigating to ascertain if the motive behind the killing was personal or a professional enmity.The Taloja police have registered a case of murder against an unknown person under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-found-with-her-throat-slit-in-taloja-home/story-p4CLaor5yznYDeCNloFL5I.html
25-08-2020||City||3 of 4 held for stealing trucks tests positive for Covid||Three of the four accused arrested by the NRI police for stealing trucks have now tested positive for Covid-19. The two undertrials with their accomplices stole at least three trucks from Navi Mumbai after they were released on bail on June 29, due to the Covid-19 situation. On July 30, the men allegedly stole a truck from Nhava Sheva and stole a container from Panvel on August 8. They struck the third time by stealing the truck in Ulwe, said police.Police learnt that the four accused men, two of whom are in their mid-twenties and two others, aged 41, stole the truck from Ulwe in the early hours of August 16 by hot-wiring the truck.Two of them met in Taloja prison, where they were lodged in separate theft cases from APMC and Taloja police stations. After they were released on bail on June 29, they decided to steal trucks, as both of them had previously worked as truck drivers. With two other accomplices, they would travel in an autorickshaw and identify parked trucks along the highways in Navi Mumbai and steal it at night, an officer said.Based on CCTV footage and informant network, police managed to trace two of the men in Nerul and arrested them last week. The other two men were planning to sell the truck in Pune, from where they were nabbed. “The accused had scrapped two vehicles but we were able to nab them before they sold the Ulwe vehicle. Three of them have multiple cases of theft against them dating back to 2014,” said Samir Chaskar, an assistant inspector at NRI Coastal police station.The police have recovered the truck worth ₹30 lakh from the accused men.Soon after their arrest, the four accused were tested for Covid-19 as per protocol. Three of them have been tested positive. The accused are admitted at Vashi Hospital and Indiabulls quarantine centre.

Khattar announced his Covid-19 positive status via Twitter in the evening, while Gupta’s test report was made public early in the afternoon. “I was tested for Novel Corona Virus today. My test report has returned positive. I appeal to all colleagues and associates who came in my contact over last week to get themselves tested. I request my close contacts to move into strict quarantine,” Khattar tweeted. On August 20, Khattar went into self home isolation after Union water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and certain officials posted at the CM’s residence in Chandigarh had tested positive for coronavirus. Khattar had met Shekhawat in Delhi to hammer out a solution to the Sutlej Yamuna link (SYL) canal logjam. Till Monday evening, at least three BJP MLAs, excluding CM and speaker, were Covid-19 positive.

25-08-2020||Gurugram||Family remembers the deceased biker as a stickler for road safety rules||Family and friends of Alok Gupta — who lost his life on Sunday morning after a car, allegedly driven by a minor boy, crashed into his Harley Davidson motorcycle near Cyber City — remember him as a passionate biker who never failed to adhere to road safety rules. His friends said that he was so concerned about safety on the road that he would avoid busy evenings on Saturday. But riding his Harley Davidson on Sunday mornings was a ritual that the 49-year-old Gupta never missed. He was on his way to Greater Noida on one of his weekly rides when the driver of a Ford Eco Sport car on the opposite carriageway lost control and rammed into his bike.Supriti Batra, a family friend of Gupta, remembered him as a “great friend” whose “biggest passion was biking”. “We often used to visit each other’s house and were dance partners in our parties. He was the live wire of our group and without him any party felt incomplete. He never planned a party on Saturday as he never skipped his ride on Sunday morning,” she said. Gupta, who worked as the chief financial officer of a private company in Gurugram, is survived by his wife and two sons, aged 17 and 13. His wife, Mihika Wahi Gupta, said, “He loved many things, but biking was his greatest passion. Apart from that, he enjoyed music and loved spending time with the family. He was a family man. Once home, he just enjoyed with the boys and kept them engaged,” she said. Gupta had been living in the city since 1996 when he moved here for work after studying in Dehradun. Anurag Gupta, his younger brother, said that he had a motorcycle back in college, but he had never owned a Harley Davidson until 2016. “In January 2016, he bought his dream bike and kept his Sunday mornings free to ride it”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/family-remembers-the-deceased-biker-as-a-stickler-for-road-safety-rules/story-LlE3trER7nSRHHdDMmfM5I.html
25-08-2020||Gurugram||Cyber City’s killer bend has witnessed 9 accidents so far this year||A sharp bend near DLF Phase 2 rapid Metro station has emerged as one of the most accident-prone spots in the city, with over nine accidents taking place there so far this year, data from Gurugram police revealed. The killer bend’s, located opposite Belvedere Park, latest victim was a 49-year-old man, Alok Gupta, who worked as the chief financial officer (CFO) of an electrical manufacturing company and was killed on Sunday after being hit by a speeding sedan.Less than 100 metres before the sharp bend, vehicles coming from the carriageway from Golf Course Road through the Sikanderpur underpass, converge with traffic coming from unidirectional MG Road-Cyber City flyover. On both these stretches, vehicles tend to travel at a very high speed. To make matters worse, just prior to the sharp bend, the carriageway narrows by one lane, often resulting in vehicles suddenly switching lanes at a high speed, often without warning. On the opposite carriageway, vehicles coming from Shankar Chowk and travelling towards MG Road/Golf Course Road also encounter this sharp-bend. However, apart from some rumble strips, there is an absence of other major speed-calming measures or traffic signals on the stretch. Manu Kalra and Adil Nargolwala, residents of IREO Victory Valley in sector 67 and Beverley Park 2 in Cyber City respectively, both said that they feel unsafe while driving or jogging past this spot and feel there needs to be a system in place for checking speeding vehicles. They added that proper speed-calming measures also need to be introduced at the spot at the earliest. “Twice, I have had a narrow escape on the stretch. On both occasions, the vehicles were being driven at a high-speed and switched the lanes at the very last moment,” said Kalra. Nargolwala said that besides engineering changes at the spot, “a heavy presence of traffic police is required, especially during the morning hours to penalise offenders for speeding.” Sarika Panda Bhatt, road-safety expert and associate director, Nagarro, agreed. “The sharp-bend at Cyber City is a perfect example of an engineering design blunder. Redesigning the entire bend will not be feasible, nor will it take place on a short-term basis. To control accidents, serious speed calming measures, such as speed breakers should be introduced since rumble strips will make no difference on the stretch as the vehicles tend to travel at a high-speed. In addition, speeding needs to be checked through speed-monitoring cameras. Serious enforcement and introduction of speed-breakers are the best possible quick fix solutions to this crisis,” said Bhatt. A police team inspected the spot on Monday morning and said that they will be making a few changes. such as installation of speed breakers and putting a speed limit. “We will write to DLF for constructing speed breakers. We will also deploy a traffic police team to monitor the speed of vehicles. Simultaneously, we are also starting an awareness drive for underage drivers and will involve all schools and parents so that they are careful to not let their children drive. Four police vans will patrol the stretch 24x7,” said Karan Goel, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), DLF. DLF officials said that they had installed necessary speed-calming measures but speeding, and not road design, is the reason why accidents are taking place at the spot. “Before the sharp bend, we have constructed rumble strips to check speed. A vehicle travelling at 60-70 kmph can easily make the turn without facing any difficulty. However, the issue on this stretch is high speeding which is leading to accidents. If there was an inherent engineering design fault, then the total number of accidents at the spot would have been much higher. Traffic police need to install cameras at the stretch and fine people to prevent accidents from taking place,” said a spokesperson for DLF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cyber-city-s-killer-bend-has-witnessed-9-accidents-so-far-this-year/story-DtSjRN1Bwnbvwh1J7B2o5I.html
25-08-2020||Gurugram||Light rain predicted for Tuesday||The city might witness another spell of light to moderate rainfall starting Tuesday evening, weather analysts said on Monday. According to India Meteorological Department officials, rainfall activity is expected to increase over the next few days across Delhi-NCR and is predicted to last at least till Friday. Last week, Gurugram had to face a severe water-logging crisis following incessant rains for two days.While the IMD has predicted light to very light rain, accompanied by thundershowers, on Tuesday, moderate rainfall, with some isolated pockets experiencing heavy rainfall, is expected in the following days. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Delhi, said one or two spells of moderate rain accompanied by thundershowers with isolated heavy rain can occur on Wednesday night and last till Friday morning.“The monsoon trough is very likely to shift northwards and will remain very close to Delhi-NCR starting from August 25. Under the influence of this, the convergence of lower-level easterlies from Bay of Bengal and south-westerlies from the Arabian Sea will take place over northwest India,” said Srivastava.Gurugram’s maximum temperature on Tuesday is expected to rise slightly and touch 34 degrees Celsius, as per IMD’s weekly forecast. The maximum temperature on Monday was recorded at 32.7degrees— a marginal drop from Sunday’s 33.5 degrees—and a degree below the normal temperature. The minimum temperature stood at 26.2 degrees Celsius on Monday.Air quality in the city remained in the ‘good’ category on Monday, with the air quality index at 36, as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s bulletin. This was an improvement from Sunday’s AQI at 51 which fell in the‘satisfactory’ category. The improvement in air quality was attributed largely to an increase in wind speed and rainfall activity. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to remain in the ‘good’ category on Tuesday as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/light-rain-predicted-for-tuesday/story-DxkJwhpWQNhUQ1Zly9wwyK.html
25-08-2020||City||Gurugram: Hospitals and private labs to tie-up for Covid antigen testing, says health dept||Gurugram: With the Haryana government allowing private facilities to conduct Covid-19 antigen and IgG antibody tests at a fixed price, the district health department officials on Monday said that private labs will have to tie up with hospitals to streamline the reporting process of positive cases, so that timely treatment and contact tracing can take place through proper channels.The state health department allowed private testing in an order on August 21 albeit with a maximum price limit – rapid antigen testing at ₹650 and IgG antibody test at ₹250. For the gold standard front-line Covid-19 test - Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) - the price was capped at ₹2,400.“If an individual tests positive in an antigen test conducted by a private lab, the lab needs to recommend the patient to a hospital. Following the same procedures as in RT-PCR, labs will have to inform the health department about positive cases with correct contact details so that it can conduct proper contact tracing,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.Private facilities will have to ensure all symptomatic negative patients get real-time RT-PCR tests done as well, as the antigen tests are moderately sensitive. According to Yadav, hospitals and labs will have to tie up for this.“Hospitals which are not accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) will have to collaborate with private labs, authorised by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to conduct Covid-19 testing, so that symptomatic patients who are negative in rapid antigen tests can be tested through the gold frontline RT-PCR test,” said Yadav. There are only three hospitals in the city which are NABH accredited and can conduct the test on their own. Hospitals and labs that intend to perform antigen tests will have to register with the ICMR for data entry. The antigen tests look for specific proteins associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus — the pathogen that causes Covid-19. In the antibody test, blood samples are collected to check for antibodies which appear after the person is infected with Covid-19 and stays in the blood for months. The antibody test is used for Covid-19 recovered patients who donate convalescent plasma for severely ill patients. It is not used for active infections. For antigen tests, ICMR has recommended use of Standard Q Covid-19 Ag detection test, a point of care diagnostic assay, for testing in the containment zones as well as in hospitals in combination with RT-PCR test. As per the guidelines, tests have to be done in containment zones for all symptomatic and asymptomatic patients who are high-risk contacts with comorbidities. They have to be tested once between day five and day 10 of coming into contact. Also, tests have to be done for patients who are hospitalised or seeking hospitalization due to other health issues, like those undergoing chemotherapy, immune-suppressed and elderly patients. It also includes asymptomatic patients who are having surgical or non-surgical procedures. The health department has been conducting antigen tests by holding camps in affected areas, as well as in 19 urban Primary Health Centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-hospitals-and-private-labs-to-tie-up-for-covid-antigen-testing-says-health-dept/story-ZgYQ7zvTWlIcTN4nyGNWQJ.html
25-08-2020||Mumbai||2.5-L-sqm at SoBo stations to be developed commercially||In what can be a called a major redevelopment plan of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), the Indian Rail Station Development Corporation (ISRDC) will be shifting the existing suburban harbour railway lines of the terminus to the P D’Mello entrance of the railway station.A city centre rail mall will be constructed at CSMT along with other commercial developments at the terminus, Byculla railway station and Central Railway’s Wadi Bunder railway yard. Nearly 2.5 lakh sq meters of land will be used by the ISRDC for commercial developments of which 1.3 lakh sq meters will be utilised at CSMT and 80,000 sq meters at Byculla and 30,000 sq meters at Wadi Bunder, according to the information available.Passengers travelling from CSMT will also have to pay a fee - a user charge as commercial developments will also be provided on the terminus.The ₹1,642 crore redevelopment work is expected to start by next year and is targeted to be completed in the span of four years. Outstation terminus along with harbour railway will be operated from the P D’Mello entrance of the terminus. The shifting of the harbour railway to P D’Mello entrance was earlier planned by Central Railway and Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC).Other developments that will be done on the terminus will include the restoration of the heritage structures along with the creation of a concourse area with separate arrival and departures. Commercial kiosks at platforms, pick up and drop services of cabs at the P D’Mello entrance of the terminus will also be provided.ISRDC along with Central Railway is also in talks with Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) for the development of the railways Haji Bunder land in South Mumbai. The Central Railway owns 17.5 acres of land in Haji Bunder. Currently, the railway land at Haji Bunder is being used as scrap depot, where CR auctions scrap from its land across the city.The terminus will be redeveloped under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model. The selected bidder will undertake the redevelopment of the terminus and commercial establishment for the railway land on leasehold basis for 60 years. The ISRDC last week invited bidders for the Request for Qualification (RFQ) for the redevelopment of CSMT.The development will be undertaken in two phases; phase one will involve the shift of railway offices from CSMT, construction of offices and commercial establishments. The second stage will involve the segregation of traffic along with development at the terminus.To access the facilities the passengers will have to pay a user charge that will be taken by the redeveloper. The charges that the passengers will have to pay have not been decided yet. “A user fee will be charged. The price of the charges will be decided by the ministry of the railways. The redeveloped station building has to function like a city centre rail mall where in addition to a passenger’s transportation needs, his daily needs are also fulfilled, like- retail, food and beverages, entertainment and souvenir shopping. The aim is that most of his daily needs are catered to by visiting the railway station thus avoiding unnecessary travel within the city.” said Sanjeev Kumar Lohia, managing director, ISRDC.Passenger associations have asked the railways not to charge any money from the suburban railway commuters. “A passenger travelling from Thane to CSMT to work should not be charged a fee. People coming from outside that wish to wait and utilise other commercial facilities can be charged,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.Urban planners have raised concerns of road traffic coming from the Eastern freeway after shifting of the harbour railway lines to the P’D Mello entrance. “The move to shift the railway lines to the P’D Mello entrance has been long planned. However, there is a concern about the road traffic coming from the freeway. Presently, the entire traffic has to be stopped to take the turn to enter the CSMT railway station. A complete plan has to be decided. The introduction of commercial establishments is a good factor and we should move on from the traditional railway stations. Railway stations in London and New York Central have shops and restaurants.” said urban planner Sulakshana Mahajan.The ISRDC will also be undertaking redevelopment work of Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT), Kalyan, Andheri, Thakurli, Dadar, Borivli and Bandra Terminus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-5-l-sqm-at-sobo-stations-to-be-developed-commercially/story-vllk3wfNx0O7Zv1VKq7gRL.html

25-08-2020||Delhi||Six months later, north-east Delhi riot victims pick up pieces, rebuild lives||Six months after the communal riots in north-east Delhi in which 53 people were killed and over 400 injured, thousands of people rendered homeless and hundreds of properties vandalised and set on fire, people are still picking up pieces and struggling to rebuild their lives.Sitting outside his fruit shop-cum-house in Khajuri Khas, Deen Mohammad (58) said the building was set on fire by the rioters. He said he was happy that he managed to save the lives of his family members.With no money left to reconstruct the building, Mohammad and his two brothers had to rent a house in Chand Bagh, just across the road.Pointing at the walls of his house that are still covered in soot, he said, “I have taken loans from relatives to revive my business. The sale is not even 30% of what we used to have. Two of my brothers have already received Rs 1.5 each as compensation from the Delhi government but mine is still pending. We are just hoping we manage to repair our home soon and start living a normal life again.”Just across the road, Ashish Maheshwari and Mahendra Kumar Aggarwal re-opened their petrol pump in Bhajanpura, which was set on fire, in July. A huge blue tin sheet wall has been erected to cover the vandalised portion of the fuel station. With their office burnt down, the partners sit outside in shade to monitor the work.Maheshwari, 44, said it took them four months to re-start the business. “We had to fix three oil dispensing machines with one of them completely damaged by rioters. All the documents and stuff kept in our office also got destroyed. We had to take loans from relatives and friends to make this petrol pump functional,” he said.The coronavirus pandemic has come as a double whammy for the residents of the riot-affected areas. “We just want the year 2020 to end. It has been difficult to make ends meet in the past few months,” said Raj Kumar, owner of a general store in Shiv Vihar, whose shop was vandalised by rioters. “We somehow got the shop repaired, but then Covid spread. The business is down by almost 50%,” he said.A group of anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protesters on February 22 moved their ongoing protest at Seelampur to Jafrabad metro station. Violent clashes broke out between Hindus and Muslims in several areas of north-east the next day. Life returns but tension palpableAfter the violent clashes in February, Shiv Vihar crossing resembled a war zone with buildings vandalised and set on fire; streets covered with pieces of bricks, glass pebbles; burnt vehicles lying on the road; notebooks and books from nearby schools strewn on the roadside; people locked inside their homes and paramilitary personnel patrolling the area.Six months later, life is back on streets of Shiv Vihar as well as other riot-affected areas such as Bhagirathi Vihar, Brij Puri, Chand Bagh and Mustafabad. However, burnt shops and buildings still stand as a grim reminder of the violence. Almost every lane opening on Brijpuri road, which connects Shiv Vihar to these localities, has an iron gate installed or being installed.“This is for our safety. We had to erect temporary gates using tables and wooden sticks when rioters ran amok,” said Jeet Chaudhary, a resident of Bhagirathi Vihar.A team of Rapid Action Force personnel continue to patrol Bhagirathi Vihar — one of the worst riot-affected areas. “The situation is under control and there have been no incidents in the recent past. Our teams are deployed in the entire north-east Delhi,” said a RAF personnel, who didn’t wish to be named. Despite palpable tensions, several residents said they want to move on that the bond they shared with their neighbours is still intact. When Manoj Kumar, 40, a garment trader, had to get repair work done of his two-storeyed house in Mahalaxmi Vihar near Shiv Vihar crossing, he called Mohd Ayub, a resident of Chaman Park. “For us, nothing has changed. We trust him and this is why we called him to do the work,” said Kumar. Waiting for compensationBunny Kochar, 24, says that he saw rioters set his pastry shop, which he had opened two years back, on fire. “For two days, we kept the shutters down and tried to protect the shop. But then, we couldn’t do anything. Nothing was left in this shop,” said Kochar.On May 27, Kochar reopened his shop—Bunny Bakers. “Business is gradually picking up. But we haven’t got any compensation. I have made several rounds to the government offices, but I don’t know when we will get the money,” said Kochar.Mehtab Qamar, 45, who had built a house in Brij Puri using all his savings two years back, is also waiting for the government compensation. He used to sell acrylic sheets in a shop built under his house. “I had left with my family to a relative’s place in Uttar Pradesh 15 minutes before the rioters entered our area on February 24. They set my shop on fire and attacked my house with petrol bombs. It took us four months to gather the courage to return back to our home,” he said. “We have received Rs 25,000 as compensation from the government as of now. We have been out of work since February. Covid-19 has made the matters worse. We are left with no money to restart our business and government compensation is the only hope,” he said. Despite repeated attempts, Delhi government spokesperson didn’t report to HT’s query regarding disbursement of compensation. On July 21, the government had told the Delhi High Court that it has disbursed Rs 18.67 crore as compensation to the victims of the riots in north-east Delhi. In an affidavit filed through its additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose before a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan, the government said that it has received 3,041 applications for compensation of which 1,526 have been approved.Loss of LifeMany families, who lost their loved ones in the communal riots, said the damage is “irreparable”. Families of many such victims have vacated their houses in the riot-hit areas and shifted to other parts of the city. For instance, the family of a civil engineer Rahul Solanki, who died in clashes, has vacated their house near Shiv Vihar crossing and put it on sale. His father Hari Singh Solanki said it was very difficult for the family to stay in the area where their son was “brutally killed”. “Living in that locality was like reliving the same grief every day. We decided to vacate the house last month and shifted to some other part of the city. We want to sell that house now,” he said, adding that his family is still waiting for justice. Sheruddin, a resident of old Mustafabad, had lost his two brothers Amir (25) and Hashmi (19) in the violent clashes on February 25. Sheruddin said his brothers were returning from work when a mob attacked them near Gokulpuri. “After waiting for 24 hours, we visited the police station to file a missing complaint of my brothers. Within the next six hours we were told they were dead. It is still difficult to believe for the family that they both are gone. Amir has left behind two daughters -- 4 and 2-year-olds. They ask about their father every day and we have no answers to their queries,” he said.“It will take years to heal the wounds and ages to heal the hearts ravaged by hate,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/six-months-later-north-east-delhi-riot-victims-pick-up-pieces-rebuild-lives/story-n5bze5Jp4uVdpGDgbENzuJ.html
25-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s banquet hall owners suggest measures for Covid-safe parties in meeting with CM||Longer buffet layouts with increased gap between dishes, skip-a-seat rule during parties to ensure social distancing, mandatory masks and staggered entry of guests are some of the suggestions offered by owners of banquet halls during a meeting with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday to discuss standard operating procedures (SOP) to be followed by all such facilities in the national Capital.With the wedding season a little more than month away, the Delhi government on Monday started drafting SOPs to be followed by all banquet halls.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe suggestions of banquet hall owners would be incorporated in the SOPs,which are likely to be issued by this week, senior government officials later said.Representatives of the banquet halls demanded a relaxation on gatherings, which is presently restricted to 50 persons for weddings and 20 for funerals.“We requested the CM to relax the number of guests at a function to 50% of the size of the banquet hall. So, if a banquet hall has a capacity of 500 people, then 250 should be allowed. The CM did not deny the request and said it will be considered,” said Ramesh Dang, president of Delhi banquet federation, who attended the meeting.A senior government official, however, said any relaxation on the number of people will depend on the Centre’s Unlock 4 guidelines.Dang said the SOP for banquet halls would include mandatory masks for all guests and staff and frequent sanitisation of all common areas, including the kitchen.“To manage the crowd better, parking at banquet halls will have to be streamlined. It may now take longer for a guest to park their vehicles since the entry of guests at a function may also be staggered, especially at the time when the groom arrives at the wedding,” he said.During the meeting, Kejriwal is learnt to have told all banquet hall owners that in case Covid-19 cases spike again, these facilities may be requisitioned so they can be converted into makeshift hospitals.The chief minister also suggested that the representatives should create a common online platform where people can get the entire list of banquet halls in Delhi and book according to their choices.“People should be able to access the whole list of banquet halls in Delhi. So, if they are put on a single website or a medium, people from other states will also be able to book banquet halls in Delhi and you all will get more business. The website will be promoted by the Delhi government. The market, industries and service sectors will be displayed on the website and the traders, industrialists and service sector professionals can easily take their businesses to the global level,” Kejriwal told the banquet hall associations.Delhi has around 300 banquet facilities and most of them with multiple halls within their premises, taking the total number of halls to over 1,000. “I agree that an SOP must be made and it will be done soon. I will hold another meeting with representatives of banquet halls in few days to discuss environmental and parking issues as well,” Kejriwal said during the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/skip-a-seat-masks-for-all-delhi-banquet-hall-owners-suggest-measures-for-covid-safe-parties/story-tOYtUeJ00OWUl4pdt1BWOL.html
25-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi panel to start proceedings against Facebook for its alleged inaction on hate speech||The Delhi Assembly’s committee on peace and harmony will Tuesday initiate proceedings in connection with complaints about social media company Facebook’s alleged “deliberate and intentional inaction to contain hateful content” in India, the panel said in a statement. The proceedings will begin at 11am Tuesday.The committee, headed by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA from Rajendra Nagar Raghav Chadha, said it has taken cognisance of “several complaints” received from the people after the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on August 14 published a report titled ‘Facebook hate speech rules collide with Indian politics’. The WSJ report stated that Facebook officials, especially its top public policy executive in India, Ankhi Das, allegedly cited business imperatives while choosing to not apply hate speech rules to at least four individuals and groups linked with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India, despite them being internally flagged for promoting or participating in violence. “After careful deliberation on the allegations levelled in the complaints that we received, the committee has decided to take immediate cognisance of this issue. Summons have been sent seeking the appearance of certain expert witnesses, specifically Paranjoy Guha Thakurta and Nikhil Pahwa along with other witnesses for participating in the relevant proceedings,” Chadha said in a statement.He clarified that Das and other officials of the social media company have not been summoned as yet and that necessary action will be taken as the proceedings move forward and more evidence is gathered. Chadha said the committee aims to redress the issue at the earliest and therefore, the proceedings shall be expedited. “In order to discern the veracity of the complainants and allegations set out in the complaint, the committee has sent the notice for appearance to certain independent and expert witnesses as well as complainants. A few reporters who have been covering the issue and have been in touch with Facebook have also been called on Tuesday,” Chadha said. Facebook did not respond to the email sent by HT seeking its comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-panel-to-start-proceedings-against-facebook-for-its-alleged-inaction-on-hate-speech/story-5YatcCpj7u1JkndD5bRoqN.html
25-08-2020||City||Covid-19: Jamia considers merit-based admissions this year||Jamia Millia Islamia is considering merit-based admissions to its undergraduate and postgraduate courses this year in case it is unable to conduct entrance tests due to the Covid-19 pandemic, officials familiar with the development said.The university hold entrance exams for admission to 56 undergraduate and 15 postgraduate courses in June every year. This year, the tests have not been held till now due to the prevailing situation.A senior official, requesting anonymity, said the university has asked all candidates to upload mark sheets of the qualifying exams in its portal. “We have asked them to upload mark sheets of the qualifying exams as in case the situation arises to take admission on the basis of merit, we should have all the data,” the official said.A circular issued by the university’s office of controller (examination) on August 20 asked candidates who have already applied to upload their mark sheets on the admission portal. “All aspiring candidates are required to upload mark sheets of qualifying examinations, including those who have already filled in online application forms using their login id and password,” the circular stated.The university’s admission portal displays a message, saying, “Please reconfirm that you have filled all academic details properly. Merit list would be prepared based on the data entered by you here. No further claims for changes will be entertained.”Jamia media coordinator Ahmad Azeem, however, said, “No decision has been taken yet. We have already extended the last date to September 14 for the submission of online application forms for admission to various programmes. We are waiting for directives from UGC.”Candidates expressed concern over the possible changes in the admission process at the last moment. Kaif Jilani, a resident of Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly, who is seeking admission in an integrated course of BA-LLB, said, “Many students do not have enough marks in class 12 to compete in the merit-based admission process. I have scored 78% marks in class 12 and Jamia was my only hope since it does not consider marks of qualifying exams as the only criteria. I will have no chance to get admission in Jamia if the merit-based criteria is followed.” Suhail Ahmed from f Patna said many students from non-CBSE schools will suffer. “I completed my school from Bihar board and I have not scored 90% and above like CBSE students. I have no chance of getting admission in Delhi University. I was relying on Jamia. If the admission process changes, it will be very difficult for me to get admission in a college.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-jamia-considers-merit-based-admissions-this-year/story-h8WVvCTbusk3j5FYJ2NNuN.html

The NOC will help us in expediting the work for the underpass project that will provide relief to thousands of the commuters. Now, as we have the NOC, the work on the underpass will be completed within the stipulated time frame,” said Rajiv Tyagi general manager of the Noida authority.The DMRC allows any construction work under the Metro tracks only after due permission.“The execution of work shall be done in close coordination with the operation and maintenance department of DMRC. The work shall be done strictly as per the submitted method statement which shall be duly approved by the in-engineer in charge,” stated a letter from the DMRC to the Noida authority.The Noida authority plans to construct the 750 metres long six-lane underpass by March, 2021.The authority had conceived the project in July 2019 to manage vehicular movement at one of the major traffic intersections in Noida better. The Sector 71-52 intersection usually witnesses traffic snarls during peak hours in evening and morning.Once the underpass is ready, the commuters travelling from Noida’s City Centre to Greater Noida West will not cross any traffic signal if they use the underpass. Commuters travelling from Sector 62 towards Dadri Road will pass a signal-free stretch above the underpass.The underpass is projected to benefit residents of newly-built group housing societies in sectors 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79 in Noida and also those living in high-rises in Greater Noida West.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/dmrc-gives-its-nod-for-underpass-construction-at-sector-71-52-intersection/story-vFvltsMASO2ZIESJVzfA1L.html
25-08-2020||Delhi||Yamuna moves towards warning mark as Haryana releases water||The water level in the Yamuna rose close to the warning level on Monday, after Haryana released nearly 30,000 cusecs of water into the Hathnikund barrage in five stages starting midnight, flood control officials said.The water level recorded at Delhi’s Old Railway Bridge was 204.38 metres, flowing close to the warning level of 204.50 metres. This was after 5,883 cusecs water was released from Haryana’s Hathinikund barrage at 8am, said officials of the Delhi government’s Irrigation and Flood Control (I&FC) department. By 4pm, however, the water level had receded slightly and was at 204.30 metres. The I&FC officials said the water level has not risen beyond 204.38 metres since 8am and, unless Haryana releases a high volume of water, the level is likely to remain below the warning mark. Although the release of water into the barrage every four hours is a regular exercise, during the monsoon, the volume is exponentially higher, owing to rainfall in the hilly regions and the accumulation in the barrage. According to flood control officials, at midnight Sunday, Haryana released 3,060 cusecs of water after which the level at the Old Railway Bridge touched 204.25 metres. At 4am, 3,060 cusecs more was released and the level became 204.36 metres. Then at 8am, 5,883 cusecs was released after which the level rose to 204.38 metres, the closest it went to the warning mark. At noon, 10,231 cusecs more was released into the barrage, but by then, the water level had started receding and was recorded 204.26 metres. At 4pm, 7,330 cusecs more was released and the water level was recorded at 204.30 metres. “Water is released into the barrage every four hours. On a regular basis, only 350 cusecs of water is released. During the monsoon, because of a higher volume of water in the barrage coupled with the rainfall in the hilly regions, more water is released, which leads to a surge in the Yamuna level. It takes about 36 to 72 hours for the released water to reach Delhi. We are continuously monitoring the water level,” Sanjeev Kumar, SDM (Preet Vihar) and officer-in-charge, Flood Control. Last year, Haryana had released more than eight lakh cusecs of water a day, after which the water level had breached the danger mark of 205.33 metres. The river had inundated low-lying areas and evacuation and relief operations had to be launched by the Delhi government. The government had pitched over 1,300 makeshift tents to temporarily house those who were shifted out of flooded areas. The water level had hit a high of 206.60 metres, before it started receding.Kumar said preparations are already underway in case a higher volume of water is released and evacuation operations are needed to be launched. “We have identified locations for pitching tents. But this time, since social distancing norms are prevalent on account of Covid-19, we have also identified schools where people can be housed while maintaining a physical distance of six feet from one another,” Kumar said.Delhi had witnessed major floods in 1978 when the water level in the Yamuna rose to the highest ever level recorded of 207.49 metres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/yamuna-inches-close-to-warning-mark-as-haryana-releases-30-000-cusecs-of-water-in-16-hours/story-ZaZcIdKeQneKH4Qh4kdmVM.html

Earlier, 911 foreigners were allowed by the trial court to be deported to their native countries under the provisions of plea bargaining, while another 44 foreigners had chosen to stand trial. One Malaysian was found to be juvenile and his case was transferred to Juvenile Justice Board .Two each from Indonesia and Thailand and one person each from Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Kazakhstan and Jordan were set free without standing trial.The city police had filed 53 charge sheets against 956 other foreign nationals belonging to 35 countries for visa violation, not maintaining social distancing norms and other sections of the Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act.Chief metropolitan magistrate Gurmohina Kaur, while framing the charges, discharged the accused from the visa violation charges falling under the Foreigners Act. The judge said the statement of the police officers in which they had alleged that the Tablighi Jamaat people had professed and propagated the doctrines of Jamaat, are general ones and do not specifically allege the role of the accused.“They ( police statements) are not putting forth the case of the prosecution as it has not been asserted that the foreigners who had participated in the markaz from March 8 to March 10 had done so for the purpose of professing and propagating the principles and doctrines of the Jamaat.“In fact, there is not an iota of evidence to suggest that the accused had in any manner professed or propagating the doctrines of Jamaat or had indulged in Tablighi work as alleged,” the court said.Kaur also said the charge sheet is silent on this fact and the register taken from markaz merely marks the presence of the Jamaatis.The court, however, framed charges against them for negligence (269 IPC), disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant (188 IPC) and relevant sections of Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/court-drops-visa-violation-charges-against-tablighi-foreigners-books-36-others-only-for-negligence/story-dApfg8uF69eSfNieZ0sp5L.html
25-08-2020||Noida||Noida: 30,000 flats in unfinished Amrapali projects to be delivered in 36 months, says NBCC||The state-owned NBCC on Monday said it will finish the remaining construction work and deliver all apartments due in realty firm Amrapali’s stuck housing projects in the next nine to 36 months.“We have deployed 6,000 workers at all Noida and Greater Noida projects. The number of workers will be doubled in the next two months to make sure unfinished units are delivered within nine-36 months,” said PK Gupta, chairman and managing director (CMD), NBCC.The NBCC’s assurance has come a year after the Supreme Court removed the Amrapali Group’s promoters from its board, handing over the control of the realty firm to the court receiver, paving the way for fast delivery of delayed units to thousands of homebuyers.On July 23, 2019, the Supreme Court had appointed senior lawyer R Venkatramani as court receiver to control Amrapali’s housing projects and carry out further activities, including registration of ready units, accepting money from buyers, selling unsold apartments and dealing with the state-owned NBCC that has been directed to complete the stuck projects.Venkatramani, NBCC officials and homebuyers on Monday performed ‘bhoomi pujan’ at the site of Amrapali Smart City Golf Homes, Kingswood and other housing projects in Greater Noida, following which the NBCC started the construction work at Smart City-Golf Homes, Kingswood, Leisure Park (Phase-1, Phase-2 & River view), Centurion Park - Terrace Homes, Tropical Garden, Leisure Valley, and Dream Valley projects. All of these projects have a total of about 16,308 units.Civil work on these two projects was already completed but the developer had failed to finish and deliver the same.“In total, as per NBCC, 30,000 units are yet to be finished and delivered. Work suffered due to the pandemic, but now it is on in full swing and we delivered 73 flats in August. Another 160 flats will be delivered in different projects in September,” said Gupta.In the first tranche, NBCC had, on November 29 last year, invited firms to compete for tenders to the following projects: Centurion Park in Greater Noida Sector Techzone-4; Silicon City-I and Silicon City-II in Noida Sector 76, Zodiac in Noida Sector 120, Sapphire-I and II in Noida Sector 45, and Princely Estate in Noida Sector 76. Since then, the NBCC has been starting work at all projects in Noida and Greater Noida.The NBCC has also requested that the homebuyers should start paying up the remaining dues for their apartments so that construction remains on track.“We have started the construction work at all housing projects in Noida and Greater Noida as per court orders. All homebuyers will get their apartments as soon as possible. Homebuyers need not worry as work is on in full swing,” said Venkatramani.Homebuyers are upbeat after the work was started at Greater Noida projects.“We have been suffering since past ten years. However, now we hope that the dream of a owning a home may be realised after NBCC started construction at our stuck building,” said TK Pathak, Amrapali Smart City Golf Homes buyers’ welfare society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-30-000-flats-in-unfinished-amrapali-projects-to-be-delivered-in-36-months-says-nbcc/story-TX5AmDrWetubgC269d9GrN.html
25-08-2020||Delhi||High court allows trial court to hear arguments in Anshu Prakash case||The Delhi High Court on Monday allowed a city court to hear arguments on the framing of charges through a regular public prosecutor (PP) in a case related to the alleged assault on former chief secretary Anshu Prakash in which Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, and 11 other MLAs of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have been named as accused.Justice Vibhu Bakhru modified its earlier order of March 14, 2019, where it had directed the trial court to not conduct any proceedings in the matter till the lawyer’s issue was settled by the high court. The court, while removing the stalemate on the proceedings from the last one-and-a-half years, directed the trial court to hear the matter, following which it was listed for 4 pm on Monday.“As far as the March 14, 2019 order is concerned, the same is modified to the extent that the trial court can proceed and hear the matter at the stage of arguments on charge,” Justice Vibhu Bakhru said.The Delhi government declined to comment on the development.Prakash had moved the high court seeking early hearing in a case where he had alleged that he was assaulted during a meeting at the chief minister’s residence on February 19, 2018.The CM, the deputy CM, and other AAP MLAs had earlier denied any wrongdoing. The party’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj has accused Prakash of making false allegations at the behest of the Union government.In his plea, filed through advocate Stuti Gujral, Prakash had asked that the matter, which has been pending in the trial court in the arguments stage for framing of charges, be heard on the grounds that no substantive proceedings had happened in the last 18 months.In 2018, Kejriwal and Sisodia moved the high court, challenging a trial court order allowing Prakash to have the lawyers of his choice rather than a special public prosecutor.On Monday, senior advocate N Hari Haran and Dayan Krishnan, appearing for the CM and the Deputy CM, said they do not have any objection over the hearing to be conducted through the regular PP. He, however, sought some time from the trial court for them to prepare the case.Justice Bakhru agreed and directed the trial court to hear the matter at 4 pm. At the trial court, N Hari Haran sought time from the judge Vishal Pahuja, who listed the matter for further hearing on September 21.During the hearing, senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, representing Prakash, told the court that an early hearing be given in the matter at the high court. However, the court said it would not be feasible and posted the matter for further hearing on November 2.The Delhi police had on February 20, 2018, filed a first information report (FIR) based on Prakash’s complaint, in which he had alleged that he was called by the Kejriwal’s advisor, VK Jain, for a midnight meeting to discuss the release of the party’s advertisements related to the government completing three years in Delhi.Prakash said he was manhandled and assaulted in the course of the meeting. Police filed the case after the chief secretary was examined by a team of doctors at Ram Manohar Lohia hospital. Police later filed a 1300-page charge sheet against 13 AAP leaders for offences, including criminal conspiracy, assaulting a public servant, threatening to cause death or grievous injury, and wrongful confinement, among other sections.The maximum punishment in the case is seven years. On October 25, 2018, Kejriwal, Sisodia and nine other AAP MLAs were granted bail by the trial court in the assault scase.The other two MLAs, Amanatullah Khan and Prakash Jarwal, who are also accused, were earlier arrested in the case and granted bail by the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/high-court-allows-trial-court-to-hear-arguments-in-anshu-prakash-case/story-xOP1Q72USdvcbra8SYEJBP.html
25-08-2020||Delhi||Allow research scholars to return to campus, delay semester registrations, JNU students urge admin||From demanding that research scholars be allowed to return to the campus in a phased manner and that the monsoon semester registrations be delayed, students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Monday submitted a memorandum to the administration, listing out a slew of issues faced by them in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis. JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) also held a protest outside the dean of students office on Monday, while maintaining social distancing norms, before handing over the memorandum at the office.The JNUSU urged the administration to consider allowing students to return to the campus in a phased manner. “All students, especially research scholars, are not able to do their work as they have no access to university libraries, online or offline. The situation of research scholars who are supposed to submit their thesis this December is quite grave and needs urgent attention. Many are hampered by internet issues and power cuts at home. For these students to be able to continue with their academics, it is imperative to design a plan to bring them back to the campus,” the student body said in its letter to the varsity administration.Other matters listed in the letter included issues faced by MPhil students, delayed disbursal of scholarships, demands for a proper protocol for Covid-19 screening, testing and isolation, and postponement of registration of process for the monsoon semester. The JNU administration had announced the provisional registration for the monsoon semester from August 21 to August 31.“The mess bills of all students are highly inflated. There have been reports of massive corruption in food procurement in some hostels. In these times of the pandemic, many students are facing massive financial distress, and are unable to pay their mess bills. The mess bills should be corrected. Submission of mess bills should be removed as a criterion for semester registration,” the letter further said. “The registration process must be postponed until all students return to the campus,” it said.“The JNU administration and the dean of students has only provided verbal assurance to take up the issues,” JNUSU said in a statement.Despite repeated attempts, vice-chancellor Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar, dean of students Sudheer Pratap Singh and registrar Pramod Kumar were unavailable for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/allow-research-scholars-to-return-to-campus-delay-semester-registrations-jnu-students-urge-admin/story-5eZFN6QQgSEOYyygDANgxL.html
25-08-2020||Delhi||Gaps appear on Tilak Nagar flyover, PWD starts temporary filling work||A flyover in Tilak Nagar in West Delhi has developed gaps in its expansion joints placed between two girders, prompting the public works department (PWD) to start a “temporary repair” of the bridge to avoid any mishap. Traffic movement, however, has not been curtailed on the flyover for the repair work, PWD officials said.The gaps in the flyover were first noticed by regular commuters and residents around 10 days ago. They had then apprised their MLA Jarnail Singh about the issue, who in turn informed the PWD, which started the repair work on Monday. The development comes close on the heels of the collapse of an under-construction flyover in Gurugram on Saturday, injuring two persons. The nearly 1km long four-lane Tilak Nagar flyover runs parallel to the Blue Line of the Delhi Metro in Tilak Nagar and serves as a crucial link between the Rajouri Garden and Uttam Nagar areas in west Delhi. PWD officials said the flyover was built about 15 to 20 years ago, and an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 vehicles use it every day. According to PWD officials, expansion joints are placed between two concrete slabs or girders to hold them together and safely absorb temperature-induced expansions and contractions of the concrete slabs. There are around five expansion joints on the flyover on each carriageway and all of them have to be replaced eventually. Some of these expansion joints had developed a four to five inch gap, raising safety concerns. The asphalt layer of the flyover has also started eroding in a few places.Shahi Kant, PWD engineer-in-chief, said gaps between girders are normal and there was no need for panic. “As soon as I came to know about the problem, I issued orders to repair the gaps. The repair work has already started. This was a case of gaps in expansion joints and there are no cracks on the flyover as such,” Kant clarified.Another PWD official, on condition of anonymity, said the permanent solution to the problem would be to replace all expansion joints, which will take 15 days for each carriageway. “This work can be done after the monsoon is over and we would also need to stop the traffic movement. But for now, we have decided to repair expansion joints temporarily by filling the gaps. The repair work has started today (Monday),” the official said.When contacted, MLA Jarnail Singh said on receiving the complaint from residents, he informed the PWD authorities and conducted an inspection of the flyover himself last week. “There were three to five inch gaps between two girders on both carriageways. The matter was raised with the PWD authorities and they assured us the gaps would be repaired on a temporary basis on Monday, and all expansion joints will be replaced once the monsoon is over,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gaps-appear-on-tilak-nagar-flyover-pwd-starts-temporary-filling-work/story-1S26J3kWUwTbaZWdsw7dvM.html

The girl and her brother had gone to collect books from a government-run school and were waiting outside the park when the crime took place, said the police.A woman who was passing by saw the sister-brother duo crying, learnt about the alleged sexual assault and informed the police, which nabbed the man in the park itself.“We dispatched police personnel, including a woman officer. They surrounded the park to ensure the suspect did not escape. He was caught from the park. His mobile phone was seized and examined. Objectionable images of the girl were found on the phone,” said a senior police officer, who did not want to be named.Deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said the man, identified as Neeraj Kohli, was arrested in a case of rape and criminal intimidation under Sections 376(2) (i) and 506 of Indian Penal Code and 4 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, registered on the minor girl’s statement.According to the officer, the sister-brother duo lives in a West Delhi neighbourhood and studies at a local government school. The girl is a Class 7 student while her brother studies in Class 5. Their mother is a help while the father works at a shop.On Saturday, around 12.30 pm, the two had gone to collect books from the school. Police said the school guard told them to wait after which they went to the park, which was nearby.In the meantime, a stranger, who was smoking in the park, came and on some pretext took them to a secluded part of the park where nobody else was present, another police officer said, quoting the girl’s statemen“The man threatened the children and forced the boy to leave the park. He sexually assaulted the girl and took her images on his cellphone,” said the officer cited above.The girl came out of the park and met her brother. They were crying when a woman spotted them. She informed the police after the girl narrated the incident.“Our team reached there and caught the suspect from the park. The girl’s medical examination was conducted and her statement was recorded,” the officer said. Kohli’s antecedents were verified but he was not found previously involved in any crime, the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/minor-sexually-assaulted-at-delhi-park-attacker-held/story-1C0r8bRhAZlixHYruj3UqK.html
25-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC tells north MCD to release pension of retired civic employees||The Delhi High Court on Monday directed the North Delhi Municipal Corporation to release the pension of its retired employees due for April 2020, by the end of August 2020, and sought the response of the Delhi government and the civic body on a plea that sought directions to pay all arrears.A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad asked Delhi Government and North DMC to file a status report on a petition filed by Nagar Nigam Sewa Nivrit Karamchari Kalyan Samiti, a body of retired employees of the municipal corporation of Delhi, who are above the age of 75 and physically disabled to seek redressal of their grievances.The court asked the civic body to be prepared on the next date of hearing, September 21, with the timeline within which the pension arrears will be released to the retired employees.Appearing for the civic body, advocate Mini Pushkarna said the corporation had released the pension till March 2020 and steps will be taken to pay the amount for the month of April 2020 at the earliest. In its plea filed through advocate Ranjit Sharma, the association sought a direction to the respondents to release the pension on time every month and pay arrears of the benefits of seventh Pay Commission without delay.The plea sought a direction to provide cashless medical facilities to all retired employees who deposited subscription fee for the purpose in empanelled hospitals.The petitioner said the retired employees have been facing the problem of non-payment of pension since 2015.“The retired employees of North DMC are facing immense problems in meeting their daily expenses. Some of them have medical problems, which require urgent treatment and care. These retired employees do not have any other source of livelihood other than their pension. If the pension is released after a lapse of 2-3 months, it is imaginable what difficulties they would be facing,” the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-hc-tells-north-mcd-to-release-pension-of-retired-civic-employees/story-1akJqxqxJ5ItjaZzzfn8mJ.html
25-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: HC seeks police response on plea alleging cops leaked info||The Delhi high court on Monday sought the response of the city police, YouTube and Facebook on a plea by Jamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha who had sought directions to get various media agencies to take down the sensitive and confidential information pertaining to him, which was leaked to them allegedly by the police. Tanha also alleged that he was coerced into signing blank papers during his police custody. Tanha, a third-year student of BA in Persian language, was arrested in May in connection with the north-east Delhi riots that took place in February and is currently lodged in judicial custody. He was earlier arrested in connection with the violence in Jamia area during a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in December last year.Justice Vibhu Bakhru issued notices to two media organisations after Tanha, through his counsel Sowjhanya Shankaran, told the court that police have been leaking his disclosure statement, which was recorded during his interrogation. The court, however, did not pass any ex parte order against the two media houses or the social media companies to remove the content while stating that it will pass orders after hearing all parties.“I agree it is not acceptable behaviour if some officer has done this and advocate Rajat Nair (representing Delhi Police) will agree with it,” the judge observed.Advocate Siddharth Aggarwal, appearing for Tanha, argued that his client’s bail plea was being considered by the trial court and the timing of the publication of the articles in the media was such that it was not only prejudicing the public mind, but also the trained mind that was hearing the bail application.Special public prosecutor Rajat Nair, representing the Delhi government and the Delhi Police, sought time to seek instructions on the issue following which the court posted the matter to September 17.In his plea, Tanha said he was aggrieved by various publications that had reported that he had confessed to orchestrating the north-east Delhi riots. He alleged that he was coerced into signing blank papers in police custody. He said the leaks of his forcefully taken statements have been leaked by the police with mala fide intent to cause prejudice to his case.“Tanha is a key member of the Jamia Coordination Committee and played an active role in organising protests and riots in Jamia in December 2019. He is a close associate of Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, Meeran Haider and Safoora Zargar who were the key organisers of anti-CAA protests and subsequent riots,” the police had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-hc-seeks-police-response-on-plea-alleging-cops-leaked-info/story-z1GvaUETeMeJtg85E5iwdL.html

Reach-two on Vanaz-Ramwadi route is expected to start by March 2021,” he said.Earlier last week, Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister and Pune district guardian minister, held a review meeting with the top officials and instructed them to speed up the metro work along with land acquisition process for proposed international airport work located at Purandar. After Pawar’s instructions, Maha-Metro has rescheduled its time table.Gadgil said, “After Covid pandemic, most of the labourers working with the metro went back to their hometown. As there is not enough manpower, only essential works were carried out after acquiring permission from municipal corporation and district administration.”Maha-Metro, the agency responsible for executing the metro rail work, had earlier missed its deadline twice to start operations on priority stretch. It was to start operations by December 2019 and later by April 2020.Gadgil said that by September it is expected that the work will start at full capacity.Hemant Sonawane, public relation officer, Maha-Metro, said, “We require almost 5,500 labourers. Even today hardly fifty to sixty per cent labours have come back to the city. But we expect within a few days, work will start in full capacity.”According to Gadgil while the metro work has got affected due to unavailability of the labours, the work of the underground metro is progressing speedily as it requires less manpower. “It is mainly technology-driven work and very soon the tunnel between Range Hills and Civil court will be complete. Right now, underground tunnel work is completed till Range Hills to Shivajinagar MSRTC bus stop.”Manpower crunch hampers workPune Metro had already completed its trial run in January this year. It was expected that by May or June, the commercial operations would start on the corridor in between PCMC and Range Hill, but due to the pandemic and lockdown restrictions, most of the labourers had returned to their hometown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/metro-on-pimpri-range-hills-stretch-to-go-live-by-dec/story-G9ZzOpLhtTXxqE8PS0hFYJ.html

25-08-2020||Pune||Pune’s Hadapsar and Dhankawadi wards account for 17% of Pune’s total cases||Two of city’s wards account for about 17 per cent of the total progressive Covid-19 cases. As of August 22, a total of 83,152 Covid-19 cases have been reported in Pune, among them 7,598 are from Hadapsar-Mundhwa. In second spot is the Dhankawadi-Sahakarnagar ward which reported 7,015 cases. The Hadapsar-Mundhwa ward has also topped the number of containment zones declared by the civic body as of August 17 with 11 containment zones, equal to the Kothrud-Bavdhan ward with 4,940 cases. The Dhankawadi-Sahakarnagar ward has only two containment zones. Hadapsar has been a Covid-19 hotspot for quite some time now with most cases being reported from Mundhwa-Magarpatta, Hadapsar Gaon-Satavwadi, Fursungi and Mohammadwadi-Kausar Baug subwards. While Dhankawadi-Sahakarnagar ward is at the second spot of reporting maximum progressive cases, the sub wards of Datta Nagar-Katraj Gaothan, Dhankawadi-Ambegaon Pathar and Sahakarnagar-Padmavati are the worst affected areas in the wards. Assistant municipal commissioner Bankar Somnath Haribhau of Hadapsar-Mundhwa ward who was earlier the ward officer for Bhavani peth and successfully controlled the spread of the virus in the ward has now been tasked with the Hadapsar-Mundwa ward.  Haribhau said, “Of course the demographics of both the wards are very different. Bhavani peth had more older houses, and narrow lanes but Hadapsar has newly added rural areas which are reporting more cases like Fursungi, Mundhwa and Sade Satranalli. We will use the same tactics that we used in Bhavani peth like aggressive testing may be tweaking guidelines a bit to increase our testing capacity. In addition to the testing centre at Bankar civic school we now also have three mobile testing vans and keeping a focus on those with comorbidities.”“Also in the case of Bhavani peth, that was the time when lockdown was being followed diligently which is not happening now as unlock has begun. Also, the Ganpati festival is ongoing and so our focus is to encourage Ganesh visarjan at home. Also we are surveying and looking for senior citizens, pregnant women and those with comorbidities and we will be in touch with them and request them to report even the slightest symptoms,” he added. In addition to these two wards, Kasba-Vishrambaugwada is at the third spot with 6,669 cases, followed by Sinhgad road with 5,533, Warje-Karvenagar with 5,528 cases and Ahmednagar road-Vadgaonsheri with 5,350 cases and Dhole Patil road with 5,150 cases. While the wards of Bhawani peth and Shivajinagar-Ghole road which were the worst affected in the initial period when the pandemic struck have now shown tremendous recovery with 4,229 and 3,618 cases respectively. The least number of progressive cases are reported from Aundh-Baner which have reported 3,206 cases as of August 22. In terms of containment zones too, Ahmednagar road-Wadgaonsheri and Shivajinagar- Ghole road has 10 containment zones, while Kasba-Vishrambaugwada and Dhole Patil road has four containment zones.

25-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Dairy trader killed, dumped in well by employee who wanted salary hike||A dairy trader (45) was murdered and dumped in a 50-foot deep well in West Delhi’s Najafgarh, Delhi Police said on Monday. The police have arrested the assistant of the slain dairy trader Om Prakash. The police said that the dairy trader was murdered, as the assistant was allegedly disgruntled with him for not raising his monthly salary. Prakash’s decomposed body was found in the well in an agricultural field on Saturday morning, about 10 days after he was killed and dumped. On Sunday, the suspect, Mohammad Tasleem, was nabbed by the Dwarka district police authorities from Jharoda Kalan in West Delhi, soon after he returned from Panipat in Haryana, where he was hiding at a relative’s house, said Anto Alphonse, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Dwarka, Delhi Police. “He has revealed that he killed his employer following a heated argument over not raising his monthly salary,” said the DCP, adding that a stick and a knife was allegedly used in the murder. The murder weapons and Prakash’s motorcycle that Tasleem had used to decamp a day after allegedly committing the murder have been seized by the police, the DCP said. Prakash, a bachelor, lived in Najafgarh’s Dhichaon Kalan, which is notorious for its criminal antecedents. He ran a dairy business along with his nephew, Purushottam. “My uncle had decided to hire a help because we were overburdened with work. On June 23, we hired Tasleem, who had earlier worked at a restaurant,” said Purushottam. Tasleem was hired for a monthly salary of Rs 12,000, even though he had demanded Rs 15,000, he said. But the DCP quoted Tasleem as saying that he was hired for Rs 15,000, but was being paid Rs 12,000 by Prakash who cited losses due to the pandemic for not keeping his word. The monthly salary amount became a constant source of friction between the deceased and the arrested accused, he added. Another argument occurred between the duo on the night of August 11, said Purushottam, who had to intervene to end the quarrel. The following morning Prakash was found missing, said a police officer probing the case. “Tasleem misled the family by saying that Prakash had left town. But by evening, when he realised that the probe would lead the police to him, he rode away on Prakash’s motorcycle,” said the DCP. “We registered a kidnapping case and started looking for Tasleem and searching for Prakash,” he added.On Saturday morning, Prakash’s decomposed body was found in the 50-foot deep well in the agricultural field near the place, where ran his dairy business. “The owner of the field had visited the farmland following a stench emanating from the well. Later, Delhi Fire department authorities sent personnel to fish out the decomposed body that was half stuffed in a sack and tied with a rope,” the official said. Soon, the police tracked down Tasleem in Panipat. “Tasleem has confessed to his crime. He recounted that Prakash had slapped him during the quarrel. An enraged Tasleem, in turn, thrashed him with a stick and then slit his throat with a knife while he was sleeping,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-dairy-trader-killed-dumped-in-well-by-employee-who-wanted-salary-hike/story-rxYwQflwaCZLNCoGwY1RNP.html
25-08-2020||World||New coronavirus cases decline in the US and experts credit masks||The number of Americans newly diagnosed with the coronavirus is falling — a development experts credit at least partly to increased wearing of masks — even as the outbreak continues to claim nearly 1,000 lives in the U.S. each day.About 43,000 new cases are being reported daily across the country, down 21% from early August, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. While the US, India and Brazil still have the highest numbers of new cases in the world, the downward trend is encouraging.“It’s profoundly hopeful news,” said Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious-diseases expert at the University of California, San Francisco, who credits the American public’s growing understanding of how the virus spreads, more mask-wearing and, possibly, an increasing level of immunity.“Hopefully all those factors are coming into play to get this virus under control in this country that’s really been battered by the pandemic,” she said.The virus is blamed for more than 5.7 million confirmed infections and about 178,000 deaths in the US Worldwide, the death toll is put at more than 810,000, with about 23.7 million cases.Jeffrey Shaman, a public health expert at Columbia University, said he is skeptical enough people are immune to significantly slow the spread. But he agreed that changes in Americans’ behavior could well be making a difference, recalling the impact that people’s actions had in containing Ebola in West Africa several years ago.“Ebola stopped for reasons we didn’t anticipate at the time. It was so horrifying that people stopped touching each other,” Shaman said. Something similar may be happening with the coronavirus, he said.“I know I don’t have nearly the number of contacts that I used to,” Shaman said. “But if we relax that, if we get complacent, will we just see another outbreak?”The decline in newly reported cases in the US comes even as deaths from the virus remain alarmingly high. Over the past two weeks, officials have reported an average of 965 deaths a day from Covid-19, down from 1,051 a day in early August.Deaths from the coronavirus are a lagging indicator — they trail new infections because of the time it takes for people to get sick and succumb to the disease.The percentage of tests coming back positive for the disease has also declined over the past two weeks, from 7.3% to 6.1%. But that comes as the total number of tests administered has fallen from its August peak of more than 820,000 a day, leveling off in recent weeks at about 690,000 a day.The situation has improved dramatically in several states that struggled with high caseloads earlier this summer.In Arizona, for example, officials reported 859 new cases Tuesday, down from a peak of 5,500 in late June. More than 2,000 people arrived at the state’s hospitals showing symptoms of the virus on a single day in early July. This week, that number has been less than 1,000.In Florida, where more than 10,000 people have died, the state reported 2,600 new virus cases Tuesday. Earlier in the summer, it was regularly reporting more than 10,000 new cases.Malinda Coler, 37, of San Francisco, said she has been diligent about mask wearing and other preventive measures, less to protect herself than a best friend who has a compromised immune system, with severe arthritis psoriasis.“So I wear a damned mask and get infuriated when others don’t,” she said.It’s not clear what will happen to case numbers as more school districts bring students back to classrooms and colleges reopen their campuses. In recent weeks, schools including the University of North Carolina, Michigan State and Notre Dame have moved instruction online after outbreaks on their campuses.Officials at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville said Monday that four students are facing disciplinary proceedings after three hosted off-campus parties with no mask or other distancing and another left isolation to meet with others despite testing positive for the virus.“If the facts reported to the university are accurate, these students will face at least suspension from the university, and potentially greater penalties,” Chancellor Donde Plowman wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-coronavirus-cases-decline-in-the-us-and-experts-credit-masks/story-BNmkzpE05noN4A2YPlUUII.html
25-08-2020||World||In first foreign trip since pandemic, China’s foreign minister visits Italy||Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said he emphasized during a meeting with his Chinese counterpart on Tuesday that Italy would be monitoring closely the implications of new Chinese security measures in Hong Kong.“I reiterated that, together with all our European partners, we have emphasized that Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity, based on the one country, two systems principle, are essential,” Di Maio told reporters in a joint press conference with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.It is equally essential to ‘’preserve the high degree of autonomy and the fundamental rights and freedoms’‘ guaranteed to Hong Kong citizens, he said.Rome is the first stop of Wang’s five-nation European tour, which includes France, Germany, the Netherlands and Norway. It is Wang’s first foreign trip since the coronavirus outbreak in China that turned into a global pandemic.Wang emphasized China’s support for close ties with Italy, with which it formed diplomatic relations 50 years ago.The ministers were scheduled for a private lunch after their press statements.The visiting diplomat’s top agenda item in Europe was expected to be pushing Europeans to guarantee market access to telecom giant Huawei, and broader efforts to keep European countries quiet on Hong Kong and to take Beijing’s side in its tariff war with Washington.Before the meeting, prominent Hong Kong democracy activist Nathan Law delivered a letter to the foreign ministry asking Di Maio to address ‘’the Hong Kong problems and human rights violations’’ during the meeting.China’s contentious national security law for Hong Kong is seen by many as Beijing’s boldest move yet to remove the legal firewall between the semi-autonomous territory of Hong Kong and the mainland’s authoritarian Communist Party system.’’We need to work together to form a strong alliance to go against the authoritarian nature of China″ Law said.Italy last year was the first major democracy to sign an agreement to join China’s “Belt and Road” initiative. The program includes major infrastructure investments to create a conduit for trade and China’s construction industry. Both the United States and Italy’s European partners see it as a threat as China seeks to project its power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-first-foreign-trip-since-pandemic-china-s-foreign-minister-visits-italy/story-5cS6lwqYd3V5P0skTbJtlI.html
25-08-2020||World||UK’s Boris Johnson urged to rethink face mask advice in schools||The British government came under renewed pressure Tuesday to change tack and encourage high school students in England to wear face masks when they return to class next week, at least in communal areas such as hallways.A day after the World Health Organization tweaked its guidance over mask-wearing by children, Scotland changed its advice, a move that’s piled pressure on the other nations of the U.K. to follow suit.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his government, which oversees schools in England, would back a change “in some contexts” if the medical evidence shows face masks help in the battle to contain the coronavirus.“If we need to change the advice, then of course we will,” he told reporters while on a visit to a shipyard in Devon in southwest England.The main opposition Labour Party said there is a “growing body of evidence” to show that face masks in communal areas in secondary schools help protect students and staff. And a union representing school principals said it would be “prudent” for the government to review its guidelines in light of the change in Scotland and the new WHO advice, and that any change should be announced “sooner rather than later” given the imminent reopening of schools.The debate has intensified after the WHO changed its guidance to recommend that children between the ages of 12 to 18 should wear masks when they can’t socially distance and in areas of high transmission.The advice of the British government is that face masks aren’t necessary. It points to a recent report from Public Health England that showed very few virus infections during the partial reopening of schools for younger students in June.The merits of face masks comes as the government tries to reassure nervous parents that their children will be safe when they return to school. Schools across the UK closed in March as part of the lockdown, meaning that many students haven’t seen the inside of a classroom for nearly six months.“I think that the schools, the teachers, they’ve all done a fantastic job of getting ready and the risk to children’s health, the risk to children’s well-being from not being in school, is far greater than the risk from COVID,” Johnson said.The evidence from around the world is that children face less severe virus symptoms than do adults. However, they can be sources of transmission and governments around the world are grappling about how school reopenings will affect the virus’ spread within families and in the wider community.“In the absence of clarity, given the known detrimental impact of school closures, we must err on the side of caution in order to ensure that when schools reopen, they remain open,” said Dr. David Strain, a clinical senior lecturer at the University of Exeter.England’s nearly 25,000 schools are due to reopen over the coming couple of weeks, and Johnson’s Conservative government is focused on making sure the return goes smoothly following the recent exam grades fiasco. The furor, which eventually saw the government ditch a controversial algorithm used to determine results after exams were cancelled as a result of the pandemic, claimed its first casualty Tuesday with the resignation of Sally Collier, head of the exams regulator Ofqual.Within the UK, which has the highest virus-related death toll at nearly 42,000, Scottish schools reopened first, followed by those in Northern Ireland. Schools in England are Wales are due to reopen in September.Two weeks on from the reopening of schools in Scotland, one school in the city of Dundee has already had to close following an outbreak, a development that appears to have been at the heart of the change in face mask advice.Following on from the change in WHO guidelines, the Scottish government confirmed Tuesday it was giving “obligatory guidance” to high school students to wear face coverings when moving around schools from Monday.“It is right we reflect that in our guidance,” Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said.Scotland has often led the way within the UK during the pandemic on the wider use of face coverings. It, for example, mandated their use in shops after they reopened a couple of weeks before England. The Welsh government also said that it was considering a change of policy for high schools in Wales.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-boris-johnson-urged-to-rethink-face-mask-advice-in-schools/story-pIAygC67yAzeTSDViAsq1N.html

Flávio Bolsonaro is the fourth member of President Jair Bolsonaro’s direct family to be infected by the new coronavirus, including the president himself, first lady Michelle Bolsonaro and Jair Renan Bolsonaro, another son.The Brazilian president has downplayed the virus’ severity, arguing against restrictions on economic activity he claims will prove far more damaging than the disease. His approach to the pandemic runs counter to most health experts’ recommendations.Flávio Bolsonaro said he has being treated with azithromycin and chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that was touted both by Brazil’s president and by U.S. President Donald Trump despite clinical trials that found it ineffective or even dangerous.Brazil so far has registered over 3.6 million cases and more than 115,000 deaths, second in the world only to the United States.Several members of Bolsonaro’s staff also have tested positive for Covid-19, among them eight Cabinet members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/now-jair-bolsonaro-s-eldest-son-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-XVtVheZzpCiM5nvTBcqo7I.html

25-08-2020||World||US-Canada border closure hurts Washington state town||The border closure between Canada and the United States has severely hurt Point Roberts, Washington, which is isolated from the rest of the country.The extended coronavirus-induced border closure shut down two border crossings for the town of about 1,300 people, who must commute 25 miles through Canada to get to the rest of Washington state.“We really need that border open to survive,” said Tamra Hansen, who owns the Saltwater Cafe in Point Roberts.The economy still depends on the flow of people and resources to and from the border, which closed in March and will remain closed through at least Sept. 21, KING-TV reports.“I rely on approximately 90% of my business from the Canadians, that come from the seasonal people,” Hansen said. “And we make our money in the summer to get through the winter.”There is no regular ferry or air service to Point Roberts. There have been no confirmed coronavirus cases reported in the town.In 2019, 1.4 million people crossed the border into Point Roberts. So far this year, there have been just 217,000 visitors.Gov. Jay Inslee penned a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last Friday addressing these concerns. Inslee cited in his letter the need for a “practical solution to this issue” and emphasized “unique hardships” faced by Point Roberts residents.It followed a similar letter to the US Ambassador to Canada co-written by the state’s Senators, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, and two other Washington state congresspeople.The city was created because of a quirk in the Oregon Treaty of 1846 between the United Kingdom and the United States. The two countries agreed to settle their border dispute by dividing their territories in the Pacific Northwest along the 49th parallel. But, that left the small area of Point Roberts on the southern tip of the Tsawwassen peninsula in American control.Darryl Marquette, an employee at TSB Shipping in Point Roberts, says the shipping company has had boxes meant for Canada backlogged for months because of the border closures.Residents like Brian Calder, a longtime resident who worked as a city councilor in Vancouver, have advocated for relief, saying that citizens of Point Roberts should be given an exemption to cross the border.“Businesses here are down 80% -- down 80%!” said Calder. “They can’t survive through this winter. Like, it’s not possible. I’m really pessimistic about the recovery here.”Canada recently ironed out a plan to allow those in Alaska to cross the border at five specific ports using car placards to identify themselves.Hansen worries, though, that the efforts of its citizens and lawmakers will be futile.“All the other restaurants have closed down, the golf course is closed,” Hansen said. “Quite honestly, I probably should have just closed.”The number of coronavirus infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some — especially older adults and people with existing health problems — it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-canada-border-closure-hurts-washington-state-town/story-VcDS3WFoKXvmzH6tAjctWK.html

Experts paint a grim picture||Kim Jong Un’s sister Kim Yo Jong could rule North Korea with an iron fist, experts have said amid reports that the country’s leader is in coma.Since the reports on Kim’s deteriorating health started emerging, global experts have been discussing North Korea’s future and what could the regime change there mean for the world. The reports from South Korean intelligence agencies that Kim has handed over power to his sister have many of them worried.“Given the reputation and history of the family, she would rule with an iron fist,” retired US Army Colonel David Maxwell told New York Post.Sung-Yoon Lee, a professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, told The Post though Kim Jo Yong appears to be feminine, “the nature of the regime demands she be ruthless, especially in the first few years.”Also read: What happens if Kim Jong Un is dead? Explaining North Korea’s succession planThe Hermit Kingdom is already known for implementing tough measures, and the violators are dealt with harshly.A former BBC journalist, however, has suggested that Kim Jong Un may already be dead.“I honestly believe he’s dead but you just can’t tell with that country. I could be in Pyongyang now and be none the wiser,” Roy Calley said in an interview to Express.co.uk.Calley’s comments came after The Korean Herald quoted a former aide of South Korea’s late president Kim Dae-jung as saying, “I assess him (Kim Jong-un) to be in a coma, but his life has not ended.”Seoul’s spy agency told lawmakers in a closed-door meeting about a ruling system that Kim seemed to have set up following which he shall share authority and responsibility with his most trusted aides, the South Korean daily reported. The National Intelligence Agency, however, said that the new system is not associated with any serious health issue, according to The Korean Herald.Meanwhile, a Korean website Shinmoongo rubbished the reports as absurd and reminded of the time when Chang was “greatly embarrassed” after he raised the rumour of Kim’s death on April 23.Following the reports, Calley said North Korea’s vague statements on Kim Jong-un point towards some major changes being brought in. “The fact that there is so much information/misinformation being released suggests there is something happening,” Express.co.uk quoted him as saying.The last official reports from North Korea stated that Kim Jong Un has issued a dire warning for the country’s economy amid reports that he delegated some power to his sister, including responsibility for relations with the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-will-kim-jong-un-s-sister-rule-north-korea-experts-paint-a-grim-picture/story-ppCug8GqpuIBeevNxy4K9O.html
25-08-2020||World||Gaza locks down after detecting local transmission of coronavirus||Gaza’s militant Hamas rulers imposed a territory-wide curfew on Tuesday after authorities detected the first local cases of the coronavirus, raising fears of a wider outbreak in the blockaded territory that is home to some 2 million Palestinians.Gaza has registered more than 100 cases and a fatality since the start of the pandemic, but until now all the infections were linked to quarantine facilities for returning travelers. Most lockdown restrictions were lifted months ago, with even wedding halls operating normally.The four cases detected in central Gaza indicate the coronavirus has breached the territory’s defenses, and a wider outbreak could overwhelm a health care system battered by years of war and isolation, with only a few dozen ventilators for the entire population.Gaza has also seen rising tensions in recent weeks between Israel and Hamas, as militants have launched incendiary balloons and rockets into Israel while demanding the easing of the blockade imposed when Hamas seized power in 2007. Israel has responded by tightening restrictions further and launching airstrikes against militant targets.Hamas announced a 48-hour curfew after the four cases were announced late Monday. Schools, businesses, markets and mosques were ordered to close, and police patrols stopped and inspected the few cars passing through checkpoints.The four patients are related and live in the al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza. On Tuesday, Hamas-run police roamed the empty streets to enforce the lockdown.Hundreds of people nevertheless took part in the funeral of four militants from the Islamic Jihad group who were killed in a mysterious blast late Monday in Gaza City.The mourners, few of whom wore masks, marched shoulder to shoulder through the city’s crowded Shajaiyeh neighborhood despite calls from the group to take precautions and limit attendance to relatives of the slain militants.All Gazans returning home through Israel or Egypt have been required to remain isolated at designated centers for 21 days. Authorities have detected 110 cases in the quarantine facilities since March, and 72 of them have recovered. A woman with underlying health problems died from the Covid-19 disease caused by the virus.Abdelnasser Soboh, director of the World Health Organization’s Gaza office, said cases of local transmission were expected. “This was not surprising to us,” he said.He added that authorities are following the correct procedures to track the source of the infection and people who were in contact with the patients.The health ministry said a woman from Gaza who was allowed to travel to Jerusalem for medical treatment had tested positive after arriving there. Health workers back in Gaza then tested her family members, revealing the four cases. The woman is still in Jerusalem.Hamas seized control of Gaza from rival Palestinian forces 13 years ago. In response, Egypt and Israel imposed a crippling blockade on the territory. Israel says the blockade is needed to keep Hamas from importing and manufacturing arms. Hamas and Israel have fought three wars and countless skirmishes.There have been no deaths or serious injuries from the recent exchanges of fire, and neither side is believed to be seeking war. But any fatalities could spark an escalation.The attacks were coordinated by Hamas to pressure Israel to ease the blockade. Instead, Israel has closed Gaza’s sole commercial crossing and its fishing zone. The territory’s only power plant was forced to shut down a week ago for lack of fuel, leaving most Gazans with just four hours of electricity per day.Gaza’s heath infrastructure has been hollowed out by years of conflict, and would be ill-equipped to cope with a major outbreak. Gaza’s health facilities only have around 100 ventilators, more than half of which are already being used.The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said it is “extremely concerned” by the closure of the power plant and its impact on Gaza residents.“We are calling on all concerned parties to maintain a supply of electricity that is sufficient to meet the basic needs of the civilian population,” said Matthias Schmale, director of UNRWA affairs in Gaza.Soboh of the WHO said that his organization managed to bring in 10 new ventilators for a special field hospital for coronavirus patients in Gaza, raising the number of these machines at that hospital to 50.“We can deal with hundreds of patients, but not thousands,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gaza-locks-down-after-detecting-local-transmission-of-coronavirus/story-DJE7cljqDDifGvhBZNuMYN.html
25-08-2020||World||China keen to establish BRICS innovation base focussing on 5G||China is considering establishing a BRICS innovation base to strengthen cooperation among the five-country bloc including India in sectors like 5G, AI and digital economy, industry and information technology minister Xiao Yaqing has said.Xiao said Beijing is actively considering setting up the base in China in order to strengthen practical cooperation among the members, which include Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS).Monday’s video meeting comes ahead of the likely summit of the BRICS foreign ministers’ early September.The coronavirus pandemic has badly impacted the economies of all five countries in the bloc with Brazil, India, Russia, and South Africa in the top five, after the US, in terms of infected people.Addressing a video meeting of the bloc’s industry ministers on Monday, Xiao urged members to boost cooperation in new technology areas, according to Chinese state media.According to the state media report, Xiao urged BRICS countries to strengthen their cooperation on “…digital transformation, especially in 5G, AI, the digital economy and others, to promote the digital transformation of enterprises and their innovation capabilities, and to promote sustainable economic and social development”.China’s interest in promoting 5G within the BRICS bloc could be part of its interest in pushing tech giant Huawei internationally – Huawei’s name has come up as a contender to build the network in Brazil and South Africa even as it is embroiled in controversies in other countries.Interestingly, a Financial Times report says that India is gradually phasing out Chinese vendors from its telecom networks including Huawei following the deadly Galwan Valley clash on June 15.Xiao added that China is vigorously promoting the resumption of work across the entire industry chain and is keen to see more development in new industries such as 5G, AI and the industrial Internet during the Covid-19 pandemic. “At present, growth in China’s industrial economy is gaining momentum, in turn supporting the steady recovery of China’s overall economy, and contributing to a new impetus and stability in the global industrial chain and supply chain,” said Xiao.The minister added that the pandemic has brought both challenges to the BRICS’ industrial anti-risk capabilities, but also opportunities for industry transformation and development.“BRICS countries should cooperate to promote economic recovery, strengthen communication and sharing their experiences in epidemic prevention and control, guarantee medical supplies, resume work and production, and promote economic development during Covid-19,” Xiao added.The BRICS multilateral bank, the New Development Bank (NDB) has loaned $4 billion to China, India, South Africa and Brazil to fight the pandemic under the emergency assistance programme.In May, the Shanghai-based bank gave a $1billion loan to India to help fight and contain the Covid-19 pandemic.The ‘emergency assistance program loan’ to India was aimed at supporting the Indian government to contain the spread of Covid-19 and reduce human, social and economic losses caused by the coronavirus outbreak, the bank said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-keen-to-establish-brics-innovation-base-focussing-on-5g/story-1m00RJzsE8yhNg6q3L7BsM.html

The vaccine has not been tested in phase 3 or larger clinical trials. There has been scepticism in some quarters about limited data related to the efficacy of the vaccine.“The Russian government has reached out to the Indian government seeking a collaboration for manufacturing their COVID-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, and conducting its phase 3 trial here,” a source in the government said.“The Department of Biotechnology (DBT) along with the Department of Health Research has been asked to lead and look into the matter. They (Russian government officials) have shared some information and data on Sputnik V, while more data related to the safety and efficacy of the vaccine is awaited,” the source said.When asked if the Russian government has placed any formal request for the manufacture of its Covid-19 vaccine in India, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said at a press conference, “As far as Sputnik V vaccine is concerned, both India and Russia are in communication. Some initial information has been shared while some detailed information is awaited.” According to sources, Russian Ambassador to India Nikolay Kudashev has approached the office of Principal Scientific Advisor K VijayRaghavan as well as secretaries of the departments of biotechnology and health research in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-seeks-collaboration-with-india-for-manufacturing-covid-19-vaccine-sputnik-v-reports/story-lm4wZoQgU3mp0IwhK70ddM.html
25-08-2020||World||Covid-19: Blood cancer patients most vulnerable to effects of viral infection||A new study published on Tuesday by researchers at the University of Oxford and Birmingham has found that compared to other cancers, patients with blood cancer are more vulnerable to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.The study, published in Lancet Oncology by the UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project (UKCCMP), found that blood cancer patients were particularly at risk with 57% higher odds of severe disease if they contract Covid-19. Those with breast cancer have the lowest risk overall. Cancer patients over the age of 80 have been found to have the highest frequency of fatality, a release by the University of Oxford said.As the virus spread globally in early 2020, cancer patients were identified as a sub-group who were potentially at an increased risk of infection and of potentially suffering more serious disease consequences. Since March, more than 60 cancer centres across the UK entered data into the UKCCMP database with information on adult cancer patients who contracted the virus.Using demographic data such as age, gender and tumour type, researchers were able to determine that patients with haematological cancers, particularly older patients and those with leukaemia, had a more severe Covid-19 trajectory compared to patients with solid organ tumours.Rachel Kerr of Oxford said: “Using these new data we are working fast to identify trends and correlations, which will enable us to create a tiered risk assessment tool so we can more precisely define the risk to a given cancer patient and move away from a blanket ‘vulnerable’ policy for all cancer patients, in the event of a second wave of Covid-19.”Gary Middleton of the University of Birmingham added: “Patients are turning to oncologists and wanting to know exactly what is their risk from Covid-19. This is particularly important as the number of cases in Europe and the UK is still labile”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-blood-cancer-patients-most-vulnerable-to-effects-of-viral-infection/story-N4dlgv5Wb742WINWj3ueAO.html
25-08-2020||World||Black Lives Matter: British Museum founder’s bust removed||The hitherto prominently displayed bust of British Museum’s founder, Hans Sloane, has been removed in the context of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) campaign and his links to slave trade before he died in 1753 aged 92.Sloane Square in central London is one of several public places named after the physician, who was known as an avid collector of books, manuscripts and specimens, including many linked to the East India Company ranging from medicine, natural history to religious tracts, among others.His collection of over 45,000 printed items formed the foundation of the British Museum, from which the British Library and the Natural History Museum were later born, but the BLM campaign has prompted a reconsideration of his place in the widely visited museum.Hartwig Fischer, the museum’s director, told the media that the likeness of the Anglo-Irish Sloane (1660-1753) has been placed in a secure cabinet alongside artefacts explaining his work in the context of the British empire.He said: “We have pushed him off the pedestal. We must not hide anything. Healing is knowledge. Dedication to truthfulness, when it comes to history is absolutely crucial, with the aim to rewrite our shared, complicated and, at times, very painful history.“The British Museum has done a lot of work – accelerated and enlarged its work on its own history, the history of empire, the history of colonialism, and also of slavery. These are subjects, which need to be addressed, and to be addressed properly. We need to understand our own history,” Fischer told the Daily Telegraph on Tuesday.Sloane’s marginalisation in the museum is part of recent attempts to re-visit Britain’s history of slave trade and colonialism, sparked by George Floyd’s death in the United States of America (USA) in May. There have since been demands to remove statues and re-name public spaces in the United Kingdom (UK).The statue of 17th century slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down in Bristol in June. However, the demand to remove colonialist Robert Clive’s statue in Shropshire was turned down by the local council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-british-museum-founder-s-bust-removed/story-S5uIoegvRdPjQ9pEVVt90L.html

Commercial and government buildings were set ablaze, along with vehicles in car dealership lots.Police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs to disperse the crowd, which grew to several hundred, according to protester Porche Bennett, 31, of Kenosha.Fires destroyed much of the Black business district, Bennett said, adding that the instigators she saw were white.“It’s people from out of town doing this. We’ve been shopping there since we were kids and they set it on fire,” Bennett said.Social media images showed both white and Black agitators. Black men swinging baseball bats broke traffic signals and street lamps. White and Black men with bats bashed in the headlights and windshields of a row of cars.One white man riding a skateboard doused a government truck with an accelerant and set it on fire. Heavily armed white civilians stood guard in front of one business to protect it from vandals.Kenosha, a city of 100,000 people, is nearly 12 percent Black and about 67 percent white, according to U.S. Census data.One large group of protesters skirmished in front of the courthouse with sheriff’s deputies firing tear gas and pepper balls into the crowd. Demonstrators hurled water bottles and firecrackers at the police.At least one man was injured, shown on social media bleeding from the head as civilians administered aid.The first night of clashes on Sunday prompted Governor Tony Evers to order in National Guard troops to help maintain order.Evers has condemned excessive use of police force and called for a special legislative session next week to consider police reforms, saying: “We must offer our empathy. We must see the trauma, fear and exhaustion of being Black in our state and our country.”Video of the shooting taken by an onlooker showed Blake walking toward the driver’s side of a gray SUV followed by two officers with their guns drawn at his back. Seven gunshots are heard as Blake, who appears unarmed, opens the car door, one officer tugging at his shirt.It was not known whether officers saw something inside the vehicle that prompted them to shoot.His three young sons were inside the car, family attorney Ben Crump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arsonists-set-fires-in-us-wisconsin-as-police-shoot-jacob-blake-a-black-man/story-PcIr1UrzMODLRd4oesXWQL.html
25-08-2020||World||Covid pandemic pace slows worldwide except for southeast Asia, eastern Mediterranean, says WHO||The Covid-19 pandemic is still expanding, but the rise in cases and deaths has slowed globally, except for southeast Asia and the eastern Mediterranean regions, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.In its latest epidemiological update, issued on Monday night, it said that the Americas remains the hardest-hit region, accounting for half of newly reported cases and 62% of the 39,240 deaths worldwide in the past week. More than 23.65 million people have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus globally and 811,895​ have died, according to a Reuters tally on Tuesday.“Over 1.7 million new Covid-19 cases and 39,000 new deaths were reported to WHO for the week ending 23 August, a 4% decrease in the number of cases and (a 12% decrease) in the number of deaths compared to the previous week,” the WHO said.Southeast Asia, the second most affected region, reported a jump accounting for 28% of new cases and 15% of deaths, it said. India continues to report the majority of cases, but the virus is also spreading rapidly in Nepal.In WHO’s eastern Mediterranean region, the number of reported cases rose by 4%, but the number of reported deaths has consistently dropped over the last six weeks, the WHO said. Lebanon, Tunisia and Jordan reported the highest increase in cases compared to the previous week.The number of cases and deaths reported across Africa decreased by 8% and 11% respectively in the past week, “primarily due to a decrease in cases reported in Algeria, Kenya, Ghana, Senegal and South Africa”, it said.“In the European region, the number of cases reported has consistently increased over the last three weeks,” it said. “However, only a slight decrease (1%) was reported in the most recent week, and the number of deaths have continued to decrease across the region.”In WHO’s western Pacific region, the number of new cases dropped by 5%, driven by less spread in Japan, Australia, Singapore, China and Vietnam. South Korea reported an 180% jump in cases, “mainly due to an increase in cases associated with religious gatherings”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-pandemic-pace-slows-worldwide-except-for-southeast-asia-eastern-mediterranean-says-who/story-3hvxaWiFb0XtKzgDcPhRHM.html
25-08-2020||World||Covid-19 epicentre Wuhan opens colleges for first time since January||Thousands of domestic university students are returning to Wuhan, China, where the Covid-19 pandemic originated, as campuses have been reopened there with strict social distancing norms in place around seven months after physical classes were suspended.Also read: Oxford coronavirus vaccine data could go to regulators this yearInternational students, including hundreds from India, are still not allowed to return to Wuhan, the capital of the central Chinese Hubei province, because of the grim pandemic situation outside China. On-campus classes are expected to begin in a week.Universities and schools were shut indefinitely in Wuhan after the city was locked down on January 23 to contain the Covid-19 spread. The disease first emerged at a seafood and meat market in this central Chinese city before spreading to the rest of China, and then the world, infecting millions and battering the global economy.Schools were reopened in a staggered manner as the outbreak slowed in China even as university campuses remained shut mainly because of the infection risks associated with student dormitories.Returning students will need to carry their updated health cards, showing them as negative for the virus.As of Monday, over 9,000 students had returned to the Wuhan University from different parts of China, official news agency Xinhua reported on Tuesday. Another 20,000 students were expected to return in batches.Students currently outside the Chinese mainland are still not allowed to return to their universities, Li Qin, deputy minister of the university’s student affairs department, told tabloid Global Times.Several hundred Indian students are enrolled at medical universities in Hubei. They will be unable to resume on-campus classes until the Chinese government allows international students to return.For Wuhan, it has been a gradual return to normalcy since the lockdown was lifted in early April. Mass testing of residents followed the lifting of strict curbs on movement.A video recently of a pool party at the Wuhan Maya Beach Water Park, showing half-submerged, tightly-packed partygoers without masks and with DJs blaring music went viral online.Chinese state media defended the gathering. “Wuhan, once badly hit by the coronavirus epidemic and then locked down for 76 days since late January, now has the epidemic under control, with no new local Covid-19 cases reported for months,” official English news channel CGTN reported.Mainland China reported 84,981 Covid-19 cases and 4,634 deaths as of Monday. Hubei has reported 68,139 cases, mostly in Wuhan, and 63,626 have been cured and discharged from hospitals. The disease has claimed 4,512 lives in the province, a majority of them in Wuhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-epicentre-wuhan-opens-colleges-for-first-time-since-january/story-wg2AR20p1arB0fRqybjNMN.html
25-08-2020||World||AstraZeneca starts trial of Covid-19 antibody treatment||British drugmaker AstraZeneca has begun testing an antibody-based cocktail for the prevention and treatment of Covid-19, adding to recent signs of progress on possible medical solutions to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The London-listed firm, already among the leading players in the global race to develop a successful vaccine, said the study would evaluate if AZD7442, a combination of two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), was safe and tolerable in up to 48 healthy participants between the ages of 18 and 55 years.If the UK-based early-stage trial, which has dosed its participants, shows AZD7442 is safe, AstraZeneca said it would proceed to test it as both a preventative treatment for Covid-19 and a medicine for patients who have it, in larger, mid-to-late-stage studies.AstraZeneca shares were up about 1% at 87 pounds ($114) in early trading.Development of mAbs to target the virus, an approach already being tested by Regeneron, ELi Lilly, Roche and Molecular Partners, has been endorsed by leading scientists.mAbs mimic natural antibodies generated in the body to fight off infection and can be synthesised in the laboratory to treat diseases in patients. Current uses include treatment of some types of cancers.U.S. infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci has called them “almost a sure bet” against Covid-19, and AstraZeneca in June received $23.7 million in funding from U.S. government agencies to advance development of antibody-based treatments for Covid-19. “This combination of antibodies, coupled to our proprietary half-life extension technology, has the potential to improve both the effectiveness and durability of use in addition to reducing the likelihood of viral resistance,” said Astra’s executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&D Mene Pangalos.Though vaccines are at the heart of the long-term fight against the pandemic, alternative treatments are also being advanced, and the United States on Sunday authorized use of recovered COVID-19 patients’ plasma to treat those who are ill.The Financial Times reported at the weekend that President Donald Trump’s administration was considering a fast-tracked approval of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine before November’s elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-starts-trial-of-covid-19-antibody-treatment/story-lAXBP3dV8If60mXusel6DM.html
25-08-2020||World||Germany’s new coronavirus infections close to four-month high||Germany’s new coronavirus cases increased at a pace close to Saturday’s four-month high, while the infection rate fell below a key benchmark of 1.0.There were 1,628 new infections in the 24 hours through Tuesday morning, taking the total to 236,122. The daily gain compared with 633 on Monday and 1,737 on Saturday, which was the most since late April. There was one fatality, lifting the overall number of deaths to 9,276.Click here for full Covid -19 coverageGerman cases have ticked up in recent weeks, mirroring a trend across Europe, with health officials blaming the increase on social gatherings and travelers returning from abroad.Bavarian Premier Markus Soeder warned Tuesday that Germany risks a return to the peak levels of daily new cases close to 7,000 seen at the end of March and beginning of April. He ruled out easing restrictions on movement and social gatherings.“The numbers are worrying and it’s clear that the situation isn’t going to get easier,” Soeder said in a video message posted on Twitter. “Right now it’s not about loosening the reins but tightening them. There is no reason to panic but there is to be greatly concerned.”Chancellor Angela Merkel will hold talks with Soeder and his regional counterparts on Thursday to discuss Germany’s strategy to contain the virus.On Monday, federal and regional health officials said they plan to scrap a requirement for people returning to Germany from high-risk areas to be tested for the coronavirus as capacity is stretched.Travelers will still be subject to a two-week quarantine, which can be ended after five days if a test result shows they don’t have the virus. The changes will likely take effect in mid-September or early October.Germany’s reproduction factor -- the average number of people infected by one person with the virus -- fell to 0.98 on Monday from 1.08 the day before, according to the latest estimate from the Robert Koch Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-s-new-coronavirus-infections-close-to-four-month-high/story-23oSI4UFnkjpoK07vufpzH.html
25-08-2020||World||China banks hire tens of thousands in latest rescue mission||China’s mega banks are ramping up their recruitment of fresh graduates as a record number enter the labor market, joining other state-owned firms in boosting employment even as lenders deal with plunging earnings and ballooning bad debt.The four biggest state banks, led by Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., this month kicked off their autumn campus hiring, instead of in November as in previous years. ICBC plans to hire 18,000 graduates this year while China Construction Bank Corp. is adding 16,000, up from 13,000 last year. Bank of China Co. will increase its hiring by 15% to more than 10,000, according to their advertisements. Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. already hired 4,500 people during the spring round.“This is in direct response to the government’s call to protect jobs,” said Tang Jianwei, a Shanghai-based analyst at Bank of Communications Co.’s research institute. “Even though the big banks are facing pressure on their own earnings, they still need people to develop the business. Also it’s important for them to assume social responsibility.”China’s largest banks have already been leaned on by Beijing to prop up the economy. They’ve been told to pump cash out to small and medium-sized businesses and forgo profits by lowering interest rates and providing relief on trillions of yuan of troubled loans. Most recently, the government doubled down on pressure to get the major state-owned financial groups to cut salaries.Together, the four biggest banks employ 1.6 million people and Construction Bank’s hiring plans alone approach the combined staff additions made by the largest US and European banks in this year’s first half. Chinese lenders are mostly looking to hire for customer service, wealth management, and information technology, according to job ads on their websites.Representatives for ICBC, AgBank, Construction Bank and Bank of China declined to comment.Yet the tens of thousands of new jobs are but a drop in the bucket. The record 8.7 million of fresh graduates face the bleakest job prospects in decades as the global pandemic has pummeled domestic demand and exports. While inching down recently, surveyed urban unemployment hit a record at the height of China’s virus outbreak in February. Unemployment for those of prime graduate age, 20 to 24, hovered at about 20% in July, according to the country’s statistics bureau.A report by Zhaopin.com, one of China’s biggest recruiting websites, showed that more than a quarter of recent graduates were still looking for a job as of June after hunting for one year, a period during which most would have typically landed jobs in the past.The government has repeatedly pledged support for jobs and rolled out measures such as increasing recruitment of post-grads, strengthening support for more flexible forms of work for graduates and promoting entrepreneurship among young people. The country’s other state-owned firms have vowed to provide at least a million jobs for the most vulnerable groups, including the newly graduated.That has done little to help Crystal Wu, who graduated in July from one of the nation’s top universities with a degree in journalism. In her search, she found herself competing against people who already had work experience and at places receiving thousands of resumes rather than the normal few hundred. At the same time, with the travel ban, many students have dropped plans for study overseas, further tightening the jobs market.“I knew it would be a tough market but this is even worse than I expected,” she said. Wu has opted for doing an internship at a non-profit in Beijing, but has also spent about 20 yuan joining a WeChat group run by a recruitment agency sharing tips on how to get a job at a bank. She prefers a policy lender such Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank or China Development Bank.Finance is a coveted job. The average annual salary for non-private financial industry employees stood at about 131,000 yuan ($19,000), the third highest among 19 sectors tracked by the statistics bureau and more than 40% higher than the overall level.Combined earnings at China’s more than 1,000 commercial banks slumped the most in at least a decade in the second quarter as bad loans hit a record 2.7 trillion yuan. The banking regulator said over the weekend that Covid-19 is a centennial catastrophe and that financial industry will need to step up further to get the economy fully back on track.Globally, the biggest US and European banks added 19,000 people to their payrolls in the first half of the year as demand for loans and other services surged during the pandemic and planned staff cuts were largely put on hold. Eight of the top 15 firms increased headcount this year through June, while only four reduced it with HSBC Holdings Plc having the biggest reduction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-banks-hire-tens-of-thousands-in-latest-rescue-mission/story-G9rIe080Urm7d6DtjG3oeP.html
25-08-2020||World||Hong Kong to relax social distancing rules as Covid-19 cases drop||Hong Kong will relax social distancing rules from Friday, allowing evening dining at restaurants and the removal of masks during outdoor exercise, as Covid-19 cases in the city dwindle.Hong Kong will also reopen movie theaters, beauty parlors and some outdoor sports venues, officials said at a briefing on Tuesday. Current social distancing measures -- the strictest in the financial hub to date -- will be extended to Aug. 27.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe exemption on masks during exercise will last for seven days, Chan said, adding that many people had stopped exercising due to the requirement.Despite the easing, restaurant seating will remain limited to two people per table. No food or drinks will be allowed in cinemas, which will provide socially distanced seating for moviegoers. Masks will be required at beauty parlors, with certain exceptions.“Under this new normal, it is hard to expect there will be no confirmed cases in the long term,” Food and Health Secretary Sophia Chan said. “We have to accept the possibility of having some specific cases and clusters.”“The government cannot wait until there are no cases in the community to relax social distancing rules,” she said.‘Reassuring’ dropChief Executive Carrie Lam said at a morning briefing that there had been a “reassuring” downward trend in cases. But she added that it was still hard to avoid some small community outbreaks, and that the government would continue monitoring and regularly test workers at the city’s port.Hong Kong reported just seven new locally transmitted infections on Monday.Hong Kong is among regional spots battling a fresh wave of cases after seeing initial success containing the virus, including Vietnam, South Korea and Australia. The government has urged citizens to take part in a voluntary free two-week drive to test the entire population for Covid-19 starting Sept. 1, aided by Chinese experts and labs.Pressure Grows on Hong Kong to Re-Open Economy as Cases DropLam repeated that the testing campaign was fully supported by Beijing and urged participation.“I would appeal to the public to actively participate in the universal testing scheme in order to find silent carriers as soon as possible,” she said. “The reason why Hong Kong at this moment has a capacity to undertake such a large scale universal community testing is because of the assistance rendered by the central people’s government.”More pressureAs Hong Kong’s third wave of virus cases tails off, her government has been under immense pressure from restaurants and other small businesses to relax distancing measures. Smaller businesses have been especially hard hit, with protests last year knocking Hong Kong into a recession even before the pandemic hit.Hong Kong’s Legislative Council will hold a special meeting to discuss the government’s coronavirus efforts on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-to-relax-social-distancing-rules-as-covid-19-cases-drop/story-WBFCAiiyEDK8ucFQ4YZ21K.html
25-08-2020||World||Starbucks cafe’s Covid outbreak spared employees who wore masks||After a woman with the coronavirus visited a Starbucks cafe north of Seoul this month, more than two dozen patrons tested positive days later. But the four face mask-wearing employees escaped infection.The August 8 outbreak in the South Korean city of Paju is another example of how rapidly the SARS-CoV-2 virus can spread in confined, indoor spaces -- as well as ways to minimize transmission. With health authorities around the world still debating the evidence around face masks, the 27-person cluster linked to the air-conditioned coffee outlet adds more support for their mandatory use to help limit the spread of the Covid-19-causing virus.“This speaks volumes about the role masks can play,” said Ma Sang Hyuk, a pediatric infectious diseases physician at Changwon Fatima Hospital in South Korea. “Masks may not provide 100% protection, but there’s nothing out there that’s as effective.”Guidance on face masks is being issued from Australia to Venezuela to help stem the pandemic, which has infected more than 23 million people and killed at least 810,000 worldwide. Face coverings will become mandatory in New Zealand for residents using public transport and inside ride-sharing vehicles, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Monday.

Misinformation over their effectiveness and safety has also spread.Officials assume that most patrons didn’t consistently wear masks as they were drinking and eating while in the Starbucks Corp. outlet in South Korea, according to Gang Young-do, a spokesperson for the Paju government. A ceiling-mounted air-conditioning was helping to cool the second-floor outlet, he said.“The virus may spread where people can’t wear masks while eating or drinking tea, as witnessed at the Starbucks in Paju,” Jung Eun-kyeong, head of the Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, told reporters in Seoul on Sunday.The Starbucks case is one of “the most important opportunities to study risk factors among a more or less controlled cohort of people,” said Arnold Bosman, director at Transmissible BV, a Netherlands-based developer of training materials for outbreak control. “This Starbucks event will be a very valuable training exercise for future generations of epidemiologists.”The Starbucks infections later led to about three dozen more cases outside the coffee shop as of August 24. They add to the more than 3,000 this month that have prompted the South Korean government to consider imposing the highest level of physical distancing rules -- a blow to an economy that’s managed to avert a steep recession so far.Korea Virus Wave Disrupts Recovery as Stronger Measures EyedThe Seoul metropolitan area has emerged as a virus hot spot, and local government authorities made it mandatory this week for all citizens to wear masks both indoors and outdoors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/starbucks-cafe-s-covid-outbreak-spared-employees-who-wore-masks/story-FIFypM3OsVLmc2zEf8suGN.html
25-08-2020||World||Nikki Haley invokes her Indian roots, says America is not racist||Former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Monday (local time) invoked her Indian roots, saying she was the proud daughter of Indian immigrants and asserted that America is not a racist country.As she took the stage on the first night of the Republican National Convention, Haley said although her parents faced discrimination and hardship, they never gave in to “grievance and hate”, CNN reported.“This is personal for me. I am the proud daughter of Indian immigrants. They came to America and settled in a small southern town. My father wore a turban. My mother wore a saree. I was a brown girl in a black and white world,” said the Republican politician, who is the only Indian-American listed to be speaking at the convention.“We faced discrimination and hardship. But my parents never gave in to grievance and hate. My mom built a successful business. My dad taught 30 years at a historically black college. And the people of South Carolina chose me as their first minority and first female governor,” Haley added.The former UN envoy said that America is a story that is a work in progress. “Now is the time to build on that progress, and make America even freer, fairer and better for everyone,” she was quoted as saying by CNN.“In much of the Democratic Party, it is now fashionable to say that America is racist. That is a lie. America is not a racist country.” she said.Haley remarked, “The American people know we can do better. And of course, we know that every single black life is valuable.”“The black cops who have been shot in the line of duty -- they matter. The black small business owners who have watched their life’s work go up in flames -- they matter. The black kids who have been gunned down on the playground -- their lives matter too. Their lives are being ruined and stolen by the violence on our streets,” she said.Haley’s remarks assume significance as protests across the US broke out earlier this year, after George Floyd, an African-American man, died when an officer named Derek Chauvin used his knee to pin Floyd to the ground. Chauvin had kneeled on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes.“It does not have to be like this. It was not like this in South Carolina five years ago. Our state came face-to-face with evil. A white supremacist walked into Mother Emanuel Church during Bible Study. Twelve African Americans pulled up a chair and prayed with him for an hour. Then he began to shoot,” Haley said.She added that everyone irrespective of their colour and from different political parties came together to remove “a divisive symbol peacefully and respectfully”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nikki-haley-invokes-her-indian-roots-says-america-is-not-racist/story-jrNFZryck8YPaOldxnMwhK.html
25-08-2020||World||Takeaways from first night of the Republican National Convention||The Republican Party kicked off its convention to re-elect US President Donald Trump with an unsubstantiated daytime warning from Trump himself that he may face a “rigged election,” full-throated praise for Trump during the evening events, and warnings that America would crumble without his leadership. Unsubstantiated claims about voter fraudIn an unscheduled speech in Charlotte, North Carolina, Trump repeated his allegation on Monday that voting by mail, a long-standing feature of American elections that is expected to be far more common during the coronavirus pandemic, could lead to an increase in fraud. Independent election security experts say voter fraud is quite rare in the United States.Warnings of a disappearing America Conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who led off the evening speeches, called the presidential election nothing less than a decision between “preserving America as we know it and eliminating everything that we love.”The goal, as Trump advisers have said, is not necessarily persuading swing voters to like the president but to contend that voting for Democratic nominee Joe Biden is the bigger risk.Heightened praise for Trump Any presidential party convention is a coronation of the party’s nominee. Last week’s Democratic National Convention featured a full spectrum of people speaking about Biden’s character, from career politicians to an elevator operator. Some speakers’ praise for Trump during the first day of the Republican convention went further. “He started a movement to reclaim our government from the rotten cartel of insiders that have been destroying our country,” Kirk said. “We may not realize it at the time. But Trump is the bodyguard of Western civilization.”A push for Black voters Kim Klacik, an African-American congressional candidate from Baltimore, is a long shot to win her race, but she scored a prime speaking slot on the Republican convention’s first night. Klacik was part of an effort on the first night of the convention to showcase Black supporters of Trump following a Democratic convention that highlighted that party’s diversity. Trump received just 8 percent of the African-American vote in 2016. His opponent’s running mate, Kamala Harris, seeks to become the first Black woman vice president. Trump has regularly criticized the Black Lives Matter movement. “The Democratic Party does not want Black people to leave their mental plantation,” Georgia state Representative Vernon Jones said. “We’ve been forced to be there for decades and generations. But I have news for Joe Biden. We are free. We are free people with free minds.” Football legend Herschel Walker declared Trump his “friend” and not a “racist.” Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the chamber’s only Black Republican, is scheduled to speak in the closing slot for the evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/takeaways-from-first-night-of-the-republican-national-convention/story-EuaJbZ3o6AYckmS7uFShAJ.html

But Trump, who has frequently expressed anger at China over the coronavirus pandemic, said last week he had postponed talks with China because “I don’t want to deal with them now.”“Both sides see progress and are committed to taking the steps necessary to ensure the success of the agreement,” USTR said.China’s commerce ministry, in a separate statement, confirmed that the two countries had a ‘constructive dialog’ and agreed to continue pushing forward the implementation of the Phase 1 trade deal. The USTR statement said the two sides “addressed steps that China has taken to effectuate structural changes called for by the agreement that will ensure greater protection for intellectual property rights, remove impediments to American companies in the areas of financial services and agriculture, and eliminate forced technology transfer.”“The parties also discussed the significant increases in purchases of US products by China as well as future actions needed to implement the agreement,” it said.Chinese purchases of US goods are running well behind the pace needed to meet a first year increase of $77 billion specified in the deal, according to official data. But China has increased the pace of farm product purchases in recent weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-chinese-officials-optimistic-on-phase-1-trade-deal-after-phone-call/story-6nZZrrKhChr2O6l0IdUo1M.html
25-08-2020||World||‘Five big lies of Pakistan exposed’, says Indian Mission at UN||India on Monday (local time) hit out at Pakistan over lies peddled by its mission at UN. In a strong statement, the Indian Mission said that Pakistan has put out a false statement claiming that their envoy Munir Akram spoke at the United Nations Security Council while the session was not open to non-members.“We have seen a statement put out by the Pakistan Mission to the UN, claiming that these remarks were made by the Permanent Representative of Pakistan at the UN Security Council. We fail to comprehend where exactly did the Permanent Representative of Pakistan make his statement since the Security Council Session today was not open to non-members of the Security Council”, Indian mission at UN said in a statement.The statement further says that the detailed statement exposed the ‘five big lies’ being peddled and pushed by Pakistan.Dismissing assertions that Pakistan has been a target of cross-border terrorism for decades, the Indian Mission in its statement said: “A lie repeated a hundred times will not become truth. The biggest sponsor of cross-border terrorism against India now tries to masquerade itself as a victim of terrorism by India!”“Pakistan is home to the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the United Nations. Many of the sanctioned terrorists and entities continue to operate with impunity inside Pakistan. Prime Minister of Pakistan admitted at the UN General Assembly in 2019, the presence of 40,000-50,000 terrorists inside Pakistan,” it added.It further rejected the claim that Pakistan has decimated Al Qaeda from the region.“The claim that Pakistan has decimated Al Qaeda from the region. Perhaps, the Permanent Representative of Pakistan is not aware that Osama Bin Laden was hiding in their own country in plain sight, and it is the US forces which got him inside Pakistan. Nor have they heard their Prime Minister refer to Osama Bin Laden as a “martyr”,” the statement read.Indian Mission at UN said Pakistan makes the “laughable claim that India has hired terrorist as mercenaries to hit them.”“Coming from a country which is a known sponsor of cross-border terrorism, which has made the world suffer due to its actions, this claim is nothing short of being preposterous!” it said.The statement also rejected claims of Indians being in 1267 sanctions list. “The 1267 Sanctions list is public, and the world can see none of these individuals are in it. The 1267 Committee works on the basis of evidence, and not random accusations thrown in to divert their time and attention,” read the statement.Further, it slammed Pakistan for making “ridiculous assertions” about internal affairs of India.“Pakistan makes ridiculous assertions about internal affairs of India. This is a country whose minority population has dropped drastically from 1947 to what it is today which is just about 3 per cent, which is nothing short of systemic cleansing,” it said.“This is in addition to false allegations about India’s sovereign actions in the Union Territory of J&K, which are for the welfare of the people. The world has seen through their lies yet again,” the statement added.This comes after Pakistan’s Permanent Representative Munir Akram put out a random statement today masquerading it as if the statement was made by him to the United Nations Security Council.But for their purpose, the statement was picked up by Pakistani media and was portraying it as Munir Akram’s statement at the Security Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-big-lies-of-pakistan-exposed-says-indian-mission-at-un/story-cMnt2cWIjekcAhGierbz2L.html
25-08-2020||World||In ‘megafire era,’ California battles record wildfires, pristine redwoods burn||More dry-lightning storms hit California on Monday after sparking 625 fires last week as authorities warned the state was trapped in a “megafire era” triggered by climate change. The worst of the wildfires, including the second and third largest in California history, burned in the San Francisco Bay Area with roughly 240,000 people under evacuation orders or warnings across the state.Much of Northern California, including the Sierra Nevada Mountains and coast, was under a “red flag” alert for dry lightning and high winds, but the Bay Area got a reprieve as storms skipped the region of around 8 million, the National Weather Service reported. Close to 300 lightning strikes sparked 10 blazes overnight and more “sleeper fires” were likely burning undiscovered in areas shrouded by dense smoke, Governor Gavin Newsom said.Also read: In just a week, wildfires burn 1 million acres in CaliforniaOne huge blaze blackened ancient coastal redwood forests south of San Francisco that have never seen fire due to usually high relative humidity levels, Newsom said. “We are in a different climate and we are dealing with different climate conditions that are precipitating fires the likes of which we have not seen in modern recorded history,” Newsom told a news briefing.The wildfires, ignited by over 13,000 lightning strikes from dry thunderstorms across Northern and Central California since Aug. 15, have killed at least seven people and destroyed over 1,200 homes and other structures. “We are essentially living in a megafire era,” said Cal Fire Santa Clara Unit Chief Jake Hess after California suffered four of the five largest wildfires in its history during the last three years. Evacuees returned to homes and vineyards torched by the LNU Lightning Complex wildfire, the second largest in state history, raging across Napa, Sonoma, Lake, Yolo and Solano counties.“Nothing’s left, but we’re safe,” said a man, who did not give his name in an online video showing everything but his patio furniture destroyed at his house near Vacaville. Smoke from fires that have burned over 1.2 million acres (485,620 hectares), an area more than three times larger than Los Angeles, created unhealthy conditions for much of Northern California and drifted as far as Kansas.Firefighters gained 22% containment of the LNU fire, but to the south, the SCU Lightning Complex fire was nearly as large and only 10% contained. Firefighters threw most of their resources at its west flank burning less than 10 miles from downtown San Jose. “This fire is by far a long ways away from being done,” said Cal Fire incident commander Jeff Ike of the blaze affecting seven counties.With lower temperatures, clouds gathered over coastal forest east of San Jose, helping firefighters achieve 13% containment on the CZU Lightning Complex fire. Some Santa Clara county residents saw the sun after 10 days of dense smoke.“Omg!!! The sun!!! The sun!!! The sun!!! Clouds and our shadows too. Oh how we’ve missed you in California,” tweeted Shana Anderson-Nute, a marketing agent from Sunnyvale.Over 14,000 firefighters were on the wildfires, with 91 fire crews traveling from seven states and National Guard troops arriving from four states, Newsom said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-megafire-era-california-battles-record-wildfires-pristine-redwoods-burn/story-Mu8zRSJ6VXyM0gQyo9O2EN.html

The witnesses asked not to be named for fear of repercussions.The fighting in Bugarama district in Rumonge province began on Sunday and continued into Monday and people were hiding in the bush, a resident who escaped the attack told Reuters.“The gunmen kidnapped everyone they met and killed them before engaging in fighting with the army on Sunday morning,” the man said. He asked for anonymity to avoid reprisals.A senior government official said the attack, which occurred as the country was holding local elections, was not unexpected and potentially linked to the imminent repatriation of refugees from Rwanda.“The government anticipated that armed groups opposed to the government will attempt to carry out attacks ahead of the first repatriation of refugees from Rwanda,” the official said.Rwanda hosts thousands of refugees from neighbouring Burundi who fled violence in 2015.A message posted on Twitter claiming to be from Red Tabara, a Burundian rebel group that says it is based in Congo’s South Kivu region, claimed responsibility for the attack and said it had “neutralized” nine policemen and about 20 militants. The veracity of the account or the message could not be verified.The statement on Twitter said presidential elections in May, won by the ruling party’s candidate Evariste Ndayishimiye, were “a farce” and called for a new vote.The statement also called for the disarmament of several militia groups such as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a group founded by Hutu officials who fled Rwanda after orchestrating the 1994 genocide, which it claims has infiltrated security forces in Burundi.The army did not respond to requests for comment on the fighting.Burundi has an ethnic Hutu majority and Tutsi minority, the same split as in Rwanda.It has been plagued by decades of ethnic and political violence, including a bloody civil war which lasted 12 years in which 300,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed.

25-08-2020||World||Virus closures send Atlantic City casinos to $112M Q2 loss||The coronavirus outbreak sent Atlantic City’s casinos plunging to a $112 million second quarter gross operating loss as the gambling houses remained closed for the entire three-month period, according to figures released Monday by state gambling regulators.That compares with an operating profit of nearly $160 million in the second quarter of last year.Only one of the nine casinos — the Golden Nugget — reported an operating profit for the quarter, and that was helped by the market-leading internet gambling operation. The casino made $3.1 million, down nearly 69% from a year earlier when it made over $10 million.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy ordered the casinos closed on March 16, and did not allow them to begin reopening until July 2. That more than covers the entire second quarter, the months of April, May and June.The casinos offered online gambling and sports betting during the quarter, which provided them some revenue during the period their physical buildings were shuttered. The nine casinos collectively reported $121.4 million in net revenue, down nearly 85% from the second quarter of 2019.The individual casinos, as well as gambling regulators, dismissed the numbers as not comparable to last year, when the industry was in full swing. Rather, they concentrated on efforts to convince customers the reopened casinos are clean and safe.“During this period, the casinos undertook an amazing effort and expense to prepare a safe environment for the return of employees and guests,” said James Plousis, chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. “That critical investment enabled the casinos to begin welcoming back visitors with appropriate limits in July, and started Atlantic City on the road to recovery.”“This closure was a setback to Ocean’s momentum gained through February 2020,” said Terry Glebocki, CEO of the Ocean Casino Resort. “We want to thank our employees who worked tirelessly to prepare us for reopening and are happy to have two-thirds of our workforce back in the building.”Ocean had an $11.8 million loss, compared to a $1.2 million loss in the second quarter of last year.The Borgata had the biggest loss at more than $40 million for the quarter, compared to a $55 million profit in the second quarter of last year.Hard Rock had a loss of $18.2 million, compared to a profit of $11.2 million a year ago; Harrah’s had a $15.1 million loss, compared to a $23 million profit a year ago; Resorts had a $12.6 million loss, compared to a $5.3 million profit a year ago; and Tropicana had an $11.8 million loss, compared to a $22.6 million profit last year.Caesars had a $9.9 million loss, compared to a profit of $16.3 million a year ago, and Bally’s had a $8.7 million loss, compared to a $9.3 million profit a year ago.The shutdown of the physical casinos provided an opportunity for online gambling operations, including the state’s two internet-only entities. Caesars Interactive NJ earned $7.7 million in the second quarter, up more than 54% from a year earlier, and Resorts Digital posted a profit of $5.7 million, up more than 194% from a year earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virus-closures-send-atlantic-city-casinos-to-112m-q2-loss/story-HfSxuFfyPERFKvGjOFqbyI.html

In 2016, around 40 detainees broke out from a high-security prison in Toliary in southern Madagascar.The police and army were called in on Sunday after almost 100 prisoners turned against guards with rocks and a stolen gun.The ministry said the weapon had been recovered and has vowed to boost security at penitentiaries across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/11-escapees-back-in-jail-after-madagascar-prison-break/story-jFqJPjyTNaQCXw9EWCMKrL.html

Pakistan had proposed the upgrade for submarines in its inventory and the Yuan class submarines being manufactured under joint China-Pakistan project in China.The AIP system would have enhanced the combat capabilities of its submarines by allowing the diesel engines to run without atmospheric air for a week or more.Conventional submarines have to surface almost every second day to run their air-breathing diesel engines, running the risk of detection.An Indian official said Germany’s refusal to help Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government with this technology would “adversely impact its lethality and vulnerability”.India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation is indigenously developing the system for the navy’s submarines. Last year, the effort crossed several milestones when it successfully tested a land-based prototype that New Delhi had then declared would have a “force multiplier effect on lethality of a diesel electric submarine”.Pakistan watchers in Delhi said the primary reason for Germany to take a hard stance on Pakistan’s request was being attributed to its role in promoting terror, particularly Pakistan’s failure to cooperate in identifying the perpetrators of the truck bomb attack on the Germany Embassy in Kabul in May 2017.Nearly 150 people were killed in the bombing that devastated a central area of Kabul near the embassy. The bombing, counted among the deadliest terror strikes in recent years, was linked to the Haqqani Network that is known in counter-terror circuits to be supported and directed by Pakistan deep state.The Afghan National Directorate of Security had then gone on record to blame the Haqqani network based in neighbouring Pakistan for the terror strike and accused Pakistan’s spy agency ISI of helping in planning the attack. German officials have noted that Islamabad hadn’t pursued the investigations at its end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-dashes-imran-khan-hopes-to-make-pak-subs-more-lethal-says-won-t-help/story-YaFM0q6WyBvChqmXoYOZNN.html

25-08-2020||World||FDA chief apologizes for overstating plasma effect on virus||Responding to an outcry from medical experts, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Tuesday apologized for overstating the life-saving benefits of treating Covid-19 patients with convalescent plasma.Scientists and medical experts have been pushing back against the claims about the treatment since President Donald Trump’s announcement on Sunday that the FDA had decided to issue emergency authorization for convalescent plasma, taken from patients who have recovered from the coronavirus and rich in disease-fighting antibodies.Trump hailed the decision as a historic breakthrough even though the treatment’s value has not been established. The announcement on the eve of Trump’s Republican National Convention raised suspicions that it was politically motivated to offset critics of the president’s handling of the pandemic.Hahn had echoed Trump in saying that 35 more people out of 100 would survive the coronavirus if they were treated with the plasma. That claim vastly overstated preliminary findings of Mayo Clinic observations.Hahn’s mea culpa comes at a critical moment for the FDA which, under intense pressure from the White House, is responsible for deciding whether upcoming vaccines are safe and effective in preventing Covid-19.The 35% figure drew condemnation from other scientists and some former FDA officials, who called on Hahn to correct the record.“I have been criticized for remarks I made Sunday night about the benefits of convalescent plasma. The criticism is entirely justified. What I should have said better is that the data show a relative risk reduction not an absolute risk reduction,” Hahn tweeted.The FDA made the decision based on data the Mayo Clinic collected from hospitals around the country that were using plasma on patients in wildly varying ways -- and there was no comparison group of untreated patients, meaning no conclusions can be drawn about overall survival. People who received plasma with the highest levels of antibodies fared better than those given plasma with fewer antibodies, and those treated sooner after diagnosis fared better than those treated later.Hahn and other Trump administration officials presented the difference as an absolute survival benefit, rather than a relative difference between two treatment groups. Former FDA officials said the misstatement was inexcusable, particularly for a cancer specialist like Hahn.“It’s extraordinary to me that a person involved in clinical trials could make that mistake,” said Dr. Peter Lurie, a former FDA official under the Obama administration who now leads the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest. “It’s mind-boggling.”The 35% benefit was repeated by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar at Sunday’s briefing and promoted on Twitter by the FDA’s communication staff. The number did not appear in FDA’s official letter justifying the emergency authorization.Hahn has been working to bolster confidence in the agency’s scientific process, stating in interviews and articles that the FDA will only approve a vaccine that meets preset standards for safety and efficacy.Lawrence Gostin of Georgetown University said Hahn’s performance Sunday undermined those efforts.“I think the integrity of the FDA took a hit, if I were Stephen Hahn I would not have appeared at such a political show,” said Gostin, a public health attorney.Hahn pushed back Tuesday morning against suggestions that the plasma announcement was timed to boost Trump ahead of the Republican convention.“The professionals and the scientists at FDA independently made this decision, and I completely support them,” Hahn said, appearing on “CBS This Morning.”Trump has recently accused some FDA staff, without evidence, of deliberately holding up new treatments “for political reasons.” And Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, said over the weekend that FDA scientists “need to feel the heat.”The administration has sunk vast resources into the race for a vaccine, and Trump aides have been hoping that swift progress could help the president ahead of November’s election.At Sunday’s briefing Hahn did not correct Trump’s description of the regulatory move as a “breakthrough.” He also did not contradict Trump’s unsupported claim of a “deep state” effort at the agency working to slow down approvals.Former FDA officials said the political pressure and attacks against the FDA carry enormous risk of undermining trust in the agency just when it’s needed most. A vaccine will only be effective against the virus if it is widely taken by the U.S. population.“I think the constant pressure, the name-calling, the perception that decisions are made under pressure is damaging,” said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, who previously served as FDA’s chief scientist. “We need the American people to have full confidence that medicines and vaccines are safe.”Convalescent plasma is a century-old approach to treating the flu, measles and other viruses. But the evidence so far has not been conclusive about whether it works, when to administer it and what dose is needed.The FDA emergency authorization is expected to increase its availability to additional hospitals. But more than 70,000 Americans have already received the therapy under FDA’s “expanded access” program. That program tracks patients’ response, but cannot prove whether the plasma played a role in their recovery.Some scientists worry the broadened FDA access to the treatment will make it harder to complete studies of whether the treatment actually works. Those studies require randomizing patients to either receive plasma or a dummy infusion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fda-chief-apologizes-for-overstating-plasma-effect-on-virus/story-dI1TG38p5u78SVdeqGfcZK.html

However, Xi stressed that this is not about “isolated domestic circulation,” but rather an open structure that will involve greater connection with the global system.China should actively cooperate with “all nations, regions and enterprises who are willing to work with us, including U.S. states, local areas and companies,” the president said.Separately, Sing Tao Daily reported Monday that Xi may visit the innovation hub of Shenzhen in September to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the special economic zone bordering Hong Kong.If it happens, the visit would be closely watched for any indication on China’s stance on economic opening up and also relations with the U.S., which have continued to worsen due to the coronavirus and other issues including technology and Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-stresses-china-needs-independent-innovation-as-world-changes/story-1CWST3oxvUeclvjlOTbmpJ.html
25-08-2020||India||India, Vietnam talk on China’s destabilising actions||New Delhi China’s destabilising actions in the region figured at a meeting on Tuesday of the India-Vietnam joint commission on trade, economic, scientific and technological cooperation, during which the two countries agreed to work more closely together in the Indo-Pacific. During the virtual meeting, co-chaired by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Vietnamese counterpart Pham Binh Minh, the two sides agreed to add new momentum to their economic and defence engagements and to explore closer cooperation in emerging areas such as civil nuclear energy, space, marine sciences and new technologies. China’s actions in the South China Sea and along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) figured in the discussions, with both sides briefing each other on the latest developments, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The Vietnamese side “underlined the importance of peace and security in the South China Sea”, one of the people cited above said. India and Vietnam agreed to enhance bilateral cooperation in line with New Delhi’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI) and Asean’s outlook on Indo-Pacific to “achieve shared security, prosperity and growth for all in the region”, the external affairs ministry said in a statement. “India invited Vietnam to collaborate on one of the seven pillars of the IPOI,” it added. IPOI was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the East Asia Summit in November 2019 and its pillars include enhancing maritime security, promoting free, fair and mutually beneficial trade and maritime transport and enhancing science and technology cooperation. In recent years, Vietnam has often turned to India for support over China’s increasing activities within its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea. India is one of only three countries with which Vietnam has a comprehensive strategic partnership and state-owned ONGC Videsh is engaged in energy production in Vietnamese waters that have witnessed intrusions by Chinese vessels over the past year. On Friday, Vietnamese envoy Pham Sanh Chau met foreign secretary Harsh Shringla to brief him on the escalating tensions in the South China Sea after China ramped up its military presence in the region. At Tuesday’s meeting, the two sides also reviewed recent developments in their comprehensive strategic partnership and discussed the future trajectory of their engagement. The statement said Jaishankar and Minh “exchanged views on regional and international issues of mutual interest, especially in the context of the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic”. Jaishankar referred to the prime minister’s vision of “Atmanirbhar Bharat” for enhancing resilience through self-reliance and human-centric globalisation and invited Vietnam to take advantage of the country’s new economic capacities and demands. He also reaffirmed India’s development and capacity-building aid to Vietnam through initiatives such as quick impact projects (QIPs), PhD fellowships, water resource management projects in the Mekong Delta, digital connectivity and heritage conservation. India has approved 12 QIPs in Vietnam, including seven water resource management schemes in the Mekong Delta and five for building educational infrastructure. MoU for cooperation between the Sushma Swaraj Institute of Foreign Service and the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam and between the National Maritime Foundation and Scientific Research Institute of Sea and Islands were signed on the margins of the joint commission meeting. India and Vietnam also agreed to coordinate closely at multilateral forums, including the UN Security Council, where both countries will concurrently serve as non-permanent members in 2021, and at regional forums under the Asean framework.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-vietnam-talk-on-china-s-destabilising-actions/story-3YALid2Qe23CVR7sbo8qXJ.html
25-08-2020||India||India, B’desh river trade route to begin from Sept 3||New Delhi India and Bangladesh are set to operationalise a new riverine trade route on September 3, when a Bangladeshi vessel will transport a cargo of cement to Tripura as part of efforts to boost connectivity between the two countries. The route connecting Sonamura in Tripura to Daudkandi in Bangladesh is being operationalised under an agreement signed by the two sides in May to boost riverine trade by adding two new routes and five more ports in order to improve connectivity to India’s northeastern states and reduce transportation costs. Following discussions between the Inland Water Authority of India and Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority, the first pilot movement on the 93-km Daudkandi-Sonamura route is expected to be conducted on September 3, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The Bangladeshi vessel MV Premier will carry 50 metric tonnes of cement from Premier Cement Ltd of Bangladesh to Tripura via Gumti river, the people said. Customs formalities will be completed at the land customs station at Srimantapur-Bibirbazar, they added. “The new route will facilitate bilateral trade with improved reliability and cost effectiveness for the business community,” said one of the people cited above. India and Bangladesh signed the Protocol for Inland Water Trade and Transit in 1972 for inland waterways connectivity between the two sides for bilateral trade and to improve connectivity to India’s northeastern states. The protocol was expanded with the signing of a second addendum on May 20 that added two new routes and five ports of call to take the total number of routes to 10 and ports of call to 11. During fiscal 2019-20, about 3.5 million metric tonnes of cargo were transported via the inland waterways. “The connectivity provided by the existing and the newly added routes is all the more pertinent amid the Covid-19 crisis as it will be key to economical, faster, safer and greener transportation for the business communities of both countries,” the person said. The other new route – Rajshahi-Dhulian-Rajshahi – will help augment infrastructure in Bangladesh and reduce the cost of transporting goods such as stone chips to northern Bangladesh. It is also expected to decongest land customs stations on both sides. The new riverine trade route is being operationalised against the backdrop of India’s concerted efforts to boost economic aid and connectivity with key neighbours amid the border standoff with China. Last month, India handed over 10 railway locomotives to Bangladesh, reflecting a renewed focus on its “neighbourhood first” policy. This came close on the heels of the first cross-border container train reaching Bangladesh with 50 containers of FMCG goods and fabrics and the first trans-shipment of container cargo from Kolkata to Agartala in the landlocked northeastern region via Bangladesh’s Chattogram port.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-b-desh-river-trade-route-to-begin-from-sept-3/story-h7NQTTdFYWGa9R6MuKEsiJ.html
25-08-2020||India||House panels told not to pick sub-judice issues||New Delhi: Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla has written to the chairpersons of all parliamentary panels to select subjects following Parliamentary rules and conventions, which includes not taking up subjects that are pending examination by courts. “The Committees should give due consideration to rule 270 and other necessary rules and directions while selecting subjects for examination,” Birla said in a letter, which accessed by the Hindustan Times. “In addition, I would like to point out that as per convention, the Committees do not take those subjects for examination where the issue is pending in the Courts.”According to rule 270, ‘a Committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records, provided that if any question arises whether the evidence of a person or the production of a document is relevant for the purposes of the Committee, the question shall be referred to the Speaker whose decision shall be final’.Moreover, the rule adds that the Government may decline to produce a document on the ground that its disclosure would be prejudicial to the safety or interest of the state.The Speaker’s letter comes barely a week before the Information and Technology Panel is slated to discuss two contentious topics, the issue of Internet shutdowns in Jammu and Kashmir on September 1 and Facebook’s testimony over alleged bias towards the ruling party. The Supreme Court is still considering the matter of Internet shutdowns in Jammu and Kashmir. While the next hearing has not with the next hearing been notified, on August 11, the Centre had told the SC that they will be restore 4G in the newly formed Union territory in a staggered manner after August 15. The Facebook controversy was spotlighted by the Wall Street Journal, which reported that Facebook India intervened in content moderation processes to ensure hate speeches by a BJP leader were not taken down – a claim the company has since denied. Facebook India on Friday evening reiterated it acts in an unbiased manner. BJP MP Nishikant Dubey has contested panel chair Shashi Tharoor’s decision to ask Facebook to appear before the committee and has asked the Speaker for his removal.Hindustan Times reached out Congress MP Shashi Tharoor for a response but did not receive one till press time. Parliamentary standing committees and departmentally related standing committees are smaller units of MPs from both houses and across political parties. As extensions of the Parliament, the rules that govern the House, apply to the Committees. The committees function all year round, under the overall aegis of the Speaker. The agenda of the committees is pre-approved by the Speaker. At present, there are 54 Parliamentary Committees, of which 24 are departmentally related. Of the 24 departmentally related committees, 17 fall under the Lok Sabha and seven are under the Rajya Sabha. According to the agenda of the IT Panel, issued on August 20 and seen by Hindustan Times, ‘oral evidence of the representatives of the Ministry of Communications (Department of Telecommunications), Ministry of Home Affairs and the representatives of the state of Bihar, UT f Jammu and Kashmir and the UT of NCT of Delhi’ is expected on the ‘suspension’ of Internet/Telecom services and its impact’. It has also listed hearing the views of the ‘representatives of Facebook on ‘Safeguarding Citizens’ rights’.The issue of ‘sub-judice’ matters being discussed in the house, say experts, has been around for a while now. According to former Lok Sabha secretary general PDT Achary, the rule of sub judice is not absolute. “There have been many times when the issues has been before the court and examined by the House at the same time,” Achary told Hindustan Times. “It has been done in the past.” Achary added that there is a rule that matters that are sub judice should not be discussed does exist, however, the Parliament also has a rule of suspension that allows for a departure in case a topic of national importance has to be discussed.“The sub judice is more of a self-imposed restriction,” said Achary. “The Committee can do so under the direction of the Speaker and since the agenda is pre-approved by the Speaker, they don’t need to seek permission again. Not every paper has to go to the Speaker.”Former secretary general of the Rajya Sabha Shamsher Sheriff said that since the Parliamentary committees are extension of the house, the Speaker has only drawn the attention of chairpersons to the particular issue. The former official drew the attention to the Presiding Officers meet held in New Delhi in 1967 that was appointed to indicate guidelines as to what could be treated as sub judice. “If you go by that, then quite naturally, it is left to the discretion of the chairpersons of the committees, depending on the facts of each case and its specificities, to determining whether the matter can be discussed or not“Members are left in the light of all this to show restraint when discussing such matters, only facts can be asked for but a discussion that may be prejudicial to the proceedings of the court has to be avoided,” he added. According to the Committe of the presiding officers, as mentioned in the Rajya Sabha General rules of procedure, (Rajya Sabha at Work) available on the Rajya Sabha website, “freedom of speech is a primary right whereas rule of sub judice is a self-imposed restriction. So where need be, the latter must give way to the former.” It says that as a sovereign body, the Parliament has a right to legislate on any matter. “Rule of sub judice has no application in privilege matters. Rule of sub judice does not ordinarily apply to legislation. Rule of sub judice applies only in regard to the specific issues before a court. The entire gamut of the matter is not precluded,” it adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-panels-told-not-to-pick-sub-judice-issues/story-7iM7g7ZGd1fnehjDpZe8kK.html
25-08-2020||India||‘A brief moment in history’: China envoy on clash that killed 20 Indians||The June 15 clash between Indian and Chinese forces was an “unfortunate incident” and “a brief moment from the perspective of history”, and the two sides should now “seek common ground while reserving differences”, Chinese envoy Sun Weidong has said.Sun made the remarks at a China-India youth webinar organised on August 18, though the transcript of his speech was released by the Chinese embassy only on Tuesday. The remarks came against the backdrop of India urging China to speedily address outstanding issues that have held up the disengagement and de-escalation process along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The envoy’s speech largely focused on historical links between the two countries and how the two sides, as ancient civilisations, should respect each other and seek common ground. He also said China’s “basic foreign policy towards India remains unchanged”.In the only reference in his speech to the June 15 clash, which left 20 Indian soldiers dead and caused unspecified Chinese casualties, Sun said: “Not long ago, an unfortunate incident happened in the border areas that neither China nor India would like to see. Now we are working to handle it properly. It is a brief moment from the perspective of history.”The envoy added, “China sees India as a partner instead of a rival, and an opportunity instead of a threat. We hope to put the boundary question at an appropriate place in bilateral relations, properly handle differences through dialogue and consultation, and push bilateral relations back on track at an early date.”There was no immediate response to the Chinese envoy’s remarks from Indian officials.In an apparent response to the Indian government’s “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) initiative that was launched after the border standoff began, Sun said: “No country can be isolated from the rest of the world and seek development on its own. We should not only adhere to self-reliance, but also stick to opening up to the outside world in line with the trend of globalisation.”He pointed out China has been India’s largest trading partner for many years and the two economies are interdependent. “I think the two big economies of China and India should attract each other like magnets, rather than forcefully separate them,” he said.The envoy outlined three reasons to show that China’s foreign policy towards India has not changed – the basic national conditions of the two countries remain unchanged, their orientation as partners, friendly cooperation and common development remain unchanged, and the “general structure that China and India cannot develop without each other remains unchanged”.Sun noted the Chinese people often say it is important to have a “long-term perspective rather than only looking at the present”, and there is need to see that “friendly cooperation between China and India is...the general trend”. “Only by seeing this can we maintain objective and rational judgment and correctly handle the differences between the two sides. I am convinced that China and India...have the wisdom and ability to properly handle bilateral relations,” he added.Sun further said the two countries should “treat each other’s differences in a mature and rational manner”. He added: “We need to understand each other, seek common ground while reserving differences, and work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind.”The two “rising major neighbours” should “abandon the old mindset of drawing lines by ideology, and get rid of the old game of ‘one’s gain is another’s loss’ and ‘zero-sum game’”, or else “you would be led astray and go down a wrong path”, Sun said.Mutual respect and equal treatment alone can enhance mutual understanding and trust, avoid suspicion and misunderstanding, and “realise the goal of ‘Dragon-Elephant Tango’ between China and India on the road of peaceful coexistence and common development”, the envoy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unfortunate-incident-china-envoy-on-border-clash-that-killed-20-indians/story-kOylvqPUBF3WJ3sLeYQNKN.html

25-08-2020||India||Companies now allowed to spend CSR funds in finding drugs, vaccines for Covid-19||The government has allowed companies to spend their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds on research and development (R&D) for finding vaccines, medicines and medical equipments to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, two government officials said requesting anonymity.“The decision was taken in line with the Prime Minister’s directive to encourage new drug discoveries for Covid-19, and a top official of the PMO [Prime Minister’s Office] played an active role in this,” one of the officials said.The ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) has already notified the two amendments in the CSR rules on Monday that would allow companies to spend their CSR funds in R&D activities related to new vaccine, drugs and medical devices in three financial years starting from 2020-21.The Companies Act requires firms with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, or turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or net profit of Rs 5 crore or more in the immediately preceding financial year, to mandatorily spend 2% of average net profit of the preceding three years on CSR. Money earmarked for spending on CSR activities in a year is about Rs 15,000 crore.MCA has amended the Schedule VII to include R&D for development of drugs to cure Covid-19 as one of the approved CSR activities, a second official said. The government has specified broad areas of mandatory CSR spending in Schedule VII.Accordingly, contributions to R&D projects in the field of science, technology, engineering and medicine, funded by the central or state governments or any public sector entity would also be counted under CSR, he added. Companies can now contribute their CSR funds to public funded universities, Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Department of Science and Technology (DST) and Department of Pharmaceuticals, he said. They can also participate in institutions under the ministry of ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha and homoeopathy (AYUSH), he said. Approved activities under Schedule VII of CSR include eradicating extreme hunger, poverty, promotion of education, promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment as well as reducing the child mortality, improving maternal health and combating diseases. Ensuring environmental sustainability and prompting employment enhancing vocational skills are other activities approved under CSR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/companies-now-allowed-to-spend-csr-funds-in-finding-drugs-vaccines-for-covid-19/story-V8BhbSlY9lgKapsN5jQQxK.html
25-08-2020||India||Orissa high court allows woman to live-in with same-sex partner||The Orissa High Court has allowed a 24-year-old woman to live with her same-sex partner after the latter’s family members reportedly tried to get her married to a boy against her wish.Hearing a habeas corpus petition, a division bench of Justice SK Mishra and Justice Savitri Ratho directed the police to provide security to the partner of the woman so that she could start living with her. Though the order was passed on Monday, it was uploaded on the high court portal on Tuesday.Petitioner Chinmayee Jena alias Sonu Krishna Jena had filed a habeas corpus application under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution seeking production of her woman partner, alleging that she was being kept away by her mother and uncle. The petitioner told the court that her partner’s mother and uncle were now trying to marry her off.Jena, who produced a certification of Gender Dysphoria for Trans man from a psychiatrist, had claimed that he and his partner had fallen in love with each other in 2011 and had been enjoying a consensual relationship since 2017. The two were studying in the same school and later in the same college. After completing their respective studies, Jena got a private job at Bhubaneswar and was staying on rent in the city.Jena claimed that while she was staying in a live-in relationship with her partner, in April this year, the latter’s mother and uncle came to her and forcibly took her away against her will. It was done against her will even though both of them had become majors. She also cited the provisions of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which acknowledged live-in relationships.Citing the orders of Supreme Court in Navtej Singh Johar vs Union of India case in which the apex court held that section 377 of the Indian Penal Code transgressed Article 14, 15, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India, the High Court bench said that the petitioner has the right of self-determination of sex/gender and also has the right to have a live-in relationship with a person of choice even though such person may belong to the same gender as the petitioner.During the hearing through virtual mode, the petitioner woman’s partner told the HC that she wants to join the company of the petitioner without further delay.The HC also ordered that the petitioner would have to allow the mother and sister of her partner to be in touch with her and that her partner would have all the rights of a woman as enshrined under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/orissa-high-court-allows-woman-to-live-in-with-same-sex-partner/story-M6gWVDJp8yWFP3QHoNEveM.html
25-08-2020||India||Delivery of modified Boeing 777 aircraft, part of Air India One for PM Modi delayed||The arrival of specially modified Boeing 777 aircraft part of the Air India One fleet for Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been delayed due to “operational issues”, officials aware of the development said.“The delivery of the aircraft was scheduled for August 25 but has been delayed due to certain operational issues. It may now take two to three weeks more to deliver,” a senior government official said requesting anonymity.The Centre had sent a team of senior officials from the Indian Air Force and Air India for escorting the aircraft back to India and assessing the technical requirements, a second official said.The government has planned to procure two such specially modified Boeing-777 aircraft, capable of countering missile threats with its own missile defence system, called the Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) and Self-Protection Suites (SPS).The modified aircrafts were set to match the US President’s Air Force One in terms of security measures.‘Air India One’ is the call sign of any aircraft with the President or Prime Minister of India on board. The aircraft is operated as a VVIP flight by the Indian Air Force.Air India One, the highly customized wide-bodied Boeing 777-300 ERs, meant exclusively for the Indian Prime Minister, President and the Vice-President, is set to land in Delhi by early next week.When contacted by HT, Air India spokesperson said: “We would not like to comment on this.” Boeing India’s spokesperson also declined to comment on the matter.The planes will come equipped with self-protection suites (SPS) consisting of aircraft infrared countermeasures, advanced integrated defensive electronic warfare suite and counter-measures dispensing system to protect them from inbound missiles, Hindustan Times had reported on June 4.Air India had sent a pair of new Boeing 777-300ER aircraft to a Boeing facility in Dallas to be refurbished for VVIP travel, including installation of missile defence systems worth USD 190 million. Aircraft records from open source websites showed both jets were less than 3 years old and have been sparingly used.The new long-haul aircraft will be used exclusively by PM Modi, President Ram Nath Kovind and Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu.At present the three dignitaries fly Air India’s Boeing-747 planes that the state-run airline deploys on commercial flights. These are temporarily reconfigured for the dignitaries when they need to travel, with the call sign changing to Air India One.The Boeing-747 planes that are chartered from Air India for use by the three dignitaries are two decades old.The modified aircraft will also have ‘Bharat’ and India written over it along with the Ashoka emblem.The new planes have been configured to give PM Modi some generous office space, meeting rooms, a wide array of communication systems and a section for handling medical emergencies. The aircraft can fly between the US and India without having to stop for refuelling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delivery-of-modified-boeing-777-aircraft-part-of-air-india-one-for-pm-modi-delayed/story-NaqlxjlxNmm1AWuG8aa49L.html

For better local movement and to make sure that the candidates appearing for these exams reach their centres on time, the National Testing Agency has written to the state governments to extend support. Around 16 lakh students have registered for NEET-UG this year, while close to 9.3 lakh students had registered for JEE-Mains (Paper I) that was conducted in January. With the ongoing pandemic, NTA on Tuesday said that the aspirants appearing fort these exams will have a safe environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jee-neet-exams-here-are-the-guidelines-issued-by-national-testing-agency-nta/story-lEpF7CZaPy2HKVRsY1Yp5N.html
25-08-2020||India||‘Appu Ghar’s land was taken by court’: SC during Central Vista hearing||The Supreme Court on Tuesday began hearing a bunch of petitions challenging the Central Vista project, which involves building a new Parliament and integrating all Central government offices into one complex, being developed by the Central government.The bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna asked the petitioners to address them first on the challenge with regard to change of land use. The lead petitioner, Rajeev Suri, represented by advocate Shikhil Suri, submitted to the court that the land use of the Central Vista area - which comprises Parliament, heritage buildings, green area and recreational spaces - could not be changed by the government. According to him, this was done in haste and in an illegal manner as the March 20 notification approving change of land use could not be issued by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA).On a lighter note, the bench observed that when the Supreme Court had to be expanded, the land where Appu Ghar existed was taken over for development of the court’s additional complex.The bench remarked, “The recreational space at Pragati Maidan was converted into the extended complex of Supreme Court. That aspect (change of land use) nobody has challenged fortunately.” Suri informed the court that the alteration carried out by the DDA was shown as modification to the Master Plan of Delhi 2021 but in essence it altered the very character of the master plan. He further submitted to the court that the National Capital Region plan envisaged decentralisation and by this logic too, the Centre’s decision to integrate all 51 Central government offices in the heart of the city could not be sustained. “The idea behind the project is to have an integrated office complex instead of having it dispersed. Does the layout plan or building bye-laws permit such classification where one class of activity can be integrated at a common place,” the bench asked Suri.Further, the Court wished to know if the DDA should be faulted on the change of land use or the extent of this change in land use. The Court pointed out that though the notification of change of land use was issued by the DDA in exercise of its power under Section 11A of Delhi Development Act, such power can even be derived from other sections of the same Act. The hearing will continue on Wednesday.The Central Vista project envisages a new Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, common Central Secretariat housing 51 Ministries in 10 buildings. At present, these offices are housed in 47 buildings spread over different locations. An underground shuttle of 3 kilometre length is also being planned for providing connectivity with nearest metro stations of Udyog Bhawan and Central Secretariat stations.The proposed Lok Sabha chamber is expected to accommodate 876 seats and the Rajya Sabha chamber 400 seats. At present, the Central Hall has 440 seats and during the joint session of Parliament, temporary seats have to be arranged in the aisle. The new complex will provide for 1224 seats in the Central Hall, equipped with state-of-the-art technology and seamless movement between the two Houses.An affidavit filed by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), the project proponent in the present petitions, has pegged the project cost at Rs 20,000 crore to be paid over six years. On the green front too, the Centre has claimed that 9.5 acres green space to be utilised for the project will be compensated by providing patches of 1.88 acre green area in three pockets, in Zone D of Central Vista and 3.9 acres green space in Zone C. Besides Rajeev Suri, other petitioners have also approached the apex court faulting the project on various grounds – manner of conducting public hearing, issue of public notice, grant of environmental impact assessment, clearance of project plan by Central Vista Committee, and unplanned destruction of heritage buildings in Central Vista as part of the project plan. The bench, while issuing notices on these petitions, indicated in March any steps taken with regard to the project will be subject to the final outcome of the proceedings in the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-begins-hearing-petitions-challenging-central-vista-project/story-ynBesx5GjneGVCLigrBGSO.html

25-08-2020||India||Nitish Kumar’s virtual mega rally for Bihar polls set for September 6||The JD (U) on Tuesday said chief minister Nitish Kumar will address the first big virtual rally on September 6 to roll out the party’s poll campaign. Ten lakh people are said to be joining the event through a digital platform.The fresh date for the maiden political rally by the chief minister, originally slated for August 7, has been announced after the Election Commission said that polls will be held on time despite the clamour by the opposition parties to defer it in the wake of sudden spurt in Covid-19 cases and flood situation, a demand that was also backed by NDA ally, the LJP.In the midst of uncertainty, the JD (U) which had completed the preparation and exercise for the roll out of the party’s poll campaign, on July 31 announced that it was putting the event on hold. In a one-line statement JD (U) state president and Rajya Sabha member Bashistha Narayan Singh said: “In view of the flood situation and Covid-19 pandemic, the party has decided to postpone the proposed virtual rally of the chief minister.”Party national general secretary Ravindra Singh said, “The state assembly elections are going to be held during Covid-19 pandemic. It is, therefore, necessary to find out-of-the box solutions for public interaction.”He, however, did not explain the idea behind the new coinage for the virtual rally that has now been christened as ‘jan samvad’ (public interaction).Singh said that people can connect with chief minister’s ‘jan-samvad’ programme on September 6, which would also be live-streamed across CM’s Facebook and his Twitter accounts, and on YouTube and electronic channels, in addition to the homegrown digital platform--jdulive.com-- developed by the party.Party sources said that separate teams of party leaders have been tasked to rope in the general public and sympathisers to hear Nitish Kumar spell out developmental initiatives and explain why another term for his party was in the overall interest of the state and its people.RJD media coordinator Mritunjay Tiwari said that nothing has changed.“First they postponed the rally fearing that their flop show would be exposed as numbers can’t be fudged on a live social media programme. Now, they are deploying their in-house digital platform. They are free to do whatever they want, but people are aware of the ground realities and the difficulties they face. No amount of window dressing is going to help,” he said, adding “last time the rally date fell during the lockdown, this time too, it falls on the last date of the extended lockdown.”On July 17, Opposition parties jointly petitioned the Election Commission, suggesting that Covid-19 cases were likely to touch 1 million mark by October-November and the election exercise could just turn into a “super spreader event”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-s-mega-virtual-rally-for-bihar-polls-set-for-september-6/story-etLXMT7OmzXbEAARRHKY8I.html
25-08-2020||India||Govt extends deadline for Air India bids by 2 months||The government has extended by two months the deadline for placing bids for Air India till October 30 as the Covid-19 fallout has disrupted economic activity globally.The process of stake sale in the national carrier was initiated on January 27. This is the fourth extension given by the government for putting in bids. Issuing a corrigendum to the Expression of Interest (EoI) for sale of Air India, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management said the deadline has been extended in view of the “request received from the IBs (interested bidders) in view of the prevailing situation arising out of Covid-19”.While issuing the EoI in January, the last date for bids was kept at March 17, which was later extended to April 30. This was further extended till June 30, and again till August 31. Also the date for intimation to qualified interested bidders (QIB) has been extended by over two months till November 20, the DIPAM said in the corrigendum posted on its website. “Further changes with respect to the Important Dates, if any, will be communicated to the Interested Bidders subsequently,” it added. Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted economic activity globally with many countries announcing lockdown to contain the virus spread. The aviation sector has been hit hard by Covid-19 with airlines cancelling international flights and announcing pay cuts for employees. The government has already extended the time given to investors to bid for its entire 52.98 per cent stake in Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) to September 30. After its unsuccessful bid to sell Air India in 2018, the government in January 2020 restarted the divestment process and invited bids for selling 100 per cent of its equity in the state-owned airline, including Air India’s 100 per cent shareholding in AI Express Ltd and 50 per cent in Air India SATS Airport Services Private Ltd. In 2018, the government had offered to sell its 76 per cent stake in the airline. Of the airline’s total debt of Rs 60,074 crore as of March 31, 2019, the buyer would be required to absorb Rs 23,286.5 crore, while the rest would be transferred to Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL), a special purpose vehicle. For current fiscal, the budget has pegged disinvestment proceeds at Rs 2.10 lakh crore. This includes Rs 1.20 lakh crore from CPSE share sale and Rs 90,000 crore from share sale in public sector banks and financial institutions, including listing of insurance behemoth LIC. However, no disinvestment has taken place so far this fiscal.The government has already kickstarted the process for selecting a transaction advisor for the initial public offering of Life Insurance Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-extends-deadline-for-air-india-bids-by-2-months/story-pO1xb8RAoejYjuO9vm8FPL.html

Indian ambassador, Suhel Ajaz Khan, handed over a consignment of medical aid, including 70 boxes of PPE kits, to Lebanon’s public health minister Hamad Hassan to help in the country’s fight against Covid-19. Khan and Hassan discussed issues of mutual interest, including encouraging Indian pharmaceutical exports to Lebanon. Earlier, India had delivered 58 tonnes of medical, food and relief supplies to Lebanon in an air force plane on August 14. The aid included emergency medical supplies, wheat flour, sugar, pulses, and relief materials such as blankets, dignity kits and sleeping mats for the large number of people left homeless by the explosions. Nearly 3,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored at Beirut’s port blew up on August 4, virtually wiping out the city’s commercial hub and damaging many parts of the Lebanese capital. The blasts killed more than 170 people, injured another 6,000 and left nearly 300,000 homeless. The total damage was estimated at $10 billion to $15 billion. A preliminary assessment by the World Bank showed some 50,000 residential units were damaged and 80% of residential buildings and infrastructure were affected by the explosions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-delivers-second-tranche-of-aid-to-lebanon/story-n3EMaqRVWnDmqOkJhbaBHI.html

HT has reviewed a copy of the notification. “In order to promote usage of digital payments for availing all discounts on the Fee Plazas of national highways, the amendments to the Rules are made which would enable- discount on return journey within 24 hours, it would be through FASTag or such other device and automatic. There will be no requirement for a pass,” a ministry official said.“The fee payable towards discounts ashall be paid through pre-paid instruments, smart card or through FASTag or on board unit (transponder) or any other such device only. The amendment would also enable that in cases where there is a discount available for a return journey within 24 hours, there is no need for a prior receipt or intimation and the citizen would get the discount automatically if return journey is made within 24 hours with a valid and a functional FASTag on the vehicle,” the official added.FASTag is a radio frequency identification sticker typically fixed to a vehicle’s windscreen that allows for the deduction of toll wirelessly and automatically without requiring a vehicle to stop at plazas. The tags were introduced to encourage digital payments and to end congestion and reduce waiting time at toll plazas.The Centre mandated that all lanes of toll plazas on national highways be declared FASTag lanes by December 15 to reduce bottlenecks along the national highways. It also relaxed its rules to allow at least a fourth of the lanes at toll plazas to allow both cash and FASTags payments for a period of 30 days. That ended on January 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-makes-fastag-mandatory-to-avail-discounts-at-highway-tolls/story-QUE2lQg8T0rMnyF7gPO8gK.html
25-08-2020||India||India-Vietnam meeting discusses China’s destabilising actions||China’s destabilising actions in the region figured at a meeting on Tuesday of the India-Vietnam joint commission on trade, economic, scientific and technological cooperation, during which the two countries agreed to work more closely together in the Indo-Pacific. During the virtual meeting, co-chaired by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Vietnamese counterpart Pham Binh Minh, the two sides agreed to add new momentum to their economic and defence engagement and to explore closer cooperation in emerging areas such as civil nuclear energy, space, marine sciences and new technologies. China’s actions in the South China Sea and along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) figured in the discussions, with both sides briefing each other on the latest developments, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The Vietnamese side “underlined the importance of peace and security in the South China Sea”, one of the people cited above said. India and Vietnam agreed to enhance bilateral cooperation in line with New Delhi’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI) and Asean’s outlook on Indo-Pacific to “achieve shared security, prosperity and growth for all in the region”, the external affairs ministry said in a statement. “India invited Vietnam to collaborate on one of the seven pillars of the IPOI,” it added. IPOI was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the East Asia Summit in November 2019 and its pillars include enhancing maritime security, promoting free, fair and mutually beneficial trade and maritime transport and enhancing science and technology cooperation. In recent years, Vietnam has often turned to India for support over China’s increasing activities within its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea. India is one of only three countries with which Vietnam has a comprehensive strategic partnership and state-owned ONGC Videsh is engaged in energy production in Vietnamese waters that have witnessed intrusions by Chinese vessels over the past year. On Friday, Vietnamese envoy Pham Sanh Chau met foreign secretary Harsh Shringla to brief him on the escalating tensions in the South China Sea after China ramped up its military presence in the region. At Tuesday’s meeting, the two sides also reviewed recent developments in their comprehensive strategic partnership and discussed the future trajectory of their engagement. The statement said Jaishankar and Minh “exchanged views on regional and international issues of mutual interest, especially in the context of the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic”. Jaishankar referred to the prime minister’s vision of “Atmanirbhar Bharat” for enhancing resilience through self-reliance and human-centric globalisation and invited Vietnam to take advantage of the country’s new economic capacities and demands. He also reaffirmed India’s development and capacity-building aid to Vietnam through initiatives such as quick impact projects (QIPs), PhD fellowships, water resource management projects in the Mekong Delta, digital connectivity and heritage conservation. India has approved 12 QIPs in Vietnam, including seven water resource management schemes in the Mekong Delta and five for building educational infrastructure. MoU for cooperation between the Sushma Swaraj Institute of Foreign Service and the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam and between the National Maritime Foundation and Scientific Research Institute of Sea and Islands were signed on the margins of the joint commission meeting. India and Vietnam also agreed to coordinate closely at multilateral forums, including the UN Security Council, where both countries will concurrently serve as non-permanent members in 2021, and at regional forums under the Asean framework.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-vietnam-meeting-discusses-china-s-destabilising-actions/story-paRUZjoMdiS709T8F5LgVJ.html
25-08-2020||India||‘Neither luxury nor sin good’: GST tax rate on 2-wheelers may witness a cut||The government may consider bringing down Goods and Services Tax (GST) on two-wheelers from the highest slab of 28% as finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday told the industry that two-wheelers are neither a luxury nor a sin good, hence merit a rate revision.Responding to an industry suggestion on the need for lowering the GST rate on two-wheelers at a close-door meeting of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) through video conference, she said “this was indeed a good suggestion as this category is neither a luxury nor a sin good and hence merits a rate revision,” a CII statement quoted her as saying.Sitharaman told the industry body that this matter will be taken up with the GST Council, which is the apex federal body on matters related to the indirect tax. The GST Council is chaired by the Union finance minister and finance ministers of states are its members. The council’s decisions are often unanimous. A government official aware about the development said on condition of anonymity that the matter is under consideration to boost sagging demand of automobiles, but the Union finance ministry has only recommendatory role. “Any decision in this regard will be taken by the GST Council,” the official said. While sale of passenger vehicles has plummeted by about 4% in July 2020 compared to the corresponding period last year, two-wheelers’ sales plunged by 15.24% in the same period.“It is not yet clear whether matters related to tax rationalisation would be taken up in the 41st meeting of the GST Council or in the 42nd meeting,” the official said. The 41st meeting of the GST Council is scheduled on August 27 and the 42nd meeting is expected next month on September 19.A finance ministry official said requesting anonymity that the first meeting on August 27 is expected to consider only one matter – how to pay compensation to states for their revenue shortfalls? “It is likely that tax rate rationalisation matters would be taken up on September 19 along with various other reforms,” he said.As told by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman after the 40th meeting of the council on June 12, the August 27 meeting will be special as it will discuss only one matter - how to pay compensation to states at a time when the compensation cess collection has plunged because of weak economic activities due to Covid-19 pandemic, he said.While briefing reporters after the 40th meeting, Sitharaman had said on request of members the Council would meet again in July to discuss only “one-agenda item” -- compensation to states.“Compensation, which has to be given to states, and, if at all, it results in some kind of borrowing, how and who is going to pay for it,” she had said. The meeting was, however, deferred to August, due to some technical reasons, the official said.At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime in July 2017, the GST law assured states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years (up to 2022) and their revenue shortfall should be made good through the compensation cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal and other tobacco products. The official said, the 42nd meeting of the Council on September 19 is generic in nature and may consider revising tax on several items that suffer from inverted duty such as fertilisers, footwear, renewable energy devices, tractors and man-made yarns and fabrics. Inverted duty structure is a situation in which inputs are taxed at a higher rate than finished goods.Jigar Doshi, founding partner of a tax technology firm TTMS LLP, said, “The applicable GST rate on two wheelers is 28%, which is usually for the sin or luxury goods. Since two wheelers do not form part of either category, the same has been under consideration and recommendations for rate reduction.”“It is relevant to note that the input tax credit on two wheelers is restricted under the Act (unless for furtherance of business). Given that two wheelers might be essential, especially for the non registrants [those not registered under GST] or small organizations, a rate cut will be a major sigh of relief,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/neither-luxury-nor-sin-good-gst-tax-rate-on-2-wheelers-may-witness-a-cut/story-mjSIjcZCsAhSXCUmg5zTbL.html
25-08-2020||India||BJP revokes suspension of MLA seen in viral video dancing with guns||The Uttarakhand BJP on Monday revoked the suspension of controversial Khanpur MLA Kunwar Pranav Singh Champion from the party 13 months after the action was taken against him when a video purportedly showing him dancing with guns in hand went viral.The decision was taken by the core committee of the party based on the legislator’s “good conduct” during the last 13 months of his suspension and his repeated apologies to the party leadership, state BJP president Bansidhar Bhagat told reporters after welcoming Champion back into the party fold at his residence.The party also decided to forgive Jhabreda MLA Deshraj Karnwal, who had been served with a notice for breach of party discipline, after he gave an apology in writing, he said.The party had been considering taking Champion back and forgiving Karnawal for some time.Bhagat also said the Khanpur MLA had apologised to him, to the party’s core committee and to the media for his “misconduct”  which had led to his suspension from the party in June 2019.Champion was suspended from the party in June last year, initially for three months, on charges of breach of party discipline for engaging in a public spat with the Jhabreda MLA and challenging him to a wrestling bout at a Roorkee stadium.When the action was taken against him, he was also facing the charge of abusing an electronic media reporter at Uttarakhand Bhawan in Delhi.His suspension was extended indefinitely just a month later when a video in which he was purportedly seen dancing with guns in hand to popular Bollywood songs went viral, leaving the party red-faced.After being welcomed back into the party, Champion said he remained loyal to the BJP even during his suspension period. He also offered an apology before the press for his misconduct which had led to his suspension.“I was sorry then and I apologise again today with folded hands for what I did. But even during the 13-month period of my suspension, I worked for the policies and programmes of the BJP,” Champion said.Champion is a fitness enthusiast known for his love for guns.The party is yet to hear from two other legislators, including Dwarahat MLA Mahesh Negi who has been accused of rape by a woman and Lohaghat MLA Pooran Singh Fartyal who also faces breach of discipline charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-revokes-suspension-of-mla-seen-in-viral-video-dancing-with-guns/story-1JXeeIoSALphaRJhnrBVoO.html
25-08-2020||India||Amid border row, India and China may take part in war games in Russia||The Indian army and the Chinese People’s Liberation army may be caught in a tense border stand-off along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh but both armies are likely to send troop contingents to Russia next month to take part in a multi-lateral exercise, people familiar with the developments said on Tuesday.Talks between the two armies to reduce border tensions are stuck in a stalemate and the disengagement process in Ladakh has hit a roadblock. The Pakistan army is also likely to take part in the exercise Kavkaz-2020, said one of the officials cited above. Eighteen countries are expected to take part in the exercise, including the member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). While it is not uncommon for the armies of India, China and Pakistan to be part of multi-nation exercises on neutral territories (they even deploy alongside in United Nations peace missions), the exercise planned next month assumes importance because of the ongoing border row in the Ladakh sector, said a second official.“Participation of Pakistan and China in this annual event as part of the SCO should not be contextualised in the perspective of the India-China border row,” said former army vice chief Lieutenant General AS Lamba (retd). India is sending a tri-services contingent of 150 to 200 personnel to Russia for the drills scheduled from September 15 to 26. Details of the Chinese and Pakistani participation are not known.India and China were unable to bridge their differences on the disengagement and de-escalation process along the LAC during diplomatic talks last week, with New Delhi emphasising the need to resolve “outstanding issues” speedily, as reported by Hindustan Times on August 20.People familiar with developments during the meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs dismissed an assertion in a readout from the Chinese foreign ministry that the two sides had “positively evaluated the progress” in the disengagement process.The military dialogue between senior commanders from the two sides has hit a roadblock due to Chinese reluctance to restore status quo ante in some key friction areas along the LAC. The commanders set the time-frame and method of disengagement while the WMCC monitors the process. No dates have yet been fixed for the next round of talks between corps commander-ranked officers who have so far met five times but failed to break the deadlock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-border-row-india-and-china-may-take-part-in-war-games-in-russia/story-alys0XvcAF404OOkD3s5lI.html

According to Raigad District Superintendent of Police, Anil Paraskar, a First information Report (FIR) was registered on Tuesday at Mahad city police station against the builder and four others: architect, RCC consultant and two civic officials. No arrests have been made till now. According to the FIR, the builder, along with the architect and RCC consultant, was responsible for constructing the building using inferior material and without proper attention. The FIR also charged two civic officials of issuing completion certificate without properly inspecting the site. The Navi Mumbai based developer had constructed the building in partnership with a local landowner based on the 50:50 formula of sharing profit, said police officials. Those booked by police are identified as Farooq Kazi, a developer; Gaurav Shah, architect; Bahubali Dhamane, RCC consultant; Deepak Jhisand, former Mahad Municipal council chief and Shashikant Dighe, junior construction inspector at Mahad Municipal Council. Repeated attempts made to reach out to all the five named in the FIR did not bear result.They have been booked under IPC sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting murder), 304-A (Causing death by negligence), 337 and 338 (causing hurt to any person, and 34 (criminal act carried out by several persons with common intention). The Tariq garden building with 40 flats was completed in two years’ time after which people started living there, according to the FIR. Paraskar said around 95 people were there in the building on the day it came crashing down. “Of the 95 persons, 75 managed to come out while the NDRF was able to pull out 11 bodies till 4 pm.” Six men and five women were among the dead. Maharashtra minister for urban development Eknath Shinde, who visited the building site, said, orders have been issued to police to act against all those responsible for the incident. “We will not spare anyone responsible for the building collapse. Information is being gathered on whether a structural audit of this building was conducted or not.”District guardian minister Aditi Tatkare said a committee will be formed to probe the incident. “The committee will probe how and why this happened.

She has urged for the Prime Minister’s intervention to postpone the examinations “so that students are free from mental agony and mental disaster.”Banerjee’s request comes in the backdrop of the coronavirus disease that has infected as many as 31,67,323 people in the country and has claimed over 58,000 lives. Also read| Clamour grows around postponement of JEE, NEET; Greta Thunberg favours students: Latest developments“Such intervention is very much essential in the larger interest of students to facilitate creating a situation whereby the students will neither be subjected to grave health risk nor they will face a career risk,” she wrote in the letter. The chief minister has asked the Prime Minister to consider taking necessary steps for postponing the JEE and NEET exams “until the public health situation becomes conducive again.” Earlier in the day, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik wrote to Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank seeking postponement of the entrance exams. It would be highly unsafe and perilous for 50,000 students of the state to visit the test centres physically to appear in these tests, he said. On Monday, Banerjee had written to PM Modi about her reservations against the UGC guidelines that required completing terminal examinations in universities/colleges across the country by the end of September 2020. “My point was that this decision had a huge potential to put students’ lives at risk,” she said.The Supreme Court had on August 17 rejected a plea seeking postponement of these exams saying a crucial year of students “cannot be wasted” and life has to go on.Over 16 lakh students have registered for NEET this year and nearly 9.3 lakh students had registered for JEE-Mains (Paper I) that was held in January. An equal number of students were expected to appear for the second phase of the exam, which are scheduled for April-May each year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-writes-to-pm-modi-asks-centre-to-file-review-petition-to-postpone-jee-neet-exams/story-j2YZkbahq1He25RfKaw2BM.html

The officers - inspector Bhushan Belnekar and sub-inspector Vaibhav Jagtap - were under quarantine after they tested positive for Covid-19 two weeks ago. “Belnekar was discharged a few days ago. But is currently under quarantine, as per the doctor’s advice,” said a senior police officer, requesting anonymity. Mumbai police officials said the CBI is likely to summon senior police officers, including the senior police inspectors and officers above him as well. The central agency’s probe team has been in Mumbai since Friday last after the Supreme Court approved the ongoing CBI investigation recommended by the Bihar government into the death of Sushant Rajput.The team continued to question the actor’s cook Neeraj Singh, domestic help Keshav Bachner, roommate and creative manager Siddharth Pithani, chartered accountant Sandeep Shridhar and house manager Samuel Miranda in DRDO guest house in Santacruz (east). On Monday, the CBI team had questioned employees of Waterstone Resort in Andheri (East) where Rajput had spent two months last year. The same afternoon, a CBI team also visited and met the team of Cooper Hospital doctors who conducted the autopsy. Rajput’s father had filed a police complaint in Patna, accusing Rhea Chakraborty - her son’s friend - and her family of abetting his son’s suicide and misappropriating his money. The CBI is yet to call Rhea Chakraborty for questioning.Rajput was found dead in his Bandra apartment on June 14.

Some initial information have been shared,” Rajesh Bhushan, Secretary, Union health ministry said while briefing the media.President Vladimir Putin on August 11 had announced ‘Sputnik V’, Russia’s first approved vaccine against Covid-19, making it the first country to approve a vaccine. Russia had said the vaccine will be rolled out by the end of this month. The country has already produced the first batch of ‘Sputnik V’, named after the world’s first satellite launched by the Soviet Union, according to reports. However, some scientists fear that with this fast regulatory approval, Moscow may be putting national prestige before safety amid the global race to develop a vaccine against coronavirus.President Putin had earlier assured the people that the vaccine is safe, adding that one of his daughters had taken it as a volunteer and felt good afterwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-russia-in-talks-regarding-covid-vaccine-sputnik-v-says-health-ministry/story-b9Id1R23bIyYazvGl7k5xL.html

Till now, the full content of the letter written on August 7 have not been made public. But Hindustan Times has learnt that the letter-writers had demanded the letter be made available to each of the 52 members that were attending the Congress Working Committee so that their act could be understood in its full context that it was asking for reform and not a revolt against Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. However, that was not done and the letter writers say that this led to the other members of the Congress Working Committee criticising them without fully knowing what the letter was about. “We wanted the letter to be made public,” said one of the members of Parliament and signatories. “However, they chose not to do so.”’ ALSO READ | CWC meet: Leaked letter puts Congress seniors on back footHT has managed to access the lines that were read out at the meeting of the Congress’ highest decision-making body. The lines addressed to Congress President Sonia Gandhi say, “We deeply appreciate the leadership provided by you in difficult times and also recognise the commendable efforts of Shri Rahul Gandhi during his tenure as Congress President. Congress Party will always remember with pride and gratitude the supreme sacrifice of Shrimati Indira Gandhi and Shri Rajiv Gandhi for the unity and integrity of India,” it said.“We acknowledge the resolute struggle, the visionary leadership and notable contribution of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. His enduring legacy will always remain a source of guidance and inspiration for the Congress party. The Nehru-Gandhi family will always remain an integral part of the collective leadership of the Congress party,” read Azad at the meeting yesterday. The other parts of the letter are reported to be asking for “active’ and visible” leadership and elections at all levels but this extract was read out to illustrate to the CWC that it wasn’t a war-cry against the Gandhis.Even as Azad read these lines, former president Rahul Gandhi questioned the claim that there were no copies of the letter. One of the members present at the meeting told HT that Gandhi questioned how the letter was leaked when it was written on the covering note that there is only one copy that was handed over to the Congress president and all other copies were destroyed.ALSO READ | ‘A year has lapsed’: Sonia Gandhi asks CWC to relieve her of party chief dutiesOne of the signatories to the letter said, “It was an orchestrated campaign for the invitees to slam the letter which they had not read. There were selective misreadings and misinterpretations,” said the Member of Parliament.However, CWC member and spokesperson Randeep Surjewala dismissed these claims. “Azad and Anand Sharma, the two senior leaders have already given statements that they are satisfied and so the issue is now closed,” he said.The party resolved on Monday to authorise Sonia Gandhi to stay on as party chief till an AICC session was called to elect the next president. The letter writers are now waiting to see if there is an impact of their letter, although all three letter writers Azad, Kapil Sibal and Vivek Tankha expressed their satisfaction with Sonia Gandhi’s comments at the meeting.She had said, “We are a large family. We have differences and different views on many occasions, but, we come together as one. Organizational issues are always addressed within the organization. And the process of constitution and reconstitution is a continuous one.” Gandhi went on to say that she does not hold any ill will against any colleague, irrespective of however hurtful the remarks. “I have always risen above them to keep the Congress family together and to fight for the cause of the people,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-cwc-meet-rahul-gandhi-had-a-question-on-leak-of-letter-that-set-off-a-storm/story-lmm3xGfcinQzsQ8WMuFcUO.html

Boating happens to be the chief attraction of Nainital. Tourists prefer to enjoy boating on a visit to the small hill station. Following the Covid-19 outbreak and lockdown, boating in Naini Lake was prohibited from March, an official said. The decision to allow boating was taken in a meeting between officials of Nainital municipality and a boat operators committee on Monday. “A meeting was held earlier also but the boat operators committee was reluctant to start operations due to lack of tourists. Now they are ready to operate as some tourists have started arriving,” Ashok Kumar, chief executive officer, Nainital municipality said. According to officials of the Nainital municipality, 222 rowing boats and around 60 pedal boats ply in the lake. The livelihood of over 300 boatmen depends upon boating. They were sitting idle during the lockdown when hardly any tourists were coming to the state. Kumar said, “It will be the duty of boat owners and boatmen that tourists maintain social distancing and wear face masks while enjoying boating. They will have to follow other guidelines during the booking of tourists and continuous sanitization of the boats.” Ram Singh Bisht, president, Boat Operators Committee, Nainital said, “As some tourists have started to come in the last few weeks, they decided to start boating services and spoke to officials concerned about it.

The notice was issued on the request of Enforcement Directorate (ED).Modi’s wife Ami is being investigated by ED in connection with laundering of money. The diamantaire, meanwhile, is in prison in London in connection with the Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case.Ami had left India with Nirav Modi and other family members in first week of January, 2018, just before agencies started investigations in the PNB scam. It is alleged that she had gone to the US.What is a red notice?Interpol defines red notice as a request to law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.The global body further says that a red notice contains information to identify the wanted person, such as their name, date of birth, nationality, hair and eye colour, photographs and fingerprints if available. It also information related to the crime they are wanted for.It is issued at the request of member country. The Interpol clarifies that a red notice is an international wanted person notice, but not an arrest warrant.The checks to be performed before issuing a red noticeEvery red notice request is checked by a specialised task force of the Interpol. This review takes into account information available at the time of publication.How will a red notice affect Ami Modi?A red notice allows 192 member countries to locate a person wanted by the country which has made the request. This means that Ami Modi’s free movement will be affected now.After a red notice against her, Ami’s name will be now in Interpol database at all the ports and airports across the world.Ami was director in few companies which were allegedly used by Nirav Modi for laundering money.

A person sought to serve a sentence means they have been found guilty by a court in the issuing country, it futher says.Can a red notice lead to arrest?Interpol says that it cannot force the law enforcement authorities in any country to arrest someone who is the subject of a red notice.Each member country decides what legal value it gives to a red notice and the authority of their law enforcement officers to make arrests, according to Interpol website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-what-is-interpol-red-notice-and-how-it-will-affect-nirav-modi-s-wife/story-VnWY1EtlGWHhgtRdcOv6ZK.html
25-08-2020||India||‘Still in love’: Congress accuses BJP of using banned China app||The Maharashtra Congress has slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party over the use of a banned Chinese app for its official communication to announce the organisational appointments on Monday. Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant raised questions over the use of Cam Scanner, one of the 59 Chinese apps banned by the central government in June. The Modi government had on June 29 banned the Chinese app as part of the ban amid the tension with China following the June 15 incident along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh in which 20 Indian soldiers died in the line of duty. The BJP issued a press note announcing the appointments of its workers on party’s OBC Morcha on Monday. Sawant has presented a copy of the press note scanned using the banned app. He said that the BJP’s pseudo nationalism has been exposed with this act. जाहीर निषेध! गद्दार @BJP4Maharashtra मोदी सरकारने बंदी घातलेले #कॅमस्कॅनर अॅपचा अजूनही राजरोसपणे वापर करत आहे. चीनी अॅपवर बंदी आणि आत्मनिर्भर अभियान ही सर्व धूळफेक आहे. भाजपाचे चीनबद्दलचे प्रेम ओसंडून वाहणारे आहे हे स्पष्ट आहे. pic.twitter.com/9w0g5L0Im5“It is shameful and annoying that the BJP is openly using the apps banned by the Central government ruled by it. This has shown how the BJP is still in love with China. The act of banning the Chinese app by the Modi government was just a hogwash to misguide people,” Sawant said. Maharashtra BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said that the party had forwarded the PDF files to the media and to other communication platforms. “We have not used any banned Chinese app for this communication. The files that were sent out were in PDF format. We are not aware if anybody in further process scanned them using the banned app,” he said. Sawant has also said that the organisations affiliated to the BJP were on forefront demanding to ban the Chinese products. “The ‘so called patriots’ were leading the campaign. The recent revelation about the potential deal between an Indian industrialistand TikTok, too has brought the real face of BJP to the fore,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/still-in-love-congress-accuses-bjp-of-using-banned-china-app/story-rViOZzbM8NgSuZV4KMCFGJ.html

The prisoner, Hemraj Bharadwaj, who is facing trial in a narcotics case, escaped taking advantage of the job of dumping garbage outside the prison under supervision assigned to him.Jail officials said with many convicts and prisoners known for good behaviour out on parole to reduce crowding of the jail due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the chores had to be redistributed among other prisoners including undertrials. This led to the lapse.“We have alerted the police ensuring the borders were sealed within 20 minutes of his escape being brought to our notice. We expect that he will be apprehended soon,” said inspector general (prisons) Gurudas Pilarnkar.Officials said the undertrial asked for permission to relieve himself and used the opportunity to escape while he was out to dump garbage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/undertrial-escapes-from-goa-jail-hunt-on/story-ulVAw7SObV4eT5G9E479SJ.html
25-08-2020||India||Stand-off with PLA pushes India to go for new snow-free axis to Ladakh||India’s national security planners are pushing hard to complete an all-weather strategic route to Ladakh that will link Darcha in Himachal Pradesh to Nimu via Padum in Kargil’s Zanskar valley, people familiar with the matter said. Nimu is 35 kilometres from Leh town and headquarters of XIV Corps responsible for the defence of East Ladakh and Siachen Glacier.This would be the first all-weather route to Ladakh that is already connected by two other routes; the first via Zoji La in Jammu and Kashmir and the second, via Himachal’s Manali-Upshi-Leh axis. The 9.02 kilometre Atal tunnel at Rohtang La, which will reduce the distance between Manali and Leh by 46 km, is set to become operational next month.Senior military commanders said the third route to feed Ladakh by road is urgently needed given how Pakistan and its all-weather friend, China were eyeing the Siachen Glacier and Daulat Beg Oldie. The defence ministry’s road project is being given its hardest push by road and highways minister Nitin Gadkari and his colleague Gen VK Singh after China provoked a standoff along the Line of Actual Control in East Ladakh and started mobilising troops in depth areas. New Delhi perceives Beijing’s reluctance to disengage despite reminders as an effort to set a new normal at the border.Officials said the third route requires upgrading the Darcha-Padum-Nimu trekking route into a metalled road and building a 4.5 kilometre tunnel under Shingo La on the Darcha-Padum route. The project, which has been in the pipeline for a decade, is scheduled to be completed by the defence ministry within two years.In an effort to ensure that the project meets its two-year deadline, Gadkari’s ministry has proposed that the task to build the tunnel should be given to the company that constructed the 9.02 km tunnel at Rohtang La on the condition that it meets the timeline.According to military commanders, the need to build the third axis was felt as tunnelling would be required under four more high mountain passes on the existing Manali-Leh route if the road has to be kept open throughout the year. The Atal tunnel at Rohtang La on this route has been built at a height of 10,171 feet and is already the world’s longest at this altitude.The four passes that would require tunnels on the existing Manali-Leh route are at higher altitudes: Baralacha La (16,500 feet), Nakee La (15,547 feet), Lachung La (16,616 feet), and Tanglang La (17,480 feet). These passes are only open for traffic between mid-May to mid-November and covered with deep snow remaining part of the year.However, the Darcha-Padum-Nimu route requires only a single 4.5 km tunnel through the 16,570 feet Shingo La between Darcha and Padum to ensure that the road is closed only for two months in winter. Darcha is 147 kilometres from Manali and lies on the highway to Leh after Jispa and Keylong across Rohtang La.The distance between Darcha and Padum is about 148 kilometres with the Zanskar sub-divisional town connected to Kargil via a 230-km long single lane road. Work is already on to construct the Darcha-Padum road with another 260 km road work in progress between Padum and Nimu, the 14 Corps headquarters in Ladakh.“We are looking to build a road that bisects the Leh-Kargil highway around Lamayuru monastery and connects Darcha via Padum. This road will allow Indian military and the local population to get round-the-year supplies… The route is not under the prying eyes of the Pakistan Army as in Kaksar in Kargil district or the DSDBO (Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie) route that is under observation of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA),” said a former army chief.Apart from keeping the supply lines open for the military guarding Siachen, Kargil and DBO sectors, the Darcha-Nimu route will also develop the new union territory of Ladakh to match the aspirations of its people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-steps-up-building-new-snow-free-axis-to-ladakh-amid-china-standoff/story-d3wAm1zGliffOpk76jowON.html

25-08-2020||India||Goans give travel influencer a reality check on tourism during pandemic||Popular Instagram travel influencer ‘ShenazTreasury’ was forced to delete an Instagram post after she faced a backlash and a barrage of comments In a post on Instagram, Shenaz posted a selfie of herself riding pillion on a two wheeler in Anjuna in Goa without a mask. “After five months at home, I feel like a prisoner who’s escaped and found freedom! Goa is open to tourism… most restaurants and hotels are shut and empty. But you can find a few open. There are very few people here, streets are deserted but that’s how I like it especially during covid times,” she said in the post. What followed was a barrage of comments questioning the propriety of travelling during the pandemic and how travellers like herself could be risking the health of the local population since unnecessary travel should be avoided. The adverse comments prompted an apology from the influencer.“... the Goa government has opened its state up for tourism and being a travel content creator, I want to stand by travel. Travel is the most affected industry in this pandemic, I want to support it. I didn’t realise that the locals felt so strongly against having visitors and didn’t want tourists here. Sorry again Goa locals, I understand your perspective,” she said. “I apologise for not wearing a mask in my earlier post. My rationale was that I was in spots that were absolutely empty or in my own hotel with friends who I am travelling with. I do realise that I am setting an example to others and It may seem like I am saying that a mask is not needed in Goa. This is not true. We must be responsible when around others and wear a mask…,” she said. However, many were quick to point out that it is not about a mask, but rather promoting travel during these ‘dangerous’ times was the real problem. “Goa is touching [the] highest numbers everyday, the moment you landed in Goa you have been trying to portray as this place that is carefree and where one can go to escape it all. I’m sorry but is everyone else sitting at home an idiot? We go wanna go for vacation, your posts have done nothing but encourage reckless behaviour during this pandemic. So called influencers should know better,” an Instagram user by the name globetrotter.chika said. “Like me a lot of other Goans depend on the tourism industry for our bread and butter, but at this point when the state is struggling to get things under control we don’t need tourists to come and add fuel to the fire,” kaioo_2396 said. “[Goa is] up and running because the economy of Goa depends on tourism. Also the medical facilities in Goa was on the news for not being able to provide adequate treatment to all its citizens suffering from the disease. Goa is open because we have no other option. Imagine getting tested positive after coming to Goa. The government here cannot even guarantee you adequate treatment. You are gonna put your own lives at risk. Give it time till everything comes back to normal,” Serial_chiller_0_0 another commentator said. However, others pointed out that one couldn’t really blame the influencers or the tourists who chose to travel “Isn’t it the ministers who decided that Goa is open for tourism? If we had collectively bashed them on such decisions, that would have been far more productive than going after an Instagram influencer. Noise like this works brilliantly in favour of these politicians who are then away from the spotlight and free to finish off this state without any sort of questioning or scanner on them,” Shreyas Naique a resident of Goa said. Goa opened for tourism in early July and while arrivals have been very minimal there have been tourists who have chosen to travel -- mainly those who prefer to drive down who have found empty stretches of beach and a few open hotels. But much of Goa’s attractions and nightlife zones remain closed. Goa is reporting over 300 cases each day of the novel coronavirus and has recorded nearly 150 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goans-give-travel-influencer-a-reality-check-on-tourism-during-pandemic/story-DWKsZWvs4TyUADyLAM7XlN.html

25-08-2020||India||‘Set up high-level committee to probe deaths of 2 Covid-19 patients’: DM writes to BHU VC||District magistrate Kaushalraj Sharma has written a letter to Professor Rakesh Bhatnagar, vice-chancellor at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU), urging him to constitute a high-level committee to probe the deaths of two Covid-19 patients who were undergoing treatment at Sir Sundar Lal (SSL) Hospital of the central university.Sharma also said a magisterial inquiry had already been ordered into the two incidents. A two-member team will probe the incidents and submit its report within a fortnight, he added. In the first incident on August 23, a 21-year-old Covid-19 patient allegedly died by jumping off the fourth floor of the SSL hospital where he was admitted, doctors treating said. The kin of the deceased alleged negligence on part of the hospital — a charge denied by the hospital. Hospital medical superintendent Professor SK Mathur said the patient was admitted to the emergency of the SSL hospital on August 16 due to some mental illness. During treatment, his sample was sent for Covid-19 test on August 19 and his report came positive on August 22 following which he was moved to a Covid-19 ward the same day. Also read: Covid-19 patient at BHU hospital disappears, body recovered from premises“He was being treated by experts. The behaviour of the patient was very unusual. He would leave his bed and go to other patients. Even on August 23, the patient made a bid to jump through the window. He was pacified and brought back to the bed. He was given medication and counselled,” Mathur said.In the second incident, the body of a 25-year-old coronavirus patient, who went missing from the Covid-19 ward of the SSL hospital’s super-speciality block two days ago, was recovered from the hospital premises on Monday night, a university official said.Mathur said it appeared that the patient had tried to come down from the second floor of the hospital building with the help of a pipe and fell as the pipe broke. The body was found below after which the hospital staff and security personnel immediately took it to the mortuary. The hospital administration then informed the police.Earlier, an FIR was registered in connection with the patient’s disappearance following a complaint by his family members, inspector Mahesh Pandey, station officer at Varanasi’s Lanka police station, said on Monday. According to the family, the patient had suffered injuries in a road accident on August 11 and was admitted to the BHU trauma centre the same day, the police said. Two days later, his Covid-19 test was done and he tested positive. Thereafter, he was moved to a Covid-19 ward at the super-speciality block of Sir Sundar Lal Hospital. He spoke to his mother on August 22 through the window of the building, the family told the police. At that time, he had pleaded his mother to take him home, the family added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/set-up-high-level-committee-to-probe-deaths-of-2-covid-19-patients-dm-writes-to-bhu-vc/story-hep6nJh7S3ig9YmUgcveuN.html
25-08-2020||India||RBI did not print even one Rs 2,000 note in 2019-20||The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) currency note presses did not print even one Rs 2,000 note in 2019-20. This happened because they did not receive any order to do so. The trend seems to be in keeping with a conscious decision to bring down the share of Rs 2,000 notes in total currency under circulation, which has come down from at least 50% in 2016-17 to just 22% in 2019-20. These figures have been reported in RBI’s Annual Report for 2019-20, which was released on August 25. RBI has also disposed a disproportionate share of Rs 2,000 notes in the soiled category. This raises questions about the government’s plan for the country’s highest denomination currency note. In January 2019, the government indicated that the printing of Rs 2,000 notes was being stopped as there was adequate supply, as reported by Economic Times in January, 2019.“Printing of bank notes of particular denomination is decided by the government in consultation with RBI to maintain the desired denomination mix for facilitating transactional demand of public. No indent was placed with the presses for printing of Rs 2,000 denomination notes for 2019-20.However, there is no decision to discontinue the printing of Rs 2,000 bank notes,” minister of state for finance Anurag Singh Thakur told the Lok Sabha on March 16, 2020.Rs 2,000 notes were introduced after the government announced demonetisation of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes on November 8, 2016. These two denominations accounted for 86% of the total currency in circulation when the policy was announced. The number of Rs 2,000 notes peaked at 3.36 billion units (or pieces) in 2017-18. This number dropped to 3.29 billion in 2018-19. It has fallen again to 2.73 billion in 2019-20. The fall in number of Rs 2,000 notes in circulation is in keeping with the fall in orders for printing Rs 2,000 notes. RBI printed 3.5 billion Rs 2,000 notes in 2016-17. This came down to 151 million in 2017-18 and 47 million in 2018-19. No Rs 2,000 notes were printed in 2019-20. RBI also seems to have disposed of a disproportionately high number of Rs 2,000 notes in 2019-20. A total of 176.8 million pieces of soiled Rs 2,000 notes were disposed of in 2019-20. Just one million Rs 2,000 notes were disposed of in 2018-19 and no Rs 2,000 notes were disposed of in 2016-17 or 2017-18. The share of disposed of Rs 2,000 notes in the total Rs 2,000 notes under circulation in 2019-20 is 6.5%. This number is just 0.6% for Rs 500 notes. Both these notes were introduced together after demonetisation.It is Rs 500 notes which have gained at the cost of the Rs 2,000 notes. More than half of the 22 billion currency notes printed in 2019-20 were of the Rs 500 denomination. As a result of these changes in currency composition, the share of Rs 500 notes has reached an all-time high in the total currency in circulation. A government official said on condition of anonymity that the Rs 2,000 notes were introduced in 2016 to quickly fill the gap created by demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. It was the need of the hour.Gradually, with increased supply of smaller notes, including new notes of Rs 100 and Rs 200, and with growing popularity of digital transactions, the urgency to issue new Rs 2,000 notes is no longer there, the official said.“But, this does not mean that there is any move to discontinue Rs 2,000 notes,” the official added. “Increasingly, commercial banks are also using more and more smaller notes because their customers often find difficulties in getting change for Rs 2,000 notes,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rbi-did-not-print-even-one-rs-2-000-note-in-2019-20/story-E4ho4aqYSZ4URUwwENtEdI.html

Farooq was the son of IC-814 hijacking accused Ibrahim Athar who was in India to execute the Pulwama conspiracy and was killed in March 2019 in an encounter by security forces.Forty Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed in the attack that brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war.Officials say that the charge sheet has irrefutable evidence - technical, material and circumstantial - on Pakistan’s role in the attack. It cites the roles of the JeM leadership and the arrested accused in the attack and has details like chats, calls details of terrorists.NIA probe has revealed that Pakistan used Adil Ahmad Dar, a local resident who rammed an explosive-laden car into a CRPF convoy in Pulwama, as a suicide bomber to project the attack as a result of a home-grown militancy against “India’s occupation of Kashmir”, one of the officers said.Azhar, who founded JeM in 2000 after he was freed from an Indian prison in exchange for 155 passengers of a hijacked aircraft, and Asghar have been named as the primary accused in the charge sheet.Azhar was among those India designated as individual terrorists in 2019. The move came following an amendment to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, which allows the government to designate individuals as terrorists. The US has similar laws for such designations and the 2019 move opened an added avenue for joint action against terrorists.The 19 people named by the NIA in its charge sheet are:1.

25-08-2020||India||Clamour grows around postponement of JEE, NEET; Greta Thunberg favours students: Latest developments||The clamour around postponing the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) and National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) has been growing. Many leaders in India have urged the Centre to postpone these exams, as demanded by the students, in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik is the latest to write a letter seeking postponement of the above entrance exam. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Tamil Nadu leader MK Stalin have already sought its postponement.Here are the latest updates on the controversy:• In a letter to Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on Tuesday, Patnaik said that due to prevailing Covid-19 pandemic situation, it would be highly unsafe and perilous for 50,000 students of the state to visit the test centres physically to appear in these tests. • Famous climate activist Greta Thunberg has also tweeted in support of the students demanding postponement of JEE and NEET. “It’s deeply unfair that students of India are asked to sit national exams during the Covid-19 pandemic and while millions have also been impacted by the extreme floods. I stand with their call to #PostponeJEE_NEETinCOVID,” she tweeted on Tuesday.• Mamata Banerjee had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday seeking postponement of NEET and JEE examinations that are scheduled to be held in September. Banerjee said she had expressed her views against the UGC guidelines that required completing terminal examinations in universities/colleges across the country by the end of September 2020. “My point was that this decision had a huge potential to put students’ lives at risk,” the chief minister said.• In his letter to Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal, DMK president Stalin said that no decision should be made in haste putting the lives of students at stake. “The government should act keeping the well-being and future of students in mind. In the light of the severe difficulties explained above, I sincerely request you to postpone the JEE, NEET until Covid-19 is brought under control,” Stalin said. • The Supreme Court had on Monday declined to pass direction to the central government to hold NEET examination in Gulf countries, but asked the government to allow students to come via Vande Bharat Mission flights to give the exams. A bench of Justice L Nageswara Rao said that the quarantine norms are mandatory for students who would come from the Middle East countries to give exam but allowed petitioners to approach state authorities to seek relaxation.• The top court had on August 17 dismissed a petition seeking postponement of these exams saying precious year of students “cannot be wasted” and life has to go on.• The Medical Council of India recently told the Supreme Court that postponement of the NEET any further shall be a “drastic deviation” from the academic schedule which may affect the subsequent academic years of the students.• Over 4,200 students participated in a day-long hunger strike on Monday demanding the cancellation and postponement of exams. Using the #SATYAGRAHagainstExamInCovid, students took to Twitter to urge the government to heed to their demands.• Around 16 lakh students have registered for NEET this year, while close to 9.3 lakh students had registered for JEE-Mains (Paper I) that was conducted in January. An equal number of students were expected to appear for the second phase of the exam, which are scheduled for April-May each year.• This year, however, owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, the National Testing Agency (NTA) kept postponing the exam dates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clamour-grows-around-postponement-of-jee-neet-greta-thunberg-favours-students-cause/story-X23r2LiBA4O1kiiVIW3eyN.html

25-08-2020||India||Report getting ready to seek flood relief from Centre: Karnataka CM||Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Tuesday said a report was being prepared to secure Centre’s assistance for the flood ravaged parts, as he also expressed confidence that the financial situation of the state would improve in two to three months. The chief minister, who is on a visit to flood-hit districts and to conduct an aerial survey of the situation there, also said, the government was honestly working towards providing relief and rehabilitation to those affected. “Survey is going on regarding the losses, how can we know it immediately? estimates are being worked out. Once that report comes, we will forward it to the Centre to get all possible help. Report is getting ready..,” Yediyurappa said in response to a question. Speaking to reporters at Belagavi, he said, on going back to Bengaluru, after conducting the aerial survey of the affected areas, he will once again discuss with the officials in this connection. The chief minister today reviewed the situation due to recent rains and floods, also relief measures undertaken so far, with the elected representatives and officials of Belagavi and Dharwad districts. Pointing out that due to Covid-19 reasons the state’s economic situation was not good, Yediyurappa said despite this, most probably in the entire country, Karnataka is the only state where there was no disruption in payment of salary to government employees. “The government was also releasing money for developmental works as much as possible, as per the requirement,” he said adding that “most probably in two to three months financial conditions may get better.” The CM assured that his government would honestly work on rebuilding the houses that collapsed last year and this year due to rains and floods, and restore roads and bridges that have seen extensive damages. On crop relief, the chief minister said, he has instructed officials to ensure that there is no misuse and work in this regard should happen with honesty and caution. “I assure that as per central government and NDRF rules whatever is possible, I will honestly work beyond my limits to do it,” he added. The state government had earlier this month said according to the initial assessment Rs 4,000 crore loss has been incurred due to floods.

The party said that their protest is similar to raising questions against Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi who extended their support to the formation of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government.In an editorial in party’s mouthpiece Saamana, Sena said that there is “instability and unease” within the Congress party but it needs to play the role of an active opposition party.Congress’ Jalna MLA Kailash Gorantyal has threatened to go on a hunger strike over constituency development funds. He has claimed support of 10 other Congress legislators without naming any one of them. The MLA added that Congress constituencies are given a step-motherly treatment in the distribution of funds. Gorantyal, who defeated Sena’s Arjun Khotkar, had threatened to resign in January after he was not given a spot in the state cabinet.Also read: Congress turmoil - A look at past instances involving ‘letters’The editorial in the Marathi daily said the MVA government will complete its full five-year term and the opposition party in Maharashtra need not rejoice over the display of resentment.“The situation in the country isn’t all well. There is instability and unease in the Congress party itself. There’s Modi government in power but there’s a need for an active opposition party in a parliamentary democracy. The Congress should play the role of an active opposition party,” it stated.“But instead of questioning the ruling party [at the Centre], the Congress legislators are going on a protest against the government where they are partners. It is their right in a democracy but this is akin to questioning Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi who had given their go-ahead to form the government,” the editorial added.It further stated that Congress ministers in Maharashtra, Balasaheb Thorat, Ashok Chavan, and Nitin Raut, have not spoken publicly on the matter but the three leaders are working to keep the government functioning.“If the Congress legislators are going to sit on a hunger strike then it is the party’s matter to look into. The opposition will get an easy issue and it will add to Congress’ woes. Uddhav Thackeray is capable of resolving political issues,” the editorial said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-slams-congress-mlas-protest-calls-it-akin-to-questioning-sonia-and-rahul/story-OF7xNxbTkfOg8fzWfm5cpJ.html

We have him time to think over and express regret. So what should we do now?” asked Justice Mishra, who is heading the three-judge SC bench.“I think this is one case where Your Lordships should take a compassionate view and forgive him. It will be greatly appreciated at the Bar. He has done a lot of good for the public and the institution,” the A-G said.The bench pointed out that the A-G himself had filed a contempt of court case against Bhushan for a remark that he had misled the court in a case.“I withdrew that case,” said A-G.“Yes, but only after he expressed regret,” said Justice BR Gavai, who is part of the bench.A-G maintained that Bhushan should express regret and the court should close the case.“That will be a fitting end to this case,” he said.The bench took a break for lunch at 1:15 pm and will reassemble at 2 pm, when Bhushan’s counsel is expected to make submissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/warn-bhushan-and-close-the-contempt-case-ag-kk-venugopal-to-sc/story-PqThrOHboxukRCZZP9VpVO.html

The Oxford vaccine showed early promise in the first human trial when it produced an immune response, underlining its position as one of the leading candidates in the race to produce a vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The trial was in the news earlier this week when the Financial Times reported that the Trump administration was considering fast-tracking the vaccine for use in the United States ahead of the November 3 elections. “The process of going through emergency use authorization in an emergency is well established, but it still involves having carefully conducted data... and evidence that it actually works,” Pollard said.The Serum Institute of India (SII) is set to begin its phase II/III clinical trials of the Oxford University-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine candidate, Covishield, to check its efficacy at Pune’s Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University Medical College and Hospital on Tuesday.SII is the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by the number of doses produced and sold globally.

25-08-2020||India||Delhi Court refuses bail to Malvinder Mohan Singh||A Delhi court on Tuesday refused to grant bail to Malvinder Mohan Singh, former promoter of Fortis Healthcare. Malvinder had sought the bail on “parity”, as his brother Shivinder Mohan Singh was granted bail by the Delhi high court (HC) in July. Malvinder had argued that he has been in jail since November, despite the fact the charge sheet has already been filed in the case. However, Nitesh Rana, the counsel for the Enforcement Directorate (ED), opposed his argument. He argued that Malvinder cannot seek parity, as the Supreme Court (SC) had ordered a status quo on Shivinder’s bail. Rana cited the SC order, which had stated that the Delhi HC judgement not to be treated as a precedent for any other case. Shivinder is also lodged in Tihar Jail following his arrest last October. In a charge sheet filed in January, the ED had alleged that the brothers used two sets of “conduit companies” to funnel funds from their finance company Religare Finvest Limited over eight years. A large part of this money was used to buy properties and there was no intention of repaying the sum, the charge sheet said. The Central agency has claimed that out of a total of Rs 47,968 crore of loans given to 115 companies by Religarem Finvest, Rs 2,036.69 crore was moved to 19 companies, which had defaulted in making payments. Most of these funds were used for the personal gain of the Singhs, the charge sheet added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-court-refuses-bail-to-malvinder-mohan-singh/story-Y6tWfMCRR9Em4HPydNODRL.html
25-08-2020||India||Congress turmoil: A look at past instances involving ‘letters’||The Congress in its 134-year-long history had to contend with several letters that centred on major debates and heated arguments. On Monday, the Congress Working Committee – the highest decision-making body of the party -- saw fireworks over a letter written by 23 leaders. A peep into the past throws up several similar incidents.For instance, in 1969, letters were at the centre stage of a tussle between ‘Indicate’ and ‘Syndicate’ that eventually led to the biggest split in the party to date. Also read: Regional BJP leaders say Cong top posts reserved for familyA total of six letters were exchanged between the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and then Congress president S Nijalingappa in October and November 1969 following the defeat of the candidate Neelam Sanjiva Reddy at the hands of VV Giri after Indira’s call for “conscience voting” to party members of Parliament (MPs) and members of legislative assemblies (MLAs). Indira’s responses to Nijalingappa veered around the facts that there is no use in pretending that all’s well, whose echoes are being felt now as the party veterans have red-flagged the need for an “honest introspection”. Another point of Indira’s reply had an uncanny resemblance with what the interim party president Sonia Gandhi told the CWC meeting on Monday, even though the context of the two occasions were markedly different. While Indira’s reply, drafted by her secretary PN Haksar, suggested that in a dynamic party such as the Congress, it must incorporate multiplicity of ideas and attitudes in sync with the nation’s plurality. On Monday, though Sonia expressed unhappiness over the leak of the letter to the media, she conceded that “the Congress is a big family and sometimes people can have different suggestions.” In the end, Sonia gave a clarion call for the party unity. “We are a large family. We have differences and different views on many occasions, but we come together as one. The need of the hour is to fight for the cause of the people and the forces that are failing this country,” she said at the meeting. However, Indira didn’t have that luxury over five decades ago. The 1969 tussle was a battle between two different generations of the Congress, akin to the present situation.But the context of earlier shenanigans was at odds with here and now. “In 1969, it was a battle between a PM and her party that wanted to control her. It bears no resemblance to the current situation,” said a Congress leader. While the 1969 infighting was also a clash of personalities that had turned into a battle of ideologies within the party, no such ideological conflicts exist in the current scenario, despite differences of opinion over strategies.Many in the Congress claimed the intent of the letter brigade was targeted at former party president Rahul Gandhi and his team, as many seniors feel marginalised because of the rise of the younger leaders.In the meeting, many veterans also spoke against the signatories of the letter. Ambika Soni reminded Ghulam Nabi Azad that he could become Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) chief minister because of the Gandhis, while Ahmed Patel slammed Anand Sharma for drafting such a letter. Sharma cited examples of world leaders, who are above 65 years, and hinted that veterans too can play a major role in the party’s affairs. Mukul Wasnik, who defended the letter and argued that it was not against the Gandhi family, also insisted that Congress’s internal communication must improve. Rajiv Satav, a member of the Rajya Sabha (RS), who was recently attacked by the party veterans, hit back and said that he was ashamed that three out of the 23 signatories to the letter are former Indian Youth Congress (IYC) chiefs. While letters had led to intense debates in both 1969 and now, leaders also quickly pointed out that in both the cases, the fight against the Gandhi family had fizzled out and their authority was further consolidated..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-turmoil-a-look-at-past-instances-involving-letters/story-w0qrkUDmSGjzizxdVskWhJ.html

25-08-2020||India||New SC bench to hear 2009 contempt of court case against Prashant Bhushan||A separate bench of the Supreme Court will hear the 2009 contempt of court case against lawyer Prashant Bhushan for his remarks that past Chief Justices of India (CJI) were corrupt.A bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said that since he is retiring on September 2, he will not have adequate time to address the legal questions raised by Bhushan in the matter.“Let the matter be listed before an appropriate bench on September 10 after taking directions from the Chief Justice of India SA Bobde,” said the Justice Mishra-led bench, which also comprised justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari.This case dates back to 2009 when Bhushan called past CJIs corrupt in an interview to Tehelka magazine.Senior advocate Harish Salve brought this statement to the attention of the court based on which contempt action was initiated against him in November 2009.The case was listed by the top court on July 24 over eight years after it was last heard. Bhushan refused to apologise for his statement but offered an explanation to the court.The court on August 10 rejected Bhushan’s explanation and decided to proceed with the case and hear it in detail.When the case was heard on August 17, the court said that certain larger legal issues need to be settled including whether allegations of corruption against judges can be made by way of public statements and the procedure to be adopted when such allegations are raised.When the case was taken up on Tuesday, Bhushan submitted a revised list of legal issues to be considered by the court and also prayed for reference of the matter to the Constitution Bench.“I am short of time. I am demitting office,” justice Mishra remarked.The same Justice Mishra-led bench is slated to hear on Tuesday another contempt of court case against Bhushan for his tweets criticising the top court and the CJI. Bhushan has been held guilty in this case and the court is expected to decide on the punishment to be handed down to Bhushan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-sc-bench-to-hear-2009-contempt-of-court-against-bhushan/story-6TN8vmDtYcs7xI2wu1IFMN.html
25-08-2020||India||‘I feel safer shooting in the hills’||Actor Brijendra Kala had a packed shooting schedule when the lockdown happened. Yet his films like ‘Gulabo Sitabo’ starring Amitabh Bachchan and Ayushmann Khurrana and ‘Ghoomketu’ with Nawazuddin Siddiqui in the lead released on over-the-top (OTT) platforms. During the unlock phase Kala has shot for an Ad film, a film ‘The Last Resort’ in Vadodara and is currently shooting for ‘Samosa & Sons’ at Mukteshwar, Uttarakhand. “It’s a love story and a touching subject on gender issues and traditional rituals. It has Sanjay Mishra and Jeetu Shastri besides others. The film is being directed by Shalini Shah who too hails from the hills comes with Rajesh Shah as DOP,” he said. “I feel it’s much safer to shoot in mountains. The film came as a good outdoor shoot amidst clean air. I am feeling healthy in these serene surroundings though we are shooting with a small crew and taking full precautions due to coronavirus,” the versatile actor said. He has another reason to feel happy about. “One of the main reasons to say yes to the film was that I come from Nauriyal Gaon in Pauri Garhwal. So my roots are in the mountains even though I had grown up in Mathura where my father worked at the veterinary hospital. I make no distinction between UP and Uttarakhand,” he said over phone. Prior to this he shot for film ‘The Last Resort’ in Varodra for 10 days. “We shot it in a resort in isolation and full safety. Before that I shot an advertisement.” The OTT platform, he said, has come as a boon for small-budget filmmakers. “Earlier, filmmakers used to think that a film should be released on the big screen. But it was a problem for small films. But, the success on OTT has given low-budget filmmakers confidence and hopefully it will reduce the mad rush for getting a film released on theatres,” he said. He will be shooting for a big OTT-series in October besides shooting for the fourth season of ‘Aaam Aadmi Family’. Last year, he shot for ‘Ram Prasad Ki Tehari’, ‘Gulabo Sitabo’ and ‘Love Hackers’ in Lucknow. “I was shooting for ‘Sherni’ starring Vidya Balan in Bhopal where lockdown happened. I have also shot for ‘Mere Desh Ki Dharti’ with Devyenndu Sharma, Anand Vidhaat and Anupriya Goenka. In Badaun, I have shot for ‘Sonam Gupta Bewafa Hai’ which has Atul Srivastava and another film that I am doing with him is ‘Mard Ko Dard Hota Hai’.” “In lockdown I have made my family happy by being with them but now my dates are being readjusted for different shoots. The readjustment is a big task. I feel blessed that I am getting enough work despite the pandemic. But I feel bad because due to small units, many crew members have been unemployed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-feel-safer-shooting-in-the-hills/story-9fmzJbdDACwaHEXUVwafqK.html
25-08-2020||India||‘Audience is lapping up rustic, realistic & relatable content’||With a career spanning over 25 years, actor Nitesh Pandey feels now is the right time to experiment with the new stories and content. “I feel the change is happening across mediums of entertainment. OTT has surely narrowed the gap of films — from silver screen to mobile. With exciting web series and digital movies, audiences are getting to watch more rustic, realistic and relatable content, now. And, they are lapping up!” said the versatile actor over the phone. Nitesh feels that television content too will change but it will take its own time, “We have to accept that TV’s reach is very wide and digital content will take long to reach all households in our country. Till then, the content of daily soaps which is primarily larger than life, fantasy based and female-oriented is going to stay. Change will happen but at a very slow pace but cinema is surely changing rapidly.” The actor is known for roles in ‘Pyaar ka Dard Hain…’, ‘Manzilein Apani Apani’, ‘Astitva...’, ‘Saaya’ and ‘Durgesh Nandini’ along with films including ‘Om Shanti Om’, ‘Khosla Ka Ghosla’ and ‘Dabbang 2.’ He was last seen in OTT series ‘Maharaj Ki Jai Ho’, a science-fiction sitcom. “Initially the show was launched on TV in March but due to some issues it was taken off air. It was then streamed on OTT and did exceptionally well. I played king Dhritrasthra, as the show travelled in Mahabharat era through time machine. The response we got was phenomenal even from abroad. It was then I realised the power of digital space.” Though Nitesh hails from Almora, Uttarakhand and has grown up in Mumbai, he has a strong connect with Lucknow too. His wife writer-actor Arpita Pandey is granddaughter of legendary author Amritlal Nagar. Telling more about his city connect, Nitesh said, “I am from the lineage of known poet Sumitranandan Pant. He was my maternal grandfather’s brother. He and Amritlalji were great friends. That is how our connection happened and we got married 17 years back. I got married in Lucknow only (2003) but now my in-laws have shifted to Mumbai near to us.” In Covid times he is happy man shooting for two shows simultaneously. “I’m playing Hansmukh in upcoming daily soap ‘India Wali Maa’. I play husband to Suchita Tiwari who essays the role of the Maa. The show is based on relationship of parents with their son. I am also shooting for another TV show ‘Hero’ which will probably go on air next month. Thankfully both the sets are very close so it’s easy for me. It’s a blessing to get work in such tough times. Sadly, since the budgets have been slashed big time so actors are also facing major remuneration cut,” he shared. Nitesh has also acted in yet to release movie ‘WingMan’ which has Shashank Arora in lead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/audience-is-lapping-up-rustic-realistic-relatable-content/story-GaAkZyUZGTbW2VIlldaTjO.html
25-08-2020||India||This Bareilly girl is surely going places||Hailing from Bareilly, actor Shrashti Maheshwari started acting at a tender age of 12. “I have always been a child who loved extracurricular activities — be it sports, acting or dancing. Thankfully, my parents supported me in all my big or small endeavours,” said the actor. Seeing her inclination towards acting Shrashti’s mother took her to Rangvinayak Rangmandal/Windermere Theatre. “It was there that well-known director and writer Ranjit Kapoor, who had come for an event, saw me as I was waiting for the auditions in my school uniform. I remember him telling me, ‘Try karo beta you never know what works — maybe you go a long way’.” She did number of national as well as international plays before landing into TV. “I learnt a lot at that time as I used to volunteer for all plays happening while I was associated with the theatre group. I got numerous chances to perform with the teams from National School of Drama. By the time I was 14, I have a long list of plays both national as well as international. Travelling and performing across the country gave me the right exposure and I learnt a lot in terms of acting,” said the young actor over the phone. Shrashti wants to join army and is still trying her best to fulfil her dream. “I dream to be an army officer and will be appearing for defence examination this year whenever it gets scheduled. My parents have been my strength and this is what I want to do for them. However, acting is something I truly enjoy and love being on stage as well as on screen. I remember participating in ‘Big Fame’ and being only one from the city to be selected. After that, I got a chance to be the part of the reality show ‘Bigg Boss’ season 7. I was not a housemate but appeared as ‘Pari’ on Sunday episodes. That small fun part actually made me popular and soon more shows followed.” . She has been part of several TV serials like ‘Thapki Pyaar Ki’, ‘Do Dil Bandhe Ek Dori Se’, ‘Dil Ko Aaj Fir Jine Ki Tammanna Hai’, ‘Khauff’, ‘Yeh Hai Aashiqui’, ‘Aladdin Naam Toh Suna Hoga’ and ‘Divya Drishti’ besides film ‘Shaadi Teri Bajayenge Hum Band’ (2018). Soon Shrashti will be seen in the ongoing TV show ‘Tujhse Hai Raabta’. Telling us about her role she said, “The show will take a five-year leap and my character ‘Avni’ will make an entry to take the story forward. I am glad the makers chose me to play this important role. It will be a fresh challenge for me and something that viewers will enjoy too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/this-bareilly-girl-is-surely-going-places/story-wRv3ZfQA4NNI5qPC2tNlNI.html

25-08-2020||India||Ready for any probe, says Uttarakhand BJP MLA accused of rape||Uttarakhand BJP MLA Mahesh Singh Negi who has been accused of rape by a woman, met the party’s state unit chief Bansidhar Bhagat on Monday evening to present his version of the case.Negi had been summoned along with three other party MLAs mired in controversies. The lawmaker has been accused of rape and fathering a child by a married woman earlier this month following which the Dehradun police is carrying an investigation. The woman has also been demanding a DNA test of Negi and her daughter to prove her allegations. A party office-bearer who was privy to the details of the meeting between Negi and Bhagat said, “After reaching Bhagat’s residence, he spoke to him on the ongoing matter and said that he is ready for any sort of investigation.” “However, he also said that the accusations by the woman are a part of a conspiracy by Congress to frame him. He is trying to gather evidence on that and will soon present them to prove that Congress is behind the episode,” said the party leader who did not wish to be named. Bansidhar Bhagat said, “The matter is under investigation by police at present. We will wait for the probe to be over. If Negi turns out to be guilty, then strict action will be taken against him as the party never compromises on discipline.” Negi could not be contacted despite several attempts. The Opposition Congress has meanwhile, attacked BJP and its state government for not taking any action against Negi. Congress state president Pritam Singh said, “The accusations leveled by the woman against him are very serious. She has been demanding a DNA test to reveal the truth but so far nothing has been done on that because of the government’s inaction.” “CM Trivendra Singh Rawat a few days ago said that Negi is ready for a DNA test but it is done as per a legal procedure. But, CM is forgetting that he is also the home minister of state. Who is stopping him from initiating the legal procedure to direct a DNA test?” “If Negi is proved to be the father of the woman’s daughter in the test, then strict action should be taken against him. And if it’s not, then stern action should be taken against the woman,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-for-any-probe-says-uttarakhand-bjp-mla-accused-of-rape/story-Zr7oCtcSBoI5kKCPPSb5MJ.html

Counselling sessions should also be conducted and teachers should be in regular touch with parents as well,” states the circular which dated August 24.While several teachers have found students adapting to online classes well, the Bombay University and College Teachers’ Union (BUCTU) has called this move “far from reality”, especially in the case of students in rural Maharashtra. “MU is assuming all students are sitting in their homes in Mumbai and other big cities but what about students stuck in their hometowns in rural Maharashtra with no electricity at present to even charge their phones, mostly due to the incessant rains?” asked one of the members of the BUCTU.Previously, the MU had released a circular on August 2 addressed to all affiliated colleges. It stated that with the completion of admissions for all batches, except first-year undergraduate and postgraduate graduate courses, colleges should start virtual lectures only for the new academic year August 7 onwards.Several teacher organisations from across the state had raised objection to this sudden decision by the university, especially amid lack of clarity given by the varsity about how these classes would be conducted for students stuck in their hometowns in rural Maharashtra due to the ongoing lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-university-issues-new-circular-on-online-classes/story-KFYpISyr6YqBrZYyO5BUbI.html

According to the details of 13,500 page charge sheet filed in a Special NIA court in Jammu, Umar Farooq (who was killed in an encounter by security forces on March 29 last year) had prepared two jerry can based IEDs – weighing 160 kg and 40 kg respectively – comprising gelatin sticks, ammonium nitrate, ammonium powder and RDX, and the same were fitted in the Maruti Eeco car by February 6, 2019 morning itself. As exclusively reported by HT on March 4 this year, the JeM had earlier planned to carry out the attack in first week of February 2019 itself but it had to postpone its plans as the highway was closed due to heavy weather and convoy movements had stopped. While the RDX was smuggled to India from Pakistan, other explosives were collected by JeM operatives and overground workers from local stone quarries, NIA probe has revealed. Umar Farooq (24), according to NIA, was the son of Ibrahim Athar, Azhar’s younger brother who along with four others had hijacked the IC-814 Indian Airlines flight in December 1999 after which India had to release the JeM chief. Farooq was especially sent to India in April 2018 to execute a spectacular attack for which he did extensive planning and made all the arrangements. In its charge sheet, NIA has included all his chats with his uncles Rouf Asghar and Ammar Alvi, in which they were continuously giving directions before, during and after the attack. Forty Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed in the attack that brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war. Officials say that the charge sheet has irrefutable evidence - technical, material and circumstantial - on Pakistan’s role in the attack. It cites the roles of the JeM leadership and the arrested accused in the attack and has details like chats, calls details of terrorists. ALSO WATCH | Car with 60 kg explosives intercepted in Pulwama, major attack averted NIA probe has revealed that Pakistan used Adil Ahmad Dar, a local resident who rammed an explosive-laden car into a CRPF convoy in Pulwama, as a suicide bomber to project the attack as a result of a home-grown militancy against “India’s occupation of Kashmir”, one of the officers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pulwama-attack-nia-to-file-charge-sheet-today-name-masood-azhar-pakistan/story-8u6QpknoF619Gr8jRzNISI.html

Cases of vector borne diseases have also been reported from several districts. “There is a warning of heavy rains. Some places have already got inundated and rivers are flowing above the danger level. We must plan for the flood keeping in mind the Covid-19 situation,” Baneerjee said at an administrative review with officials of four districts in south Bengal on Monday. While North 24 Parganas, the second most populous district in India after Thane in Maharashtra, has registered a high positivity rate of 20.6% which is double the national average, the death rate in North 24 Parganas and Howrah is 2.7% and 2.2% respectively compared to the national average of less than 2%. Dengue is another major worry and every year many cases are reported from densely populated areas of North 24 Parganas. This year such incidents have been low so far.The two coastal districts of North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas have already been affected by heavy rains. There have been breaches in river embankments and water has gushed into the villages inundating some villages. There are fears that Howrah and Hooghly will get affected when the Damodar Valley Corporation releases water. “Even if there is heavy rain in Jharkhand and the Damodar Valley Corporation releases water, large areas in Howrah and Hooghly may get inundated. In some areas water may also enter hospitals,” Banerjee said, asking district officials to plan accordingly keeping in mind the Covid-19 pandemic situation. Some districts in north Bengal including Malda, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar have also been asked to stay on alert as they may be affected due to heavy rain in Bihar and Nepal. “The districts have been asked to set up 24X7 control rooms to monitor the flood situation during the Covid pandemic. The control rooms would be set up in the offices of district magistrate and superintendents of police,” said a senior official who was present in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-braces-for-three-pronged-assault-of-covid-flood-and-dengue/story-fQSj8OwPcwOIF9kfnjXbWN.html

India’s Covid-19 total recoveries crossed 2.4 million as 66,550 patients were discharged between Monday and Tuesday morning.With this the recovery rate is now at 75.91%, which the government has attributed to “effective implementation of the policy of testing aggressively, tracking comprehensively”.“Effective clinical management of the patients in the ICUs has been instrumental in keeping the Case Fatality Rate low and on a steady downward trajectory. It has further dipped to 1.85% today,” the ministry said on Monday.Delhi may be facing a fresh challenge to control an outbreak it had contained to a considerable extent, data has shown. The Covid-19 positivity rate has started rising again in Delhi, with 7.4% of all tests conducted in the last week coming back positive, the highest this number has touched in over a month.Experts say positivity rate shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and when coupled with an increase in new cases, indicates that the virus is spreading fast.India has tested more than 3.5 crore people for Covid-19 so far, resolutely following its ‘TEST TRACK TREAT’ strategy, the health ministry also said on Tuesday morning.However, India’s daily testing for Covid-19 dropped sharply on Sunday, as 609,917 tests were conducted, the lowest in two weeks, according to health ministry data.

25-08-2020||India||Lucknow’s KGMU pins hopes on asymptomatic donors for Covid-19 plasma therapy||King George’s Medical University (KGMU) has started obtaining plasma from asymptomatic people for transfusion to Covid-19 patients in different hospital. Although these donors have developed antibodies for the Sars-Cov-2 virus, they have never tested positive for the Covid-19 infection earlier nor were they hospitalised.The medical university is understood to be the first institute in Uttar Pradesh to resort to this method. It had earlier given the plasma of cured Covid-19 patients to those under treatment for the disease.“We took plasma from five people after antibodies (for the virus) were found. Their antibody levels were good enough. Their plasma can be transfused to Covid-19 patients in the hospital. They never tested positive (for the coronavirus infection earlier), neither were they admitted for Covid-19 treatment,” Prof Tulika Chandra, head of the department of transfusion medicine at KGMU, said on Tuesday, Also read: More than 700 have been administered plasma therapy for Covid-19 in DelhiPlasma therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from Covid-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to boost the immune system to fight the disease.Out of the five asymptomatic plasma donors, the antibody level in three was higher than the normal range. For the two others, the level was within the range.Antibody test was conducted to check if the person ever had Covid-19 infection and whether she or he recovered as an asymptomatic patient.Till now, 59 people have donated plasma. Five of the donors were asymptomatic people and the remaining by cured Covid-19 patients, who were admitted in hospital and then discharged.“Hopefully, as the second option of getting plasma from asymptomatic people is open now, donations will go up manifold in a few days and we shall be able to help more patients in the state,” said Prof Chandra.She said efforts will be made to get plasma donation from regular voluntary blood donors if they have antibodies for coronavirus.For this, blood donors will be tested for antibodies. If antibodies are found, they will be motivated to go for plasma donation.“They are coming for donation themselves. Hopefully, they will agree to donate plasma instead of whole blood. This will be done at the same blood bank. So, it will hardly make a difference to the donors,” said Prof Chandra.“But certainly this will increase the stock of plasma with antibodies manifold,” she said.Asymptomatic Covid-19 patients, who test positive for antibodies, can volunteer for plasma donation. Besides, other voluntary blood donors will be tested for antibodies. If antibodies for the virus are found, these people will be asked to donate plasma, instead of whole blood.Every day between 50 and 100 blood donors go to the KGMU blood bank to obtain blood for a patient and donate a unit in exchange. The number includes voluntary blood donors. All of them will be tested for antibodies.“Even if we get four blood donors a day, who test positive for antibodies, we hope it will be a good number for plasma donation. This will be apart from those who got treated for Covid-19 and came for plasma donation,” said Prof Chandra.She said a shift from whole blood donation to plasma in some cases will make ‘no or very little’ impact on the stock of blood units at the blood bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lucknow-s-kgmu-pins-hopes-on-asymptomatic-donors-for-covid-19-plasma-therapy/story-7MXOsJSRz7IruMTAkuCBKI.html

It has entered a manufacturing partnership with AstraZeneca to produce the vaccine.Also read: 172 countries engaging with global Covid-19 vaccine plan, says WHOAccording to the Clinical Trials Registry of India, 17 sites have been selected to conduct the phase II/III trials, observer-blind, randomized, controlled study, to check the safety and immune response of the vaccine candidate among healthy Indian adults.Around 1,600 adults above 18 are expected to be recruited for the trials across India. Dr Prasad Kulkarni will be the principal investigator for SII and spearhead the process.On August 3, India’s drugs controller gave approval to SII for conducting phase II and III clinical trials of the vaccine candidate in the country. The results of its phase I trial held in the UK had shown promise in generating an immune response against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.Covishield will be administered as a two-dose schedule on days 1 and 29 as 0.5 ml dose intramuscularly. Placebo will be administered as a two-dose schedule on days 1 and 29 as 0.5 ml dose intramuscularly.The vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold adenovirus taken from chimps and genetically modified.Even though confirming that the trial process has started, representatives of SII have been declining to divulge more details regarding the development.In a statement issued on Sunday, SII said, “The phase-3 trials for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine are still underway. And only once the vaccine is proven immunogenic and efficacious, SII will confirm its availability, officially. COVISHIELD will be commercialized once the trials are proven successful and all the requisite regulatory approvals are in place. …Presently, the government has granted us permission to only manufacture the vaccine and stockpile it for future use.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serum-institute-to-begin-phase-2-trial-of-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-today/story-mTOqPWxtLKp3IldyyA9zeK.html
25-08-2020||India||SC grants bail to 77-year-old rape accused on DNA evidence||The Supreme Court on Monday granted bail to a 77-year old retired Army pensioner from West Bengal accused of raping a 13-year old girl after the DNA report showed that he was not the father of the child born to the rape survivor.A division bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul overturned a June 5 order of Calcutta High Court in this regard after the state government conceded before the Supreme Court that the DNA report showed that the accused, Jayanta Chatterjee, was not the father of the child as claimed by the survivor.“In view of the aforesaid, we have no hesitation in saying that the petitioner (Chatterjee) should be enlarged on bail on the terms and conditions to the satisfaction of the trial court,” the bench which also comprised Justice Ajay Rastogi said.“The petitioner was falsely implicated by the father of the victim because of personal enmity on account of a landlord-tenant dispute between them. The DNA test did not match with the accused meaning thereby that the petitioner was not the father of the child. Therefore, the court granted bail,” Chatterjee’s lawyer, Jayant Mohan told HT.A case was registered against Chatterjee on May 11 at the Matigara police station based on the complaint by one Dilip Karmakar, the father of the rape survivor. Karmakar had alleged that his daughter had showed unnatural behaviour and on questioning, the girl revealed that Chatterjee had raped and impregnated her. Chatterjee was charged for offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POSCO) and was arrested on May 12. He was remanded to judicial custody on May 26. The rape survivor gave birth to a baby girl on July 5.Chatterjee had contended before the Supreme Court that Karmakar, who was his tenant, was neither paying the monthly rent nor vacating the premises and the false complaint was filed to incarcerate Chatterjee.He had also repeatedly raised the argument before the high court and top court that he is incapable of sexual activity since he is 84 years old. The state government had, however, submitted that Chatterjee was only 77 years old as per official records.“The ludicrousness of the allegations are rife on the face of it considering the age of the petitioner. As per the well-established principles of medical jurisprudence, such allegations are improbable due to the age of the petitioner and due to ailments of diabetes and high blood sugar (which the petitioner is suffering from),” the plea stated.The petitioner had also requested for a DNA test to prove his innocence. The Supreme Court after hearing Chatterjee’s lawyer, senior counsel Kapil Sibal, had ordered a DNA test on July 9.With the DNA test absolving Chatterjee, he also claimed compensation against Karmakar for filing a false case.“Senior counsel for the petitioner (Chatterjee) further submits that it is out of a landlord-tenant dispute that a false case has been filed and that he should be given appropriate compensation. If that be the position, it is for the appellant to take necessary steps in this behalf in accordance with law claiming compensation in accordance with law,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-grants-bail-to-77-year-old-rape-accused-on-dna-evidence/story-QA8hi6fi4fIITGntqKTlGI.html

25-08-2020||India||Eight assembly seats vacant in Uttar Pradesh, EC to decide on bypolls||Uttar Pradesh may witness a mini-assembly election of sorts in the coming months if the Election Commission (EC) decides to hold bypolls to eight vacant seats in the state assembly along with the Bihar elections.Five of these eight seats fell vacant after the death of sitting members.“The Election Commission of India has to take a call about holding by-polls to the eight assembly seats. As of now, we have no information about the possible timing of the bypolls,” said a senior officer. A bypoll to a vacant seat in the state assembly is generally held within six months from the date of vacancy. However, EC has not yet given any indication about holding these bypolls. “For seats, where the six-month time period is complete, EC has given a certificate, saying a decision about holding the bypoll there will be taken later,” said the officer. Legal expert CB Pandey, a former advisor to the governor, said, “Yes, EC should ideally hold an election to a vacant seat in six months. The poll panel can defer the elections in special circumstances like Covid-19 or any other reasons. These vacancies have no impact on the state assembly.” The Uttar Pradesh assembly has a strength of 403 members. The five members who died include two ministers Kamal Rani Varun, who held the Ghatampur seat in Kanpur Nagar district, and Chetan Chauhan, who represented Amroha’s Naugawan Sadat assembly constituency.While Varun died on August 2 after contracting Covid-19, Chetan Chauhan succumbed to the disease on August 16. BJP’s Janmejaya Singh (Deoria Sadar) died on August 21 and Veerendra Singh Sirohi (Bulandshahr) passed away on March 2. Samajwadi Party’s Paras Nath Yadav, who represented Malhani in Jaunpur, died on June 12. The other seats declared vacant include the one that had been held by BJP member Kuldeep Singh Sengar (Bangarmau, Unnao) who was disqualified following the life sentence awarded to him in a rape case. His seat has been declared vacant with effect from December 20, 2019. The Swar seat was declared vacant with effect from December 16, 2019 after the Allahabad high court declared the election of Samajwadi Party’s Mohammad Abdullah Azam invalid. Earlier, the Tundla assembly seat of Firozabad was declared vacant on June 4 following the resignation of former UP minister SP Singh Baghel when he was elected to the Lok Sabha from Agra. The Election Commission also will have to take a call about holding the biennial election to 11 seats of the Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Parishad. The term of 11 MLCs from graduate and teachers constituency of the state legislative council ended on May 6. Another seat fell vacant in the council following disqualification of former Bahujan Samaj Party leader Naseemuddin Siddiqui, who had switched loyalties to the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eight-assembly-seats-vacant-in-uttar-pradesh-ec-to-decide-on-bypolls/story-3QWijJzDxkgzGQQ0VcWJMI.html

Justice Arun Mishra said the matter can be listed before an appropriate bench on September 10.The Supreme Court is also expected to pronounce its order on Tuesday on the sentence to be imposed on senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan in the contempt of court case against him for criticising the Supreme Court and the CJI on Twitter in late June this year.The top court had on August 20 asked Bhushan to reconsider his stance and offer an apology for the tweets he made criticising it and Chief Justice of India, SA Bobde by Monday while hearing on the sentence to be awarded to him. The court had on August 14 ruled that Bhushan was guilty of contempt of court.Bhushan had on Monday refused to tender an apology and said in a supplementary statement it would be “contempt of conscience.”“An apology cannot be a mere incantation and any apology has to be sincerely made. If I retract a statement before this court that I otherwise believe to be true or offer an insincere apology, that in my eyes would amount to the contempt of my conscience and of an institution (Supreme court ) that I hold in highest esteem,” his statement submitted through advocate Kamini Jaiswal read.The case against Bhushan was filed on July 5 and the court had pronounced its verdict on August 14.The Supreme Court had given the senior advocate till August 24 to reflect on his statement and asked him to tender an apology within the given time. It can now begin proceedings to punish the senior advocate for criminal contempt of court. He faces up to six months in jail or a fine of Rs 2,000 or both.Bhushan had said on August 20 that the judgment was not delivered based on any evidence and highlighted that the statements made by him were directed towards the benefitting the nation.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-prashant-bhushan-s-contempt-case-deadline-for-apology-ends-today/story-4sOsINWxfGYtyMH3DK8V8K.html

In such cases, more time might be required, if a notice is issued to ascertain certain details, he added.The official said proper verification of the commercial premises and other details are required to keep the fake and fraudulent entities out of the GST mechanism.In both cases, the tax authorities need to act within a specified time frame. It would take three days for a person opting for Aadhaar authentication, and 21 days for those opting not to undergo the verification, he said. “An application shall be deemed to be approved, if no notice for rejection is issued after the stipulated time frame,” he added.The new mechanism of Aadhaar-based GST registration was approved in the 39th meeting of the GST Council held on March 14 for new taxpayers.The mechanism, which aims to enhance the ease of doing business, could not be implemented immediately following the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak that prompted an imposition of nation-wide lockdown restrictions from March 25 that were in place for over 60 days, he said.He said the person, who applies for GST registration, would get options of verification either through Aadhaar or in the physical form. If the person opts for Aadhaar authentication, a link would be shared on the promoter’s registered mobile number and email ID. Upon clicking the authentication link, a screen would come up with a declaration, where the applicant needs to enter an Aadhaar number and click to validate. On successful matching of the details, a one-time password (OTP) would be sent in the registered email and mobile number. On entering the OTP, the validation would be complete and a message of successful electronic-know your customer (e-KYC) authentication would pop up.If the person does not opt for Aadhaar-based authentication, his registration application would be sent to the jurisdictional tax authority that may carry out necessary documentary and physical site verification before approving the registration, he said.“The facility of quick approval of GST registration through Aadhaar authentication can be availed by all Indian nationals,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-aadhaar-to-get-gst-registration-in-just-three-days/story-65e3z5ttuGqg66n9I6Ef1K.html

Professor SK Mathur, medical superintendent of the hospital, said it appeared that the patient had tried to come down from the second floor of the hospital building with the help of a pipe and as the pipe broke, the patient fell. The body was found below, after which the hospital staff and security personnel immediately took it to the mortuary. The hospital administration has informed the police. Earlier, an FIR was registered in connection with the patient’s disappearance following a complaint by his family members, inspector Mahesh Pandey, station officer at Varanasi’s Lanka police station, said on Monday. According to the family, the patient had suffered injuries in a road accident on August 11 and was admitted to the BHU trauma centre the same day, said the police.

They are also empowered to draw the CVC authorities’ attention to corruption complaints against officials that may necessitate a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The CVC has repeatedly reminded government departments to carry out their disciplinary proceedings on time.A July 2018 letter written by CVC to all departments stated that “the unexplained delays lead to Central Administrative Tribunals (CATs) and the high courts (HCs) quashing the charge sheet (s) on the sole ground that the disciplinary authorities concerned had issued charge sheets to the delinquents (officer under investigation) after very long periods of commission of alleged misconduct etc and also for unexplained delays in conducting disciplinary enquiries.“More so, such long delays in finalising disciplinary matters are not unjust to officials, who may be finally exonerated, but helps the guilty to evade punitive action,” the CVC had said.The time limit for completion of a department enquiry is six months from the date of appointment of the IO.However, a study by the CVC in 2016 had stated that the average time taken by the administrative authorities in finalisation of disciplinary proceedings is more than two years and the maximum time taken in a particular case was eight years and in at least 22% of the cases, the probe took over two years.In a directive issued in May, the new CVC, Sanjay Kothari, had also instructed all ministries and government departments to conduct internal investigations or disciplinary proceedings against government officials much before they are due to retire.CVC is a statutory body and derives its powers from the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2013. It is free of control from any executive authority and has the responsibility of monitoring all vigilance activities in the federal government besides advising various authorities on planning, executing, reviewing and reforming their vigilance work. A major part of its work is to refer important corruption activities to CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cvc-asks-cvos-to-complete-disciplinary-proceedings-through-video-conferencing-to-avoid-delays/story-QImGXopBIhSipEdKdo2VQM.html

25-08-2020||India||Opposition, experts rue lack of question hour in Rajasthan Assembly||The Rajasthan Assembly session, which began on August 14, was adjourned sine die on Monday after three sittings but without the question and zero hours. The Opposition legislators were prompt to say that the sole purpose of the session was to prove the government’s majority. Experts said if lawmakers cannot hold the government to account in Assembly, it was was a dangerous trend for democracy.  The government and the Assembly management said the question and zero hours were disallowed in view of the coronavirus pandemic.  The Assembly session convened on August 14 when the Ashok Gehlot government moved and won the confidence motion by voice vote. This followed more than a month-long political turmoil arising out of the rebellion by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 other Congress MLAs.  Also read: Did he say it or did he not? Rahul’s remarks on letter writers create flutterThe Assembly was adjourned until August 21 and when it reconvened that day, there was only discussion on Covid-19 situation in the state, no question or zero hour was allowed. The same happened on Monday, during the third sitting of the Assembly when 13 bills were passed in the House but no discussion on them took place even as the Opposition boycotted the business advisory committee’s (BAC) meeting over five bills tabled on Monday itself. The government tabled eight bills on August 21 and five on Monday; all were passed amid protest by the Opposition. Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria said they didn’t have enough time to study the new bills. The Opposition also staged a walkout. BJP MLA Kalicharan Saraf, who is a member of the BAC, said, “Not holding question and zero hour is unjustified. It is happening only because the government has the mandate. We protested in the BAC meeting, too. The government wanted to have this assembly session only for the trust vote and is unconcerned about public issues.” Two other BJP MLAs echoed the sentiment.   Pratap Singh Singhvi said it is in the question and zero hour that lawmakers could grill ministers over issues of public interest. “The state is in the grip of locust invasion, parents are protesting over school fee, there’s the issue of unemployment – there was so much that we wanted to discussed but the session became a mere formality,” he said. Jogeshwar Garg accused the government of misusing its mandate in the BAC. “It called the session for its own requirement,” he added.  According to the Assembly website, there are around 1,200 questions for the session, including the starred ones. Twenty-five starred questions were listed on Monday. Assembly Speaker CP Joshi said everyone wanted the session to be longer but the BAC decided against it because of the rising number of Covid-19 cases. “There was no intention to prevent the Opposition from raising questions and seeking a reply from the government but the question and zero hour would have led to the inflow of more people in the Assembly,” he said in the House. “No state assembly across the country is holding question or zero hour because of this,” he added. The speaker said that in Bihar, a one-day session happened and around 13 bills were passed. Even in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, the speaker will take a call to take question hour or not.   “The session will be called again once the situation improves and all issues will be discussed,” the Speaker said while addressing the House.   Chief whip Mahesh Joshi also blamed the pandemic for not holding question and zero hour. “During these, department officials and staff are required to be in the Assembly and we wanted to prevent the flow of more people,” he said. But political commentator Narayan Bareth said that in the democratic system, questions are most important as they hold the government to account. “There is no democracy if there aren’t questions,” he said. “It’s not about the Congress or the BJP; they both are equal. It’s a dangerous trend of not addressing questions,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-experts-rue-lack-of-question-hour-in-rajasthan-assembly/story-I6Ba3rd8JOqAtL1EkITaeJ.html

Along with this, instructions have been given to keep a watchful eye on anti-social elements in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-no-public-functions-religious-gatherings-in-up-till-september-30/story-nZdyx9bkTTmqkuH0QWMScL.html

25-08-2020||India||Delhi BJP asks Anna Hazare to join its ‘mass movement’ against AAP govt||Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta on Monday wrote to social activist Anna Hazare, urging him to join his party’s “mass movement” against the government led by AAP, which he alleged was the “new name of social, political and economic corruption”.  In his letter, Gupta alleged that the AAP government has demolished all parameters of “political purity” and also accused it of “planning” the northeast Delhi riots in February, which had left at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.“The Aam Aadmi Party, which came to the government in the name of clean and fair politics, has demolished all the parameters of political purity,” Gupta wrote in his letter to Hazare.No immediate reaction on Gupta’s letter was available from the AAP. The AAP has launched a sustained attack on the BJP, levelling allegations of corruption in the three municipal corporations ruled by the party and also in connection with the riots in the city.The two sides have been hitting out at each other on a range of issues, including corruption, waterlogging and civic amenities in the city along with the riots, in the run up to the civic body polls due in 2022.  “The people of Delhi have suffered the communal riots planned by the AAP,” Gupta said in his letter.Senior AAP leader Saurabh Bhardwaj had recently hit out at the BJP, accusing it of “orchestrating” the riots in Delhi.“Aam Aadmi Party is the new name of social, political and economic corruption and we are constantly fighting against them. Therefore, we request Anna Hazare to come to Delhi and raise voice against corruption and support us in the movement.“The voice of Anna Hazare will have to be raised again for the relief of the youth and for people of Delhi who feel betrayed by the the Kejriwal government,” Gupta said.  Kejriwal was a frontline leader of the anti-corruption movement launched by Anna Hazare from Ramleela ground in Delhi in 2011.  Later, Kejriwal and his supporters joined active politics and formed the AAP which formed government thrice in Delhi and also emerged as the main opposition party in Punjab Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-bjp-asks-anna-hazare-to-join-its-mass-movement-against-aap-govt/story-ePcHcdMZ50znqVvCnp9NSM.html

25-08-2020||India||Delhiwale: A human solo||It is late in the night — about 10.30pm. The traffic has thinned down. Swiftly darting his eyes around, the man rests his gaze upon a young passerby by the roadside. He walks up to him, and whispers in English, “Brother, don’t take offence but I see that you are very lucky.” The passerby stares at him for a moment, looking puzzled, and goes away with quick steps. The man lowers his head, and then raises his eyes, staring around suspiciously. He finally sits down on a bench, here on this central Delhi street.“I’m in a very dire situation at the moment,” Sanjeev says. In dusty blue jeans and long whitish kurta, he has a green scarf hanging around his neck. His beard is scraggly. He has drooping shoulders; his eyes are sunken. Sitting away from the orange glow of the street lamp, he is reduced to his silhouette.“I collect money from passers-by,” he says in fluent English. “These are donations so that I can take care of my daily food.”Taking out a packet from his kurta, Sanjeev says, “If you don’t mind, try these.”Over Parle-G biscuits, Sanjeev gives clues about his life:• He is from Benares, UP.• He was born in 1965.• He is a graduate in Sociology.• He was employed in a TV manufacturing company.• He has parents, two brothers, a wife and a son. They all live in Benares.• He came to Delhi 20 years ago.He says, “I’m in no position to go back to Benares… for economic and maintenance (sic) reasons.”Can’t his family be a support?He answers vaguely, muttering: “Time passes.”During the day, Sanjeev sleeps under the shade of a bus stop. In the evening, he collects “donations” for a few hours and stays awake, alone. He says he has no friends.For 10 years, he worked as a repairer in a television manufacturing company. His job would take him to different states but once every month he would come to the company’s Delhi head-office to get his pay cheque. When Sanjeev lost his job and returned to Benares, his parents married him off. A year later he had a son. Soon afterwards, he left home for reasons he asks not to share publicly. “So many years have gone by since then. I haven’t seen them all this while. In fact, I came to Delhi because it is such a big city. No one can find you here if you want to be lost.“Does he regret leaving his family?“Brother, there is a saying in Hindi: Apno ki do baat nahi bardasht kar sakte. Baad mein lakhon gairon ki baatien bardasht karte hain.[While we will never tolerate even two minor barbs from our loved ones,We are later ready to tolerate far nastier words by strangers.]”He now walks away, probably in search of “donations”, his eyes darting around.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-a-human-solo/story-tiydsK6GbtjQvONSwl0L9L.html
25-08-2020||India||Narada case: ED issues notices to 5 TMC leaders||The Enforcement Directorate on Monday sent notices to five Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders and summoned a suspended Indian Police Service officer in connection with the 2016 Narada sting operation case. An ED official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the leaders – Lok Sabha members Saugata Roy and Kakali Ghosh Dastidar, former Lok Sabha member Aparupa Poddar, minister Suvendu Adhikari and TMC leader Ratna Chatterjee -- have been asked to furnish details of property owned by their families. Chatterjee’s husband, the former Kolkata mayor Sovon Chatterjee, is also an accused in this case. The case is also being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). While Saugata Roy and Suvendu Adhikari said they would reply after receiving ED notices, the other three leaders were not immediately available for comments. The case pertains to a controversy that erupted in March 2016 after Narada News portal uploaded a series of videos purportedly showing a number of high-profile TMC leaders receiving money in exchange for favours to a fictitious company. The CBI filed an FIR in the case on March 16, 2017, acting on a Calcutta high court order, which was upheld by the Supreme Court. The CBI and ED probed bank transactions and wire transfers. The CBI also registered FIR against then TMC Rajya Sabha MP Mukul Roy, who later joined the BJP and became the opposition party’s election strategist in Bengal.The suspended officer is Saiyaad Mustafa Hussain Mirza, who was posted as superintendent of police in Burdwan district during the sting operation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narada-case-ed-issues-notices-to-5-tmc-leaders/story-h40bUdOHvkrQ727aEsH2iI.html
25-08-2020||India||Tributes pour in for Arun Jaitley||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several other national leaders paid their respects to the late Arun Jaitley on Monday on the occasion of his first death anniversary. “On this day, last year, we lost Shri Arun Jaitleyji. I miss my friend a lot. Arunji served India diligently. His wit, intellect, legal acumen and warm personality were legendary,” PM tweeted. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s social media handle posted a video with the message: “He left us early but he also left behind indelible imprints on the Indian economy, law, governance and probity in public life. His impeccable life will serve as a guiding path for the talented future generations.” Union home minister Amit Shah remembered Jaitley as “an outstanding politician, prolific orator and a great human being who had no parallels in Indian polity” and described him as “multifaceted and a friend of friends, who will always be remembered for his towering legacy, transformative vision and devotion to the nation.” Jaitley, 66, was admitted to New Delhi’s AIIMS on August 9 after he complained of uneasiness. He died of multiple organ failure on August 24 last year. Jaitley’s daughter Sonali Jaitley-Bakshi, a lawyer, posted a picture of her early childhood and tweeted: “Today marks one year without my father. Do I miss him? Yes. Do I miss his presence? Never, for he is always with me. I love you, dad --- thanks for everything.” His son, Rohan Jaitley, shared old photographs of the leader and tweeted, “It’s been a year since you left us, dad @arunjaitley. In many ways, it feels like it was just yesterday. The pain is still as fresh. But so is my resolve to live by your values, principles and vision. You are always with us. So missed, so loved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tributes-pour-in-for-arun-jaitley/story-ByhfqIGFNBxjtsjiono5FJ.html
25-08-2020||India||Regional BJP leaders say Congress top posts reserved for family||The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party leaders took a dig at the Congress saying the top post in the party is reserved for “Gandhi family” members and the Congress leaders re-imposed their faith in the leadership of interim president Sonia Gandhi and former chief Rahul Gandhi.The comments came during the seven-hour-long virtual Central Working Committee (CWC) meeting on Monday, in which party leaders asked Sonia Gandhi to continue for another six months. Gandhi asked the CWC to start the process to elect the new president.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan took a jibe at the Congress high command on Monday saying all the posts in the Congress are reserved for a family whereas an ordinary party worker in the BJP can become an MLA, MP, chief minister and even Prime Minister. He said this while addressing a gathering of the BJP workers in their programme in Gwalior on Monday during the party’s membership drive in Gwalior-Chambal region. Also read: Seed of letter germinated at dinner hosted by Tharoor five months ago“Congress leaders don’t have courage to hear truth. Sycophants are considered as loyal and those who tell truth are considered as traitors”, said Chouhan, while referring to a letter written by some Congress leaders to Sonia Gandhi asking for restructuring of the party. “When Jyotiraditya Scindiaji raised voice for justice to people he was accused of colluding with BJP. In the same way, the senior Congress leaders like Kapil Sibal and Ghulam Nabi Azad are being accused when they are demanding a full-fledged president in the Congress. No one can save such a party”, said Chouhan.However, Scindia refused to comment saying that the rumbling in the Congress was its internal matter.Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra said the “Congress was like a school where only headmaster’s child tops the class”. Former Union minister and BJP leader Uma Bharti said the Congress needs a grassroot leader like Mahatma Gandhi if it wants to revive. Hours before the CWC’s meeting state Congress president Kamal Nath and Rajya Sabha member Digvijaya Singh, both former chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh, sought to throw their weight behind the leadership of Congress president Sonia Gandhi in a series of tweets late night on Sunday. Several Congress leaders asked Sonia Gandhi to continue as party president.Jharkhand Congress president Dr Rameshwar Oraon in a letter to Sonia Gandhi requested her not to resign from the post of the party president. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot earlier in the day had expressed faith in leadership of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi and said the party could not survive without them.

25-08-2020||India||Seed of letter germinated at dinner hosted by Tharoor five months ago||Informal deliberations over the need for reforms within the Congress party started at least five months ago at a dinner hosted by Member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor, several Congressmen who were his guests have confirmed to HT -- a disclosure that highlights that the letter sent to Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi by 23 leaders was in the making for some time. Importantly, many who were a part of the dinner meeting have not put their signatures to the letter, which was addressed to Gandhi and sent on August 7. Prominent among those who attended Tharoor’s dinner – but did not sign the letter asking for a “visible” and “active” leader – are former Union minister P Chidambaram, his son Karti Chidambaram, Sachin Pilot, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, and Mani Shankar Iyer.Singhvi confirmed his presence at the dinner. “I was invited to the dinner by Shashi Tharoor at a day’s notice. There was an informal discussion on the constructive issue of reforms within the party. Subsequently, I was not informed about the formulation of the letter, at any stage,” he told HT. Chidambaram said he did not want to comment on “party affairs”. Pilot, only last month, led a revolt against Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, before returning to the party fold, after a meeting with Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, and did not comment on the matter. Tharoor did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment.Mani Shankar Iyer was more forthright , saying, “I did not sign [the letter] because I was not asked to. Nobody approached me.” Of the dinner in March, Iyer said, “There was a general discussion to revive the party and the need to go back to our secular credentials. There was a suggestion, which nobody opposed, of the need to send a letter. Nobody, however, approached me after that dinner.” The Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision-making body, discussed the controversial letter signed by the leaders at a marathon session on Monday -- and then decided to maintain status quo, although there was talk that she would now be assisted by a committee for the next six months till a meeting of the All India Congress Committee (AICC). The CWC resolution, however, made no mention of a committee. One Member of Parliament, who is a signatory to the letter and was also at Tharoor’s dinner, said on condition of anonymity that he signed because he believes that there is an urgent need for reforms within the Congress. “It is about issues, not personalities. The Gandhis and other senior leaders should read the message and not shoot the messenger. We have put our names to the letter because we believe that we need to reform. There is no cloak and dagger here.”The letter represented the first direct questioning of the Gandhis. The party has faced revolts in the past but no one from within has challenged the authority of Sonia Gandhi since Sharad Pawar’s revolt in 1999. The larger point made at the end of the day, after the long meeting of the CWC, was the need for the party to stay united. It will be of little comfort to the Gandhis that there are many within the fold who did not put their signature to the letter but are in favour of seeing a reformed Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seed-of-letter-germinated-at-dinner-hosted-by-tharoor-five-months-ago/story-PzwOnvwsM5aGCIUU8ZazdI.html
25-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Do we know enough about the strains of the Sars-CoV2 virus in India? How many strains are there? Is there one dominant strain? Are there multiple strains?Last week, Malaysia claimed to have discovered a strain that was “10 times more infectious” and “easily spread by a superspreader”, but as researchers around the world were quick to point out, while this strain might have been new to that country, it was the predominant strain in most parts of the world even as far back as March and April (including in Europe). Called the G clade (a biological term meaning descendants of a common ancestor), this strain is the dominant strain in India. And it is, unfortunately, a virulent one, which could perhaps explain the virus’s run through the country; India ended Monday with 3.16 million cases of Covid-19, of which 762,051 were active. It saw 58,532 deaths till Monday night.Around the same time the Malaysian authorities made their claim – resulting in sensational headlines around the world – researchers in Singapore wrote in a study published in The Lancet that a variant of Sars-CoV2 with some of its DNA missing actually caused a milder infection than the other strain. In a small study, it was found that people in whom this strain was found did not require either oxygen support or to be put on the ventilator.Compared to many other viruses, Sars-CoV2 has stayed relatively stable – and that is both a good thing and a bad thing. It is good because it means vaccines currently under development have a high chance of succeeding. It is a bad thing because there were hopes during the initial weeks of the pandemic that, like some viruses do, Sars-CoV2 would mutate into an unviable strain and taper off.The ability of viruses to mutate is one reason why some experts are worried about Russia’s Sputnik-V vaccine, which hasn’t undergone the kind of rigorous tests any such vaccine should – an ineffective vaccine may, far from proving to be a cure, merely cause the virus to mutate, perhaps into something far more dangerous.Not that Sars-CoV2 in its current form is benign. Around the world, researchers and doctors no longer see Covid-19 as a respiratory disease – it affects everything from the kidneys to the brain – and are beginning, especially as they set out to answer questions about long-Covid, to believe that it could be much more. Long-Covid refers to the sometimes debilitating and long-drawn-out fallout of Covid-19 that some patients suffer – sometimes even without being seriously ill. Those trying to find out more about long-Covid believe that one explanation for it could be that Covid-19 affects at least some patients the same way an autoimmune disorder does. An autoimmune disease is simply one where the immune system attacks the host (or an organ of the host), or one where it weakens the body’s response to infections. While this (accepting Covid-19 as an autoimmune disease) could explain some things, more research is needed before it can be classified as such.Interestingly, one of the most promising lines of treatment for autoimmune diseases involves the use of monoclonal antibodies (called so because the antibodies are all made up of identical cells, each of which is cloned from the same parent). Several companies (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Eli Lilly) are testing monoclonal antibodies for Covid-19. HT’s health editor Sanchita Sharma has been writing about them from early July, from around the time Regeneron’s monoclonal antibody REGN-COV2 entered Phase 3 trials. Scientists believe that the use of monoclonal antibodies early on in the treatment of Covid-19 could save more lives.Another treatment for autoimmune diseases involves the use of interferons – proteins released by the body’s immune system and which provoke, regulate, or amplify the response to pathogens. And companies are experimenting with interferons, too, in the treatment of Covid-19. A study reported in July, and conducted by the University of Southampton and a company Synairgen, showed that an inhaled interferon helped Covid-19 patients recover faster.A vaccine is necessary and important, but we’d do well to keep track of the work being done on interferons and monoclonal antibodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-nt3CtTuraC9oTHbj4lbwEM.html

25-08-2020||India||3 key dissenters ‘positive’ after Sonia’s statement||Three key signatories of a controversial letter asking for structural changes in the Congress appeared to strike a conciliatory note on Monday, welcoming a statement by interim Congress chief Sonia Gandhi about bridging internal differences, and her decision to remain at the helm until the next party president is appointed.Senior Congress leaders Kapil Sibal, Shashi Tharoor, Mukul Wasnik and Manish Tewari -- all among 23 leaders who signed the letter addressed to Sonia Gandhi -- met at the residence of Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, late on Monday evening after an acrimonious seven-hour-long Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting. Sibal told HT that he wanted to be briefed on the meeting, which only four of the 23 leaders -- including Wasnik and Azad -- attended by virtue of being CWC members. Also read: Seed of letter germinated at dinner hosted by Tharoor five months ago”Mrs Gandhi made a very good statement. It is a very, very thoughtful gesture on her part,” Sibal said, referring Sonia Gandhi’s statement at the CWC meeting that the letter should be treated as a part of the past. “We are a large family, we have differences on many occasions but in the end, we come together as one. The need of the hour is to fight for the cause of the people and forces that are failing this country,” Sonia Gandhi said, according to party’s chief spokesperson, Randeep Singh Surjewala.Azad also reacted positively. “The outcome is very good’’ said Azad, ”She has decided to stay on till an AICC session is called to choose the next Congress President.’’”We are heading in the right direction,’’ said Congress MP Vivek Tankha, who had also signed the letter.But a fourth Congress leader, who asked to not be named, disagreed. “This letter is not the end, it’s the beginning- at the CWC, you are trying to shoot the messenger. But we are only there to raise issues,” he said, referring to the critcisim directed at the letter’s signatories during the CWC meeting. For now, said one person aware of developments, the 23 leaders have decided to adopt a “wait and watch’’ approach.The leaders who signed the letter -- who want elections at all levels of the Congress organisation and consultations on key issues -- are waiting to see if their suggestions are taken on board, said the person quoted above. Rahul Gandhi has suggested a mechanism to help the Congress president which may include appointing members to a parliamentary board to advise the president, or picking vice-presidents.Also read: Sonia stays in charge of Congress after acrimonious CWC meetTHREE LETTERS?Although only one letter asking for an overhaul in party processes -- which HT hasn’t seen, and which has only partially been reported by the media -- triggered an internal tussle in the Congress, HT has learnt that the signatories of the first letter may have written at least two more. The first letter -- it may have up to 100 signatories but only 23 of whom are known, according to a second person aware of developments-- was sent to Sonia Gandhi on August 7, and then a second was sent to her on August 15 as a reminder.This person quoted above said that a third letter was written to an external party, and it raised “legal issues” with the functioning of the Congress and its adherence to its own internal rules and guidelines. Sibal refused to comment on this issue. The repeated letters was one of the key reasons that Sonia Gandhi was upset with the signatories, said the second person quoted above.“I have no grudge against those who have written about problems but I am pained by it appearing in the media,” Sonia Gandhi said at the meetingTo which Azad, the first of the letter writers to speak at the meeting, said, “Leaks are a problem with politicians. Whether it is Indira’s [former PM Indira Gandhi] cabinet, [former PM] Narasimha Raos or UPA’s [United Progressive Alliance], cabinet notes have routinely been leaked.’’ He went on to add, “There are four of us here at the meeting and despite Vengugopal ji (the general secretary organisation) instructing all to leave their phones, everyone outside knows what we have said here.”Former Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha, who first hinted at a letter written by dissenters last week, suggested that internal decisions of the party can face a legal challenge. ”The INC Constitution is clear under Sec 18 (H) that all decisions taken by the CWC must happen under a freshly elected AICC or else it will be unconstitutional and illegal. If any violation occurs they can be challenged. They will be challenged,’’ Jha tweeted on Monday morning.According to the Congress party’s constitution, section 18 H says, “In the event of any emergency by reason of any cause such as the death or resignation of the President elected as above, the senior most - General Secretary will discharge the routine functions of the President until the Working Committee appoints a provisional President pending the election of a regular President by the AICC.’’A Congress MP, who is also a signatory in the letter, said that according to these provisions of the Congress, the CWC’s decisions were now without legal validity. But a senior leader of the Congress dismissed this stand and asked why four signatories of the letter were participating in the CWC meeting if there were doubts about its legal veracity. “Since last year, there have been four CWC meetings. Why didn't they point this out in there?’’he asked, speaking on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-key-dissenters-positive-after-sonia-s-statement/story-FdNsnVkwBjKeTeI6QE5k7L.html
25-08-2020||India||Kapil Sibal withdraws statement after Rahul Gandhi calls him||The intense drama in the virtual Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on Monday spilled over into the public domain when, reacting to a tweet by Congress veteran Kapil Sibal, former party president Rahul Gandhi called him personally to deny remarks attributed to him.It was preceded by a bit of friction between Sibal and the Congress chief spokesperson Randip Surjewala, who rejected allegations that Rahul Gandhi accused some seniors of “colluding” with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during the high-voltage CWC discussions.According to party functionaries, minutes after Sibal’s tweet, Rahul Gandhi came to know of it. And soon after, Sibal received a call from Gandhi’s key aide, Kanishka Singh. According to people close to Sibal, he conveyed his anguish to Singh, and soon after, Gandhi left the CWC meeting to call Sibal and categorically told him that he made no such comments.“Sh. Rahul Gandhi hasn’t said a word of this nature nor alluded to it. Pl. don’t be misled by false media discourse or misinformation being spread,” Surjewala replied to Sibal on the microblogging site even when the meeting of the top executive body was underway. Sibal quickly withdrew his online statement. “Was informed by Rahul Gandhi personally that he never said what was attributed to him. I therefore withdraw my tweet,” he announced on Twitter. Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad clarified later in the day that Rahul Gandhi never stated those who wrote the letter were colluding with or doing so at the behest of the BJP. “Rahul Gandhi at no point of time inside the Congress Working Committee (CWC) or outside it has said that the signatories to the letter were doing it at the behest of the BJP. This is a totally wrong thing which has been attributed to Rahul Gandhi,” Azad told HT. In his tweet earlier in the day, Sibal, listed his acts of loyalty to underline that in his 30 years in the Congress, he had never made a statement in favour of the BJP on any issue. He pointed out how he “Succeeded in Rajasthan High Court defending the Congress Party”, and he is “Defending party in Manipur to bring down BJP Govt”. In his own tweet, Surjewala also urged Sibal to fight together with party colleagues against the BJP. “...we all need to work together in fighting the draconian [Narendra] Modi rule rather than fighting & hurting each other & the Congress,” Surjewala wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sibal-withdraws-statement-after-rahul-calls-him/story-B5Uk3SiixTDrgGQlyL6QbK.html
25-08-2020||India||7 hours of fireworks at CWC||The Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting saw fireworks with almost all the members coming down heavily on the 23 dissenting leaders for writing a letter to party chief Sonia Gandhi and leaking that to the media. Four of the 23 dissenters - Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mukul Wasnik, Anand Sharma and Jitin Prasada - were isolated at the CWC meeting as members lashed out at them for challenging Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. These four leaders along with 19 others, including Kapil Sibal, Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor, Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Prithviraj Chavan, in their letter to Sonia Gandhi sought a complete overhaul of the organisation, demanded formation of a parliamentary board and maintained that the Gandhis will always be an integral part of a “collective leadership”. A Congress functionary said the letter was triggered by apprehension among these leaders that the party high command might name a third person such as Mallikarjun Kharge or KC Venugopal as the interim chief till internal elections are held as both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are not keen to occupy the post. “They wanted to scuttle that move and ensure that a leader acceptable to all occupies the post,” he said. The CWC meeting started with Venugopal reading out Sonia Gandhi’s letter addressed to him on August 20, asking him to initiate the process to elect a new president. Addressing the meeting, Sonia Gandhi told Azad that he had sent her the letter on August 9 and then a reminder on August 17. “It was hurtful. You know me so well, Azad sahib. How could you think that I will take any decision on the leadership issue without consulting party leaders? You could always come and meet me. I retired long ago. I don’t want to hang on to this chair. So what’s the motive of this letter?” a CWC member quoted her as having said at the meeting. For his part, Rahul Gandhi questioned the timing of the letter. It was written at a time when my mother was in hospital and you attacked her when she was at her weakest and also when the party was vulnerable, fighting the BJP in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan,” the CWC member quoted him as having said. “Challenging her authority and talking about the collective leadership was an insult to her. I never wanted her to be the Congress president. She too didn’t want to become again,” Rahul Gandhi is said to have told the meeting. Rahul Gandhi also asked Azad how the letter was leaked when it was written on the covering note that there is only one copy that was handed over to the Congress president and all other copies were destroyed. Party treasurer Ahmed Patel criticised the dissenters. Naming Azad, Wasnik and Sharma, he said they are occupying key posts in the party and should not have written such a letter. “I had advised you not to write any letter but you still went ahead. Do you want Sonia Gandhi to sit at home? Are you doing any favour to the Gandhis by saying they too will be part of the collective leadership? One may be angry over certain decisions in the party but that doesn’t mean you start writing letters. I too am out for the last three years but that is ok,” Patel is said to have told them.“You are talking about the collective leadership. When you met Baba Ramdev at the airport, did you go after consulting the then Prime Minister (Manmohan Singh) and the Congress president (Sonia Gandhi)?” Patel said.Sibal along with Pranab Mukherjee had met Ramdev at the Delhi airport in June 2011 to dissuade him from launching a fast. Patel also told Sharma that he should have realised what he is writing when he drafted the letter. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said urged Sonia Gandhi to continue on the post till Rahul Gandhi becomes the president. Former defence minister AK Antony said if Sonia Gandhi is unwilling then Rahul Gandhi should take over. “Weakening the high command is weakening the party. How can my colleagues write such a letter? This is cruel and unfortunate.” Ambika Soni demanded action against dissenting leaders. She said when the party can take action against block and district leaders for indiscipline why can’t it do the same against these leaders who first wrote the letter and then leaked it. She also told Azad that he became the J&K chief minister only because of Sonia Gandhi. Referring to Sonia Gandhi’s meeting with Rajya sabha members, she said Rajeev Satav never questioned Manmohan Singh. “Why did you all bring it up on twitter? What does it mean?” Wasnik insisted that he is a party loyalist and would never go against the Gandhi family. “I owe a lot to Sonia Gandhi. How can anyone say that we did it when she was in hospital? I wish her a long life. Nobody can question my loyalty to the Congress party. I am ready to face any action.” Sharma said the letter is not against the Gandhis but only seeks to point out to certain issues in the Congress. “I joined the Congress at the age of 18 years and will die as a Congressman.” When Azad was explaining the reason behind the letter, Adhir Ranjan Choudhary intervened and said “You are making lame excuses and defending the indefensible”. At this point, Sonia Gandhi asked Adhir to switch off his mike and not to speak out of turn. Jitin Prasada too said he was ready to accept the CWC decision in letter and spirit and whatever action it takes against him. “We had flagged certain organisational issues and in no way it was against the Gandhis.” RPN Singh praised Sonia Gandhi for being available 24x7 to guide the party during Jharkhand elections. “We won the elections. Secondly, I want to tell all CWC members that we should all learn politics from Sonia Gandhi.” He also told the members that it is surprising that they don’t put forth their viewpoint in the CWC which is the appropriate party forum for raising such issues. Ajay Maken said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and the BJP are afraid of Rahul Gandhi only and asked him to assume the reins of the party immediately. Rajeev Satav said he is pained that 3 of the 23 dissenters were former Youth Congress presidents and know very well how the organisation functions. Sonia Gandhi has never taken any decision without consulting the leaders. Tariq Hameed Karra demanded that Sonia Gandhi should be made lifetime president of the party. He described the move by senior leaders as less of an internal desire and more of an external design to create an alternative leadership in the Congress and the move to declare her as lifetime president would defeat that external design. A Chella Kumar said when Article 370 was abrogated in Jammu and Kashmir, three former chief ministers were put under detention. “People keep asking us why the former Congress chief minister (Ghulam Nabi Azad) had not been detained and was roaming freely.” To this, Azad told him to check the Rajya Sabha records as he was the only opposition leader to have attacked Modi in the House. Jitendra Singh said there are many ‘Jaichands or traitors’ in the Congress. Some people reminded the dissenters that how many people they used to meet when they were ministers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/7-hours-of-fireworks-at-cwc/story-d93o5rAEPfRDgc7DT2pXsN.html
25-08-2020||India||Patna HC asks health workers to call off strike, resume duty||The Patna high court Monday directed health workers, paramedics and doctors to call off their strike immediately and resume their duties. Around 20,000 paramedical employees under the National Health Mission (NHM) in the state had struck work since Sunday while junior doctors, including those at the AIIMS-Patna and state-run medical colleges, had threatened to boycott work indefinitely from August 27 over their respective demands. Restraining the paramedical workers and doctors from going on a strike, a division bench of the Patna high court said the violation of the order would be tantamount to contempt of court. It listed the case for further hearing on August 26. The division bench of chief justice Sanjay Karol and justice S Kumar also issued notice to the Bihar State Contractual Health Employees Federation (BSCHEF) and the Junior Doctors Association (JDA), Bihar. The bench, which drew upon orders by the Supreme Court, said the medical officers and the paramedical staff employed in government hospitals were duty bound to extend medical assistance for preserving human life. Failure on their part to provide timely medical treatment in the need of hour resulted in violation of right to life. “During the time of current situation and circumstances prevalent as a result of pandemic Covid-19, none of the functionaries empowered and authorised under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, can refrain from discharging their duties and functions, more so by resorting to the mechanism of strike which perhaps may be illegal. The doctors and the para medical staff(s) are constitutionally duty bound, even so on humanitarian grounds, to protect and preserve human life,” the bench said. “Perhaps, they may have some genuine grievance, but then for redressal thereof, proper mechanism has to be resorted to, but state cannot be put to ransom by resorting to an illegal method of protest, i.e. going on indefinite strike,” the bench added. Responding to the court order, secretary of the Bihar State Contractual Health Employees Federation, Lallan Kumar Singh, said, “We will share our viewpoint in court.” “The government has not revised our salary since 2011. Besides, we do not even have life insurance cover. We have also been kept out of the state government incentive to give one-month basic salary to healthcare workers on Covid-19 duty. Demand for Employees Provident Fund is also among our 17-point charter of demands,” he added. The NHM workers were on strike between July 20 and 23 as well. President of the Resident Doctors Association of AIIMS-Patna Dr Vinay Kumar said, “The government and authorities concerned must hear and solve all the genuine concerns of doctors and residents of the state. All the health professionals are working tirelessly day and night in times of Covid-19. We never want to withdraw our services as we are responsible for the lives of patients. But where do we go if no one will hear our genuine concerns?” The junior doctors are demanding a hike in stipend and relaxation in clauses of the government bond for post-graduate medicos, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patna-hc-asks-health-workers-to-call-off-strike-resume-duty/story-9Z9snnFQ9YcVMYAJPjF5NI.html
25-08-2020||India||Covid danger: Effects may linger long after recovery||Clinicians the world over are increasingly treating Covid-19 as more than a respiratory disease, with patients reporting neurological, autoimmune and cardiovascular symptoms that can manifest as strokes, heart attacks, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, cytokine storm, loss of taste and smell, and fatigue that may occur and last for weeks after recovery.Close to eight months since the disease first came to light, and after 23.7 millions infections and 814,000 deaths across the world, the range of effects the Sars-Cov2 has had on people adds to the volume of many unknowns about a virus that has caused the first pandemic in a century. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“Around 50% patients have residual symptoms post recovery, which range from fatigue and weakness to breathlessness that requires oxygenation at home even after testing negative for Covid-19. In some people, the symptoms can persist for weeks,” said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior pulmonologist and critical care specialist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals in Delhi, where he has been treating Covid-19 patients since the hospital established isolation wards on March 26.One of his patients is Achal Jain, 53, who has been experiencing breathlessness, exhaustion and headaches since he recovered from Covid-19 four months ago. “Four people from our family were hospitalised with coronavirus in April after we contracted it from a migrant camp where we went to feed the hungry. We all recovered, but I still feel tired and have trouble sleeping, even though I did not need ICU admission,” said Jain, a businessman who lives in Yamuna Vihar in north-east Delhi. Long Covid While there is no peer-reviewed data on such long Covid, a survey of 1,567 people on Facebook page called Survivors Corps showed long-term symptoms stretched from extreme fatigue to difficulty focusing and moving. While all long-haulers suffered from fatigue, more than half had difficulty breathing, concentrating, exercising and sleeping, while at least 40% had anxiety, memory problems and dizziness. A study of 110 patients treated for Covid in a hospital in Bristol, UK, found 75% were experiencing at least one symptoms three months after recovery, with breathlessness, fatigue and muscle ache reported by 81 patients long after being diagnosed free of disease. These symptoms overlap with those of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (myalgic encephalomyelitis), which is a disease of unknown etiology. “Although a causal link between Sars-CoV2 and the appearance of autoimmune and auto-inflammatory diseases has not yet been firmly established, it is suggested by the temporal association with the current Covid-19 pandemic and the history of exposure of affected patients to Sars-CoV2,” according to a study in the scientific journal, Nature Reviews Rheumatology, on June 4. Immune threat Emerging reports show Sars-CoV2 infection is followed by various autoimmune and auto-inflammatory diseases, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. “Early diagnosis of Covid-19-linked autoimmune and auto-inflammatory diseases, and prompt initiation of therapy, is crucial for successful recovery and preventing end-organ damage and fatality,” said the Nature study, which suggested that Sars-CoV2 could act as a direct trigger of autoimmune and/or auto-inflammatory conditions either by molecular mimicry or some other, unknown mechanisms. “When Sars-Cov2 attaches to the spike protein ACE-2, it activates the cytokine release syndrome that activates immune cells to increase inflammation. The pro-inflammation cytokines include IL-1, IL-6 and IL-10. The chief among them is IL-6 that causes direct damage to cells and triggers other cells to release cytokines, leading to damage to all organs with ACE-2, which include the lungs, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, liver and gastrointestinal tract,” said Arvinder S Soin, chairman of the Medanta Liver Transplant Institute, Medanta-The Medicity, Gurugram. “IL-6 has been implicated in triggering a cytokine story and in the pathogenesis of myocarditis, which explains why drugs that block IL-6 like the steroid dexamethasone and monoclonal antibodies tocilizumab and sarilumab benefit patents with Covid-19,” added Dr Soin, who is the national lead of the Indian multi-centre trial on Tocilizumab (a drug used to treat auto-immune conditions) in moderate and severe Covid-19. Blood vessel trouble Heart attacks and stroke after recovery have also been reported in otherwise healthy patients. Heart images of people taken 10 weeks after Covid-19 infection found 78 of 100 had cardiac involvement, and 60% had ongoing myocardial inflammation, which was independent of pre-existing conditions, severity and course of the illness, and the time from the original diagnosis, according to a study published on July 27 in the journal JAMA Cardiology.“A study of patients in Wuhan, China, found 5% experienced stroke. Neurological symptoms were seen in 36.4% of patients, but were more common in patients with severe disease according to respiratory status, which included stroke, impaired consciousness and muscle injury,” said Dr Pushpendra Renjen, senior neurologist, Apollo Hospital. The study was reported in JAMA Neurology in April. Also read: High virus in kids with Covid-19, but are they contagious?“The disease is just eight months old, and though we are learning with each passing day, it will take years to fully understand the long-term effects of Covid-19,” added Dr Renjen.Way forward With long Covid increasingly being reported in patients in India, the Union health ministry has begun formulating guidelines on the management of post-recovery long-haul complications. “A section of recovered patients experience respiratory or heart-related issues, renal or liver complications, or even ophthalmological side effects. A joint monitoring group chaired by director general health services (Dr Rajiv Garg) is studying data from Covid-19 hospitals across India to draft guidelines on the long-term care required,” said Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan. People with long Covid met World Health Organisation (WHO) director general Dr Adhanom G Tedros on Friday. “These patients want three things: recognition, rehabilitation and research. Recognition of their disease, appropriate rehabilitation services, and more research to be done into the long-term effects of this new illness. We still know relatively little about the long-term effects,” said Dr Tedros, in a statement. “My message to these patients was... we are committed to working with countries to ensure you receive the services you need, and to advancing research to serve you better,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-danger-effects-may-linger-long-after-recovery/story-dWO2z1LoOZlA5qQ99ihq1M.html
25-08-2020||India||Sonia stays in charge of Congress after acrimonious CWC meet||The Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Monday resolved that Sonia Gandhi will continue as party president until an All India Congress Committee (AICC) session is convened, rejecting the concerns raised by 23 Congress leaders who criticised the functioning of the party and asked for structural changes in a controversial letter whose contents became public last week.The CWC — held in the backdrop of the first-ever show of dissent by prominent leaders against the party’s first family — authorised Sonia Gandhi to effect any necessary organisational changes, reaffirmed its faith in both Sonia and former president Rahul Gandhi.  There was sharp criticism of those who signed the letter at the party’s highest decision-making body, which met for seven hours on Monday and witnessed stormy exchanges between the leaders.The discussion focused largely on the timing of the letter, the intent behind it, and its leak; rather than on its contents. Rahul Gandhi led the attack on the signatories by saying it came when the Congress was fighting political battles in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, and Sonia Gandhi was in hospital. The CWC, in its formal resolution, also emphasised that issues must be raised within party forums in the interest of “propriety and discipline”, and not “through the media or in public fora”.Only four of the 23 leaders who signed the letter are CWC members, which made them eligible to attend the meeting — Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Mukul Wasnik and Jitin Prasada. Attacked for criticising the leadership, the dissidents expressed their support for Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, claimed that the letter was not intended to question the leadership of the Nehru-Gandhi family, and it had been “misconstrued”, but asserted that it had been written within the limits of a democratic party. According to people familiar with the contents of the letter, sent on August 7, a set of leaders — which also included Kapil Sibal, Shashi Tharoor, Manish Tewari, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and Milind Deora, among others — criticised the lack of honest introspection after electoral defeats, and asked for a full-time, effective, “active” and “visible” president; elections at all levels in the party (including the CWC); establishing an institutional leadership model to collectively guide the party; and a national coalition with like-minded parties, among other steps.HT has not seen a copy of the letter.Monday’s CWC resolution, which is the final word in the party for now, after enumerating the challenges facing the country, stated that Sonia and Rahul Gandhi are “two voices that have been at the forefront of exposing the government’s inadequate responses, divisive politics and audacious propaganda” and that the two have “inspired a generation of Indians”; it pledged to “strengthen” their hands “in every possible way”; and asserted that “no one will be or can be permitted to undermine or weaken the party and its leadership at this juncture”. According to several leaders present in the meeting who HT spoke to, the proceedings began with Sonia Gandhi reiterating her decision to step down, as she had noted in a letter to party general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal last week. She took over as interim chief last August, after Rahul Gandhi resigned after the Congress defeat in the Lok Sabha elections. “In the interest of the party, I ask CWC to begin deliberations to put in place the process of transition to relieve me of my duties,’’ she wrote in the letter. There was, however, overwhelming support for Sonia and Rahul Gandhi — among the 52 members who spoke, a majority either wanted Sonia to continue or Rahul to take over, or the former to continue till the latter took over. According to one person at the meeting, Sonia Gandhi directly addressed Azad, the senior-most leader among the letter signatories, “You know me so well, Azad sahib. How could you think that I will take any decision on the leadership issue without consulting party leaders? You could always come and meet me. I retired long ago. I don’t want to hang on to this chair. So, what’s the motive of this letter?”Rahul Gandhi, too, was critical of the timing of the letter, and referred to the fact that the party was engaged in political battles when it was written (in Rajasthan, it was dealing with an intraparty rebellion led by Sachin Pilot, while in Madhya Pradesh, it faces a set of crucial bypolls), and that Sonia Gandhi was then in the hospital. According to a second person who participated in the meeting, referring to his mother, Sonia, Rahul said, “She didn’t want to be Congress president, and I didn’t want her to be because of her health, and yet you all insisted that she become [the president]. Why then do you have a problem with her? Challenging her authority and talking about the collective leadership was an insult to her.” Rahul was incorrectly reported on Monday morning to have alleged that the letter-writers were in collusion with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), leading to Sibal putting out a tweet defending his commitment to the party. This, in turn, led to Gandhi calling and speaking to Sibal to clarify he had never made such a remark — which, then, saw Sibal withdraw his tweet. Former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh said the letter was “unfortunate” and shouldn’t have been written, even as he supported Sonia Gandhi’s continued stint as president. Former defence minister AK Antony called the letter “cruel”. Ahmed Patel, among Sonia Gandhi’s closest aides, said that he was pained that three senior leaders — Azad, Wasnik and Sharma — who occupied positions in the party had signed the letter. “There are times when a person is angry over certain decisions in the party but that does not mean one starts writing letters,” he said, according to a person familiar with the proceedings of the meeting. Party general secretary Ambika Soni demanded action against the signatories, and said rules should be the same for seniors and juniors. But on behalf of the signatories, Azad said that the letter was not directed against Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, and was “misconstrued” by some people. Azad claimed that for the past month, there had been rumours that Rahul Gandhi did not want to return as president while Sonia Gandhi did not want to remain party chief, and that someone else may be appointed. It was in that context of a possible third person being appointed, Azad said, the letter had been written, to urge the Congress president to discuss and consult with them before appointing somebody to the post. Mukul Wasnik said he owed a lot to Sonia Gandhi, while Anand Sharma — who was accused by Ahmed Patel of drafting the letter — said that the letter was written with the permissible limits of a democratic party. Prasada said the idea was to only flag organisational issues and the letter wasn’t directed at the Gandhis. Towards the end of the meeting, however, Sonia Gandhi sought to heal the divisions. Quoting her, the party’s chief spokesperson, Randeep Singh Surjewala, said, “We are a large family, we have differences on many occasions but in the end, we come together as one. The need of the hour is to fight for the cause of the people and forces that are failing this country.” “Organisational issues are always addressed and process of constitution and reconstitution is a continuous one.”While no one from the dissenting group wanted to comment officially, one MP told HT, “It’s the beginning of a process and not the end.”The BJP said it had nothing to do with the Congress’s internal matter. “As a former Congress person, I can say that the mirror has cracked and it is all out in the public domain,” senior leader Tom Vadakkan said.Mumbai-based political analyst Abhay Deshpande said the dissenting leaders had raised genuine concerns about the functioning of the organisation. “They are also worried not only about their future but that of the party as well. For the time being, the issue has been put under the carpet but I am sure it will resurface within next six months if the concerns raised by them are not addressed,” he said. Author and commentator Rasheed Kidwai said, “It’s going to be a fascinating, protracted battle. The dissenters have many tricks up their sleeve so let’s see what happens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-stays-in-charge-of-cong-after-acrimonious-cwc-meet/story-XcQqkzSnUgV9o9no2MZvBJ.html
25-08-2020||India||Letter written to Sonia being misconstrued, says Azad||New Delhi: Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha and senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said on Monday that a letter signed by him and 22 other party leaders was being misconstrued because only parts of the document, addressed to interim party chief Sonia Gandhi, were out in the public domain. Speaking to HT after an acrimonious Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting, he also clarified that the letter, which criticised the party’s functioning and called for more transparent internal processes, was not against Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi. “What I said at the working committee meeting was that unfortunately most of the people have not seen the full text of the letter. Because in the leak, which is unfortunate, only some portion of the letter has come out. Without going into the full text of the letter, some of our Congress colleagues yesterday said that this was being done at the behest of the BJP. I have said that if any of those people and leaders will prove that it was done at the behest of the BJP, I will resign. In that context, I said that I will resign if they prove it and I did not ask Rahul Gandhi to prove that. I have not resigned,” he said. In the letter, Azad and others sought a complete overhaul of the organisation, including full-time president, a parliamentary board if a someone outside the Gandhi family became the party chief and collective leadership. Azad had sent the letter to Sonia Gandhi on August 9 and then a reminder on August 17, after which Sonia Gandhi wrote to party general secretary in-charge of organisation, KC Venugopal, to begin deliberations to put in place a process to elect a new president. Azad read the letter out at the Congress working committee meeting on Monday. Azad said there were rumours for the past one month that Rahul Gandhi did not want to return as Congress president and that Sonia Gandhi did not want to continue as the party’s interim chief beyond August 10, when she completed one-year term. There were also suggestions that Sonia Gandhi might appoint somebody to the post and the letter was written in that context, he told the CWC. Azad said the letter was written to urge the Congress president to discuss and consult with them before appointing somebody to the post. Should a third person be appointed to the top post he or she has to do certain things such as form the parliamentary board, be active and have collective leadership, he told the CWC. Azad further said the letter was actually dos and don’ts for the third person and that they should be consulted before appointing anybody because of the importance of the position of party president. Addressing a news conference at the party headquarters in Delhi after the meeting, Venugopal said Azad told him that “all of them are part and parcel” of the CWC resolution, which noted, among other things, that inner-party issues cannot be deliberated through the media or in public fora. “The CWC urges and advises all concerned to raise such issues only in party fora in the interest of propriety and discipline,” the resolution read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/letter-written-to-sonia-being-misconstrued-says-azad/story-1DCfB78YSqJIUE4kzJqEWM.html
25-08-2020||India||ED sends notices to 5 TMC leaders in Narada case, summons suspended IPS officer||The Enforcement Directorate in Kolkata on Monday sent notices to five senior Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders and summoned a suspended Indian Police Service officer in connection with the 2016 Narada sting operation case. An ED official said on condition of anonymity that the leaders have been asked to furnish details of property owned by their families. The case is also being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The TMC leaders are Lok Sabha members Saugata Roy and Kakali Ghosh Dastidar, former Lok Sabha member Aparupa Poddar, minister Suvendu Adhikari and TMC leader Ratna Chatterjee who is the wife of former Kolkata mayor Sovon Chatterjee who is also an accused in this case. The suspended IPS officer is Saiyaad Mustafa Hussain Mirza. Saugata Roy and Suvendu Adhikari said they would give their reply to the ED once they receive the notice. The other three leaders were not available for comments. Interestingly, the TMC state leadership on Monday evening relieved Ratna Chatterjee of several responsibilities which led to speculations that her husband, with whom she has an estranged relationship may return to the TMC. Sovon Chatterjee officially joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in August 2019, but has not taken part in any activity in the party. The controversy erupted in March 2016 after Narada News portal uploaded a series of videos purportedly showing a number of high-profile TMC leaders receiving money in exchange for favours to a fictitious company. Narada was a poll issue during the 2016 assembly polls but the TMC managed to retain power despite a strong anti-corruption campaign by the BJP, Congress and the Left. The CBI filed an FIR in the Narada case on March 16, 2017 acting on a Calcutta high court order which was upheld by the Supreme Court. The CBI and ED probed bank transactions and wire transfers. The CBI also registered FIR against then TMC Rajya Sabha MP Mukul Roy who later joined the BJP and became the opposition party’s election strategist in Bengal. Other senior TMC leaders named in the CBI’s FIR are lawmaker Sultan Ahmed, Lok Sabha member Prasun Banerjee, urban development minister Firhad Hakim and panchayat and rural development minister Subrata Mukherjee. Former minister Madan Mitra and legislator Iqbal Ahmed, who later died, were also named as accused under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Mirza was posted as superintendent of police in Burdwan district during the sting operation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-sends-notices-to-5-tmc-leaders-in-narada-case-summons-suspended-ips-officer/story-gyDEtLMcjm9093YOqNTvAO.html
25-08-2020||India||Letter-writers may have lost upper hand after leak||Senior Congress leaders who called for an overhaul of the party organisation may have aimed at exposing how Rahul Gandhi’s loyalists were allegedly trying to run the party, but a leak of the letter they wrote to Sonia Gandhi turned the tables. They lost the advantage they gained at a July 30 meeting with Sonia Gandhi and Rajya Sabha members of the party.Their key demand this time, according to the letter, was for a “full-time and effective” leadership that is “visible” and “active”. Signatories to the letter, including Ghulam Nabi Azad and Anand Sharma, came under intense attack from colleagues at Monday’s meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), which ended with the party reaffirming its faith in the leadership of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.A resolution adopted by the CWC, too, contained a sharp reference. “No one will be or can be permitted to undermine or weaken the party and its leadership at this juncture,” the resolution said. Senior leaders who were signatories to the letter cited several reasons why they had been “compelled” to write it, including difficulties in getting appointments with the party’s top brass. One leader said on condition of anonymity that in the internal WhatsApp group of Congress leaders, any suggestion for a review of the party’s functioning or detailed discussions are met with attacks by at least two MPs.He added that some leaders have also wondered why one general secretary, considered to be close to Rahul Gandhi, is present in several key panels. He did not name the leader. Some senior leaders were also got frustrated at the delay in shuffling state organisations.“Many key appointments are held back. There is no clarity on how the organisation was working and there was no consultation with senior leaders,” said a signatory to the letter. But while this section was successful in getting their agenda discussed in the meeting, several party insiders said the letter turned the tide against them. They added that the group of veterans who wrote the letter had the upper hand three weeks ago when they united, apparently to safeguarding former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s legacy after Congress MP Rajiv Satav called for introspection on the second term of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government.But their attempt to “reform” the organisation is being seen as a sign of revolt against the Gandhi family members -- a charge the seniors vehemently deny. UPA ministers Shashi Tharoor, Anand Sharma, Milind Deora, Manish Tewari (all among the 23 signatories to the letter to Sonia Gandhi) were vocal on Twitter to defend the UPA’s achievements. Anand Sharma, a minister in the UPA regime, wrote 11 tweets to remind colleagues that “honest introspection” was always helpful and “Congressmen must be proud of UPA’s legacy.” Sharma cautioned young leaders: “No party disowns or discredits its legacy. Nobody expects the BJP to be charitable and give us credit but our own should respect and not forget” its legacy. Milind Deora invoked Manmohan Singh’s words—history will be kind to me—to say: “Could he have ever imagined that some from his own party would dismiss his years of service to the nation & seek to destroy his legacy - that, too, in his presence”. While Manish Tewari, who had lashed out at Congres MP Rajiv Satav also spoke out strongly. “BJP was out of power for 10 years. Not once did they ever blame Vajpayee or his government for their then predicaments. In @INCIndia unfortunately some ill–informed would rather take swipes at Dr. Manmohan Singh led UPA govt than fight NDA/BJP. When unity reqd (required) they divide,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/letter-writers-may-have-lost-upper-hand-after-leak/story-hdYFvbHcLCQ298oCrl4VtI.html
25-08-2020||India||‘If it holds in future tests too’: UP doctor on promising Covaxin results||The test reports of the 38 volunteers who were given the first dose of anti-Covid vaccine in Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur have shown promising results. The vaccine, known as Covaxin, has been developed by Bharat Biotech. Samples from the volunteers were taken on August 14, exactly two weeks after the vaccine was injected into them at Prakhar Hospital in the city as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. Prakhar Hospital is one of two private hospitals in Uttar Pradesh that were chosen for human trials of the vaccine. “The inputs shared with us can fill anyone with a lot of hope; the results are very encouraging,” said Dr JS Kushwaha, chairman of the hospital. “The anti-bodies developed are well beyond expectations. If this holds in future tests, too, we may have our vaccine by the end of the year,” he said. The second sample of this batch, and the first sample of the second batch of 32 people, would be taken on August 28. The samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NVI) where they were tested on the lines of the ICMR guidelines. The experts here said they were expecting good results as none of the participants complained after they were given the vaccine. The hospital had set up a team of specialists to monitor the participants, with whom they spoke twice in a day in the past three weeks. “The day they were given the vaccine we had them with us for three hours against the two hours as specified. No one complained of any side effects then, nor did they in three weeks,” the experts said. “That was a positive sign and the test results have vindicated what we were feeling,” he said. The process for the human trial of the vaccine had begun in July with the hospital screening nearly 100 individuals who had listed for the programme. Their blood samples for coronavirus and anti-bodies were taken and tested twice at the ICMR recognised labs. It was done to make sure that the participant was healthy and that the level of anti-bodies could be matched after the vaccine given. The data was analysed at the NIV and shared with the hospital where the vaccines were given. The hospital has planned a trial on 100 volunteers in two stages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-it-holds-in-future-tests-too-up-doctor-on-promising-covaxin-results/story-DSWjzhGD7a10FkHrTLD6XO.html
25-08-2020||India||UP govt suspends two senior IPS officers over corruption charges, fraud||The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday suspended two senior IPS officers for their alleged involvement in corruption and links with fraudsters involved in duping people on the pretext of providing them government contracts, said home department officials.They said both the cops—DIG (rules and manuals) Dinesh Chandra Dubey, Lucknow, and DIG, provincial armed constabulary, Agra, Arvind Sen are promotee IPS officers of the 2003 batch. While Sen is due to retire in January next year, Dubey will superannuate six months after Sen.In a press note issued by the home department, Sen was suspended for his alleged links with the racketeers involved in duping people on the pretext of giving contracts by the animal husbandry department.The racket involving a Noida-based senior journalist, a self-proclaimed journalist of Lucknow, some Vidhan Sabha secretariat employees and some outsiders was unearthed by an UP special task force (STF) on June 16 this year after the arrest of seven people in this connection.The STF probe had revealed that the fraudsters, who operated from a Vidhan Sabha secretariat room, had allured Indore businessman Manjit Singh Bhatia alias Rinku with a government contract worth Rs 292.14 crore, took a commission of around Rs 9.72 crore between March 2018 and March 2019. However, when the promise remained unfulfilled, Bhatia was issued a life threat allegedly by a criminal and was also warned of being framed for fraud by an IPS officer.A senior home department official said an enquiry was set up against Arvind Sen whose alleged links were established with the racket kingpin Ashish Rai, senior TV journalist Anil Rai and self-proclaimed journalist AK Rajeev.The official said further probe also revealed involvement of Dinesh Chandra Dubey in taking money promising people to provide government contracts.He said the home department had received a complaint for discrepancies and making of profit in the name of assuring allotment of contracts for construction of bus stations in Bareilly and Kaushambi, buildings for the physically challenged in Lucknow besides hostels in Rae Bareli and Hathras.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-suspends-two-senior-ips-officers-over-corruption-charges-fraud/story-O7uxxAOV65beDNF5oFKYtK.html
25-08-2020||India||DRDO lists 108 items to boost local industry||From mini unmanned aerial vehicles to fire detection systems and bullet proof vehicles to tank transporters, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has come out with a list of 108 systems and sub-systems that it will help the Indian industry design and develop to strengthen the local defence ecosystem. A DRDO delegation met defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday and briefed him on the 108 defence items identified for local production by the industry to achieve self-reliance in the defence sector, a defence ministry spokesperson said. It will also allow the DRDO to sharpen its focus on advanced technologies, the defence ministry said in a statement. “This initiative will pave the way for the Indian defence industry to develop many technologies towards building an AtmaNirbhar Bharat,” the defence minister’s office tweeted. The other items on the list prepared by the DRDO are NBC (nuclear, biological and chemical) shelters, missile canisters, navigation radars, satellite navigation receivers, mine-laying equipment and armoured engineering reconnaissance vehicles. The DRDO will also provide support to the domestic industry for the design, development and testing of these systems, the ministry said. “All the requirements of these systems by R&D establishments, armed forces and other security agencies can be met through development contracts or production orders on suitable Indian industry. This will allow the DRDO to focus on design and development of critical and advanced technologies and systems,” the statement added. The present industry base of the DRDO consists of 1,800 micro, small and medium enterprises, defence public sector undertakings, ordnance factories and large-scale industries. On August 9, the government announced that it will ban the import of 101 different types of weapons, systems and ammunition over the next five years, a significant step on the long road towards achieving self-reliance in the defence sector. The negative import list included artillery guns, light military transport aircraft, conventional submarines and long-range land attack cruise missiles. The detailed list of equipment published by the defence ministry has spelled out that the embargo on import will kick in between December 2020 and December 2025 for different categories of military hardware. The military hardware on the negative import list includes assault rifles, sniper rifles, short-range surface-to-air missiles, beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, corvettes, missile destroyers, light combat helicopter, ship-borne cruise missiles, light combat aircraft, a variety of radars and different types of ammunition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-lists-108-items-to-boost-local-industry/story-37UlsZ2T7sP4xRLnxfM99J.html
25-08-2020||India||Green concerns over Metro Phase-4 work||Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has run into a conflict with the city-state’s forest department over suspected violations of guidelines that don’t permit construction on deemed forest land and for damaging trees during work on the Janakpuri-RK Ashram corridor in Phase 4, and has been issued orders to stop work at least twice between February and August and, most recently, August 7. This includes the area around the Najafgarh drain, which is a birding hotspot frequented by thousands of migratory birds. Once classified as forest land, trees on the stretch cannot be cut or pruned for construction unless the required permissions are sought from the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980.Such work also requires the usual permissions under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994. Documents accessed by Hindustan Times show that DMRC, which began preliminary work on the 17-km stretch in December, was slapped with two notices on February 28 and August 7 by the Delhi forest department for damaging and pruning trees without obtaining permissions from the department and was ordered to stop work on the stretch. It also filed a violation report on August 18 with the Union ministry of environment and forest and chief conservator of forests, Delhi government, accusing DMRC of causing severe damage to trees, disturbing the ecology of the area and for continuing work on the stretch without permissions despite warnings. “The officials of this division have inspected the site, and it has been reported that one tree has been completely felled due to excavation work in Keshopur district park, and roots of a few other trees in the project area have been found damaged due to digging work. In addition, many trees have been covered by barricading and the area around the Najafgarh drain has been filled with soil,” said the first restraining order issued by the deputy conservator (west division) on February 28. The order added, “...you (DMRC) are directed to cease all digging work near trees and take necessary steps to save trees by putting soil on the roots exposed by digging and excavation work...The portion of the Najafgarh drain coming in the alignment is a site of plantation done by the IFCD (Irrigation and Flood Control Department) and GNCTD (Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi), so you are also directed to cease all construction activity on the drain area until necessary approval.”Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai did not comment on the matter.Paying no heedDespite the order to cease work, DMRC has continued to work on the stretch. In a response to HT’s email queries , DMRC said that 2,958 trees are proposed to be cut between Krishna Park and Mukarba Chowk for the construction of the corridor.Hindustan Times visited the construction site at least five times between February and August and found that the DMRC has continued construction on the stretch despite the restraining orders. Another notice was issued to the DMRC on August 7 by the office of the Deputy Conservator of Forests (west), which stated that damage to trees continued on the stretch because digging work was under way despite the lack of permissions. Inspections conducted by forest department officials between February 25 and July 28 showed that six fully grown trees on the stretch were illegally uprooted or over-pruned during construction. The digging and construction work, leading to the tree damage, continues even though senior forest department officials have confirmed that DMRC, as of August 13, was yet to submit a permission request for tree felling or transplantation on the Janakpuri-RK Ashram corridor .“I am yet to receive the permission request by the DMRC for the Janakpuri-RK Ashram stretch. If there are any violations then strictest of actions will be taken,” said Ishwar Singh, principal chief conservator of forests. DCF (west) S K Muan Guite said that the most recent reminder to stop construction work was issued to the DMRC in a meeting on August 14. “They have been intimated several times in various notices and restraining orders that the area is a deemed forest and they cannot carry out any construction work here till they obtain necessary permissions from the MoEF {ministry of environment and forest} to divert the land for the project . My staff inspected the site and told DMRC officials to stop the work despite which it has come to my notice that work is still going on,” Guite said.Records maintained by the forest department show that a portion of Road Number 26, where the Metro construction activity is currently ongoing and which spans nearly 5.3 kms in length, has been categorised as “deemed forest land” by the government.  DMRC, however, said that the exact location of the deemed forest land “could not be established by the forest department”.Guite said the identification of the deemed forest was carried out using satellite imagery in 2002 and the DMRC was informed of it.In Delhi’s context, a deemed forest is one which is spread across an area of at least 1 hectare and the number of trees per hectare is 250 or above. If both conditions are fulfilled simultaneously, the area is considered a deemed forest.Police complaintHe added that since the matter falls under the purview of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, which comes under the jurisdiction of the MoEF, the department does not have the authority to book a case. “In this case, I have submitted a report of the violations to the state headquarters a few days ago. The chief conservator of forests (CCF), who is the nodal officer {for FCA,1980},may report the violations to the MoEF,” Guite said.He added that a complaint was also sent to the local police station.Responding to the allegations, DMRC, in its statement, said that the preliminary work on the stretch was initiated on permissions from the Public Works Department (PWD). The corporation claimed that their work is ongoing in sections where “there are no trees”.“Work at the location where trees are there shall be taken up only after permission from Forest Department for which application had already been sent on April 2018 and subsequently in September 2019. The tree cutting permission from forest department is awaited,” DMRC said in the statement.In the response, it also claimed: “DMRC has not damaged any tree on the Vikaspuri- Madhuban Chowk road”.“Tree protection measures are being taken by DMRC’s contractor at work site and the existing trees are protected with the help of fencing with green garden net as per the suitability. Further, many other utility owning agencies are also working / digging on ROW (right of way) for their respective utilities,” it added, passing the buck for the damage. .Ravi Agarwal, founder of environmental NGO Toxics Link and a former member of the Ridge Management Board (RMB), said DCF has the authority to stop work and take legal action against DMRC for continuing work despite warnings. “The DCF has the power to stop work in his area, if a construction agency is not following the due procedure or is working on deemed forest land without the necessary permission. In the past, we haven’t come across instances of the DMRC ignoring the procedure, but if it is happening here then it is very much in the jurisdiction of the concerned officer to get the work stopped and report to the CCF (chief conservator of forests) for legal action,” said Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/green-concerns-over-metro-phase-4-work/story-QShNJyT6MnEoziE6DVqLiI.html
25-08-2020||India||Coronavirus crisis in India: 600k tests on Sunday, lowest in 2 weeks||India’s daily testing for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) dropped sharply on Sunday, as 609,917 tests were conducted, the lowest in two weeks, according to data from the Union ministry of health and family welfare. The daily testing count was around 200,000 fewer than that of the previous day. Sunday’s was the lowest test count since August 10, when 477,027 tests were conducted. To be sure, the number of samples that arrive at the laboratories to be tested for Covid-19 is lower at the weekends than on week days. Sunday’s numbers are what India was testing around first week of August, when about 550,00-600,000 tests were performed in a day.On Saturday, 801,147 tests were conducted across 1,515 Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-approved laboratories in the country. Last Friday, India had achieved a milestone, when it had conducted a million tests.On average, the country has been conducting 850,000 tests per day over the past week.On August 1, 525,689 tests were conducted. The number rose to 6,64,949  on August 6; and 746,608 on August 16. ICMR officials said that during weekends the number of swab samples that arrive for testing is usually lower, but the rising average daily tests in the past three weeks are a pointer towards progress being made in the aggressive Covid-19 testing mechanism put in place across the country. “On weekends and public holidays, the number of samples getting tested usually goes down a bit. There could be several reasons, including fewer swab samples being collected and reduced work shifts of laboratory technicians. This is more an aberration than a norm. It doesn’t mean that the country’s testing capacity has reduced. The daily testing count is only going to increase from here on,” said an ICMR official, requesting anonymity.India, which had conducted its first Covid-19 test on January 23 at ICMR’s National Institute of Virology in Pune, has conducted 3,590,213 tests till date.Almost all states are performing more than 140 tests per day per million population, the minimum norm prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to determine adequate testing. India’s national average is close to 600 tests per day per million population.“The number of tests has been significantly scaled up in a short span of time, which is commendable, but at the same time we have to ensure there is equal access to testing in all parts of the country, especially in remote areas,” said Dr Tarun Bhatnagar, senior epidemiologist, National Institute of Epidemiology.Some experts say that the focus should be on increasing the real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing as that is recognised as the gold standard of testing.Given that the RT-PCR test has essential requirements in terms of biosafety and biosecurity as well as specialized equipment, it needs a sophisticated laboratory to carry out the test, and ICMR has been making efforts to identify and add as many laboratories as possible. Currently, close to 750 of the total 1,500 labs are equipped with RT-PCR machines for Covid-19 testing.“RT-PCR has higher sensitivity which means it is more reliable, and that is what is required to know the exact disease burden when dealing with a pandemic,” said Dr VK Monga, chairperson of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/600k-tests-on-sunday-lowest-in-2-weeks/story-D1sEMfGPDeak7qYTEZEleM.html
25-08-2020||India||NEET aspirants stuck abroad can be brought back: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to ensure that Indian students in the Gulf who have to appear in the September 13 National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) are allowed to travel to India by special flights operating under the Vande Bharat Mission to bring home Indians stranded abroad.Close to 4,000 students in the Middle East who have to appear in NEET for admission to medical and dental courses had pinned their hopes on a petition in the Supreme Court filed by a social worker, Abdul Azeez. The petition filed on behalf of 21 such students demanded opening of NEET examination centres in Dubai, Doha and Qatar, as has been done by the National Testing Agency (NTA) for holding the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) for admission to engineering schools every year. Azeez’s demand was rejected by the Kerala high court on June 30 and the top court was hearing an appeal against the decision.Both the NTA and the Medical Council of India (MCI) were opposed to setting up examination centres abroad. An MCI affidavit stated that holding the examination in different time zones will compromise the uniformity of the NEET examination.The Centre had submitted that the time was too short to consider the request of the petitioner; the process of identification of exam centres, appointment of invigilators, and transport of question papers requires careful planning and execution. The government was also concerned about possible leakage of question papers as it would not have any control over the examination centres abroad.The bench of justices L Nageswara Rao, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhatt asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to consult the concerned government departments and ensure the overseas students appearing for NEET are allowed to travel by the Vande Bharat special flights. Before the Kerala high court, the ministry of external affairs had stated that students are eligible to take Vande Bharat flights.The petitioner represented by advocate Harris Beeran also sought a relaxation in the 14-day mandatory quarantine period. The bench refused, saying, “We are afraid such a direction cannot be made as it involves public health of citizens pertaining to state governments.” Beeran pointed out that in Kerala, the quarantine period has been extended to 28 days. At his request, the bench allowed the petitioner to approach the state government, seeking a relaxation in the quarantine period.The bench favoured having online examination for NEET beginning next year in order to avoid hassles for students faced with similar situation in the future. The bench told MCI, “Why are you not having NEET online when JEE is online and can be written from examination centres abroad. There are a number of students in the Gulf, Singapore and Malaysia appearing for NEET. Why can’t you think of something for next year? It will avoid troubles for so many people studying abroad.” MCI counsel Gaurav Sharma told the bench that he will convey the suggestion to the Board of Governors of MCI.Less than 20 days remain for the NEET examination and for those students in the Gulf who have to appear in both NEET and JEE, it will be a hard choice, Beeran said.“Nealry 60% of students writing NEET have to appear in JEE as well. This examination will be held online and offline from September 1 to 6. If they manage to take a flight after this, there is hardly a chance for them to appear for NEET exam in India.” The bench understood the predicament of such students, but refused to pass an order because no student faced with such a situation appeared before the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-neet-aspirants-stuck-abroad-can-be-brought-back/story-jFWz9h20bJNaJhQvbyMK7L.html
25-08-2020||India||Covid-19 positivity rate inching up again in Delhi, stands at 7.4%||The Covid-19 positivity rate has started rising again in Delhi, with 7.4% of all tests conducted in the last week coming back positive, the highest this number has touched in over a month, suggesting that Delhi may be facing a fresh challenge to control an outbreak it had contained to a considerable extent.Positivity rate — the fraction of tests that return positive -- is a crucial metric as experts say it shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and when coupled with an increase new cases, indicates that the virus is spreading fast.The Capital added 1,061 new cases and 13 new deaths according to the government’s Monday bulletin, taking the total number of infections in the city to 162,527 and fatalities to 4,313, according to Delhi government’s health bulletin on Monday. In terms of the single-day positivity rate, 8.9% of samples tested on Sunday came back positive. This is the highest proportion in nearly a month-and-a-half. Around 10.3% of tests came back positive on July 13 – when cases in the Capital were dropping from the peak. To be sure, single-day positivity rates can be influenced by low testing figures that are generally reported on weekends. This is why experts generally look at average positivity rate, which shows a clearer trend.The developments come as the number of daily tests in Delhi continued their steady drop from peak levels – 11,910 samples were tested on Sunday, with 8,084 (67.9%) of these being antigen, or rapid tests. Though the number of tests generally reduces on Sundays and holidays, at its peak, the city conducted 24,592 tests a day on August 8. The seven-day average for tests stands at 17,985 -- off the peak of 21,660 for the week ending July 10.With daily tests hitting a plateau, the average positivity rate has started inching up in the past few weeks. The number, which had dropped from a peak of 31.4% in mid-June to 5.7% at the end of July, was 7.4% in the past week – the highest since July 19, or 36 days ago.When asked about the positivity rate and the increasing number of infections, Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain, said in his daily media briefing that the infection rate in the Capital is still below 10% and “under control”.“We see the infection rate in ranges of 5-10%, 10-20%, 20-30%, and so on. As on date, the infection rate is well below 10%, whereas Delhi has also seen a time when the infection rate had hit 40%. The current variation of 1-1.5% we are seeing these days is understandable and keeps happening. It is just day-to-day variation,” Jain told reporters.According to recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO), the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme should be at or below 5% for at least two weeks before it can be considered that the outbreak is under control in the region. In case the positivity rate rises, WHO recommends increasing testing numbers for prolonged periods of time till the number drops below 5%. Delhi has never dropped below this threshold.To be sure, Delhi has consistently had one of the highest testing rates in the country. The city has conducted over 75,947 tests per million residents against the national average of 26,935.The Capital was the first major hot spot in the country to have successfully reined in the outbreak last month. At the end of June, the city was reporting over 3,400 cases every day at an average, which then dropped in the 900s in the first week of August. But a recent spurt in cases has meant that this number has been steadily rising again and currently stands at over 1,300 new cases a day. HT reported on Sunday that the new-case trajectory in Delhi is currently at a month’s high.There were 1,200 new recoveries reported on Monday taking the total number of people who have recovered to 146,588.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-positivity-rate-inching-up-again-stands-at-7-4/story-JHTfUtu7soOEUkUDVOjiXO.html
25-08-2020||India||54 ex-bureaucrats write to Facebook CEO, seek audit of hate-speech policy||A group of 54 former bureaucrats have written to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to perform a serious audit of the implementation of the social media company’s hate-speech policy in India in a manner that its India policy head, Ankhi Das, is not in a position to influence investigations. “We are writing to you in the expectation that you will make serious efforts to audit the implementation of Facebook’s hate speech policy in India and, while such an audit is underway, ensure that the present Public Policy Head of Facebook, India, is not in a position to influence the investigations,” the former All India Service Officers said in a statement on Monday.The controversy was spotlighted by the Wall Street Journal earlier this month in a report that said Facebook India intervened in content moderation processes to ensure hate speeches by a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader were not taken down – a claim the company has since denied. Facebook India on Friday evening reiterated that it acts in an unbiased manner. WSJ named Ankhi Das in the report.The 54 former officers include ex-Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers Salahuddin Ahmad, Wahajat Habibullah and Harsh Mander, and former Indian Police Service (IPS) officers Shafi Alam, Vappala Balachandran and K Saleem Ali.The letter said Facebook had “failed to implement its own policy of discouraging hate speech in India, or has implemented it in a clearly partisan manner.” The former officers also highlighted the fact that posts on Facebook have often to led to hate crime in India, including lynchings and torture, primarily of Muslims and oppressed castes. “That this (not censoring hate speech by members of the BJP) seems to have been done to protect Facebook’s commercial interests is even more reprehensible… We note that such behaviour on Facebook’s part has become a subject of debate in other countries as well. Commercial interests at the cost of human lives? If these are the crass calculations Facebook indulges in, it is no surprise that the calculus of hate is spreading like a virus in many parts of the world,” the letter said.Hindustan Times reached out to Facebook for a comment, but had not received a response as of press time. Hindustan Times on Friday reported that members of at least three opposition parties are backing Congress MP Shashi Tharoor’s decision to summon officials from Facebook to answer a parliamentary panel over allegations that the social media company acted in a politically partisan manner to benefit the BJP. Facebook has been asked to appear in front of the panel on September 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/54-ex-bureaucrats-write-to-facebook-ceo-seek-audit-of-hate-speech-policy/story-JAeVjs1fwO07sOqnnpOu5I.html
25-08-2020||India||Anti-dumping measure: Tariff on Chinese optical fibre likely||India has found large-scale dumping of optical fibre from China, days after Beijing extended an anti-dumping duty on the import of Indian-made fibre for five years, which could trigger a similar tariff measure by New Delhi against the Chinese product in the local market, two officials aware of development said.The government is considering imposing remedial duty on the import of “single mode optical fibre” after an investigation by the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) confirmed its dumping mainly from China, the officials said, requesting anonymity. The DGTR is a single-window agency tasked with providing a level-playing field to domestic industry against unfair trade practices by countries like China.After a detailed investigation, DGTR on Friday concluded that import of single mode optical fibre at below cost is threatening to cause “serious injury” to Indian manufacturers and recommended imposition of a 10% safeguard duty on its import from all countries except developing nations, barring China, the officials said. The government had already raised basic customs duty (BCD) on it by 5% in July 2019.The finance ministry is expected to take a final decision on the matter soon, they said. Single mode optical fibre is used in manufacturing optical fibre cables used in telecommunication operations such as community access televisions (CATV).“Effectively, the measure is against Chinese firms as combined import from all other developing countries is less than 9%. China alone has a share of over 84% in its import,” one of the officials said.The DGTR’s recommendation came close on the heels of Chinese commerce ministry’s punitive tariff on the same product imported from India for five years, effective from August 14. HT reported the measure on August 13.According to officials, China is resorting to tariff barriers because its companies are suffering from overcapacity, and also diverting its exports to the Indian market in the face of a global boycott of the Chinese products. “Based on complaints by the domestic optic fibre industry, DGTR had initiated the investigation on Chinese dumping on September 23 last year. It had issued a primary finding on November 6 last year, but its recommendations could not be implemented at that time,” the first official said. The second official said India was very cautious about Chinese unfair trade practices, especially after June 15. Sino-Indian tensions have shot up after a violent brawl between Chinese and Indian soldiers on June 15 along the Line of Actual Control in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh in which 20 Indian army personnel and an unspecified number of Chinese were killed.“Given the domestic economic scenario, the finance ministry is expected to accept this,” Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consulting firm DVS Advisors LLP, said. The move cannot be linked to China alone as the government has been indicating its intentions of protecting domestic industry.“In the budget, customs duty was increased for more than 10 products. Since China is a major supplier for India with a huge trade surplus, any action on imports across the board would impact China. Atmanirbhar Bharat {Self-Reliant India} itself is to restrict the influence of China on Indian markets and with relationships soaring, indirect economic sanctions will help both in hurting China and giving a boost to the fortunes of the domestic industry,” he said.Dumping is an unfair trade practice that entails the export of a product at a price lower than its value and is countered by punitive actions, which are an acceptable measure under multilateral trade agreements, the officials said. Remedial actions include imposition of anti-dumping duty (against under-priced imports), safeguard measures (imposition of a duty, a quota, or both against an unexpected import surge) and countervailing duty (against export subsidies) to protect domestic units.India has taken a tough position against unfair Chinese trade practices as it is committed to protecting domestic industry under the government’s Make in India campaign, the officials said. India-China bilateral trade is heavily tilted in favour of China. According to trade figures released by the General Administration of Customs of China (GACC) in mid-January 2020, India’s trade deficit with China was $56.77 billion in 2019; bilateral trade amounted to about $92.68 billion last year, a 1.6% annual increase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anti-dumping-measure-tariff-on-chinese-optical-fibre-likely/story-LHhTYR5IyP7txmCVAEKKwM.html
25-08-2020||India||China dismissed Indian claims over Valley, says Pak minister||Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told a press conference in Islamabad on Monday that during his recent visit to China, the issue of Indian occupied Kashmir also came up, where Beijing dismissed Indian claims over the valley. Qureshi said that China had rejected India’s August 5 move and termed it ‘unilateral’.Qureshi also explained that the purpose of his recent visit was to “understand [China’s] current state of mind and gauge their stance on India”. “I can tell you that I didn’t see any hesitation, their (China’s) stance is very clear,” he said.“China has made clear that it views India’s measures of August 5, 2019 [in Kashmir] illegal,” said Qureshi. China does not stand in agreement with India’s position on Ladakh and Kashmir, he added.According to Qureshi, the stand off between India and China remains unresolved despite five rounds of negotiations between the two. He categorically rejected India’s objections to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor as well.The foreign minister also touched upon the relations of other regional countries with India, saying that the impression that Saarc member countries were “leaning towards India” was “dissolving”.He referred to India’s conflict with Nepal and the recent resolution passed by the latter’s parliament in that regard in addition to “a lack of warmth” in India’s ties with Bangladesh.Speaking on Indian atrocities, the minister said that India has failed to project the impression that things are improving in occupied Kashmir.“The International Crisis Group called the situation in the valley a resistance movement, and has demanded that India rescind its August 5 decision,” he said.The Pakistan foreign minister said that Prime Minister Imran Khan raised the matter of IoK before the United Nations, adding that “India is running away from the matter and lying to the global community”.Qureshi said that New Delhi’s August 5 move had made matters worse for the people of the occupied territory. He said that anger and frustration are on the rise in the region due to restrictions and a communications blackout imposed by authorities.The foreign minister said that India’s move had crippled occupied Kashmir’s economy, wondering how investment could thrive with so many armed personnel holding the local population hostage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-dismissed-indian-claims-over-valley-says-pak-minister/story-J86sraZLjuYigsbTnMnmPL.html
25-08-2020||India||Bhushan stands ground, says he will not apologise||Lawyer Prashant Bhushan stood his ground on Monday, refusing to apologise to the Supreme Court for his posts on Twitter criticising the top court and Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde.In a statement he submitted to the apex court, Bhushan said the views he expressed represented his bona fide (good faith) beliefs and, therefore, offering an apology for expressing such beliefs would be insincere.“An apology cannot be a mere incantation and any apology has to be sincerely made. If I retract a statement before this court that I otherwise believe to be true or offer an insincere apology, that in my eyes would amount to the contempt of my conscience and of an institution (Supreme court ) that I hold in highest esteem,” he added in the supplementary statement submitted through advocate Kamini Jaiswal .According to the details available on the Supreme Court website, the case will be taken up on Tuesday to consider the effect of the supplementary statement submitted by Bhushan.The Supreme Court , on August 20, asked Bhushan to reconsider his stance and offer an apology by Monday failing which, it cautioned the activist lawyer, it would proceed against him and punish him for criminal contempt of court. Even at the time, Bhushan said that while he appreciated the court’s move of giving him time, he would not change his mind. “I believe that the Supreme Court is the last bastion of hope for the protection of fundamental rights, Today in these troubling times, the hopes of the people of India vest in this Court to ensure the rule of law and the Constitution and not an untrammelled rule of the executive. This casts a duty, especially for an officer of this court like myself, to speak up, when I believe there is a deviation from its sterling record,” Bhushan said.He maintained that the tweets put out by him were in good faith and were not intended to malign the apex court or the CJI but only offered constructive criticism so that the court could arrest any drift away from its longstanding role as a guardian of the Constitution.In the written arguments submitted separately by Bhushan’s counsel, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, reliance was placed on attorney general (AG) KK Venugopal’s opinions regarding corruption and nepotism in the judiciary. The AG , during the hearing of the matter on August 20, asked the apex court not to punish Bhushan while highlighting that he himself made a speech in 1987 pointing out certain ills plaguing the judiciary.“Contemnor’s (Bhushan) comments were opinion made in good faith founded on true facts. Similar opinions were made before (in 1987) by the Attorney General. On this basis, the Attorney General has counselled against punishment,” Bhushan said in his written submissions.The court found Bhushan guilty of the offence of criminal contempt on August 14. According to the Contempt of Courts Act, the offence carries a punishment of up to six months in prison or a fine up to Rs 2,000 or both.Bhushan posted two tweets, one against the Supreme Court on June 27 and another against CJI Bobde on June 29.Bhushan’s first tweet said: “When historians in the future look back at the last six years to see how democracy has been destroyed in India even without a formal Emergency, they will particularly mark the role of the SC in this destruction, and more particularly the role of the last four CJIs.”The second referred to CJI Bobde and said: “The CJI rides a Rs 50-lakh motorcycle belonging to a BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader at Raj Bhavan, Nagpur, without wearing a mask or helmet, at a time when he keeps the SC on lockdown mode denying citizens their fundamental right to access justice!”Mehek Maheswhari, an advocate, filed a petition before the Supreme Court on July 9 seeking initiation of contempt of court proceedings against Bhushan for the tweets. Based on Maheshwari’s petition, the court took suo motu {on its own}cognizance of the matter and listed the case for the first time on July 22 and issued notice to Bhushan the same day.After a day-long hearing on August 5, the Supreme Court pronounced its verdict on August 14, holding Bhushan guilty of criminal contempt of court. It however, kept the matter for further hearing on August 20 to decide on the sentence to be imposed on Bhushan.When the case was taken up on August 20, Bhushan read out a statement prepared by him. In his statement, Bhushan expressed dismay at the judgment of August 14 convicting him, stating that the conclusion against him was arrived at without providing any evidence of his motives. He said that he was standing by his tweets, which he described as an attempt to discharge his duty towards the country. He also invoked Mahatma Gandhi’s stance in a case slapped against him by the British government.“I can only humbly paraphrase what the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi had said in his trial: I do not ask for mercy. I do not appeal to magnanimity. I am here, therefore, to cheerfully submit to any penalty that can lawfully be inflicted upon me for what the Court has determined to be an offence, and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen,” Bhushan said.The three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra maintained that it could show leniency only if Bhushan expresses regret and reconsiders the statement made by him on August 20 declining to apologise. “We have given time to the contemnor to submit unconditional apology, if he so desires. Let it be filed by August 24,” the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhushan-stands-ground-says-he-will-not-apologise/story-da2TIjctrhB2IKfBxkq8FO.html
25-08-2020||India||In Bengal, tribal woman gang-raped over relationship||A 30-year-old tribal woman, a widow with two children, was allegedly gang-raped in the early hours of August 19 in the Mohammad Bazar area of West Bengal’s Birbhum district because she defied the residents of her village and had a relationship with a man from a non-tribal community. The woman and the man were allegedly made to face trial at a kangaroo court that asked them to pay a fine of Rs 10,000 and Rs 50,000 respectively, residents said. Instead of paying the money, the woman went to the police and filed a complaint. “All five men named in the FIR {first information report} have been arrested for rape. We are conducting an investigation into the alleged kangaroo court as well,” Subimal Paul, additional superintendent of police (headquarters), Birbhum district, said on Monday afternoon. In her police complaint, the woman said that a religious ritual took place in her village on August 18 and on that afternoon she and the man were forcefully locked up inside a community club and beaten up when they were caught together on the road. Hours later, in the early hours of the next day, five men took her to a desolate place and took turns in raping her, the victim alleged. She and her partner were released on the morning of August 19. In her complaint the woman, however, did not mention the kangaroo court. Police arrested all the five accused between Friday and Sunday. One of them is an elderly leader of the local tribal community. The Suri court on Sunday remanded them in police custody for a week. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that the incident had once again exposed how unsafe women are in West Bengal. “There are numerous incidents that the media never comes to know of. In many cases the rape victims are too scared to lodge a complaint. Also, Kangaroo courts are quite common in rural Bengal because the ruling Trinamool Congress encourages its workers to take the law in their hands,” said Bengal BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bengal-tribal-woman-gang-raped-over-relationship/story-X3uZBxwEHLfVAHZPyN73DI.html
25-08-2020||India||Haryana CM, speaker test Covid+ve ahead of session||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Vidhan Sabha speaker Gian Chand Gupta and two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Monday, ahead of an assembly session scheduled for 2pm on August 26. Both Khattar and Gupta tested positive for Covid-19 in a span of about seven hours, said officials. Khattar announced that he has tested positive for Covid-19 through a tweet in the evening, while Gupta’s test report was made public early in the afternoon.Until Monday evening, three BJP MLAs, excluding the CM and speaker, were Covid-19 positive. Ratia member of legislative assembly (MLA) Lakshman Napa and Indri MLA Ram Kumar Kashyap tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, while BJP’s Ambala City legislator Aseem Goel had tested positive for the virus on August 21. Goel is currently in home quarantine. Another BJP MLA, Mahipal Dhanda, of Panipat Rural constituency, who had tested positive for Covid-19 early this month, recovered last week, while MLA Subhash Sudha, of Thanesar constituency, had contracted the infection a month ago and recovered. On Monday, three employees — a sweeper, cook and room attendant — posted at Haryana MLAs hostel in Chandigarh also tested positive for the coronavirus disease. On Sunday, six Vidhan Sabha employees, including speaker Gupta’s political aide, had tested positive for the infection. More than 350 employees of the Vidhan Sabha were tested for the infection on August 22 in view of the monsoon session of the assembly. The Vidhan Sabha premises will be out of bounds to all, including the lawmakers, until they have a Covid-19 negative report that is not older than three days, according to the regulations in place. Informing about his Covid-19 positive status, Khattar wrote on his Twitter handle : “I was tested for Novel Corona Virus today. My test report has returned positive. I appeal to all colleagues and associates who came in my contact over last week to get themselves tested. I request my close contacts to move into strict quarantine.” Last week, on Thursday, Khattar went into self-isolation after Union water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and a few officials posted at the CM’s residence in Chandigarh had tested positive for coronavirus. Khattar had met Shekhawat iin Delhi to hammer out a solution to resolve the SYL canal logjam. Khattar underwent another test on Monday, the fifth day after his meeting with Shekhawat.

25-08-2020||India||India’s answer to China-backed Thai Canal plan is a huge military upgrade in islands||With Chinese Navy positioning itself for dominance in the Indian Ocean through strings of ports in Myanmar, Pakistan and Iran, India is planning rapid infrastructure upgrade in its Island territories to ensure that there is no restriction on navigation or a replay of the South China Sea in Indian backyard.According to top military officials, India will upgrade the airstrip at INS Kohassa, Shibpur in north Andamans and at the Campbell strip at Nicobar into full-fledged fighter bases. The airstrip at Agatti, in Lakshadweep will also be upgraded for military operations to secure both the Bay of Bengal upto Malacca Straits and Arabian Sea up to Gulf of Aden.“The two Island territories will be like the new aircraft carriers for India, extending the navy’s reach in the region far from the mainland. Both the Islands sit on the busiest sea lanes of the world with more than half the world trade going through this route,” said a tri-service commander. Lakshadweep sits on the Nine Degree Channel, so named because it lies on the 9-degree line of Latitude, north of the equator. The Andamans and Nicobar Islands will allow the navy to dominate the Six Degree and Ten Degree Channels towards Southeast Asia and North Asia.Officials said the infrastructure upgrade had also acquired urgency due to efforts by China, much of it backroom, to get Thailand to start work on the Thai Canal aka Kra Canal that has been on the drawing board for the last 70 years. The canal has been proposed to slice through the Malay peninsula some 800 km south of Bangkok and connect the Gulf of Thailand with the Andaman Sea.It would let ships bypass the choked Malacca Strait, the main shipping channel between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean that has become the world’s busiest trade route. For ships passing between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, it would shorten the distance by at least 1,200 km.There is no unanimity in India’s strategic community on the approach to the Kra canal. One view is that the canal, promoted by China under its Belt and Road Initiative, would pose a risk to India’s long-term maritime security but there is an influential section that sees the construction of the Thai Canal as inevitable given the money China is believed to be throwing at powerful elements in Bangkok.Like when Thailand was to decide on setting up an ad-hoc committee to carry out a study earlier this year, there were raised eyebrows at how Thailand’s fragmented political class demonstrated unprecedented unity in supporting the move. Even parties that are known to be anti-China had ended up supporting the canal. The Thai King, however, is still opposed to the Kra Canal.National security planners believe that India should capitalise on the opportunity - bundled with its own set of challenges - that the Kra Canal offers and offer transhipment ports to vessels bound for either Malacca or Kra Canal. As of now, ships wait for their turn at Sri Lankan ports, earning Colombo precious foreign exchange as well as leverage.Building pressure on ChinaUSS Ronald Regan - The US Navy’s aircraft carrier Ronald Regan and its strike group recently returned to the South China Sea to carry out air operations to demonstrate, what the navy called, the US’ enduring commitment to allies and partners.B-2 Bombers - The US Air Force has deployed three B-2 Spirit Stealth Bombers to its naval facility in Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. The heavy strategic bomber has the ability to deliver lethal, ready, long-range strike options.66 F-16 jets for Taiwan - Taiwan has signed a pact to buy 66 latest F-16s from the United States, the first sale of advanced fighter jets to the island since then US President George Bush cleared 150 F-16s in 1992.It is argued that the infrastructure upgrade in the island territories would serve twin objectives: one, enable India to maximise the economic gains as well as raise its military presence in the Indian Ocean Region.The continuing focus on the infrastructure upgrade also comes against the backdrop of China’s aggressive moves in Ladakh and its reluctance to restore status quo ante. The Chinese aggression has not only prompted New Delhi to reinforce force deployment along hotspots along the LAC but also in the high seas.The Indian Navy is on high alert from the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait in the context of the standoff with China. The instructions to the navy are clear: That they should be prepared for military action if China mounts an attack along the Line of Actual Control, people familiar with the matter said.Indian military officials stressed that the upgradation of air bases in the Island territories would ensure that China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy under its President and commander in chief Xi Jinping, does not dominate the area to extract leverage from all countries in the region.Also Read: Military option on table if talks fail: CDS General Rawat on ChinaFor now, the United States earlier this month flew in its three B-2 stealth bombers to the naval support facility in Diego Garcia in the south Indian Ocean to support the Pacific Air Forces’ Bomber Task Force to deter China from flexing its muscles in the region. Around the same time, the US decided to sell 66 new American-made F-16 fighter jets in the biggest arms sale to the island, a democracy of 24 million people that Beijing claims to be an inseparable part of its territory.A few days later, the United States also moved aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan and its strike group for maritime air defence operations to the restive South China Sea. The US Navy said the training said the Carrier Strike Group participated in cooperative sea drills with the Air Force’s B-1B Lancer to improve “joint readiness response capabilities. The US Navy said the units conducted air-to-air operations, combat search and rescue drills and air defence exercises, according to the Navy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-thai-canal-project-propels-india-to-upgrade-military-infra-in-a-n-lakshadweep/story-EcDEGU2XXGgwdJmRNwm4LN.html
25-08-2020||Editorials||Delhi must not get complacent | HT Editorial||From being among the most-affected regions in the country to battling Covid-19 with relative success, Delhi’s journey has gone through many ebbs and flows. Enhanced testing, strict enforcement of restrictions in containment zones, ramping up health infrastructure, prioritising plasma therapy, home isolation, calibrated opening up of activities involving large crowds in closed spaces, and following social distancing protocols to prevent the disease have all helped in bringing down the number of cases and deaths in Delhi.But Covid-19 is still here — and science is still discovering unknown facets of it. It is in that backdrop that recent figures in Delhi present a warning. As this newspaper reported on Tuesday, the city’s positivity rate (the number of people who test positive out of 100) has increased to 7.4% last week, after dropping to 5.7% in the week ending July 30. On Sunday, the positivity rate was 8.9% — but the weekly average is a better indicator of the spread of the disease. Testing too has reduced in Delhi, with the seven-day average of tests at 17,985, a drop from over 20,000 tests conducted in the week ending July 10. A majority of these tests are antigen tests, which are less accurate than RT-PCR tests.To be sure, the sero survey has indicated that close to 30% of Delhi’s residents may already have the disease, hinting that the Capital may be inching towards herd immunity, and current positivity rates are less than 10%, as Delhi’s health minister Satyendra Jain emphasised. But it is important for both the government and Delhi’s citizens not to turn complacent. Test, trace, isolate, treat, and follow social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/delhi-must-not-get-complacent-ht-editorial/story-k07EF8XZaa5ZmU14CcCEoN.html
