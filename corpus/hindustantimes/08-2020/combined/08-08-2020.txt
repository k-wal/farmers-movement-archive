Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said “from the perusal of the CCTV footage, it is clearly apparent that Mohd Mobin Ali does not appear to be part of the riotous mob” on February 26. The judge said Ali was merely returning from “Phool Wali Masjid” after offering “namaz” when the riots broke out in Usmanpur area. The court granted bail to Ali on a personal bond of ₹20,000 and one surety of like amount while directing him to not tamper with the evidence or influence any witness in any manner and maintain peace and harmony in the locality. According to Ali’s counsel, there was an apparent delay of about 24 hours in recording of FIR. He contended that his client has not been named in the FIR and was in judicial custody since April 20. He said that two CCTV cameras installed at the scene of crime, which is quite near to “Phool Wali Masjid”, clearly showed that the alleged accused person was just coming from the Masjid and going towards his house in the vicinity. However, the police had contended that Ali was identified by an injured person on March 13 after seeing the CCTV footage. He was then arrested under sections of unlawful assembly and attempt to murder. On Friday, the court observed that Ali was unarmed and appeared to be cool, calm and composed before granting him bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/court-grants-bail-to-riot-accused-says-he-appears-calm-composed-in-cctv-footage/story-ez1P7JTzmX3NuItrPMZxeO.html

The report states that there was also an increase in conversion rate (how many of those who enquired for a property actually bought it)-- from nearly five percent earlier to 10 percent in Gurugram. Most enquiries were for properties priced between ₹75 lakh to ₹1.25 crore for sizes 1,400-1,600 sq ft built-up area. Gurugram-based developers and consultants said that affordable properties (between ₹15 lakh to ₹30 lakh) were seeing good traction and 30 per cent demand for affordable housing was from investors, while 70 percent were from end-users, the report said. The report said that, across the country, most buyers preferred ready-to-move-in homes and that salaried professionals and employees from IT/ITeS, pharma, manufacturing industries and government employees were driving the demand. Prashant Thakur, director, Anarock property consultants, said, “Despite site visits far below previous levels, the site-visit-to-closure conversion rate has increased considerably as only serious buyers are venturing out.”The report further said that in terms of the preferred budget range, homes priced between ₹40 lakh and ₹1.25 crore now attract a major chunk of the buyer enquiries. Bengaluru, Chennai, Ghaziabad and Noida are now seeing the most enquiries for homes in the under-₹1 crore category.Pradeep Agarwal, MD of affordable housing company Signature Developers, said that their recently launched projects in Gurugram and on Sohna road were attracting customers. “In July alone, 3000 flats were alloted and not even one per cent allottees surrendered their homes. Around 2,500 flats were launched last month and most were booked by end users in affordable category,” he said. Property consultants also said that they are seeing more enquiries from end-users, who want to have a look at the property and decide on taking it up. Kamaljeet Singh, vice president, Bestech Ltd, said that there has been an uptick in sales and enquiries in last one month. “Home buyers are ready to make visits, look at different properties, but what they want is finished product, which they can see and feel before they buy it,” he said. Vaibhav Jaiswal, a city-based real estate consultant, said that sales of only completed apartments and houses are happening and buyers are showing interest for projects between ₹90 lakh and ₹1.25 crore. “Things are slowly improving but it will take time for situation to normalise,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/residential-housing-sees-green-shoots-with-end-users-looking-for-houses-report/story-4qj2b0ivUAPvoIed32HWFJ.html

One person was rescued, the police said on Saturday, adding that efforts were on with the help of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams to trace the missing passengers. According to the police, the men were travelling in their Swift Dzire car from Bareilly to Chandigarh when the incident took place. “We received information around 12.15am on Saturday and our teams rushed to the spot. One man was rescued, while three others are still missing. The teams from NDRF were also called in and the car was fished out. They all are in the age group of 25-36 years and working as private contractors with a central government agency in Chandigarh. They had planned to make a night stay in Ghaziabad,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural). According to the police officials, the upper Ganga canal at present is having high flow of water. The canal starts from Haridwar and brings in Ganga water which is supplied to NCR areas. The rescued man has been identified as 28-year-old Paramvir Singh, who was driving the car. The other three have been identified as Ashish Dhyani, 30, Sanjeev Kumar, 44, and Vinod Kumar, 30. All four are residents of Bareilly district, the police said. The officials said that while the men were travelling on NH-9, they did not take the Masuri-Dasna flyover and instead took a service road in order to get fuel. “They took the surface service road near the canal. The driver could not guage the road direction at night and the car fell into the canal. The areas where the car went into the canal have no parapet wall. So, the car went straight into the canal. We have alerted the police stations along the canal,” Jadaun said. The police said that the families of the four men were informed. The police on late Saturday said that the three missing men could not be traced. “There is very heavy flow of water in the canal. The rescue efforts will start again on Sunday,” Jadaun added. In an earlier incident on February 1, a group of six friends, including two women, travelling from Dehradun to Mathura met with a similar incident after their SUV plunged into the canal. Two of the six were rescued while bodies of four others were recovered in the next one week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-three-men-go-missing-as-car-plunges-into-ganga-canal/story-3hWr6w0q2uW80MUfEYcjSM.html

The death toll of the district as on August 8 is 64; the last death took place on July 21. Apart from following treatment protocols and using special equipment such as high-flow nasal canulas, the district administration officials said that they have been trying to filter out suspected cases with the help of special surveys as part of the containment exercise, which has helped reduce the death rate. These surveys are specifically conducted door-to-door to trace suspected cases like persons with symptoms of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illnesses (SARI) and send them for testing. These surveys are conducted in both containment and non-containment zones.According to the UP state Covid-19 control room figures on August 8, the district had a total of 5,769 Covid-19 cases, including the 64 deaths. A majority of deaths, 51, took place in June, while there were four deaths from March to May. Nine deaths were added to the tally in July. The fatality rate, till May 31, stood at 1.67%. It was the highest so far at 3.89% in June and dropped to 0.27% in July. In August so far, the fatality rate is zero. “The fatality rate has been on the decline—it is primarily due to our containment systems that entail a defined set of processes such as tracing suspected cases before they turn severe, speedy testing, faster referral of patients who test positive to Covid care facilities through a centralised ambulance system and regular monitoring of patients in home isolation through control rooms put in place for early detection. For early detection, we bank on different surveys across the district while conducting special surveys that are conducted by dedicated teams to specifically trace suspected cases only in containment zones,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, the district magistrate. The Ghaziabad district administration is also operating a dedicated Covid-19 control room to centrally monitor all containment activities and patient-related services. The control room has come up on directions of the UP government. “Using different surveys, we have been able to find suspected cases, such as persons suffering from influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illnesses (SARI). These infections are most likely to aggravate after patients test positive for Covid-19. So, through our surveys, we filter out such persons early and test them. Once positive, they are referred to an appropriate Covid care facility and their treatment starts,” he added. As part of the ongoing survey in containment zones, the health department’s teams surveyed 370,015 houses with population of about 1,469,575 and figured out 344 suspected cases between July 13 and August 6 . “Of these, 36 tested positive for Covid-19. Although the number of positive cases seems low, these were patients affected by ILI or SARI and prone to deterioration in health. They were immediately referred to appropriate Covid care facilities. Over 860 of our teams only survey containment zones. Each team is assigned to cover 75 houses per day,” said an officer from the health department, requesting anonymity. According to the UP state Covid-19 control room figures till August 7, the district comprises 396 containment zones with 84—the majority—under the jurisdiction of Indirapuram police station area, followed by 68 and 57 under the jurisdictions of Sihani Gate and Kavi Nagar police station areas respectively, in Ghaziabad city.Another door-to-door survey is being carried out by block-level officers in both containment and non-containment zones under their respective jurisdictions. The administration officials said that these teams surveyed 404,679 households with a population of about 1,737,617 persons and traced 927 suspected cases from July 1 to August 7. “Of the 927 suspected cases, 15 tested positive for Covid-19 and were referred to appropriate Covid care facilities,” said another officer of the district administration who requested anonymity.Health department officials said that during a survey of 1,737,617 people in both containment and non-containment zones, which was conducted between July 2 and July 12, they found 1,477 suspected cases. Of them, 140 tested positive for Covid-19. The survey had been ordered by the UP government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/special-surveys-help-contain-suspected-cases-lower-fatality-in-ghaziabad/story-ejJDCd0jYHtHDTjRJe9ewO.html

08-08-2020||City||Soon, get your Covid test results on the phone in Ghaziabad||In order to dissuade people from queuing up at testing centres across the district to get their test reports, the health department plans to send them directly to mobile phones.At present, testing facilities are available at several centres across the district at Vaishali, Indirapuram, MMG Hospital, district women’s hospital, four community health centres in Modinagar, Muradnagar, Dasna and Loni, besides one primary health centre at Bhojpur and one sampling centre at IMS, Dasna.“The majority of testing takes place via rapid antigen kits. The reports are given to patients within 30-40 minutes. Issues crop up when people are tested via the RT-PCR method. Such reports generally take one or two days, sometimes longer, to be ready. In such cases, those getting tested have to return to the testing centre to collect their reports. This often results in long queues,” said an officer from the district health department, requesting anonymity.Till August 7, the district completed 129,188 tests, including 73,966 conducted via rapid antigen kits which were brought into use from June 26.“In order to avoid hassling the public, an online system will be started soon and reports will be made available to patients over the phone.This will help curtail travel for fetching reports,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, the district magistrate.Health department officials said that the system is already operational in the district of Kanpur.“The patient gets a message over his/her mobile. The message includes his/her test results and a link to fill out his/her details and opt for the home isolation facility. We are planning a similar system in Ghaziabad and it will be made operational by next week. Patients will not be required to come to the centre for their results,” the district health department officer cited above said.Health department officials said that at present they are conducting about 2,000 rapid antigen tests, apart from 1,000 RT-PCR tests on a daily basis. They added that in the future, they plan to increase the number of RT-PCR tests.“Of the 73,966 rapid antigen tests conducted till August 7, we have to test 26,056 samples again through RT-PCR in order to find true negatives. So,regular RT-PCR tests combined with those administered to find out true negatives result in an increased number of RT-PCR tests. To avoid the increased number of people queuing up for their test reports, we’ll start an online system soon,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/soon-get-your-covid-test-results-on-the-phone-in-ghaziabad/story-3fHanhCANIPbn6Pp6bhboN.html

The facility, set up to handle Covid-19 queries, is equipped with an electric vehicle charging station. The Gautam Budh Nagar administration had on April 3 started an ‘all-in-one’ integrated control room in Noida’s Sector 59 with support from tech giant HCL. Via a toll free number – 1800-419-2211 – the control room catered to 2.5 lakh citizen’s queries since it began operations. Adityanath, after inaugurating a Covid hospital in Sector 39, visited the control room where he stayed for 15 minutes and asked the staff to help persons in need who seek help on the toll free number, said officials.“The control room has been helpful to citizens since its opening and this facility shall continue to strive hard to serve the public in future too,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar. To make this facility environment friendly, the Noida authority set up an electric vehicle charging station near this facility. “There are 41 chargers available at the EV charging station outside the control room. In Noida we have set up 20 electric vehicle charging stations,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of the Noida authority. The authority also beautified footpaths, repaired roads, pruned trees and cleaned public spaces ahead of the CM’s visit to the control room, which has been an epicentre of activity for the welfare of the public since the Covid-19 disease broke out in the district.As per HCL, it responded to at least 2.5 lakh queries related with food supply to migrants, the supply of essential goods in containment zones and other issues related with policing or other issues.

We need to increase surveillance to identify more infected patients and give them proper treatment. For this, dedicated and integrated Covid-19 call centres will be established in every district of the state. Also, the district administration must consult and co-ordinate with the local people’s representatives to create awareness about Covid-19,” he said. Appreciating policing in the district after the implementation of the police commissionerate system on January 14 this year, the CM said his government has given a free hand to the police to take stern action against criminals. “Right from day one of my government, it is a wide and clear message for the police in the state to take the toughest actions possible against criminals, to ensure the safety of the common people. I am really happy with the report that the GB Nagar police commissionerate has brought positive changes in the law and order scenario of the district, by tightening the noose around anti-social elements in the district in such a short span of time,” he said. Earlier, the chief minister inaugurated a much-awaited Covid-19 hospital in Sector 39 –the Noida Covid Hospital (NCH), made under the joint auspices of Tata Trusts and the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. He also instructed the additional chief secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad, to enhance the capacity of beds in this hospital to 400 soon.

This is following a direction from the directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB) in this regard on Saturday. MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh clarified that the campaign should not be considered as a licence to not wear a mask.“Besides attempting to instil the habit of wearing masks in residents, we are also looking at the two-day campaign to identify locations where the violation is rampant. Using this data we will send our teams following the end of the campaign, to such spots accordingly and fine people in bulk. Our main objective is to curb the spread of coronavirus and thus MCG is engaged in various measures towards this cause,” said commissioner Singh.The order from the ULB read: “The violators should be thoroughly educated to understand the benefits and compulsion of wearing masks in the interest of their own safety and the safety of others who come in their contact, for prevention of the spread of Covid-19 pandemic. Wide publicity should be carried out for these two days to inculcate the habit of wearing masks and its benefits should be explained through munadi (beating of drums in public spaces) as well.”It directed the MCG to constitute teams for issuing high penalty for those who violate the mask rule after the culmination of the two-day campaign.As per the ULB’s order, MCG has to submit them a “compliance” report once the campaign ends.Usually, MCG fines people ₹500 for mask violation and gives them five masks on the spot. ULB, however, has directed the civic body to distribute only one cloth face mask to a violator and also extended them the option of dispensing disposable masks if sufficient stock of cloth masks is not available.As per MCG’s sector 42 central store data, where the civic body stores all coronavirus-related items, on Saturday, MCG had a stock of over 153,000 masks, of which only 30,000 were cloth masks.In an order on July 17, ULB had directed all municipal corporations across Haryana to procure cotton cloth masks from self-help groups and distribute five masks instead of one during the issuance of a fine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/in-2-day-campaign-mcg-to-educate-people-on-wearing-masks-instead-of-penalising-them/story-ml3Tlmo3RwLqFj2jC9IgUN.html

Ahaatas, or drinking places next to the vends, will continue to remain shut, officials of the excise department said.The Haryana government on March 26 had decided to temporarily shut all liquor vends across the state after the Covid-19 induced lockdown was imposed. They were allowed to reopen on May 6, but only between 7am and 7pm. Around 218 liquor shops across the city which have been approved to resume operations. Aruna Singh, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (East), said, “The industry has suffered huge losses during the last four months. Even after opening from May 6, sales were low. Officials at the headquarters took the decision to resume the operation on August 1,” she said. “Any shopkeeper violating the lockdown measures or directives, such as allowing ahaatas, could be prosecuted under the Disaster Management Act and the Indian Penal Code,” she said. People at liquor shops will have to maintain at least six feet distance from one another and only five persons will be allowed to enter the shops at any given time, said officials. The police and excise officials had in May marked out lines and circles outside the shops to ensure social distancing for this reason and sanitisers too were placed at the entrance of the shops. Haryana Tourism Corporation had also started running six liquor vends in Gurugram last month as a pilot project to recover its losses. Singh said that it was the first time that a state government entity started to run liquor shops in the district as the tourism department suffered huge losses due to closure of tourism complexes and guest houses during the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19. During the lockdown period, the revenue receipt of the corporation was almost nil, said an official. Shekhar Yadav, director Reva Wines said that this move was required as they have suffered losses worth Rs 5 crore during the lockdown and this is the first time in the history that something unannounced has impacted our business. “The customers who used to buy regularly have decreased their purchase and have reduced drinking as there has been cut outs in salaries and many lay-offs have taken place. There are no longer any parties happening so the sales have come down big time. People prefer buying at night so now we might get some business back,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/night-curfew-lifted-in-gurugram-for-liquor-shops/story-AsMjvyMY4HSHengL18pXnM.html
08-08-2020||City||Warehouses, logistics businesses get industry status in Greater Noida; final nod awaited from Lucknow||The Greater Noida authority on Saturday gave industry status to warehouses and logistics’ businesses in line with the Uttar Pradesh warehouses and logistics rules, 2018 with an aim to encourage setting up of industries and attract investment to fuel growth in this region.The decision was taken during the 119th board meeting that took place at the authority’s Sector Knowledge Park-IV office, under Alok Tandon, who is the chairman for the authority and also the state’s infrastructure and development commissioner. Earlier, the warehouses and logistics’ businesses were not considered ‘industrial businesses’, thereby affecting the investment prospects in Greater Noida, which was established as an industrial city under the UP Industrial Act 1976. After this change in rules, the businesses of warehouses and logistics would enjoy relaxations in Greater Noida’s building bylaws 2010 and would be able to use 60% ground coverage in their respective buildings, said officials.“Now, interested investors would be able to set up warehouses and logistics’ parks on industrial plots in Greater Noida. The move will attract investment into warehouses and logistics’ parks from domestic and international investors. To attract investment, we have changed the permissible floor area ratio from existing 1.00 to 3.00 and the board has approved this proposal. Now, the proposal will be sent to the state government for approval,” said Deep Chandar, additional CEO of the Greater Noida authority. Change in floor area ratio (FAR) means the industrial plot owner setting up warehouses or logistics’ projects can cover more area on a plot and build taller buildings, said officials. The authority had approved its annual budget during its August 4 board meeting. But to make changes in its industrial rules, it organized another board meeting on Saturday after the UP chief minister, who inaugurated a Covid hospital in Noida, left the city. Noida authority CEO Ritu Maheshwari and other top officials were also part of this board meeting. Among some other decisions taken during the meeting, the board extended the date to September 30, 2020 to get building maps approved for plots for information technology projects. The earlier deadline was March 31, 2020.The board also has approved a proposal that allows the authority to sell two commercial plots of 19,000 square metres in Sector Knowledge Park-II. The board also approved a proposal that gives the authority two weeks’ time to address the matters raised in the comptroller and auditor general’s (CAG) objections pertaining to financial issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/warehouses-logistics-businesses-get-industry-status-in-greater-noida-final-nod-awaited-from-lucknow/story-Z6QGclgp3RiVCKUhFoe0jM.html

Two fire tenders were rushed to the spot and the blaze was brought under control in one and a half hour. Of the injured, 10 have been hospitalised while one has sustained minor burns. At around 1.05pm on Saturday, a fire broke out at Jai Mata Di Nashta House, owned by Ravindra Gupta, 34. Gupta, who was in the eatery at the time, sustained serious burns and was taken to Central Hospital, where he died during treatment. According to the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC), a short circuit led to the fire while a leakage from a cooking gas cylinder used at Gupta’s shop led to a blast. “Gupta, who owns the shop, died in the incident while 11 others who were around the shop and reached to help, suffered injuries. Primarily, we suspect a short circuit led to the fire and the blast was due to leakage from cylinders,” said Yuvraj Badhane, public relations officer, UMC. Two fire tenders with 20 fire fighters arrived at the spot and were able to control the blaze. “When we reached, we could see fire bursting out of the shop. Crowding of people outside the shop led to burns to many,” said one fire fighter, requesting anonymity. The fire was brought under control by 2.30pm.President of Ulhasnagar Shopkeepers’ Association, Jagdish Tejwani, said, “The fire also affected the nearby fruit shop. The fruit seller also suffered minor burns.” Of those injured, four have sustained severe burns. Six are receiving treatment in Shri Balaji Hospital and four have been admitted to Shivneri Hospital in Ulhasnagar. One sustained minor burns that do not require hospitalisation, said UMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-killed-11-hurt-in-cylinder-blast-at-ulhasnagar-shop/story-ZwjKEJpRy0tmdV65V1WAhL.html

It helps bring uniformity and do away with the differences. That’s why we see children in schools and our defence personnel wear uniforms. On special occasions, corporate employees also wear a uniform,” said Paul, who is also the president of the party’s mahila morcha in the state.Two types of sarees have been designed. While one has orange and black colours with an off-white base, another has orange and green colours with off-white in the background. The positions of the lotus are also different in both variants. “It is not mandatory for the members to wear the uniform-saree. Any morcha member wanting to wear it, can buy it. It is extremely low priced and will be produced by an NGO. You can’t get a cotton saree priced under Rs 500 in the market. The uniform would cost only Rs 275,” she said.

The mayor was accompanied by councillor Mamta Ashu and adviser of NHAI for Punjab, MPS Kalra. Water accumulation at the chowk has remained a major issue in the past, which is an inconvenience to commuters.“I have also written to NHAI officials, directing them to ensure there is no water accumulation on sites where their projects are currently ongoing. They have also been directed to ensure there is proper disposal of rainwater at all sites in the city. If this issue is not checked now, it might lead to bigger problems in the future.” Mamta Ashu said that there were several complaints of water accumulation at Sherpur Chowk on GT Road. “It was not only causing inconvenience to the public, but can also lead to road accidents. Damage to roads also leads to loss to public exchequer,’ she added.Earlier this week, municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal also conducted a meeting with NHAI officials and sought a solution for the problem. Sabharwal also asked the MC officials to stop nearby industrial units from pumping out rainwater accumulated inside their premises on the road portion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mayor-directs-nhai-officials-to-ensure-no-water-accumulation-on-roads/story-GnyS0YGAHd09oNPtNsnw3H.html

The death toll in the spurious liquor consumption has risen to 121, officials said on Saturday.Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said joint teams of excise and police departments are conducting surprise checks at vulnerable points, which include dhabas in Banur, Zirakpur and Derabassi, as such illegal activities have been reported more often in these areas in the past.“Mohali has a unique position as it borders Chandigarh and Haryana. Liquor is comparatively cheaper in UT and Haryana. So, manufacturing of illicit liquor or lahan is not the main problem in the district but smuggling, pilferage of illicit spirit and ENA, the primary raw material for making alcoholic beverages, is a menace that needs to be curbed,” said Dayalan.“We have had a meeting with the owners of distilleries and bottling plants and directed them to follow the excise laws, failing which stern action will be taken,” the DC added.117 CASES FILED IN MOHALI DISTRICTThe DC informed that 117 cases have been registered under the Excise Act, while 131 accused have been arrested in the past seven months in the district. The seizure of illicit spirit/ENA to the tune of 72,700 litres has been made in less than 12 months.In July, the excise department had detected 5,500 litres of spirit/ENA in Devi Nagar village in Derabassi and nabbed three persons for possessing the large quantity without licence.Earlier in May, a history-sheeter liquor smuggler was caught and over 50,000 litres of ENA was seized from two tankers parked in Zirakpur. Similarly, 15 drums of spirit (3,000 litres) were seized from a dhaba in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-admn-starts-drive-to-curb-pilferage-of-raw-liquor-in-district/story-Mqa4V6EzKdhP4kwxb6AxRI.html

A night curfew from 9pm to 5am was imposed to discourage such gatherings, said civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga while urging residents to show restraint for the next two months. Bagga stressed that it was really important to flatten the curve. “I fail to understand at a time when we are witnessing high mortality and infection rate, a section of people are not bothered and are instead holding house parties. It has been observed that during such gatherings, the risk of spread is more since people remove masks while eating and drinking and do not maintain social distance,” he said.House parties common during lockdownA resident, Deepali (name changed), said that social gatherings were common even during the lockdown and they had increased after the restrictions were eased. “I have been receiving calls and messages from friends about house parties, but I flatly refused. Recently, one among the group tested positive after which the weekend gathering was stopped,” said Deepali.Most of these parties were being organised at farm houses located on the southern bypass, also known as South City road, she added. Dr Bishav Mohan, who is a member of the Covid task force formed by the state, said that a handful of residents were posing danger to the lives of people, especially to elderly and those with underlying illnesses. “We are witnessing a phenomenal rise in fatalities and infection. In such circumstances, it is advised to remain at home and go out only when it is required. Youngsters, who are meeting people due to work, are advised to maintain distance from elderly and children at home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-rise-in-covid-cases-house-parties-in-ludhiana-irk-health-department/story-cifU9zu5Jy2zadDmeXm95M.html
08-08-2020||Chandigarh||HC raises concern over gangster violence in and around Chandigarh||Taking a strong note of rising gangster culture in the tricity, the Punjab and Haryana high court observed that once known for academic achievements, the area is now being rapidly turned into a “hostile city”.“..this court is perturbed over the manner in which such goons trotting with firearms pervade the tricity and gangsters have come to settle here, and such steep number of such incidents in the area is a strong circumstance for this court to take a strong view of the incident,” the bench of justice Fatehdeep Singh said, while rejecting anticipatory bail plea of an accused in a firing incident reported outside Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, in January this year.The HC bench further added that the FIR’s content was strongly suggestive that the accused as well as the complainant side are young boys who have formed gangs and are trying to create an atmosphere of threat to society to lay their claim of supremacy and bravado.THE CASELudhiana resident Jagtar Singh, aka Jaggi, 23, had told police that on January 10, he and a friend, Samar Bhat, had come to GMCH to meet another friend, Lovepreet Singh of Model Town, Kharar, who was admitted there. The two were standing near the emergency when four to five men reportedly attacked them and fled after firing gunshots. A passerby was shot in the arm in this melee. The incident was allegedly the result of Bhat’s standoff with the accused youths over a TikTok video. Police arrested Kamalpreet Singh Sidhu, 24, of Sunny Enclave, Kharar, on June 28,while Dilpreet Singh, alias Billa, 24, who had opened fire, was nabbed from Ropar in July. Three co-accused, including one Nishan Singh Khera, are yet to be arrested.The HC order came on the plea of Khera, who allegedly owned the car used to flee from the spot. He had told court that neither he has been identified nor named in the FIR and nothing was to be recovered from him. He had also produced a compromise deed document effected by both parties in this case.However, Chandigarh Police told court the two groups had a previous history of enmity and a number of skirmishes had taken place between them. Thus, rejecting the bail plea, the court said it has to invoke its extraordinary powers “sparingly” and the compromise effected in this case was to “stifle” the investigations.

As the scheduled flight was taking off around 11:45 am, it suffered a bird hit and the pilots aborted the take-off. The cabin crew announced about the snag through public address system and asked passengers to evacuate the plane.Confirming the incident, BMA director Vinod Sharma said the flight developed minor technical snag which was being attended to by engineers. “There was no damage and all the 176 passengers on board were safe,” he said.The engineers carried out all mandatory procedures and the flight will take off soon, he said.However, the aircraft could not take off on the rescheduled timing at 4 pm as some sparks were noticed. Ranchi airport director Sharma said the plane was taken to runway after re-examination but it failed to take off again, as the technical snag that developed after the bird hit could not be corrected. The passengers were then deboarded and asked to wait in the lounge, he said.Sharma said Air Asia then agreed to despatch another plane from Kolkata.The airline spokesperson said all passengers were being attended to and served refreshments by its staff at the Birsa Munda airport.This is not the first incident of bird hit at Ranchi airport. BMA authorities, in the past, have written to the district administration for shifting temporary meat shops and other food stalls nearby that attract the birds. Sharma said the airport had got security audit done in March 2020. “There was no problem. However, we carry out regular monitoring to ensure safety.” There are 30 regular daily flights from the airport that handles around 2.48 million passengers annually in normal times.However, the passenger volume has shrunk after the coronavirus outbreak. At present, there are 10 regular daily flights from Ranchi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/scare-at-ranchi-airport-as-aircraft-suffers-bird-hit-flight-delayed-by-10-hrs/story-UW83HJkvOOmmUGgwIAyezM.html

Often Bollywood actors have said the same about their cute kitties. While Nimrat Kaur wrote “Paws and reflect” on her Insta post on #coronachronicles with her cat, Alia Bhatt called her cat her “calm in every storm...” So, on International Cat Day, August 8, we ask some pet parents in Delhi-NCR about what life lessons they have learnt from their purry friends. Peace is the key!Fashion designer Nida Mahmood shares that her cat Mr Toffee Tinkerbell has taught her to believe that things always fall into place. “Patience and being zen is what he teaches me. Nothing affects him! I marvel at his ability and try to emulate it in my attitude during testing times,” says Mahmood.   It’s time this isn’t just a ‘day to post something relevant’ on our timelines. We need to live this day, every single day. As if it were all we’ve ever had, and all we’ll ever get. About time we stopped-noticed every little decision we make-commit to making responsible, fair, aware choices. As with even the most insignificant choice and decision we either add or take away from our mother home. It’s always been up to us. All of this. And it always will be. #EarthDay @earthdaynetwork #50Years 🌏♥️ #Kaurantined #StayHome #CoronaChroniclesA post shared by  NIMRATasneem KAUReshi (@nimratofficial) on Apr 22, 2020 at 12:22am PDTA similar sentiment is shared by Noida-based fashion designer Sanskriti Jain. Her two-year-old cat Sheldon has been a constant source of love and emotional support. “I think just watching him sleep so easily and not caring about anything taught me to not take stress. It has been a difficult time for all of us, and I think we cared a lot and took a lot of stress. It’s time to be at ease,” says Jain. Fascination with everythingGhost, a gorgeous white cat in the Asthana household, spends his time cuddling in different laps all day long. “For cats, every moving thing is entertainment... When we’d mull how boring our days had become, Ghost would be out chasing butterflies, or lounging in the sun. He made us realise how rare it’s nowadays to slow down and notice the birds singing or flowers blooming,” says Abhishek Asthana, Wing Commander, Indian Air Force. For his wife, Seema, the cats have served another purpose: “Our cats are self-sufficient — they clean themselves, hunt for food, and are absolutely independent. My sons have so much to learn from these little beings.” Sleep is sacrosanctDelhi-based Karnvir Singh, a graphic designer, says he has begun to value his sleep schedule because of the 20 cats around him. “It doesn’t matter how good boiled chicken or biryani smells; they don’t wake up! They sleep around me, and helped me understand how important sleeping for 10 straight hours is. And it sure feels good,” says Singh, who stays alone and the cats have ensured that he never feels lonely.   my calm in every storm.. ☂️☀️A post shared by  Alia Bhatt ☀️ (@aliaabhatt) on Jul 14, 2020 at 11:50am PDTSingh adds, “Guess what? They have started typing, too, now! Writing ‘asdnabfhasjd2’ on WhatsApp is now more frequent than ever, and I don’t mind telling the person at the other end of the phone that my cat did it.

Most of the outstanding money is to be paid to small and medium scale orchardists.“At a time when orchardists are expecting financial relief from the state government for the loss suffered due to the lockdown imposed and heavy rainfall and hailstorms, they are not being paid the outstanding amounts. This has further increased financial burden on them,” he said.He added that the state government is not making enough efforts to strengthen apple economy during the pandemic situation. “Hiked transportation fares, and unavailability of trays, cartons and labours during the apple season has exposed the anti- orchardist face of the Himachal government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/orchardists-demand-hpmc-himfed-to-pay-outstanding-amounts/story-7D4iF818tZajNKWJuvz5DL.html

08-08-2020||Chandigarh||No sense in denying people the joys of weekends at Sukhna Lake||The move by the Chandigarh administration to close the iconic Sukhna Lake, the city’s pride, on weekends seems to be a knee-jerk reaction to the rising Covid-19 count here.At a time when smart thinking and planning is needed, keeping the lake out of bounds for visitors on weekends does not serve the purpose of reducing the rate of infections as no evidence exists of people contracting Covid-19 while visiting this place.One fallout of this move is likely to have weekend crowds shifting to the markets or parks in the inner areas of the city, close to residential sectors, unlike the fairly isolated lake, leading to increased chance of infections.At a time when people have been confined indoors, the lake offers residents breathing space, especially on weekends. Working people who do not get a chance to exercise on weekdays look forward eagerly to their tryst with the lake. For regulars, this will translate to an inconvenient break from routine.The powers that be have to exercise their imagination to smartly implement social distancing and other Covid-19 safety protocols. Issuing tokens to visitors, regulating the crowds, checking temperatures of people entering the area, even offering free Covid-19 sampling – there are various checks that can be put in place to ensure people enjoy access to the Sukhna they love so much.These are trying times, the authorities have to reassure people that life has some semblance of normalcy, allowing them to enjoy the peace and serenity that’s so much a part of Sukhna.NO ENTRYIs UT admin right in closing Sukhna lake on weekends?

PGIMER is among 17 institutes across the country chosen for second and third phases of human clinical trials of the Oxford University-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine (Covishield).The two-dose vaccine is to be administered with a gap of 28 days.The immunogenicity of the vaccine is evaluated by checking the T-cell and antibody response in the human body after administering the vaccine. This exercise will check both the quantity and quality of antibodies in a participant’s body. The quality of the antibody is its ability to neutralise viruses. “We have received a communication that PGIMER will be taking care of the vaccine’s safety as well as immunogenicity,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER.Principal investigator of the trial at PGIMER, Dr Madhu Gupta, said it will be conducted on 250 individuals here, adding that the ratio for immunogenicity and safety will be communicated to the hospital later. Earlier, PGIMER had given consent to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for the trial to be conducted by the Serum Institute of India (SII), Pune. SII, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by the number of doses produced and sold globally, has entered a manufacturing partnership with British-Swedish biopharma major AstraZeneca to produce the Oxford vaccine.The vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold adenovirus taken from chimpanzees and genetically modified so that it cannot infect humans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-to-test-covishield-vaccine-s-safety-immunogenicity/story-yX4Uywo5qA51NOg107YrQJ.html
08-08-2020||Chandigarh||Guest column: Some calm, some chaos, that’s what farm life is all about||A few evenings ago, father and I were sitting in his lush garden with my daughters playing close by. It was a rare moment of quiet and serenity. Father and I were enjoying the beautiful golden sunset over his orchards. It felt surreal, but I silently wondered whether I would ever love the sedentary, peaceful life at the farm as much he did, visiting the place every day, proudly tending to his gorgeous flowers, overseeing the milking of cows and gathering of fresh fruits and vegetables. Our halo of peace was suddenly disrupted when the girls came running towards us. They seemed to be saying something in rushed tones, pointing towards the small water body in the corner of the garden. Their incoherence and sense of urgency made us follow them quickly. “There’s a baby bird in the water. It can’t swim!”, exclaimed my two-year-old, with eyes as big as plates.My older daughter, being the more sensitive of the two, was teary-eyed as she pleaded, “Save it, nanaji, do something, mama”. We headed towards the little pond to see a small Lapwing chick struggle to stay afloat. Just outside the pond was the Mother Lapwing, pacing up and down and screeching in distress. She knew her offspring was in grave danger, but she was helpless! On seeing us approach, she flew away to some trees nearby. Father and I quickly got down on our knees, and gently rescued the shivering little bird. To our surprise, there were two other little birds in another corner, struggling to stay afloat. We got them out one by one, and placed them gently on the grass. Meanwhile, the kids were jumping up and down in sheer excitement. The next struggle was to find the distressed Mother Bird. We ran towards the orchard, tut-tutting, calling out, but in vain. Mother lapwing was nowhere to be found! We felt nervous, because the sun was setting, and the chicks would be vulnerable to stray cats in the dark. The kids had bonded with the little birds. They ran about in circles after them, giggled and clapped. Watching them alone was sheer joy! All of a sudden we saw Mother Lapwing. She had flown and perched herself on the stone next to the pond and seemed to be looking for her lost offspring. Her screeches seemed to be getting only louder. Father and I picked up the baby birds and put them in Mother Lapwing’s line of sight. We were a little apprehensive about going closer to the already aggrieved bird.The four of us stood in stunned silence as the Mother and her little ones spotted each other. The earlier orange and pink skies had taken on darker hues. However, the bright spark in Mother Lapwing’s eyes could not be missed. On seeing her precious brood, the screeching halted. She swiftly turned around and began walking towards the hedge. Her little ones formed a queue and began following their mother. It looked like an orchestrated performance! Every now and then, the Mother Lapwing would give a side glance, making sure the brood was following her. We watched in amazement as the four of them went behind the hedge, deeper into the farm, back to the safe cocoons of their nest. Maybe the farm life is not all about peace and quiet. It’s much more than that. It is about engaging with nature in such a wholesome way that everything else pales in comparison. Just like we were during those 40 minutes – almost meditative! The heart and mind were in absolute harmony, I contemplate, while watching the beaming faces of father and his granddaughters. seeratsandhu25@yahoo.comThe writer is a Chandigarh-based educationist||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guest-column-when-farm-life-is-all-about-chaos-and-quiet/story-MA9IRZfEDdyBJawsiJvbHM.html

08-08-2020||Chandigarh||Guest column: As a teacher, look for positives to inspire your students||One sees it as a huge privilege with an equally huge responsibility to be a teacher. At home, there are two or three pairs of young eyes observing and learning from the person, whereas, at school or college, the numbers are much larger. It’s not only the content taught, but, the manners, demeanour, attitude and the like, too. Everything is likely to get emulated, in one or the other way. The importance of this can never be overstated. As an educator, Ivan Welton Fitzwater, has rightly said: “The future of the world is in my classroom today, a future with the potential of good or bad. I must be vigilant every day, lest I lose one fragile opportunity to improve tomorrow.” A fragile opportunity it indeed is, because a single uncalled-for action, even if done unknowingly, can destroy the desirable impact of previous actions as one wrong word can harm sensitive minds. What is required is the correct approach to be able to inspire students – but it’s a goal that cannot be achieved easily. The teaching fraternity did, does, and will always try its best to rise to these expectations, by all means. But what about the students? Will they match up to the expectations that their teachers, family, and the society have of them? One will often hear laments that the student population does not care much for values. It’s perhaps with a deep parent-like concern that such views are shared, with a faint ray of hope that the scenario will change for the better. After all, times are changing; and there’s no doubt about that. But, whatever we see/experience in life is mostly a reflection of our own inner world. The notion that students are ‘not as good as they used to be’ needs a second thought. Maybe what’s required is ‘something more’ on the part of the teachers. Similar to a health related symptom or problem that is often a call for a change in lifestyle or situation.Picking from neuro-linguistic programming, a relatively newer approach in psychology, our nerve processes, language and behaviour, are all connected. So, if I negatively criticise a particular student, it’s likely to set my expectations on a similar pattern, which will result in unwanted behaviour by the student.Consider a contrast – I mention that the particular student seems to be having some blocks in the path of achievement, and is yet at least showing up in class. And, I praise him or her for the effort. This will likely raise the subconscious bar of expectation from that student, thus resulting in better outputs. Yes, it’s about being supportive. At the same time, as the definition of ‘Guru’ goes in our revered Upanishads, it’s about removing darkness from the lives of our students. We can’t do that unless we are ourselves ‘mentored’ – be it on our own, or by each other! We need to imbibe that inner voice for ourselves, or though each other. But imbibe we must! Last but not the least, we grant different marks for different types of answers; similarly, we need to have different (customized) approaches, too; for different types of students. One size will never fit all. Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, a remarkable personality who was, and still is extremely dear to every Indian’s heart, always used to say that he would like to be remembered as a teacher. That’s the kind of aura that this noble profession holds. Let us do justice to it. Let us be the epitome of inner strength, wisdom and patience. Let us inspire!

08-08-2020||Chandigarh||Guest column: Partition, Covid-19 and a tale of two migrations||I grew up hearing tales of horror of the days of Partition. Our mohalla had a sizeable population which had migrated from Bahawalpur in West Punjab. “Those were horrible times and we pray that such a catastrophe is never repeated.” These words would invariably be uttered whenever the carnage of the Radcliffe divide was discussed. Driven out from the land where they had lived for centuries millions traversed hundreds of miles on foot, animals or carts to reach their ‘own country’.Over seven decades later the nation witnessed yet another migration, this time caused by a different factor – Covid19. Compelled by loss of livelihood, migrant labourers left their workplaces where they had worked for years. Complete lockdown of all means of transport led to a situation when once again millions of migrants inched forward towards ‘their home states’ on foot, cycles or rickshaws. Though minuscule in comparison of the Partition mayhem, this migration also had many a tale to tell when heat and hunger took its toll. During the Partition migration the idea of India was still in its infancy. The common people exhibited great compassion while lending a helping hand to alleviate the sufferings of the victims of the communal holocaust. They not only welcomed their brethren with open arms, but also accommodated them among themselves in villages and towns. This was when the government was already grappling with the challenges of handling the biggest ever human migration on planet; a parting gift by its colonial predecessors. During the Corona induced migration the response of common citizens was somewhat indifferent. Compassion, the highest form of Dharma for us Indians, was at times conspicuous by its absence. The fear of virus being a convenient alibi, these migrants were left to fend for themselves. Little help came from common citizens who opportunely mortgaged their responsibility to the overstretched administrative machinery. The citizens of a self-reliant nation appeared to be more self-centered than what they were at that stroke of midnight when we got Independence. History has demonstrated that calamities whether natural or man made will continue to plague the world from time to time. What matters is how responsibly our patriotic citizens deal with it and assist the unfortunate in ameliorating their distress. Who knows which calamity will befall us next and who amongst us would be at the receiving end. Calamity after all does not ask your religion, class or even status before intervening in your lives. On the eve of our 73rd Independence Day it is time to introspect and revisit our concept of nationalism. It is certainly more than jingoistic war cries during surgical strikes and frenzy that marks the cricket matches. Nations are not defined just by manmade boundaries marked on the ground; instead, they are known by the ethos and character displayed by the populace. It is nationalism that engenders nations and not the other way round. It took a few years after Independence for the ‘refugees’ of 1947 to get back on their feet. One hopes for a better deal for the refugees of 2020 once they return for work.

08-08-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: The love that flew away||We wonder how coy butterflies alight on a wrist or birds shed inhibitions and take to feeding from a hand extended in warm friendship. Well, wild creatures have a knack of ascertaining human intent but winning their trust can entail a long, patient campaign. The village of Bahu perches at 7,500 feet, nestling among orchards of Royal Delicious and Golden apples, besieged by columns of deodars, pines and rakhal (Himalayan Yew), and gazes in serenity over silvery rapids bouncing over ancient boulders and tumbling through the famed Banjar valley of Kullu. In a quaint little cottage of Bahu sparkling with summer roses, a pair of Himalayan bulbuls had taken to nesting in the garden’s flowering bushes and vines. As the snows fell softly, the family of Deepak Atheist and his parents, Raja Ram and Bhagwati Devi, would put out grains of rice in their lawn for House sparrows, a tradition of Himachali households. The bulbuls, too, partook, of the precious grains and their confidence proceeded inch by inch in the direction of their benefactors. “One day in winter 2018, one of the bulbuls alighted on my hand to eat flakes of jaggery. Then I started putting out raisins on my hand and the bulbul loved these. The bulbul would visit my hand four to five times a day, so fond it was of raisins. It would chatter happily on my hand but its mate somehow never mustered the confidence to fly to my hand. Along with a Streaked Laughing thrush, the bulbul would await at our kitchen door in the morning, hop inside and gobble grains my mother had kept,’’ Deepak told this writer.One day this summer, one of the two loves of Deepak’s life, the bulbul, flew away into the gorges with a large group of bulbuls. The ditched mate struck another romance and paired. However, the thrush has yet not flown away from Deepak’s hand and his mother’s warm and welcoming kitchen.THE LOVE THAT STAYED The thrush that stayed back at Deepak’s home is a species found commonly in our hill stations, foraging around in flower beds and kitchen gardens in groups, singing gloriously in a chorus, and feeling quite at home in human presence. Its song has been described as a “short, rapid trill followed by a loud ringing whistle” or even as “highly variable (notes), brief but often complex; first note often starts off with a distinct bubbling quality. Gives various high call notes.’’Deepak’s thrush had picked up courage to wait outside the kitchen and the bulbul followed suit ever since December 2018. Like the bulbul, the thrush, too, relished the raisins in Deepak’s hands. “Whenever the thrush does not find grains in the lawns in the early morning, it will come to our kitchen window or the door and sing sweet songs to catch our attention. Whoever amongst us goes to the kitchen first in the morning has to only open the door slightly and the thrush will hop into the kitchen for grains. The thrush lives in a group of four to five around our garden. The one that comes to us is a moody, playful and naughty creature. If in a good mood, the thrush will come to me while I am standing and start climbing from my feet upwards like a pet mouse and finally perch and frolic on my head,” said Deepak. A day will come when the thrush, too, will leave Deepak...but true love means he will let the bird go.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-the-love-that-flew-away/story-GbwGdweuDKURo4YX1rEYYM.html
08-08-2020||City||Faridkot RTA to inquire into death of Abohar prof at Faridkot medical college||Faridkot A day after Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh expressed his dismay at the death of an Abohar associate professor, Parwinder Singh Kamboj, 46, at Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital in Faridkot on July 23 in his Facebook Live session on Friday, the district administration has started investigation into the case of alleged negligence in the treatment of Kamboj. Kamboj had been admitted to the isolation ward of the hospital after being suspected to be infected with covid-19. However, he tested negative a day after death. On the directions of the department of health and family welfare, the district administration has asked Faridkot regional transport authority (RTA) secretary Paramdeep Singh Khaira to conduct the investigation.“I have started investigation. There has been some delay due to covid-19 as one of the three doctors that the family has accused had tested positive. My own office was sealed after three of my staff members tested positive. I have summoned the wife of the victim and the accused doctors. The report will be submitted soon,” Khaira said.Neeta Pandhu Kamboj, the wife of the victim, has alleged negligence in treatment of her husband and delay in receiving covid-19 test reports, which prevented them from taking treatment from a private hospital. She claimed in a social media post that her husband developed mild fewer on July 16 and a slight throat ache on July 18, after which they both gave their swab samples for covid-19 testing on July 20 at the Abohar civil hospital.“The report was not available by July 22. Meanwhile, my husband’s condition deteriorated so I got him admitted to civil hospital, from where he was referred to Faridkot,” she stated.She has alleged that despite not having any symptoms of covid-19, he was admitted to the isolation ward. She stated the Faridkot hospital authorities did not provide proper treatment and wasted time in paperwork instead of providing immediate treatment. “I received my husband’s covid-19 report on July 24, in which tested negative,” she added.Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS) vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur said the university had already completed an internal inquiry and the report had not been submitted as administration’s inquiry is underway. “We have not disclosed the report, as it may affect the other probe, after the completion of which we will submit our report to the CM,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/faridkot-rta-to-inquire-into-death-of-abohar-prof-at-faridkot-medical-college/story-ccQICfSArcvGgo4ElvvE8I.html

The security guard, Subash, hailing from Sonepat and currently living in Indira Colony, Manimajra, and the paan seller, Kishan Kumar Patel of Manimajra, have been arrested.“Subash, an ex-serviceman, had handed over his loaded weapon to Patel before going to get liquor during their drinking session. Meanwhile, Patel fired gunshots, leaving two persons injured,” said a senior police official. While Patel claimed the gun fired while he was keeping it aside, police have not believed his story. Besides, the footage from a CCTV camera installed at the liquor vend had captured Patel opening fire and fleeing from the spot.“We have recovered the weapon. The accused were produced before a court and sent to judicial custody,” said inspector Yashdeep, SHO, Mansa Devi Complex (MDC). He said, “Both parties neither know each other nor had any argument.” A case under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code and Arms Act was registered at the MDC police station. The case was registered on the complaint of Satpal, 29, a building contractor hailing from Pinjore, who sustained injuries in the ankle. A bystander, identified as Heera Lal, who works as a mechanic in the Manimajra motor market, also suffered pellet injuries. Both were rushed to the civil hospital in Sector 6, Panchkula. According to Satpal, he and his two friends had stopped their car near the traffic lights as he wanted to relieve himself. As he went behind the liquor vend, the gunshots were fired, injuring him and another man. He had seen the accused run away, as per his statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/firing-outside-manimajra-liquor-vend-pan-seller-security-guard-held/story-863KJW0QAFRnhRE18wcfKK.html
08-08-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER healthcare staff can home-isolate as per new quarantine policy||Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has come up with a new policy for quarantining its healthcare workers in case they suspect infection or test positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The health workers will be allowed home isolation rather than being admitted in the Nehru Hospital Extension, which is the city’s dedicated Covid-19 care centre.“Those who have better facilities at home can go for home isolation. The step has been taken in view of rising Covid-19 infections. The healthcare workers opting for the same will be cross-checked by the officials of Chandigarh administration as per the procedure laid down earlier,” said PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram.As per the new protocol, the healthcare workers having symptoms like fever, cough, breathlessness and sore throat will get tested for Covid-19 at the screening OPD and ‘self-isolate’ till the results arrive.Besides, the staff exposed to Covid-19 patients will be categorised as high or low risk. While the low-risk staff can continue work with normal precautions and self-monitor for symptoms and get themselves tested on the fifth day of exposure, the high-risk workers warrant quarantine with testing on the fifth and seventh day.The protocol says that in case the test result turns out positive, the health workers will be isolated in either NHE or their homes for 14 days. However, health workers with high index of suspicion will be tested again after 72 hours.The protocol also suggests that all health workers should at least wear surgical masks with visors and gloves during patient care and have their meals and tea only in isolation during the duty hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-healthcare-staff-can-home-isolate-as-per-new-quarantine-policy/story-2nK2V0A1EiVxGorf8PtYKP.html

08-08-2020||City||LeT’s terror funding module busted in Jammu, 5 arrested||Security forces have arrested five overground workers of the proscribed Lashkar-e-Taiba terror financing network and foiled their bid to revive the outfit in the Jammu region, said inspector general of police (Jammu region) Mukesh Singh on Saturday.The arrests come barely a week before Independence Day.The network was busted on the information provided by the Army, which gave intelligence inputs about efforts to revive it in Jammu city.The arrested overground workers have been identified as Moulvi Tauqeer Ahmad Batt of Sazan in Doda, Asif Batt of Sazan, Doda (a surrendered terrorist and former special police officer in J&K Police), Khalid Latief Batt of Kotal in Doda, a contractor, Ghazi Iqbal and Tariq Hussain Mir.On July 19, a team of SOG Jammu had apprehended one Mubashir Farooq Batt of Sazan, Doda (a student of BSc nursing at Kharar) with a consignment of ₹1.5 lakh of Hawala Indian Currency concealed in a box. A case under Sections 17/18/20/21/38 and 40 of UAPA Act 1967 was registered at Peermitha police station. “During the investigation of the case, SOG Jammu apprehended five more suspects involved in the module. They have confessed to their involvement in the case,” said Singh. The IGP said that all the six accused were in contact with Pakistani handler identified as Mohammad Amin Batt aka Haroon of Kathawa, Thathri in Doda. “He remained a district commander of the LeT in Doda and exfiltrated to Pakistan in 2007,” said the officer. “All of them were tasked to identify naive and gullible youth for recruitment in terror ranks, providing logistics and strengthening LeT cadre in the region, sharing information about the presence of security forces and their important locations to Pak handlers, transportation of arms and ammunition from one location to another and distributing money among the families of active terrorists,” he added. During questioning of all the six overground workers, it has come to the fore that they received money amounting to ₹12,19,704 through different means on different occasions as part of this module. They were also instrumental in recruiting Abid Ahmed Bhat of Sazan, Doda, who was killed in an encounter and Jamal Din of Doda, who surrendered before the security forces. During the interrogation of a suspect identified as Mohammad Irfan Khan of Bijarni in Doda, it came to the fore that he along with two of his associates Ghazi Iqbal and Amir Batt had hoisted Pakistani flag at Lal Draman in Doda. “The involvement of four accused from Kashmir has also surfaced. Moreover, it has come to light that the module has its links in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab as well,” Singh said. Further investigation into the case is underway to unearth terror financing channels and overground worker’s network used for providing financial support and motivating youth to join terror outfits in J&K, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/let-s-terror-funding-module-busted-in-jammu-5-arrested/story-zfyVetDwuXlzTPEa5KKmXO.html

Only Fatehabad district excise and taxation commissioner has submitted information regarding missing liquor with the Special Enquiry Team while other districts asked the SET to get details about liquor missing from the excise department,” Chautala said.Hitting out at his nephew Dushyant Chautala, Abhay said he had given a clean chit to excise and taxation commissioner Shekhar Vidyarthi against whom home minister Anil Vij recommended action on the basis of report compiled by the SET. “The excise minister has directly challenged chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar over SET report. During the lockdown, police had laid nakas across the state but it failed to stop vehicles loaded with liquor, which was supplied to many parts of the state and country. I urge the CM to take strong action against Vij and Dushyant. If he fails, then the CM too involved in the business of illegal liquor smuggling,” he said.Chautala alleged that liquor kingpin Bhupinder Singh is also linked to leader of opposition (LoP) and he had given Rs 31 lakh to Hooda as donation when the latter fought the 2019 parliamentary polls from Sonepat. “The LoP’s silence raises serious doubts over his connection with liquor kingpin,” the INLD leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dushyant-vij-involved-in-liquor-smuggling-abhay-chautala/story-urRzwBawuhkfkrhX6GuwOO.html

This land is part of 4,000-kanal land sold out in the same area.Refusing to name the minister, Mankotia said that he wants to know from CM Jai Ram Thakur whether he knows about the involvement of his minister in such corrupt practices.“I want to hear from the CM,” said Mankotia, adding that he has written to the CM, PM Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, BJP president JP Nadda and veteran leader Shanta Kumar in this regard.Mankotia alleged that prima facie it appears that a major land purchase mafia allegedly linked to a Cabinet Minister is operating in the region.Listing some land deals, he said that apart from the land mentioned above, the minnister’s family are in possession of 18 kanal land in Darini sub-tehsil of Shahpur. “A hotel is coming up in Upper Bhagsunag ward of Dharamshala over a 2.3 kanal land, and the same people own this land,” said Mankotia.He alleged that some time back reports of large scale forest and government land and appropriation of a Nullah was reported by these persons in Bhasunag.“This cabinet minister and their family are involved in the illegal felling of Deodar trees for construction of the aforesaid hotel,” he alleged.Mankotia said that these people have also purchased 20 kanal land at Baghni near Tapovan in the outskirts of Dharamshala. Apart from this, they also own a plot in Gamru ward of Dharamshala.“In interest of justice, CM Jai Ram Thakur owes it to the pubic of Himachal to direct CBI probe in this matter,” he said, adding that it is just the tip of the iceberg. These people may be involved in more such deals, he said.Mankotia said that a state government agency cannot carry out free and fair probe in this matter, thus, CBI investigation is necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mankotia-alleges-involvement-of-himachal-cabinet-minister-in-dubious-land-deals/story-ZCW5Jz0Tq53UEQmqHYQZbK.html
08-08-2020||Chandigarh||PU senate elections set to witness two-cornered contest||With the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) group joining hands with DAV group and Sangha group against the alliance of Navdeep Goyal and Ashok Goyal, the Panjab University senate elections are headed for a two-cornered contest this year.Polling for the 91-member apex governing body of the university will start on August 24. The last senate elections were held in 2016. Of the total 91 members, 36 are nominated by the varsity’s chancellor.The term of the new PU senate will begin in November 2020 and last till October 2024.Highlighting the need for a major alliance against the Goyal group, the BJP group, which is led by senator Subhash Sharma, will contest the elections in alliance with DAV group led by Gurdeeep Sharma and Sangha group led by SS Sangha and Varinder Singh Gill.During the last election of PU senate, Ashok and Navdeep were in opposite camps. The alliance between their power groups was forged during the syndicate elections of 2018. Earlier, the two rival alliances – Goyal and BJP groups – also held differing views over the conduct of senate elections amid the pandemic and wrote letters to PU’s chancellor M Venkaiah Naidu. CONSTITUENCY OF FACULTIESThe election from the constituency of faculties is scheduled on August 24, with both alliances pitting their contestants against each other. Interestingly, both Ashok and Navdeep are contesting from faculties, which will contribute six members to the senate.In the faculty of arts, Ronki Ram from Goyal group will contest against Anju Suri of the opposite camp, who is contesting for the first time.

New panchayats are to be formed by January for which election process has started.He said that the state government is not ready for elections so they do not want to conduct polls. “First they tried to avoid elections on pretext of Covid-19 and now they are trying to do the same on pretext of creating new panchayats. There is no provision to extend tenure of exisiting panchayats so government is trying to occupy the panchayats by imposing favoured committees,” he said.Agnihotri said that CM Jai Ram Thakur has himself been panchayati Raj minsiter and is familiar with constitutional process of creating new panchayats. It will be foolish and immature to create such a crisis,, he added.He said that if the state government wanted to create new panchayats, all formalities should have been started last year. But considering creation of new panchayats all of a sudden will postpone elections by at least a year.He said that the DCs have completed process of delimitation and demarcation, boundaries have been fixed and voter lists have been finalised. Postponing polls now will put burden on the state government’s treasury as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-move-court-if-hp-govt-tries-to-postpone-panchayat-polls/story-PfpqjEBEuC9ffkRfCnPlkN.html
08-08-2020||City||Tricity buzz: HT Chandigarh reporters’ tracker on all those making, of faking, news||Stray cattle have field day near Mohali MC office Mohali’s stray cattle problem was discussed and debated endlessly at the municipal corporation meetings but nothing much changed for the city’s residents on the ground. The MC’s five-year term ended on April 26 and stray cattle are having a field day right outside the MC premises. With officials failing to act, stray cattle occupy roads in Sector 68, causing accidents and inconveniencing commuters. When will the authorities wake up? UT Secretariat staff edgy after two positive cases With two Covid-19 cases reported in two days in the UT Secretariat, the anxiety among staff is palpable. “It is getting harder for us to attend to office work with cases being reported from the secretariat. Even other offices such as the UT treasury and estate office have reported positive cases. Still the administration is not adequately sanitising offices nor are employees taking proper precautions. We are worried,” said a UT employee requesting anonymity. Chandigarh cops don’t upload FIRs regularly, glitch or tactic? Chandigarh Police don’t upload first information reports (FIRs) on their website regularly. This is a violation of Supreme Court directives of 2016 by which all states and UTs have been asked to upload FIRs except sensitive cases. This initiative was taken to save people the hassle of visiting police stations to get a copy of the FIR. But Chandigarh Police either do not upload or selectively upload FIRs. Some police stations in town don’t upload a single FIR throughout the month but suddenly as the new month begins, all FIRs are available online. Is it a glitch or a tactic to avoid information reaching the media? Chandigarh cops on the trail of a stolen flowerpot Chandigarh Police are on the lookout for a stolen flowerpot belonging to a former law professor. DN Jauhar, a former chairman of Panjab University’s department of laws, got a first information report (FIR) registered at the Sector 39 police station after a flowerpot was stolen from the boundary wall of his house last week. The police are yet to zero in on the thief and recover the flowerpot belonging to Jauhar, who is also a former dean of Guru Nanak Dev University, but they insist investigation is on even if it’s an ordinary planter. Be careful what you wish for The association presidents of smaller, congested markets, including Shastri Market in Sector 22, Sadar Bazaar in Sector 19 and Patel Market in Sector 15, are having their way with the Chandigarh administration taking a U-turn on the odd-even formula in these markets. They wanted the rule to be abolished in June, but once markets opened in July, they reported a dip in sales due to larger competition son they wanted to go back to the previous arrangement. The odd-even rule is back in August in these markets to prevent congestion and check the spread of Covid-19, but it is too early to see whether their problems will finally be solved. Focus shifts from counting cases to saving lives With the Covid-19 infection spreading across sectors of Chandigarh besides the UT’s periphery, the health authorities are now are not as concerned about the increasing numbers since the focus has shifted to saving lives of the seriously ill. A senior health officer said that the numbers were bound to increase when the decision to remove curbs on movement and businesses was taken. However, testing has been ramped up but the real challenge is in saving lives of high-risk patients by timely diagnosis of infection and treatment. Not welcome to Panchkula any longer The Panchkula district administration sure has its unique way of welcoming commuters. If earlier it was bumpy roads the moment one took a turn towards Sector 7 from the Housing Board traffic junction, now it’s the arch with missing letters that half-heartedly greets people. These days, one only finds ‘Pankula’ written on the arch with ‘welcome to’ missing. The poor maintenance makes one wonder how long before the rest of the alphabets fall, and on whom!

JKPCC has written to respective district magistrates to allow the party to organise functions at party headquarters in Jammu and Srinagar, although in a simple and symbolic manner to mark the important event in the freedom history of the country, said chief spokesperson Ravinder Sharma. Sharma added that the importance of the day calls for celebrations every year to carry forward the spirit and sacrifices of crores of people who contributed to the freedom under the Indian National Congress led by Mahatma Gandhi. The August Kranti movement was the turning point in the history of the freedom struggle as Mahatma Gandhi gave a call to launch the quit India movement from August 9, 1942, calling upon Britishers to leave India and exhorted countrymen to “do or die”. In view of this significance and since the INC launched the movement, the party wants the tradition to be carried forward, observing all social and administrative norms of Covid but permission should be granted at all costs for the national importance day, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-seeks-special-permission-to-hold-functions-for-historic-august-kranti-diwas/story-5iYoevDdSrjKkL0KDSGj6K.html

08-08-2020||Jaipur||Six Rajasthan BJP MLAs shifted to Gujarat’s Porbandar||The BJP on Saturday shifted six of its MLAs to Gujarat’s Porbandar ahead of the Rajasthan assembly session beginning August 14, according to party sources. They left on a chartered flight for BJP-ruled Gujarat from the Jaipur airport. The legislators will be staying at a luxury resort there and likely to visit the Somnath temple, the sources said. According to them, 12 party MLAs on Friday had left Rajasthan for Gujarat’s Ahmedabad where they camping at a resort. However, state BJP chief Satish Poonia rejected suggestions that his party has started herding their MLAs to a place like the Congress did ahead of the crucial assembly session. Congress MLAs are holed up in a Jaisalmer hotel as the party has accused the BJP of horse-trading following the revolt of its leader Sachin Pilot and 18 MLAs loyal to him against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot. All legislators are “united and there is no distrust”, Poonia said, adding that people in the Congress government are trying to “spread rumours and confusion” about BJP MLAs on social media and other forums. Poonia said soon a meeting of the BJP legislature party will be held, which will be attended by all MLAs. Meanwhile, BJP MLA Ashok Lahoti, who accompanied the six legislators to the Jaipur airport, said they were being “harassed” and voluntarily went on a pilgrimage. “Some BJP legislators are being harassed through police and the administration. Those legislators who are being harassed have gone on a pilgrimage voluntarily,” Lahoti told reporters after coming out of the airport. Deputy Leader of the Opposition Rajendra Rathore said, “If some BJP MLAs went on an educational tour or roam around collectively then it cannot be termed ‘badabandi’ (fortification).” He said the BJP stays away from such a culture. The BJP legislators who boarded the flight from the Jaipur airport on Saturday are Nirmal Kumawat, Gopichand Meena, Jabbar Singh Sankhla, Dharamveer Mochi, Gopal Lal Sharma and Gurudeep Singh Shahpini. The airport authorities too confirmed that six passengers were on the flight to Porbandar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/six-rajasthan-bjp-mlas-shifted-to-gujarat-s-porbandar/story-XhCT7jkiSFKSlV4EU2pu9O.html

Leaders of mainstream political parties also targeted Subrahmanyam for stating “unbelievable levels of fraud” were committed by leaders of mainstream parties and separatist organisations. Even the newly launched party, Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party (JKAP) blamed the senior-most official of the J&K administration for breach of service rules “which are legally and ethically unwarranted”. Recently in an interview, Subrahmanyam said the J&K was a ‘broken state’ without any ‘proper system’ where frauds were committed by leaders of mainstream parties and separatists organisations. JKAP senior leader and former minister Ghulam Hassan Mir said “All the government employees including bureaucrats are supposed to remain apolitical and give people a fair deal of governance which is entirely lacking in J&K.” He said that an officer of the rank of chief secretary in J&K seems to have forgotten about service conduct rules which warrant serving officers not to talk about issues pertaining to politics and instead should work for strengthening the institutions of governance on the ground. Former minister in BJP-PDP coalition government and senior J&K People’s Conference leader Imran Raza Ansari termed this as an effort by a government official to dismantle mainstream parties. ‘’Chief secretary J&K – Takes pride in dismantling, discrediting mainstream,’’ he said in a tweet.In another tweet, Ansari said: “So chief secretary has been here for two years and you have been the boss. Wonder how many people will cry if you are arrested. Hope you focus on your job rather than dabbling in politics. Please for god’s sake do your job what you are best at deciding new date for the meeting).”Another former minister and senior PDP leader, Naeem Akthar said, ‘’The fact that he timed it with the swearing-in of new LG adds a different dimension to it, given the impression that the new incumbent is to revive political process. Interesting timing and method to help achieve that.’’People’s Democratic Party (PDP) also criticised the remarks on its official twitter handle by stating “Sad state of affairs when a top bureaucrat no less than Chief Secretary takes pride in dismantling & discrediting mainstream in #Kashmir and brags about @PMOIndia @narendramodi backing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-chief-secretary-triggers-political-row-says-none-cried-at-politicians-detention/story-bj0ayTm8Ztk8iNukXzntKK.html

08-08-2020||Chandigarh||Citing zero threat perception, Punjab govt withdraws Bajwa’s security||Chandigarh: The Punjab government has decided to withdraw the state police security from Congress MP Pratap Singh Bajwa after an assessment showed that he had virtually no threat perception and was, in any case, getting central security directly accorded to him by the Union home ministry An official spokesperson said that the state police security provided to Bajwa had become redundant since he had procured personal security directly from home minister Amit Shah. “A mixed security component is, in any case, not considered good, particularly when the Rajya Sabha MP has, by opting for central security, showed that he had no faith in the state police,” the spokesperson said in a release here on Saturday. The decision comes after Bajwa, a former Punjab Congress president, criticised the Capt Amarinder Singh-led government’s handling of the hooch tragedy case and demanded an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or Enforcement Directorate (ED) into it. ‘CENTRAL SECURITY NOT AT BEHEST OF CONG LEADERSHIP’ According to the spokesperson, contrary to claims made by Bajwa, the central security he had got was not at the behest of the Congress leadership. “In fact, the Union home ministry had not even consulted the state government to gauge the threat perception, which is usually done before providing central security to any person,” the release said. Bajwa, as Rajya Sabha MP, may have simply approached the party’s leader in the House, Ghulam Nabi Azad, to seek central security, and as is the norm, the latter could have simply sent his request to the Union home ministry. However, for some reason, the home ministry chose not to discuss the matter of Bajwa’s threat perception with the state government in this case, which was a clear deviation from the norm followed in such cases, the spokesperson said. ‘SHOULD HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN EARLIER ‘The spokesperson said that Bajwa has been getting enhanced security from Punjab Police all this time, way beyond what he was entitled to as a Rajya Sabha MP. This was because the state government decided not to withdraw the greater security he had at his disposal as Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president. Ideally, the enhanced security should have been withdrawn as soon as he became MP, with virtually zero threat perception. Bajwa was given Z category security by the MHA on March 19 and as of date has 25 CISF personnel for personal security, house protection and escort, besides two escort drivers. Till March 23, he also had 14 Punjab Police personnel deployed with him but a few were withdrawn for Covid duties. At present, he has six Punjab Police personnel and an escort with driver, which is now being withdrawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/citing-zero-threat-perception-punjab-govt-withdraws-bajwa-s-security/story-pIrOSXvdb5mO5lFrhhaAsJ.html

08-08-2020||Lucknow||UP CM will be invited to lay stone for public facilities on land for mosque in Ayodhya: Official||Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will be invited to lay the foundation stone for various public facilities at a mosque to be built in Ayodhya’s Dhannipur village by a trust formed by the state Sunni Central Waqf Board, one of its officebearers said on Saturday.“On the five-acre land in Dhannipur village, which has been given for the construction of a mosque on the Supreme Court’s directive, a hospital, a library, a community kitchen and a research centre will also be built. These will be for the public and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will be invited to lay the foundation stone for these projects,” secretary and spokesperson of the trust -- Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF) -- Athar Hussain told PTI.Also read: From Kashmir to Ayodhya, the BJP’s total domination of politicsHe said the chief minister will not only participate in the programme, but will also assist in the construction of these public facilities.To a question on whether Adityanath will lay the foundation stone for the construction of the mosque, Hussain said according to the four schools of thought in Islam -- Hanafi, Hanbali, Shafi and Maliki -- there is no provision for laying the foundation stone for a mosque.Asked whether the mosque will be named as “Babri Masjid”, Hussain said, “There is no such thinking. The name is yet to be finalised.” “Barring the Masjid-e-Nabwi (Madina in Saudi Arabia) and a few other mosques, the names of other mosques do not matter. In the eyes of Allah, the ‘sajda’ done at the mosques is important, everything else is meaningless,” he added.The trust constituted by the Uttar Pradesh State Sunni Central Waqf Board to construct the mosque is in the process of setting up an office in the state capital, which will be functional in 10-12 days.“The trust has been formed. In accordance with rules, we have applied for a PAN card in its name and awaiting its delivery, after which we will meet online and pass a resolution for opening a bank account. We met online last month. As of now, we have identified an office space and renovation work is going on there. It will take 10-12 days for the work to be completed, after which the office will be functional,” Hussain said.The state government has allotted a five-acre land in Dhannipur for the construction of the mosque. The IICF will oversee the construction of the mosque, the Indo-Islamic research centre, the library and the hospital on the land.A member of the trust said, “Ayodhya District Magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha has formally handed over the possession of the land for the mosque to the trust members. We have got a certified copy of the revenue record.” The Supreme Court had, in November last year, paved the way for the construction of a Ram temple by a Trust at the disputed site in Ayodhya and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a “prominent” place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh.The trust will have 15 members, of whom the names of nine have been declared and the rest will be finalised soon. “We will co-opt the remaining six trustees. The secretary of the trust will also be its official spokesperson,” a member of the trust said.Meanwhile, the Samajwadi Party (SP) sought an apology from Adityanath on Friday over his remark that he would not attend the inauguration of the mosque to be built in Ayodhya, replacing the demolished Babri Masjid.After the “bhoomi pujan” for the Ram temple in Ayodhya, the chief minister had said on television that “as a yogi and as a Hindu”, he could not go for the inauguration of a mosque.“If you ask me as a chief minister, I have no problem with any belief, religion or community. If you ask me as a yogi, I will definitely not go because as a Hindu, I have the right to follow my way of worship and act accordingly,” he had said.“I am neither ‘vaadi’ nor ‘prativadi’ (neither petitioner nor respondent). That is why neither will I be invited, nor will I go. I know that I will not be getting any such invitation,” Adityanath had said.“The day they invite me, the secularism of many will be in danger. That is why I want that their secularism should not be in danger and I continue to silently work to ensure that everyone benefits from government schemes without any discrimination,” he had said.SP spokesperson Pawan Pandey criticised Adityanath over his remarks, saying he had violated the oath he took while assuming charge as the chief minister.“He is the chief minister of the entire state and not only of the Hindu community. Whatever the population of Hindus and Muslims in the state, he is the chief minister of all. This language of the chief minister lacks dignity. He should seek an apology from people for this,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-cm-will-be-invited-to-lay-stone-for-public-facilities-on-land-for-mosque-in-ayodhya-official/story-3Xh3OFUuvuNziqnzaWgiLJ.html

Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Aaswant Dhaliwal, the investigating officer, said Switzerland-based Proton Mail has not responded to the police request to share information about the email user identity of the unidentified hacker. He said preliminary police probe has not found any clue to those behind compromising the question paper bank of the university. “After registering the FIR, Proton Mail service provider will be asked to give the internet protocol (IP) address from where the email by the unidentified hacker was sent to the university authorities, informing them about the hacking. Once a criminal case is registered, we can question suspects and summon cyber data from agencies,” Dhaliwal said. In view of the Covid-19 outbreak, the university conducted examinations online where only the schedule was released and students had the flexibility to choose dates to take their tests while staying home. On July 8, the university found that its online examination system had been accessed by hackers. A hacker sent an email from Proton Mail, an end-to-end encrypted and sophisticated cyber platform, to vice-chancellor RK Kohli and some faculty members, where a link was given. Clicking on it gave access to all questions. The server was sealed by university authorities for the police probe. “The university appointed a three-member cyber expert team, including two external members. The team is expected to share the dump of data secured from the central server to check who all accessed the question bank,” the DSP said. Earlier, Kohli had raised doubts about a group of 10 students from a particular state, who scored exceptionally well in the semester exams conducted on the first three days. “It was found that these students had average marks in the previous semesters but in this session of online exams, they scored more than 92%, much higher than other students. We have shared these details with the police for cyber scrutiny of the matter,” Kohli said. Registrar KP Mundra, who is also a complainant in the case, did not respond to phone calls on Saturday. Meanwhile, university sources said the examination for second year students that restarted from July 24 are going on smoothly. “After the question bank was hacked, faculty members were asked to set question papers again. Of the 484 second year students, 483 opted to take the online test,” a faculty member said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/clueless-police-to-register-fir-in-central-university-bathinda-question-bank-hacking-case/story-b5Jrkdc98doX5FlpCl2pTI.html

The administration has begun repair work, however, the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) residents are not satisfied yet. Some residents say there are hardly any areas which are pothole-free. “The repair work was on halt for the last couple of days due to rain. We are adding laterite, broken bricks to even out the potholes and it will be covered up by tar. At many places, the work has already been completed and we will be covering other areas soon,” said Vijay Bhojane, PCMC spokesperson. There is anger among commuters because the condition of the roads has made them unsafe. “For the last three months we’ve been in a lockdown, and the potholes have been there for the last six months. We have complained so many times to civic bodies but our complaints have gone unheard always. I hope after watching the photograph in the newspaper they will react fast,” said Salman Sheikh, who works at a salon near Wakad phata, Thergaon. Rahatani residents have also been facing the pothole issue for the last four months. “No proper repair work is done by the civic body, the road was repaired in January and look at its condition now. It started to deteriorate in April. All the shopkeepers have complained but no action has been taken by the civic body,” added Rakesh Mishra, who works at a shop in Nakhate Wasti, Rahatani. In contrast to these claims, the civic body said that many potholes were filled by coal tar. “The civic body officers are lying, There are 12 potholes next to each other at Rupinagar, Nigdi, I have seen people falling at this spot in rain but it has not been repaired since the past two months,” said Akshay Rumale, a resident of Rupinagar. Under the overbridge at Dalvi nagar, Chinchwad a large pothole leads to traffic jams every day. “My four-wheeler was stuck yesterday and five people helped me to bring out my car.

08-08-2020||Pune||Adivasi students get their hands on a mobile for the first time||What is a smartphone? This was only known to the adivasi students from Andgaon village in Mulshi via television; but now, each of them have one in their hands, for study purposes. The 80 adivasi students of the Vidya Vikas Mandir (secondary school), Andgaon, were helpless when school announced classes were going online due to the Covid pandemic. Parents, who don’t earn enough to buy a smartphone, were left clueless about rescuing their wards’ education. Rajendra Marne, chairman of the school, decided on a campaign: “Donate a mobile to the needy”; and it received a good response. “When school started online, these students had no option, so for the first few days these students were not able to attend the classes. I promoted my campaign via social media and it generated a quick response from the general public and social workers,” says Marne. Two social workers – Anil Tambe and Tatya Devkar – are at the forefront of the endeavour to ensure Andgaon’s students are online. Tambe donated mobile phones worth Rs 4 lakh and Devkar sponsored laptops worth Rs 75 lakh. “I keep on doing social work, and with the help of Dr Yashraj Parkhi my friend, I got to know about this school in Mulshi. I decided to give these students smartphones to better their future,” says Tambe. “The expression on their faces said a lot when I donated the mobiles. All of them were very happy and also thanked us,” Tambe adds. Devkar, apart from donating laptops to Vidya Vikar Mandir, now plans to give laptops to 37 other schools in Mulshi taluka. “The laptops will be given to students of classes 8, 9 and 10, and girl students will get a preference,” says Devkar. “These mobiles will help these adivasis a lot. All of them are sincere students,” Marne adds. Sheetal Akhade, who studies in Class 9 is on cloud nine. “I had never thought that we would get smartphones to operate so early in our life. We will not misuse the mobile and will handle it with care,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/adivasi-students-get-their-hands-on-a-mobile-for-the-first-time/story-EMl8vfPodyAv3OX4s2mD1K.html

08-08-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal’s economy suffered Rs 30,000-crore hit due to Covid-19 pandemic: CM||Dharamshala: The overall economy of Himachal Pradesh suffered a hit of Rs 30,000 crore due to the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown, while the hill state registered a revenue loss of Rs 1,300 crore in the first quarter of this financial year. Stating this at a press conference in Dharamshala on Saturday, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said, “During this pandemic, the entire world is facing an economic crisis. Himachal Pradesh too suffered an economic loss of around Rs 1,300 crore in the first quarter. Our financial liabilities have increased by Rs 737 crore due to budget announcements.” Thakur said that the private sector, including tourism, transport, horticulture, and other businesses, had faced its worst crisis and the revenue loss is estimated to be around Rs 30,000 crore but there are green shoots with these sectors slowly coming back on track. He said that salaries, wages and pensions of government employees have been disbursed on time thanks to the central government that has not reduced the state’s financial dues. “The Rs 950-crore revenue deficit grant released by the Union government has kept the state’s economy afloat. The state is also getting its central tax share and Rs 300 crore has been received till date,” he said. Accusing the opposition Congress of playing politics during the pandemic, he said, “We are going through a crisis no government has ever faced but Himachal is in a much better position compared to other states.” RISE IN CASES AFTER RETURN OF NATIVES The chief minister said that the spurt in Covid cases after Unlock 1 was due to the return of Himachalis stranded in other states. “However, it was our responsibility to bring back stranded residents and the government facilitated the return of 2.5 lakh people,” he said. In Unlock 2, Thakur said as the Centre eased restriction on inter-state travel, the Covid-19 spike was seen among migrant labourers. “Most of the infected people were in quarantine,” he said. In Unlock 3, though unconditional inter-state travel was allowed, the state government kept monitoring the movement of people coming to the state. OPENING TOURISM SECTOR TO REVIVE ECONOMY Taking on the Opposition for criticising the government for opening the tourism sector, he said, “It is important that we revive the economy or more people may suffer due to the financial crisis than the virus.” He said the government has allowed conditional entry, making the Covid-19 negative report mandatory for visitors. On reopening temples, Thakur said that the government will review the situation after August 15 and if the number of cases increases, temples may remain closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-s-economy-suffered-rs-30-000-crore-hit-due-to-covid-19-pandemic-cm/story-bHGGGwl3i5NkwqzonjuHII.html

The flash floods of September 25, 2019, where 22 people lost their lives are still fresh in the minds of Pune residents and the fire brigade. Learning a lesson from that tragedy and to be better prepared for this year’s monsoon and rescue operations, the makeshift boats are being constructed by the fire department. In addition to the boats, the fire officials will also be offering training to citizens who reside near the riverside, streams and lake in using those boats in an effective manner. “We already have rubber boats, pumps, life jackets, rocket launchers which are used mostly during the rainy season rescue operations. But learning from last year’s tragedy of heavy rains and flash floods, we have now made a different kind of boats with the help of empty plastic barrels of 200 litres. Two such barrels are taken then bamboos are tied in the upper side and a small boat is made out of it which can float easily. Around eight to 10 people can sit over it and can be rescued. Another 5, 10 and 20 litres empty cans are used to make smaller size boats. These small boats can easily go inside the narrow lanes where waterlogging is there and 2 to 3 persons can be rescued using it. Also, from the smaller 1-litre water bottles we have made a very compact boat through which a single person can float and can be rescued. It is an improvised version of the things we had in the wastage materials,” said chief fire officer Prashant Ranpise. According to Ranpise, the biggest difficulty rescue officials faced last year during the flash floods that hit Katraj and Dandekar bridge was reaching the small lanes and narrow areas. “Considering this, during the lockdown period we prepared these makeshift boats with the waste and throwaway materials.,” he said. The goal of the fire brigade is not just to construct these boats but to train residents living next to water bodies to make these boats themselves. “We are going to give training to the public about making such boats. There was no expense in making these boats, it was an idea of our senior firemen and we made it. We have currently made three boats of each type and size and kept it at the Erandwane fire station. If needed, more such boats will be made as per the need or requirement to fire stations,” added Ranpise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/floating-devices-for-flood-rescue-missions-pune-fire-brigade-puts-plastic-waste-to-good-use/story-KdoqhSBs0LwMLAxpmz7FmM.html

If they all come forward it will be a good response.”“Six jawans donated blood for plasma and they will, in turn, go to their colleagues and encourage others who have recovered to do the same,” he said.While the jawans have come forward the hospital administration has been struggling to convince civilians to donate blood for plasma therapy.Dr Nalini Kadgi, associate professor, pathology department and incharge of Sassoon’s blood bank, said, “We will reintroduce the red blood cells after the antibodies are recovered. We conducted two lectures and attended to all their doubts and queries after they were satisfied they agreed to come forward to donate.”“However, we are not getting a positive response from residents overall.

They collected samples when they came for counselling and those who were eligible were called. The room where blood is taken is completely isolated and properly maintained so there is no question of getting infected again.”“I did not experience any kind of weakness or any physical problems. It took one hour for the process to complete and one hour before that for testing.

08-08-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan tussle takes turn as BJP herds MLAs fearing poaching by crisis-hit Congress||The Bharatiya Janata Party in Rajasthan has started herding its MLAs, especially those from tribal areas, amid fear of poaching by the Congress for the assembly session starting from August 14, party leaders said. Some MLAs have been sent to Gujarat.The BJP leaders said they have evidence that the Congress was trying to approach its legislators, especially in the tribal belt of Mewar in southern Rajasthan, to win their support. The Congress denied these charges. “We had input that the Congress was approaching our legislators in the Udaipur division through administrative officers and other influential people of the area so we decided that they should all be at one place where they can be protected,” said state BJP president Satish Poonia. “We will have a meeting of the legislature party 2-3 days before the Assembly session. Before that some MLAs said they want to visit Somnath temple so we have allowed them to go,” he added. Also Read: A week before Rajasthan assembly session, Vasundhara Raje meets BJP chief JP NaddaParty insiders said the effort to approach “weak legislators”, especially those elected from seats reserved for the scheduled tribes (STs), started before August 6 when a division bench of the Rajasthan high court was to deliver its judgment on petitions challenging merger of six BSP MLAs with the Congress. The decision on the merger is now likely on August 11 by a single judge bench of the high court. “We alerted our MLAs before 6th and told them to be together,” said leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria, one of the tallest party leaders from south Rajasthan. “The Congress government is set to fall and the party is approaching our legislators for support. So we have to protect our people against attack from the Congress,” he added. State Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra denied the BJP’s allegation. “There’s no danger to our government and we don’t indulge in horse trading, which is an exclusive domain of the BJP,” he said. There are 28 Assembly seats in southern Rajasthan comprising six districts. The BJP won 15 of them in the December 2018 Assembly election. Congress has 10 seats in the area. Of the remaining 3, one is with an Independent MLA and two are with the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP). The BTP MLAs are supporting the Congress government. The Congress has 107 MLAs in the Assembly, 19 of them are in Haryana with party rebel Sachin Pilot and are unlikely to vote for the Gehlot government. Assembly Speaker Joshi and a bed-ridden MLA are among the remaining 88 MLAs including 75 MLAs from opposition parties the BJP and the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party.Eighty-six Congress legislators, 10 Independents, 2 from BTP, one CPM and one RLD MLAs are supporting Ashok Gehlot government and are camping in two hotels in Jaisalmer. The 107 include six BSP MLAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-tussle-takes-turn-as-bjp-herds-mlas-fearing-poaching-by-crisis-hit-congress/story-Krdhr7p6cC0iRFpdzPsp6I.html

08-08-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab-origin youngster dies rescuing three children swept away in Kings River in California||Amritsar: A 29-year-old man from Gurdaspur district of Punjab died while rescuing three children being swept away in the Kings River in California. Manjeet Singh jumped into the river to rescue a boy and two girls who were playing in the water off Reedley Beach on Wednesday. They were swept away by a current that pushed them south under a bridge. Seeing the trio drowning and crying for help, Manjeet jumped into the river to try to save them. “He removed his turban and attempted to use it as a rope to pull the children in but was quickly pulled under himself. He went in to try and help them and, unfortunately, went under water fairly quickly and never came back up,” reported Los Angeles Times, quoting Reedley police commander Marc Ediger. The sacrifice of the Sikh youngster is widely being hailed in the US and India with religious, social and political leaders paying tribute on their social media handles. According to US media reports, two children were brought to shore unharmed, but one of the girls was underwater for nearly 15 minutes. She was taken to Valley Children’s Hospital in Fresno and as of Friday remained in a critical condition and on life support. SON OF A FARMER, HE WENT TO US TWO YEARS AGO Manjeet was the youngest son of Gurbax Singh, a farmer and former block samiti member at Chhina village in Gurdaspur district. The family struggled to send him abroad two years ago. “There is no bigger sacrifice than to lay down one’s life for saving others,” said Panthdeep Singh, the sarpanch of the village. “Manjeet went to the US two years ago. He was at Fresno to learn truck driving. He had his first training session to become a truck driver on the day of the tragedy. Our entire village salutes him for his sacrifice,” the sarpanch said. SARPANCH URGES GOVT TO HELP BRING BACK BODY “He was kindhearted and keen to serve humanity. During the Covid-19 lockdown, he extended financial help to needy families in Dera Baba Nanak area. Besides, he sent donations for the village’s development. He would ask us not to disclose his name as donor,” Panthdeep Singh said. The sarpanch urged the government to help bring back his body to India so that his family could see their brave son one last time and perform the last rites. “It is as much an honour as being killed at war,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-origin-youngster-dies-rescuing-three-children-swept-away-in-kings-river-in-california/story-56AW4MTNITe09345asCTuJ.html
08-08-2020||Bhopal||Gwalior SP’s ‘radio message’ sparks row about Bhim Army’s anti-Hinduism ‘propaganda’||A row has erupted following the circulation of a radio message to all the in-charge of the police stations and other subordinates purportedly sent by the superintendent of police (SP), Gwalior, Amit Sanghi, asking them to keep a strict vigil on the activities of the Bhim Army, a Dalit rights organisation, which is allegedly working against Hinduism in the district. The radio message, which was sent on Thursday (August 6), went viral on social media the following day. Sanghi, who assumed the charge as Gwalior SP recently, issued a show-cause notice to the in-charge of district special branch (DSB) for circulating the radio message without his knowledge and permission. “The DSB in-charge issued the radio-message without my knowledge. I have issued a show-cause notice to him and sought an explanation,” said the SP. The SP’s purported radio message stated: “(As per information from) the assistant inspector general of police (special branch), Bhopal, Bhim Army office-bearers/workers are trying to infuse the poison of casteism in Scheduled Caste (SC)-dominated localities by propagating against Hinduism. They (SCs) are being persuaded not to install the idols of Lord Ganesha in their homes. They are also being asked to worship Babasaheb Ambedkar as their God.” The radio message urged the police to keep a close watch on the situation and take necessary action to ensure that no untoward incident occurs in Gwalior district. “We wanted to authenticate the veracity of the input. However, it was not meant to be circulated across the department,” the SP said. The Bhim Army’s Gwalior unit read a malicious intent against SCs by purportedly circulating such a discriminatory radio message. “There are some Manuvadi (upper caste) forces, which are behind such kinds of propaganda against the Bhim Army and SCs. We are not indulging in any such activity. The images of gods and goddesses can be found in any SC home, including mine. We are opposed to these inimical forces that are trying to create a rift in the society and working against SCs’ interests,” alleged Nand Kishore, president, Gwalior district, Bhim Army.

08-08-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan police file final report in 3 cases related to toppling of Gehlot govt||The special operations group (SOG) of Rajasthan police closed the investigation in three cases of sedition, including the one in which former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot was served a notice, on Friday.The cases were related to attempts to topple the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in the state. Sant Kumar Jain, the public prosecutor, said SOG found during its investigation that the charge of sedition could bot be held and those of corruption surfaced so it closed the probe citing lack of jurisdiction. The cases related to corruption are being investigated by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB).An SOG official said on the condition of anonymity, the force took suggestions from legal experts and filed a final report (FR) in the cases on the basis of the advice. An FR is filed when an investigating agency wants to close its investigation in a case.“During the investigation done, so far, evidence to prove charges under section 7 (accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain bribe), section 8 (accepting or attempts to obtain reward for inducing by corrupt or illegal means) and section 12 (abetting any offence under corruption) of Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act were found,” Jain said. This decision has given the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) the ammunition to attack the government. “For 28 days they were investigating a case that was not made out. Notices were served to MLAs and raids were conducted and now we learn that there was no case,” Rajendra Rathore, deputy leader of Opposition, said.Pankaj Meena, the spokesperson of the BJP state unit, said the Congress should apologise. “The three FIRs had revealed that the misuse of agency in the history of the state for the first time. Now the final report has been filed hence the Congress party should apologise for the misuse of agency,” Meena said.Archana Sharma, the spokesperson of Congress’ Rajasthan unit, said the investigation revealed that the MLAs were offered money. “This is a moral victory for the Congress as preliminary investigation reveals that facts regarding the offering of money were true,” Sharma said.The SOG had registered three FIRs on the complaint filed by Mahesh Joshi, Congress’ chief whip in Rajasthan assembly, related to the horse-trading allegedly aimed at dislodging the party’s government in the state.The first FIR, number 47, was registered on July 10, in which two accused, Ashok Jain from Banswara and Bharat Malani, were arrested. They are presently in judicial custody.The second and third FIRs, numbers 48 and 49, were registered on July 17. In the FIR number 48, Sadulshahar MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma, Sanjay Jain and Gajendra Singh were booked. Jain was arrested on July 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-police-file-final-report-in-3-cases-related-to-toppling-of-gehlot-govt/story-MwBixqmHlGM1d85ewNhbgL.html

Responding to this, while tagging Dubey, Soren said that he would reply to his allegations through a legal channel.In the suit, it has been said that since about July 27, 2020 Dubey has been publishing defamatory statements attacking Soren falsely and maliciously to bring him into public scandal, odium, contempt and hatred and tarnishing his reputation. He even went to the extent of publishing it on social media.Twitter Communications India Private Limited and Facebook India Online Services Private Limited have been made the respondent because they allegedly did not block or withdraw the posting of such derogatory posts knowing that a complainant is a person of repute, as per the suit.A brief hearing was done on August 5 and the next hearing will be on August 22.On August 6, Dr Nishikant Dubey again took the social media to corner Soren. “Mr Chief Minister allegation of rape and abduction was put by some girl in Mumbai and you are filing cases against me instead of her. Thank you for giving me a chance to fight against Chief Minister like Saryu Roy,” he tweeted in Hindi.

08-08-2020||Mumbai||Social impact of crime against women can’t be lost sight of: Bombay HC||Social impact of the crime against women requires “exemplary treatment” to be meted out to the accused, said the Bombay high court (HC) on Friday while refusing to reduce the life term to six-year imprisonment to a Mumbaikar for attempting to kill his girlfriend six years ago, who had also refused to marry him, despite being in an intimate relationship for two years. “We are conscious that the social impact of the crime against women cannot be lost sight of and per se require exemplary treatment,” said the two-member HC bench, comprising Justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik, while rejecting the prayer of the convict, Arumugum Arundatiyar, to reduce his life term to six years imprisonment, which he had already served. Earlier, Mumbai sessions court had sentenced Arundatiyar to a life term. The prosecution argued that Arundatiyar was seeing the young woman, who worked as a baby-sitter, and wanted to marry her. She, however, had refused to marry him, as her family was opposed to the match, following which Arundatiyar had assaulted her twice because she had spurned his proposal. On May 8, 2014, when the victim was returning home from work by an auto-rickshaw, Arundatiyar barged into the vehicle. He threatened the auto-driver with a knife and pulled her out of the vehicle. Arundatiyar attacked her with the knife in public. He stabbed her on the neck and also threatened the public, who had tried to intervene. Though he had fled from the scene of the crime, he was arrested after a while. Arundatiyar appealed against the sessions court verdict and move HC. His counsel, advocate Aniket Vagal, pleaded before HC that the injuries caused to the woman were not life-threatening and the incident took place because she had refused to marry him, even they were in an intimate relationship for two years. Vagal also cited that Arundatiyar was only 25 years old when he had committed the crime and had little financial means. He argued that the sentence was grossly disproportionate to the crime, especially when the injuries were not life-threatening, and urged the court to let Arundatiyar off since he had served six years in prison. HC, however, refused to show any sympathy to the convict. The bench said any liberal approach by imposing meagre sentences or taking a lenient view of the crimes against women would be counter-productive in the long run and against societal interests. But, HC found life imprisonment to be too harsh and reduced Arundatiyar’s sentence to 10 years, of which he needed to serve another four years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/social-impact-of-crime-against-women-can-t-be-lost-sight-of-bombay-hc/story-0yGNVzgRrvhfcnhPgunRFN.html
08-08-2020||Delhi||This Independence Day, Covid19 cuts kite sales||New DelhiIndependence Day is synonymous with kite flying. Pockets of Old Delhi, north and north-east Delhi, especially, hold the title for most kite-flying competitions around this time of the year. Colourful kites dominate the city’s skies, with children and adults participating with gusto. Even if a person is not flying a kite, you can find them cheering from their balconies, turning the entire activity into a community festival of sorts. But this time, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, people are being extra careful, limiting their enthusiasm. This has impacted sales of kites and the wholesalers of Lal Kuan, Old Delhi have seen a slump in the number of people visiting their shops. “Lockdown ka asar toh hua hai. Sales are down and we are not even able to pay our workers. Payments kahaan se ayengi? Log corona se toh ubhre pehle (Where will we get our payments from when people are still struggling to stay afloat during the pandemic),” rues Altaf Qureshi of Kallu Bhai Patang Wale. Adding to this, Imran of Shabbir Bhai Patang Wale says, “The demand has gone down this year. Earlier, we would get about 30 people at our shop, but now it has gone down to 10-15 people.”Read: Kite fliers go green to spread environ message sky-highThe otherwise bustling lanes of Lal Kuan Bazaar are devoid of cheer. Eager kite flyers would fight motorists and fruit vendors for space, and then make a dash to catch a kati patang to claim victory. “Kites with tiranga and PUBG are still popular, but you will hardly find anyone on the streets. Puraana vala mahaul nahi hai. People are confined to their homes and flying kites from their roofs,” says Ahmed from Haji Kite House. A new kite design — a ghost on a white background — is something that has attracted people this year. “Log issi ko corona kite keh rahe hain,” shares Bablu of Bishan Chand & Sons Kite Merchants. State-wise lockdown guidelines have also impacted the import of raw material, as most of these kite wholesalers would buy material from neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. “Demand toh hai logo mein, par maal taiyyar ho ke nahi aa raha. We would source from Rampur, Bareilly, Japiur and Kolkata, but it has been very difficult this time,” says Bablu. Many craftsmen, or kaarigars, had gone on leaves for the festivals of Raksha Bandhan and Eid, further slowing down the production. Read: This video of a monkey playing with a kite has left people surprised. WatchThe wholesalers would get enquiries for bulk orders from across the country, but retail sales were also a big source of income. “The metro made it easy for people to come to us. But now that the metro services are suspended, we are not getting many customers. It’s a huge loss,” says Sachin Gupta of Sachin Kite Centre.Interact with Etti Bali @TheBalinianFollow @htcity for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/this-independence-day-covid19-cuts-kite-sales/story-oizyf9dguhEP8zm5I8l2fO.html

The car was being driven by one Paramvir Singh.“We received information around 12.15am on Saturday and our teams noticed one of the four men. He was rescued while three others are still missing. NDRF teams were also called in and the car was also fished out. They all are in age group 25-36 years and working as contractors with a Central government agency. They had planned to make a night stay in Ghaziabad but then the mishap took place,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural). The officials said that while the men were travelling on NH-9, they did not take the Masuri-Dasna flyover. “Instead they took the surface service road near to the canal and met with the accident. It is still not clear whether the car was being driven at high speed or the driver lost control due to some other reason. The area where the car plunged into the canal has a parapet. So, the car went straight in. We have alerted the police stations along the canal and they are also helping to find the three missing men. All of the four are from Bareilly district,” Jadaun added. The cops said that the families of the four men have been informed. In an earlier incident on February 1, a group of six friends travelling from Dehradun to Mathura met with a similar accident after their SUV plunged into the canal. Two of the six were rescued while bodies of four others were recovered a week later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/3-missing-1-rescued-after-car-plunges-into-upper-ganga-canal-in-ghaziabad/story-jp1Ml2xH0Ewep2Lhr7EI0N.html

08-08-2020||Chandigarh||Probe finds Jalandhar private hospital overcharged for Covid-19 test||Jalandhar: The Jalandhar district administration has found the authorities of Patel Hospital at Civil Lines here charged Rs 5,500 for a Covid-19 test on July 21 even as the government has fixed the maximum charges, including taxes, at Rs 2,400. The hospital wrongly charged Rs 3,100 towards the cost of the personal protective equipment (PPE) kit for the safety of lab technicians and clinicians, ignoring state government orders of July 18 that caps the Covid-19 test charges at Rs 2,400. An inquiry was marked by deputy commissioner Ghanshyam Thori on July 22 on the complaint of Rajeev Makol, a resident of Guru Teg Bahadur Nagar, who needed his Covid report to travel out of Punjab. Makol said he got to know about the fixed charges only after his friend was charged Rs 2,400 for the test at another lab. Assistant commissioner (grievances) Randeep Gill, who conducted the inquiry, said in his final report submitted to the state health department on Saturday that the hospital was overcharging for the test. The report said that the complainant met medical superintendent Dr Swapan Sood but he justified the higher rate, saying that Patel Hospital is a private facility conducting the test locally. Dr Sood said that the hospital charged Rs 2,400 for the test but the remaining amount was towards the PPE kit and doctor charges of pharyngeal swabbing. “The government order states that Rs 2,400 is inclusive and all expenses from tax to packaging, transportation, reporting and documentation is included. Money charged by the hospital for PPE kits holds no ground,” the inquiry report said. LIABLE FOR ACTION “The provision of PPE and personnel taking samples are basic protocol of the Indian Council of Medical Research. No laboratory can conceive taking a swab without a PPE kit and qualified personnel. Patel Hospital has erroneously or wilfully charged more than the amount directed by the government and is liable for appropriate action,” Gill said, adding that the DC has submitted the report to the state health department for further action. PATEL HOSPITAL STATEMENTIn a statement, Patel Hospital said it did not agree with report filed by the assistant commissioner (grievances). The statement added that it was not a private laboratory, but included several other facilities like isolation wards, oxygen supply etc. The isolation ward charges fixed by the government at Rs 9,000 per day included, Rs 1,200 towards PPE charges and some others. The capped cost does not include sample collection charges or isolation charges, which are besides this, the hospital has said.Meanwhile, suspecting discrepancy in the testing of Covid-19 samples, the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) is also conducting an audit of the RT-PCR tests being carried out at Patel Hospital. Special secretary, health, Isha Kalia had written to PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram that Patel Hospital, Jalandhar, reported 26.34% positivity rate of the 205 samples put through the RT-PCR (real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) tests for Covid-19. This is high compared to other government and private labs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/probe-finds-jalandhar-private-hospital-overcharged-for-covid-19-test/story-3XpJTcK1ORw7WTJ3QIy7JO.html
08-08-2020||Kolkata||Covid-19: West Bengal observing complete lockdown today||Normal life came to a grinding halt in West Bengal on Saturday as a complete lockdown was enforced across the state to stem the spread of Covid-19 cases.All public transport, offices and other commercial establishments, barring those dealing with essential services, remained closed as the strict restrictions were clamped.It is part of the twice-a-week lockdown imposed in the state since July 23 to break the chain of the infection.Flight operations in and out of the Kolkata international airport were suspended for the day, while long- distance trains were also rescheduled due to the lockdown. Essential services like medicine shops and health establishments remained open as these were kept out of the purview of the complete shutdown. Petrol pumps are also allowed to remain open on the lockdown days.Schools, colleges and other educational institutes have remained closed in the state since late March when the first phase of the nationwide lockdown started.Security has been tightened to enforce the lockdown and police personnel were seen patrolling major traffic intersections in Kolkata.A complete lockdown was earlier imposed in the state on July 23, 25 and 29 and August 5.The Covid-19 death toll in West Bengal went up to 1,954 after 52 more people succumbed to the disease on Friday, the state health department said.A bulletin issued by the department also said that 2,912 new cases were reported from various parts of the state, pushing its coronavirus count to 89,666.According to a notification issued by the state government, the total lockdown will be imposed on August 20 (Thursday), 21 (Friday), 27 (Thursday), 28 (Friday) and 31 (Monday).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/covid-19-west-bengal-observing-complete-lockdown-today/story-d4Eta9AfoeGrgYXs7WUxDL.html
08-08-2020||Delhi||Our bookseller emeritus||They all have died. Almost all the legendary founders of Delhi’s great independent bookstores have left us. Anil Arora of now-extinct The Bookworm passed away in August 2016. Balraj Bahri Malhotra of Bahrisons Booksellers passed away in February 2016. KD Singh of The Book Shop passed away in May 2014.But one continues to be with us.Mirza Yaseen Baig, the founder of Midland bookstores is still with us. He is 93 and comes daily, without fail, to his shop at south Delhi’s Aurobindo Market—even in these risky times of coronavirus pandemic. With so many years weighing down on his back, Mr Baig has reduced his interaction with customers. He spent the day sitting outside the bookshop on a chair facing a shelf stacked with classics of English literature; the shop itself is handled by Afsar, his second son.The bookstore is like Mr Baig’s second home.One afternoon, before the pandemic, he was seen taking a nap. His head bent down and his face resting on his arm, his chest was heaving gently in a deep-sleep breath. A few shoppers walked about without waking him up.This evening, however, he is wide awake but sitting quietly, his face covered in the ubiquitous face mask. And yet, he is looking every inch a bookstore emeritus.Unlike the other three aforementioned bookstore founders, Mr Baig’s connection to Delhi is somewhat more recent. Like most of us Delhiites, he is not a Delhi native. Mr Baig is from Hyderabad in the south. There he used to run a small book stall on the bustling Sultan Bazaar Road. In 1970, he folded his business and moved to Delhi with his wife, four sons and six daughters (one more girl would be born later).In the Capital, he set up a similar stall, later named Books Selection Center, just outside the Indian Coffee House in Connaught Place — at that time the coffee place was not in its present location in Mohan Singh Place but on the site of present-day Palika Bazaar.Eight years later, Mr Baig founded the New Book Land, the first of his four Delhi bookstores, just outside the Janpath flea market. It continues to exist and is managed by his third son, Salim, a charmingly moody man who can be nice or indifferent, depending upon your luck at that moment.In 1985, Mr Baig opened the first Midland in the brand new Aurobindo Market, an aesthetically challenging block constructed by Delhi Development Authority (the market’s small garden has a gigantic cement butterfly).The other two outlets in South Extension I and Gurugram came later.Like almost every long-time bookshops in the city, Midland stores too have a following. The one in Aurobindo Market is a beloved of many well-known writers such as Namita Gokhale who lives nearby in SDA Colony. For many old-time regulars to this market, the ritual is to first have a burger and a glass of soft drink at the nearby Wimpy’s (a fast-food legend in its own right but sadly, not open these days) and only then to step inside Midland to browse for the new releases.While Midland might be loved by its patrons, it didn’t appeal to at least some of the city’s booksellers. Its crime — it was among the first shops in Delhi to sell books at 20% discount, a scheme that led the spoiled customers to demand similar discounts elsewhere. The late Anil Arora confessed his disappointment to this reporter on Midland’s pricing strategy on the eve of closing his bookshop, The Bookworm, in Connaught Place in 2008.But at such an advanced age, just why can’t Mr Baig sit at home, safe from the virus, with wife, Sardar Begum, in west Delhi’s Paschim Vihar? “Coming to the shop is my habit,” he says in his cracking voice full of affection. “I cannot sit at home. Here I watch people, see the world go to and fro about me and I feel good.”In the pre-corona days, Mr Baig, who is addressed as Babuji by his employees, reached the shop every morning at 11 and would leave by eight in the evening. But now he comes by 2pm. It is tempting to implore the readers to give this iconic bookseller an immediate visit but these are dangerous times. Perhaps you might wait for the pandemic to recede, following which you might visit Mr Baig, hopefully still sitting like a monument at his usual spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/our-bookseller-emeritus/story-w24EK6rNdP9Ygpoyt0r37K.html
08-08-2020||Bangalore||Flood, landslides batter parts of Karnataka||Flood-like situation and landslides continued to cause havoc in several parts of Karnataka that has been battered by torrential rains.Many places in Malnad, coastal and north interior regions of the state have been affected by deluge, putting life and properties at risk.There were reports of mudslides near Botlappa and other places in Kodagu, also along Charmadi ghat near Chikkamagaluru and Dakshina Kannada.On Friday, rescue operations were halted in Kodagu, which suffered landslides at the foothills of Brahmagiri hills located near Talacauvery on Wednesday, due to inclement weather in the district. Over the last four days, Kodagu has received an average of 106.2 mm of rain, an IMD bulletin said. Bhagmadala alone received a record 486 mm rainfall between August 5 and 6. State minister V Somanna, after touring the affected areas along with local MP Pratap Simha, MLAs Appachu Ranjan, KG Bopanna, and district collector Annies Kannmani Joy, said, “There are 4-5 landslides on the road between Bhagmandala and Talacauvery which is hampering our rescue efforts. The district administration is trying its level best to clear roads, fallen trees, electric poles and to ensure relief for those affected. Tomorrow too I am holding a high-level meeting with all officials to accelerate our efforts.”The district collector said that the landslides and continued heavy rain were posing a challenge to the movement of rescue teams and equipment. Addressing mediapersons, Somanna said, “We are nothing in front of nature. While we will take all measures humanly possible to mitigate the situation, I also pray to god to be kind on us.”Meanwhile, a political controversy has erupted over the handling of the flood situation in the state. The opposition Janta Dal (Secular) has demanded that the Centre must extend financial assistance for the people ravaged by floods. Former PM Deve Gowda said that the state was facing a twin-challenges – the Covid-19 pandemic and the floods. Former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy has warned the government that “if they are not cautious enough then it will be risking lives of people”.A release from the Chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s office on Friday said Chief Secretary Vijay Bhaskar has been instructed to proceed with emergency measures without waiting for his approval. The CM is undergoing treatment for the coronavirus disease at a state hospital. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) regional centre in Bangalore has issued an orange alert across large parts of the state and has forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall over the weekend. The department said that strong southwesterly and westerly monsoonal flow over the Arabian sea, along with winds of 50-60 km per hour off the Karnataka coast, are likely to continue till Sunday leading to heavy rains across large parts of the state.So far, two people have been killed in rain-related incidents in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/flood-landslides-batter-parts-of-karnataka/story-Mois4CSKnjZARk8ngx1jRL.html

08-08-2020||Mumbai||How urban planner’s Spain trip gave Mumbai 1st traffic signal with female figures||It was in 2019, on her trip to Madrid in Spain, that Vijayshree Pednekar, a 34-year-old Mumbai-based urban planner and architect, saw women figures or female silhouettes on traffic signals. “I was astonished. I thought it might be a small gesture, but a bold statement,” said Pednekar.Already associated with various projects being implemented by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Pednekar worked on this one too, and months later, Mumbai became the first city in the country to adopt these figures at a signal in Dadar.Aaditya Thackeray, Maharashtra’s tourism minister, took to Twitter to announce the change. He said, “@mybmcwardGN is ensuring gender equality with a simple idea – the signals now have women too.” On Friday, United Nations Women also acknowledged the important step.Pednekar, co-founder of The Urban Project and a resident of Prabhadevi, said that Thackeray and the G/N ward office (includes Dadar) instinctively took to the idea. “In a way, the sign also represents women ‘crossing the limits’ and entering the public space. Women are no more confined to their houses,” said Pednekar.In the past, The Urban Project was associated with BMC’s project to introducing women-friendly sanitation facilities at the Gateway of India. It has also worked with the Right To Pee campaign, to prepare guidelines for women-friendly sanitation spaces.“Cities need both macro and micro initiatives that ensure safer access to sanitation and public spaces, not only for women but also transgenders and the differently-abled,” she said.The traffic signal initiative is part of the ‘Cultural Spine’ project by the BMC, which aims to give a face-lift to the entire stretch from Mahim to Prabhadevi.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner from G/North ward, said, “We have been involving young urban planners and architects, and have been taking their suggestions to improve public spaces in the ward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/how-urban-planner-s-spain-trip-gave-mumbai-1st-traffic-signal-with-female-figures/story-YgJ3Ke0NJ4zZCwHLMzDQSN.html
08-08-2020||Mumbai||Change in foreign scholarship scheme to help scores of Scheduled Caste students||Students belonging to the Scheduled Castes (SC) can now apply for the state government’s foreign scholarship scheme for higher studies in a post-graduation (PG) course other than the faculty they completed their graduation in. Social justice department minister Dhananjay Munde, on Friday, withdrew the condition that caused an “obstacle” for several thousand students, a note from the department said. The previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government had put a condition that students can only apply in the same stream for PG course. The department said that the University Grants Commission (UGC), too, allows students to apply for postgraduate courses for specialisation in streams other than the ones students opted for their graduation. In another decision, the minister has extended the age limit for students to apply for the scholarship. Now students, who wish to apply for the foreign scholarship, can avail the benefit up to 35-year age for PG and up to 40 years for PhD. The department has invited applications who are aspiring to study further in foreign countries. However, students will have to apply before August 14, said Munde. Keeping the Covid-19 situation in mind, the department has also allowed online application instead of physical submission of the application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/change-in-scheduled-castes-foreign-scholarship-scheme-to-help-scores-of-students/story-AAQ4tB9mlDdou2iWtZk8ZO.html
08-08-2020||Mumbai||University of Mumbai’s move on online classes is haphazard, says teachers’ body||Days after the University of Mumbai (MU) directed colleges to start the new academic year online for students, a teachers’ organisation in the state has called the move “haphazard and apathetic”. In a letter addressed to the varsity’s vice-chancellor Suhas Pednekar, the Bombay University and College Teachers’ Union (BUCTU) has highlighted a series of problems that students and teachers of certain colleges are already facing while conducting virtual classes. “Without finding out if students or teachers have the adequate infrastructure to participate in virtual lectures, the recent circular directing colleges to start lectures from August 7 is unfair to the stakeholders of the education system,” said the letter by BUCTU. Despite repeated attempts, the vice-chancellor was not available for a comment.HT had reported that MU had informed all its affiliated colleges that with the completion of admissions for all batches, except first-year undergraduate and postgraduate graduate courses, colleges should start online lectures for the new academic year until further notice. “A detailed arrangement of the term for programmes offered under different faculties will be communicated separately,” said the circular released on August 2.Teachers felt that not there are issues of internet connectivity or lack of smartphones, but the university is also wrong to insist on starting the academic year without clarifying the curriculum. “This decision by the university also goes against the government decision to keep education institutes shut until August 31, and it clearly shows that the university did not take opinions from staff or students before announcing the same,” the letter by BUCTU said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/university-of-mumbai-s-move-on-online-classes-is-haphazard-says-teachers-body/story-i9gpXpOvfGn5w7lvDCg1PI.html
08-08-2020||City||35-year-old dies as concrete slab of building collapses near Mumbai||A 35-year-old worker died after the concrete parapet of a three-storey building near Ulhasnagar Camp-1 collapsed on Friday afternoon. Four workers who were feared trapped inside a shop were evacuated safely by the fire brigade officers. They suffered minor injuries and are undergoing treatment. As per the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC), the worker Vishnu Pathole, 35, was repairing the shutter of the shop on the ground floor when the parapet collapsed. Locals nearby rushed to the spot and managed to pull him out. He was admitted to Mamta Hospital and later was shifted to Central hospital. However, he succumbed to his injuries. Four other workers stuck inside the shop were later evacuated by the firefighting team. The building was a ground plus three-floored structure. The shops on the ground floor were functioning, while the top floors were used for commercial purposes and were empty. Satish Marathe, 40, a social activist from Ulhasnagar, an eye witness to the incident said, “I heard a loud noise and saw a man being crushed under the debris. The man was severely injured as the concrete hit his head. I called for an autorickshaw and sent him to the hospital. I also called the fire department and civic officials.” A fire brigade official said, “Locals informed that people are stuck inside the shop. We used the gas cutter to open the shutter. We evacuated four workers who were feared trapped inside the shop. They suffered minor injuries.” As per the UMC the building is around 40 years old and it was not listed in the dangerous buildings list prepared by the civic body. “The police are questioning the owner of the building and will register a case after further investigation. We have barricaded the premises of the building. Our engineer has also conducted an audit after we receive the report, we will decide whether to demolish it or not,” said Yuvraj Badhane, public relations officer, UMC. The police are investigating the case further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/35-year-old-dies-as-concrete-slab-of-building-collapses-near-mumbai/story-YAFlWmMk4OkmuRReWOrUIM.html
08-08-2020||Mumbai||Rare two-headed snake rescued from Kalyan||A rare two-headed Russell’s Viper was rescued from Kalyan’s Gandhare Road area on Thursday. Experts said the growth of the two heads was a genetic abnormality similar to conjoined or Siamese twins in humans. These snakes have very low survival rates in the wild. The forest department will hand over the snake to the Haffkine Institute in Parel. The snake is 11cm long, with the two heads measuring 2cm each, while the width of the snake is 1cm. Russell’s Viper is one of the top four venomous snakes in India. On September 20 last year, the same snake species with two heads was found from the same area in Kalyan. On Thursday around 2pm, Kalyan resident Dimple Shah called the local snake rescuers after spotting the Russel’s Viper outside her building, Rutu Riverside Estate on Gandhare Road. Prem Aher and Nilesh Navsare from the War Rescue Foundation (WRF) then rescued the snake in the next couple of hours. “There are four documentations of the two-headed Russell’s Viper from India, of which two were from Kalyan,” said Yogesh Kamble, president, WRF. WRF then informed forest department about the snake. “As these species have a low survival rate owing to possible genetic modifications, the previous snake had died. However, this snake, currently at the Kalyan range office, looks much better,” said Jitendra Ramgaokar, deputy conservator of forest (Thane). Experts said the abnormality takes place during birth. “We found developmental defects in the previous two-headed snake, including an abnormally developed digestive tract, which may have led to its death,” said Dr Nishigandha Naik, former director, Haffkine. According to herpetologist Varad Giri, who is the director at NIDUS – an organisation working on research on amphibians and reptiles – a developing embryo in its early stage divides. “The reason for this division is not known. After some time the division stops, leading to two heads. There are characteristic issues where two brains and one body fight for food and freedom, creating complications for survival,” said Giri. Romulus Whitaker, founder of Madras Crocodile Bank said that little is known about this environmental genetic anomaly owing to the lack of research available. “There are different kinds of snakes with two heads identified across the world and India. Some have been known to survive in captivity for almost 20 years. Those ensuring their survival have had to put a barrier between the two heads to ensure they don’t fight for food,” said Whitaker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rare-two-headed-snake-rescued-from-kalyan/story-wqXTNS9tnJBnPfvHNjdrxM.html
08-08-2020||Mumbai||Sushant case probe was quarantined: Bihar cop||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities gave exemption from home quarantine to Bihar-cadre Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Vinay Tiwari, who had come to the city for investigation into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, allowing him to return to Patna before Saturday. The decision was taken following a letter by Bihar Police to facilitate Tiwari’s return to Patna to resume his duty. Tiwari had arrived in Mumbai on Sunday evening and was asked by the civic authorities to remain under 14-day quarantine until August 15, as per the rule for domestic air travellers. Tiwari was quarantined at the SRPF camp in Goregaon, where he had put up upon his arrival to Mumbai. On Thursday, four other personnel of Bihar Police, who were in Mumbai since July 27 to investigate Rajput’s death, flew back to Patna. Bihar Police’s letter came in the backdrop of the Nitish Kumar-led government giving its consent to transfer the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) earlier this week. CBI registered a first information report in the case on Thursday. Mumbai Police is probing the case after the actor was found dead in his Bandra apartment on June 14 and Maharashtra government ordered an investigation into his death. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, responded to Bihar Police’s letter. “It is surprising and unfortunate to note that a visiting senior officer before proceeding to Maharashtra has not acquainted himself with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) quarantine guidelines issued by the Maharashtra government to arrest the spread of the pandemic in the state. It may be noted that the guidelines are available in the public domain,” the BMC letter stated. “Considering that it is only the fifth day of his arrival, and since the request to exempt from home isolation to go back to Patna has come from Patna police, and considering the provision in the SOP (standard operating procedure) to exempt passengers on a short duration visit, it is hereby decided to exempt Mr. Vinay Tiwari from home quarantine subject to fulfilling the following conditions. He shall leave Maharashtra before the seventh day of the start of quarantine (before August 8),” the letter stated. Tiwari left for the Mumbai airport on Friday afternoon. While speaking to the media, Tiwari said, “I was not quarantined, but the investigation was quarantined. We did whatever we could do, and definitely there were hurdles in our investigations. Now, the investigation is with the CBI, and I cannot comment on it. But we will submit all investigation-related details we did in the Supreme Court.” Meanwhile, BMC on Friday also tweeted a notification reading, “Some instances have come to notice that some government officials after landing in Mumbai show their government ID card and secure exemption. By this order, it is clarified that any exemption for government servant contributing for its office has to be made in writing to BMC two days in advance justifying the reason for exemption for home quarantine. All exemptions will be given in written by BMC, and BMC officers at the airport shall not give any exemptions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-case-probe-was-quarantined-bihar-cop/story-2zYsaoZ0I4z4kwujt9m5PP.html

BMC supplies 65MLD (million litre per day) water to Thane city, and will get 13MLD less water once the water cut is implemented. This will lead to low pressure water supply in some of the areas. The corporation said that a complete shutdown will be imposed once or twice a week depending on the water levels in the dams in the coming few weeks. BMC imposed 20% water cut in Mumbai after the water level in the seven lakes was not on par with the levels every year. An official from the water department of Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) said, “We will receive 13MLD less water supply from BMC as per their letter. As of now, we are not imposing a complete shutdown. The available water will be distributed evenly. There will be water cuts only if water levels in the lakes do not increase and there is further water cut. Areas such as Naupada and Old Market will receive low pressure supply for some days of the week.” The low pressure supply will also affect residents of Kopri, Panchpakhadi, Gaondevi, Jambli Naka, Kharkar Ali, Station Road, Louis Wadi, Ambika Nagar and Hajuri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-mumbai-thane-too-will-face-water-cuts/story-CNiAaH6ntj1UGcgA96vePM.html
08-08-2020||Mumbai||HC strikes down GR prohibiting artists aged 65 above 65 from participating in film shootings||Artists and crew members aged above 65 years are now free to resume shootings for films, television serials and over-the-top media, after the Bombay high court (HC) on Friday struck down a condition imposed by the Maharashtra government in view of the Covid-19 pandemic prohibiting them from attending studios and outdoor shootings.The bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Riyaz Chagla struck down the condition on the grounds that it was discriminatory and arbitrary. “In our view, there is discrimination in the disparate treatment of persons who are 65 years of age or above in the film or television industry and in other permitted sectors and permitted activities,” said the bench.The condition formed part of a government resolution (GR) issued on May 30, the day on which the state government allowed resumption of shootings for films, television serials and over-the-top media series, and pre-production and post-production works after a gap of over two months.The bench said if there was no general prohibition on persons above 65 years from working or practicing their trades and businesses that were allowed to operate, an age based prohibition in only one industry, namely the film industry / television / OTT “would constitute an unreasonable restriction”.HC said it would be a different matter if for policy and health considerations, the film industry would not be allowed to operate or open for filming and other related activities. “However, having permitted the film industry to operate and open, introduction of the condition that places an absolute restriction on persons above 65 years from carrying out their occupation and trade, would amount to an unreasonable restriction, and hence a violation of their right under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.”Pramod Pandey, an actor by profession, who has been earning his livelihood by performing small roles in films and TV serials since the past 40 years, and the Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association had challenged the validity of the condition before HC. They opposed the condition primarily on the grounds that it was discriminatory and imposes unreasonable restriction on their right to carry on their trade and occupation.HC accepted their contentions and held that the absolute prohibition on cast and crew above 65 years who earn their livelihood from the film industry was a measure that violated the right of the petitioners to live with dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-strikes-down-gr-prohibiting-artists-aged-65-above-65-from-participating-in-film-shootings/story-Tfutvk2KdXbk12n9tRuGMN.html
08-08-2020||City||2 injured in Thane as part of ceiling collapses||Two people were injured on Friday after part of a room’s ceiling fell on them. The incident took place in a 35-year-old building near Khartan Road. The building was originally constructed by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) for its employees. TMC said it will evacuate the building soon and carry out repairs. Around 5am on Friday, a slab of plaster fell off the ceiling of a room and injured Meena Solanki, 30, and her son Praveen, 16. The duo were asleep at the time. Solanki, a homemaker, has injured her right hand and Praveen has sustained major injuries to his head and right ear. Both are recuperating at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital in Kalwa. Santosh Kadam, chief of the regional disaster management cell, Thane, said the rest of the plaster is also in bad condition and needs to be repaired at the earliest. Forty families live in the building and over the years, alterations have been made to the original structure. Naresh Solanki, a relative of the injured, said, “We have been staying here for 30 years and most are families of people who work with the civic body. A year ago, we were told that a month-long repair work would be undertaken, but no efforts have been made since by the corporation to renovate this structure.” Deputy municipal commissioner Sandeep Malvi said, “Three months ago, we had suggested repair work for the building. However, due to certain technical issues, it got delayed. The building is not a dilapidated structure, so we had not given any evacuation notice.” He said the residents would be evacuated soon, after which repairs would be carried out. “If they [the residents] do not comply, we will have to make a police complaint. We cannot allow the residents to risk their lives,” Malvi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-injured-in-thane-as-part-of-ceiling-collapses/story-OPezQLd4M85d0IjTANHJJO.html
08-08-2020||Mumbai||Need to focus on 10 districts with most Covid-19 cases and deaths: Centre||The Central government has expressed concern over the high number of Covid-19 cases and deaths in 10 districts of the state. Lav Agrawal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, in a review meeting along with chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, said that Maharashtra needs to do more in the battle against Covid-19 to contain the spread, especially in the districts where the case count is high. He pointed out that 10 districts have contributed 79% of the total cases detected in the last week. Their case fatality rate (CFR) is also higher than the state’s average and needs to be brought under control.The 10 districts include Pune, Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon, Sangli and Nagpur.Agrawal emphasized that the state needs to bring down the number of infections among healthcare staff as it is above the national average. Infection among a high number of healthcare personnel also means more strain on the health care system, he said.As much as 21% of healthcare personnel in the state have tested positive for Covid-19. The country’s average is 7%.Agrawal was speaking at a review meeting called by the CM along with divisional commissioners, municipal commissioners, district collectors and other senior officials from the health department. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and health minister Rajesh Tope were also present. Agrawal was invited by the CM to share his views, and he also made a presentation.He said that the state needs to focus more on areas where the rate of fresh cases, as well as case fatality rate is high. He pointed out that the 10 districts need more attention as their death rate is higher than the state’s average.Maharashtra’s CFR at 3.49% is higher than the country’s 2.07%.The joint secretary also called increased efforts to provide infected senior citizens with hospitals bed in time.In the meeting, Agrawal stated that senior citizens do not like to get admitted to hospitals, and only go when their condition worsens. This can be avoided with timely intervention and surveys. He asked government officials to focus more on containment zones and house-to-house surveys and said that if a patient tests positive, then 80% of his contacts need to be traced within 72 hours, and tested.Agarwal said that even if the antigen test result came negative, the person should be observed closely for symptoms, and a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test should be conducted. Government officials should also ensure test reports are released within 24 to 36 hours after the test is conducted.Meanwhile, the CM directed officials to ensure that the state does not undergo a second wave of infection.“We will have to ensure that a second wave will not come in the state as there are some projections. It is also the case in a few countries. We cannot afford negligence, and focus should be on the timely treatment of patients,” Thackeray said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/need-to-focus-on-10-districts-with-most-covid-19-cases-and-deaths-centre/story-U6VugTCXgksABs7wuZ7tUL.html
08-08-2020||Mumbai||Restart suburban train services with only 20-30% occupancy: TIFR||Researchers from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Colaba, who analysed data of the first sero-survey conducted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), have cautioned the state government on restarting local trains in full capacity in Mumbai amidst easing of lockdown restrictions. They have suggested running local trains with 20-30% occupancy so that commuters can maintain social distance. Mumbai and its satellite cities are connected by a network of 3,000 local trains that used to ferry more than 75 lakh passengers until Covid-19 hit the city. At present, both Central and Western Railways are operating around 700 services only for essential staff. Ullas S Kolthur, professor at the TIFR’s department of biological sciences, and Sandeep Juneja, professor and dean, school of technology and computer science, welcomed the state government’s move to gradually open up Mumbai for economic benefits. “Medical facilities in Mumbai are increasing as more hospital beds are available for the treatment of Covid-19. Also, with rising awareness, people are using masks and maintaining social distance, which has lowered the prevalence of the virus. Thus, a small amount of economic opening up can be absorbed by the medical system,” said Juneja on the sideline of an online discussion on the sero-survey findings.Due to overcrowding in local trains, Juneja said typically 14 passengers travel per square metre, making it impossible to maintain social distance. “We need to maintain one-metre distance to stop further spread the virus. Thus, the trains should run at 20-30% occupancy. The procedure to start local trains should be slow. It can be increased further based on the observed infection rate,” he said.To prevent overcrowding, currently, only essential staffers, defence personnel, employees of the Central government, income tax, GST and customs, postal departments, nationalised banks, Mumbai Port Trust, judiciary and Raj Bhavan are allowed to travel in local trains.Health activists supported the suggestion of 20-30% occupancy. “Considering the huge population of Mumbai, it is essential to keep a check on local trains. If the state government completely opens up trains in a hurry, it can lead to a second wave of the pandemic. After coming so far, we have to be more cautious,” said Dr Ravikant Singh, a health activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/restart-suburban-train-services-with-only-20-30-occupancy-tifr/story-ynSxK9PrYDTd51NZsEuBMN.html
08-08-2020||Mumbai||77% recovery rate in Mumbai as almost 1 lakh discharged||The city will soon reach the milestone of 1 lakh recovered patients out of the 1.21 lakh Covid-19 positive diagnosed so far. At present, the city’s recovery rate is 77%, which exceeds the state and national average recovery rates of 66.76% and 67.98% respectively. Meanwhile, on Friday, Mumbai recorded 862 Covid-19 cases and 45 deaths. The total number of infected cases in Mumbai have reached 121, 012 and the total death toll is 6, 693 according to the state health department data. As per BMC’s data, out of 45 deaths, one death was of a patient below 40 years of age, 33 deaths were of patients above 60 years of age, and 11 patients were between 40 to 60 years of age.The data further states that 1, 239 patients were recovered and discharged on Friday. A total of 9, 3898 patients have been treated and discharged by now. Total active patients in the city are 20,124. The recovery rate of the city is at 73 percent. Further, total Covid tests done till Thursday, is 5.83 lakh. Meanwhile, Dharavi reported 7 new cases on Friday. Total cases in Dharavi have reached 2540.Nearly 20,000 patients are active cases of Covid-19 while the total number of patients who have recovered and been discharged as of Friday, is over 92,000. On an average, nearly 1,000 patients are discharged daily. The city’s recovery rate has seen a significant improvement since mid-June when it was at 50%, following which the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) launched a rapid action plan to contain the spread of Covid-19. The recovery rate improved to 57% on July 1 and then to around 70% on July 15, as per BMC’s data. It is currently at 77%. Experts as well as members of the state’s Covid-19 task force said the improved recovery rate may be due to improved immunity, early detection and treatment. Some said virus may have weakened as it spread within the city. Shashank Joshi, state task force member, said, “There could be two major reasons behind an increasing recovery rate – either Mumbaiites’ immunity is better, which is more likely considering the results of the sero survey conducted recently. Another reason could be that the recurrent viral stages that spread in the community are at a less virulent stage. However, this can be substantiated through research and surveys to know the virus mutation.” On July 3, a sero survey of 6,936 people from R-North (Dahisar), M-West (Chembur) and F-North (Sion) wards was conducted by BMC to identify recovered individuals and estimate the spread of Covid-19. The findings revealed 57% from slums and 16% from other residential areas had antibodies that suggested they had been exposed to Covid-19 and recovered. Health experts said virus mutation has been seen in past pandemics but, early detection and treatment tend to have the most impact in improving recovery rates. Madhav Sathe, retired professor of microbiology at BYL Nair Hospital, said, “It has been noted during epidemics or pandemics in the past that the virus goes through genetic changes. It is a type of mutation where virus spreads fasted but its severity goes down. This could be a factor behind the increasing recovery rate. However, early detection and early treatment being done through rapid antigen testing could also be the key to increase in recovery and bringing down mortality rate.” Experts further said a research study should be conducted to know the genetic changes and frame future public health policies accordingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/77-recovery-rate-in-mumbai-as-almost-1-lakh-discharged/story-iJtSzEgNFx40KkRItsxQBN.html
08-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government’s plan of reopening rural schools stalled due to Centre’s guidelines||Two months into the new academic year, the state education department has been getting numerous requests to allow the physical reopening of schools in remote parts of Maharashtra. Schools, activists and social organisations, in several representations to the department, have urged that schools reopen so students without access to technology do not drop out or miss out on learning.An official from the education department said several such requests have been pending due to the Central government’s guidelines. As per guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs in July, schools, colleges and coaching classes will remain shut across the country until August 31. Since June 15, schools across the state have been only operating online.“We are receiving many requests from remote places where physical learning is the only option due to poor access to technology. However, in the absence of a Central government nod, all those plans are shelved, at least till the end of August,” said a senior official from the education department.The state government had issued a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) in June, based on which classes 9, 10 and 12 were expected to start in July, followed by classes 6-8 from August, and classes 1-5 from September. This, however, was subject to permissions from the local administration after no Covid-19 positive cases are reported in the area for a month. In accordance with the guidelines, the education department started 190 schools in Chandrapur and Gadchiroli. However, they were closed again after the Centre’s guidelines came in.“We had ensured strict compliance with safety protocols and had made sure students come in small numbers and wear masks at all times. It was helping a lot because, finally, face-to-face learning could kick-off. The online-only mode is not feasible in the long run,” said the teacher of a school in Chandrapur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-s-plan-of-reopening-rural-schools-stalled-due-to-centre-s-guidelines/story-QwxqGtr28UA6pOM6hZQfEP.html

The state health department has also directed them to submit the action report in three days.“Flying squads will help in keeping a check on the hospitals and ambulance operators by carrying out surprise inspections,” state health minister Rajesh Tope said.The decision was taken following complaints from the citizens over exorbitant charges by the private hospitals for Covid-19 treatment. The state is receiving similar complaints against private ambulances operators, the officials said. There are complaints despite the charges for Covid treatment at private hospitals being capped by the state government on May 21.On May 23, the state had extended free health insurance cover to all the citizens under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, a cashless medical healthcare scheme. Later, on June 30, the state also fixed the fare for private ambulances and requisition ambulances across the state to provide free services to Covid patients.Taking serious note of the complaints, Tope directed the local authorities such as district collectors and municipal commissioners to appoint flying squads across cities and districts to crack the whip against the violators.“The flying squads have been authorised to see if all the decisions taken by the state at regular intervals for Covid-19 treatment are being implemented or not, private hospitals have put up boards at the entrance with details on treatment charges, auditors have been appointed to verify bills at private hospitals to check overcharging for Covid-19 treatment and citizens are getting benefits of the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Aditya Yojana scheme for Covid treatment,” states the letter issued by the state health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas to the local authorities on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/flying-squads-to-keep-check-on-overcharging-by-private-hospitals-ambulances/story-0KjNo1u76qK91m29VmuACM.html

To date, he had organised around 1,133 weddings since 1987 under the aegis of the Thane District Slum Dwellers’ Welfare Sangh. Churi would also do ‘kanyadhaan’ of many orphaned tribal brides at the weddings.In many cases, tribals would take large loans to pay for weddings and would be stuck paying the debt for years. Churi started community weddings to stem the practice by making the function more affordable for the tribals.He was also a union leader for the industrial workers in Tarapur and was associated with the Bombay Labour Union.Last week, the 71-year-old came down with a fever but recovered in a few days. However, he relapsed and succumbed to the infection. According to Dr Dinkar Gavit, medical superintendent at Palghar Rural Hospital, following his death, Churi’s test came back positive of Covid-19.He was cremated at Palghar civic crematorium, where only 15 of his relatives were present, and social distancing was practiced as per protocol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/veteran-journalist-and-social-activist-dies-of-covid-in-palghar/story-Iyi9aeE06kHW490IaF2xLM.html
08-08-2020||Mumbai||Need to study low death rate in slums: TIFR on sero survey||Even though the sero survey of three civic wards showed higher (57%) prevalence of Covid infection, where residents silently recovered thanks to antibodies, in slums compared to residential areas (16%), the overall fatality rate of these wards has been similar to the rest of the city, a finding which researchers from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) feel needs to be studied further. The three wards – M-West (Tilaknagar and Chembur), F-North (Matunga, Sion and Wadala) and R-North (Dahisar and Mandapeshwar) – have a fatality rate of 7.87%, 5.85% and 4.27%, respectively. The city’s overall fatality rate is 5.53%. Slums comprise 73.8% of the area in F-North ward, 75.3% in M-West ward and 60% in R-North ward. The segregated data of fatality rates in slums and non-slum areas in these wards is not available.As per data of the antibody survey shared by TIFR, 4,234 individuals were randomly surveyed in the slums, while swab samples were collected from every fourth building in non-slum areas. F-North ward topped in the presence of antibodies, in 1,240 of the 2,144 people tested, in slums. In M-West ward, 860 of the 1,518 people surveyed in slums came positive. In R-North ward, 292 of the 572 people came positive.Ullas S Kolthur, principal investigator of the survey, and researcher Sandeep Juneja spoke in-depth on the findings of the sero-survey via an online discussion on Friday. “If we see the fatality rate, it is almost similar to the cumulative death rate of Mumbai. We are unsure of the reason behind such few deaths in slums despite such a huge infection rate. This can be because a large portion of the infected patients were young who recovered properly. We need more research on it,” said Juneja, professor and dean, school of technology and computer science, TIFR. On July 3, the civic body in collaboration with NITI-Aayog and TIFR started sero surveillance in which a group of individuals undergo blood tests to detect the presence of Immunoglobulin-G (IgG) antibodies. IgG antibodies are produced by the body’s immune system on being exposed to a virus. A sero-survey helps identify individuals who were previously infected with the virus, but developed antibodies and recovered. Although the estimated target was 10,000 blood samples, the ongoing monsoon restricted the collection process to 6,936 samples, said a health officer from BMC. The civic body has also run an antibody test on 1,000 health workers, results of which are awaited. Kolthur and Juneja said their initial target was to collect the same number of samples from both slum and non-slum areas in the three wards. But due to resistance from citizens in residential areas, they failed to meet the target. Only 10% individuals from residential areas gave their consent for the survey, while almost 80% slum dwellers cooperated with the researchers. As BMC plans to start the second phase of the sero-survey, researchers have requested people to cooperate. “There is a lot of speculation among people residing in non-slum areas. When we enter to collect samples, they protest. In some areas, we had to convince society members through our own personal contacts. As it is a population-based study, people have to help and trust us,” said Kolthur, professor at the department of biological sciences, TIFR. Juneja while discussing the sero-survey findings revealed that 90% of the people surveyed in the slums didn’t have access to personal toilets. “There is a need to focus more on increasing toilets in the slums in the future as community toilets are extremely infectious. In residential areas, only 30% of the people didn’t have personal toilets,” he said. Dr Abhijit More, co-convenor, Jan Aarogya Abhiyan, said, “When infection started spreading in the slums of Mumbai, ward officers installed plastic makeshift toilets for the quarantined and high-risk contacts which helped stop the spread of the virus. We need to incorporate this idea while upgrading Mumbai and surrounding satellite areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/need-to-study-low-death-rate-in-slums-tifr-on-sero-survey/story-OTSihWzRhk4MWvcSPEirIO.html
08-08-2020||City||Thane MNS chief released on bail||Thane district president of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) was granted bail on a ₹15,000 bond by Thane session court on Friday, a week after he was arrested by Thane Police for protesting outside a Covid hospital and allegedly violating several lockdown norms. Jadhav was also served an externment notice from police departments of Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Navi Mumbai and Mumbai, the hearing on which is still pending. Jadhav was arrested on July 31, following which he was in police custody for two days and judicial custody for five days. The court had, on Monday, rejected his first bail application. Omkar Rajurkar, Jadhav’s lawyer, said, “Jadhav has got bail on the bond of ₹15,000 as the court realised his arrest was merely a political propaganda. He was pressured to give up his fight for the people through the arrest. We will challenge the externment order too, for which partial hearing is completed.”On July 31, three or four MNS workers and around 30 nurses, led by Jadhav, staged a protest outside Thane Municipal Corporation’s headquarters in Panchpakhadi and the Covid hospital in Balkum. Naupada police booked Jadhav under sections 188 and 269 for disobedience and act likely to spread infection, while he was arrested by Kapurbawdi police the same night for obstructing the work of a civil servant. Assistant police commissioner Pankaj Shirsat said, “Avinash Jadhav has got a bail. Our investigation will be on, and if required, we will call him for inquiry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-mns-chief-released-on-bail/story-10oNB8HhGhcTxEa1B6bseJ.html
08-08-2020||Mumbai||Willing to declare south Konkan wildlife corridor as ESA, but state needs to send proposal first: Centre tells HC||The Union environment ministry has told the Bombay high court (HC) that despite the Centre’s intention to declare the Dodamarg-Sawantwadi wildlife corridor in Sindhudurg as an eco-sensitive area (ESA), Maharashtra government has not sent a proposal even after seven years. On Friday, a bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice AS Gadkari, while hearing interim applications by NGO Vanashakti and Awaaz Foundation seeking implementation of previous orders citing threat to the corridor’s biodiversity, directed petitioners to explain the maintainability of their petition and explain why it should not be transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The next date of hearing is on August 17. “The court wanted to hear from us on maintainability in view of the NGT Act and that we were seeking a notification under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. We highlighted issues in this matter overlapping with provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972 and certain schedules of the NGT Act excluding WPA. Thus, this matter may be heard by HC,” said Zaman Ali, co-counsel for Vanashakti. To curb environmentally destructive activities in this corridor, the court had in 2012, 2013 and 2018 directed for the declaration of the ESA and also ordered the belt be a ‘no tree-felling zone’. The HC had, on Wednesday, asked the ministry of environment forests and climate change (MoEFCC) to file their response on steps taken to comply with previous orders. MoEFCC in its affidavit stated that it cannot take an independent decision. “In view of the fact that the state supports declaration of Sawantwadi-Dodamarg corridor as ESA, a proposal based on ground level information and land records has been sought to be submitted for consideration,” read the affidavit, which HT has reviewed, and was confirmed by counsel for MoEFCC Parag Vyas. The petitioner alleged that the Maharashtra government was delaying the matter. “The state is dragging its feet which forced us to go back to the HC,” said Stalin D, director of Vanashakti. Declaring an area as ESA means prohibiting projects such as mining, quarrying, and red category industries while restricting infrastructure development. MoEFCC also suggested that the state consider including the wildlife corridor in the proposed Western Ghats ESA. “This will ensure that a single notification can cover both Western Ghats and Sawantwadi-Dodamarg as ESA,” MoEFCC said. Maharashtra has proposed a total area of 15,359 square kilometre (sqkm) for the draft Western Ghats ESA, which excluded 11.4% of the originally proposed area by the Centre. The proposal left out crucial wildlife corridors including the entire Dodamarg taluka. “The inclusion of Dodamarg in the Western Ghats ESA is still awaited from the state government,” the affidavit said. State chief wildlife warden Nitin Kakodkar reiterated that the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun was appointed to assess the exact boundary of the corridor, based on which a proposal would be sent. However, the study, first proposed in early 2019, has not started yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/willing-to-declare-south-konkan-wildlife-corridor-as-esa-but-state-needs-to-send-proposal-first-centre-tells-hc/story-F48sTC9RrtLSn8UWkeiC5L.html

A few locals, who caught the fish, contacted Bhushan Bhoir, assistant professor of Zoology, SDSM Dandekar College, Palghar. Bhoir contacted Akhilesh KV, a scientist at the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) Mumbai, who identified the fish.“Armoured catfish is an invasive species which is rarely found in lakes, rivers and is known to compete with local species for food and shelter and has a high fecundity rate (the ability to produce an abundance of offspring) and can tolerate fluctuations in pH salinity and other chemical factors of water. Hence, it is hardy and can acclimatise to any water body,” said Bhoir.He, however, added that this is a warning that natural fish resources are in danger as armoured fish attack and kill other fish. “They compete with local species for food and shelter. They also eat eggs laid in sand by other fish, due to which within 5 to 10 years all local fish species may go extinct in that water bodies,” warned Bhoir. He cited the example of Tilapia which was illegally imported from Africa and introduced to Indian waterbodies and said that now many of these waterbodies which have Tilapia do not have any other fish.The armoured catfish has been kept in a well and will not be released in the creek, said Bhoir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/armoured-catfish-found-in-dahanu-creek/story-LpPQc9MAMT2QPxXYZK8mhJ.html
08-08-2020||Mumbai||‘Mumbai malls see low footfall, but high conversion due to planned shopping’||Two days since malls and supermarkets in Mumbai reopened after over four months of lockdown, heavy rains on August 5 and 6 impacted the crowd and staff turnout at the retail stores. The mall owners and retailers, however, said that while there was less footfall, the conversion rate has gone up.The conversion rate is described as the number of customers who turn up, versus those who shop. This is attributed to planned shopping, instead of visiting malls for leisure. The mall owners and retailers are now hopeful that the coming weekend will see better footfall.The High Street Phoenix Mall in Lower Parel saw 65% of retailers open shops on August 5. Rajendra Kalkar, president - West, The Phoenix Mills Ltd. said, “Given the weather conditions, the first day was very good and successful. Due to rains, footfalls were restricted and a lot of staffers could not reach. But we had customers coming from Worli, Prabhadevi and Dadar. We opened the mall with a good 65% occupancy. We expect the count to reach 80% in a day or so, once the weather gets better.”As part of staggered lockdown in March, the Maharashtra government via a notification shut down malls and multiplexes in the second week of March. After 4.5 months, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) issued a circular allowing malls and supermarkets to reopen from August 5 as part of state government’s Mission Begin Again. This circular has disallowed reopening of multiplexes and the dine-in option for restaurants and food courts inside malls. However, food delivery is allowed through aggregates.Many mall owners and retailers expect only serious buyers to visit malls. Sachin Dhanawade, chief operating officer (retail and real estate), Grauer & Weil (India) Limited, which operates Growel’s 1O1 Mall in the Kandivali said, “We were expecting only serious buyers as people are being advised to not step out of their homes unless necessary. As seen in other states, where malls have been operational for a month, customers have been visiting for planned purchases and not for leisure as yet, so the conversions rate is very high.”According to Dhanawade, while Growel’s 101 saw 20% footfall as compared to the same days last year, the conversion rate has gone up three times, and average spend per customer has gone up four times. The food and beverage industry in malls have seen a conversion rate of 100%.A representative of Growel’s 101 said, “This week a lot of staff could not turn up for work due to rains, or as many of them live in Mumbai Metropolitan Region.”Dhanawade said, “We are offering free parking over this weekend and are expecting about 30% to 35% of footfalls this weekend. However, we are confident that the August 15th weekend will be more buzzing as consumers will be more confident to step out for a shopping trip. We are positive that as consumers become more aware of the safety arrangements.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-malls-see-low-footfall-but-high-conversion-due-to-planned-shopping/story-IawIvDVIWtYt3FAOJ03QJI.html

They further said that they had inputs that the builder was bootlegging liquor and frisked him. However, the accused then let him go with a warning. Later when the victim was looking for his car keys, the conmen returned and tried to steal his gold chain by claiming a crime had occurred in the vicinity and it was not safe to wear valuables. The builder managed to escape and tipped off a police patrol team about the incident, following which police officers reached the spot and arrested two accused, Sandesh Maladkar and Sachin Singh. The third accused is absconding, said a police officer. We arrested the duo under sections 170 (impersonation), 420(cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and the duo have been remanded in judicial custody on Thursday.

HC was also informed that the plea to transfer the investigation into Rajput’s death to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) from Mumbai Police had also seen some developments, as based on the recommendation of the Bihar governor, the Centre has issued a notification, based on which CBI has already filled an FIR. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice AS Gadkari, while hearing the PILs filed by advocate Priyanka Tibrewal and a Nagpur resident, Sameet Thakkar, was informed that both the petitions had similar requests related to the probe. Tibrewal, however, submitted that as the transfer petitions being heard by the SC did not have any request for transfer of investigation to CBI, the court could hear the PIL. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni submitted that the SC on July 30 dismissed a petition seeking transfer of investigation from Mumbai Police to CBI and also submitted an August 5 order of the SC in which it had asked Maharashtra government to submit a report on the progress in the investigation by August 18. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh representing the Union of India informed the bench that the Maharashtra government had gone overboard in trying to stall Bihar police from participating in the investigation. He added that while earlier in the lockdown police personnel had come from Bihar to investigate other cases they were not quarantined, but when an IPS officer came for the investigation in Rajput’s case was put under 14-day quarantine. “To unearth the truth, Mumbai Police should not create any problem in entrustment of the investigation to CBI,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rajput-death-case-no-orders-on-pils-till-aug-21-says-hc/story-v5Yrj5VT7HvBEdWZVRLFGK.html

TAFI has also requested the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MOCA) along with DGCA to intervene after IATA declared to refund only 8% of the total amount spent on air tickets by passengers.In a letter to DGCA chief Arun Kumar, the travel agents’ body has called for setting up a fund for airlines who could go out of business and urged the aviation regulator to call a meeting of travel agents to discuss the issue.TAFI said MoCA and DGCA should be concerned with the delicate situation that is prevalent now and learn from the bad situation created by Jet Airways’ default and closure. since only 8% is being considered as a refund for payment by IATA. The Federation alleged IATA did not keep an adequate deposit despite being aware of the likely default.Its letter to the DGCA read, ‘It is a passenger loss, the Indian citizen loss...it is about time the oversight authority (DGCA) creates a fund to cover airlines facing bankruptcy type of situation, in case of LCC’s (low-cost carriers), registered in India.

Babu, 54, an associate professor in DU’s department of English, was arrested on July 28. He was produced before the special court on Friday morning, as his custody with the NIA ended. The agency did not seek his further custody and requested the court to remand him in judicial custody, which the court accepted. According to the prosecution, Babu, who is an activist of Kabir Kala Manch – a cultural organisation in Pune – gave a “provocative presentation” as well as speeches on December 31, 2017, during the Elgar Parishad conclave at Shaniwar Wada, Pune, which led to violence the next day, resulting in the death of one person and a state-wide agitation. The agency also claimed that Babu had links with Manipur-based insurgent group Kangleipak Communist Party-Military Council (KCP-MC). The agency is probing his emails and data recovered from his social media and computers. NIA also alleged that Babu was closely linked with banned Communist Party of India-Maoist outfit and was involved in raising funds to help Maoists for their release from prisons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-hany-babu-mt-sent-to-judicial-custody-till-aug-21/story-C54OrGDXPpmFM74LKMpDCI.html

However, for the past two years, due to increase in the height of Barvi dam, the village has essentially become an island, surrounded from all sides by water, completely inundating access roads and cutting them off from rest of the world.The petition added that 2019 monsoon was particularly difficult for the villagers who had to travel through makeshift rafts and suffered colossal damage to agricultural lands and properties.The situation in Talyanchi Wadi, according to the petitioners, was no different as the villagers remained cut off from main access roads the entire year. The tribal settlement, they said, was also surrounded by water on three sides with the fourth side being a dense forest, leaving the village without any access road.They have, therefore, sought directions to MIDC to for permanent rehabilitation contending that the ministry of environment and forests has cleared the third phase of heightening of Barvi dam without allowing land for rehabilitation of the two tribal villages.On Wednesday, their counsel, advocate Ronita Bector, pointed out that the tribals were in urgent need of ration, drinking water and transportation facility.Advocate Shyamali Gadre, who represented MIDC, maintained that drinking water was being provided to villagers and they have been paid ₹6,500 per project-affected family towards ration.Bector, however, disputed the claim about payment for ration, and pointed out that all the affected families were not paid the amount and it was not made clear by MIDC as to who all were held eligible to receive the benefits.Judges said potable drinking water and transport were basic facilities and must be supplied by the concerned authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/provide-water-transportation-to-2-murbad-villages-hc-to-midc/story-t651Keein2C93B7XygEyCJ.html
08-08-2020||Mumbai||ED questions Rhea for 9 hours in Sushant case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) questioned actor Rhea Chakraborty for nearly nine hours on Friday in a money-laundering case it has registered in connection with Sushant Singh Raput’s suspected suicide on June 14. The 28-year-old Chakraborty, Rajput’s girlfriend at the time of his death, arrived at the agency’s office in Balard Estate area around 11:50am after her request to defer the questioning was turned down. She left the ED office at around 8:45pm. The agency, which investigates money laundering and foreign exchange violations, also questioned Chakraborty’s bro-ther, Showik, and her business manager, Shruti Modi, who worked for Rajput as well. Their statements were recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). ED officials privy to details said the agency was looking into Chakraborty’s tax returns and investments. The officials said Chakraborty respo-nded to most of the questions. A property located in the Khar area of Mumbai is also being probed by ED for the source of its purchase and ownership. Chakraborty told interrogators that she took around ~60 lakh home loan for the property worth ~84 lakh, according to the officials. When ED officials asked her about the remaining amount, she said she arranged the rest on her own and made the payment through cheques, the officials said. Investigators also tried to get more information on the formation of four companies by Rajput, Chakraborty and her family. While two of these companies were registered, the rest of the two were under the process of getting registered. Chakraborty said she did not siphon of anyone’s money, the officials said.“She has been examined and her statement...(has been) recorded... She’s always cooperated with investigations with police and ED. She has nothing to hide. In the event she’s called again, she will appear at the appointed time,” Satish Maneshinde, her lawyer and senior counsel, said. “Rhea Chakraborty is a law-abiding citizen. In view of the fact that ED has informed the media that the request to postpone the attendance is rejected, she appeared before the ED at the appointed time and date,” Maneshinde said in a statement earlier in the day. Chakraborty initially refused to appear before the agency, citing her appeal pending before the SC. She has requested that the FIR filed in Patna be transferred to Mumbai, arguing that Bihar Police have no jurisdiction. Rajput’s death has sparked a debate on mental health issues, how the film industry treats outsiders, and also the circumstances that led to his suspected suicide. The mystery has moved on from theories on and investigations into how nepotism in Bollywood may have claimed his life to allegations of a criminal conspiracy involving Chakraborty.ED filed a case on July 31 on the basis of a first information report (FIR) by the Bihar Police. The FIR was registered after a complaint by Rajput’s father, KK Singh, who accused Chakraborty and her family of abetting the actor’s suicide and siphoning of his money. Singh accused that close to ~15 crore were transferred from Rajput’s account to unknown persons not linked to him. He said his son’s credit cards were with Chakraborty. Alongside ED, the CBI, too, has launched a probe on the request of the Bihar government and named Chakraborty, her brother and four other family members, apart from unknown persons, as accused. The Bihar Police have handed over their case files to CBI in the midst of a jurisdictional dispute with the Maharashtra Police, who have filed an accidental death report.Rajput’s roommate, Siddharth Pithani, too has been called by ED to appear on Saturday, PTI reported. Pithani, an IT professional stated to be living with Rajput for about a year, is believed to be out of Mumbai and he has said in news channel interviews that he was present in the Bandra flat on June 14, when the 34-year-old actor hanged himself. The agency has already questioned Rajput’s chartered accountant, Sandeep Shridhar, and his house manager and staff, Samuel Miranda, twice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ed-questions-rhea-for-9-hours-in-sushant-case/story-YkaVwrjzGmXpYtY0fVHGNM.html
08-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra first Indian state to declare state mangrove tree as symbol of conservation||Maharashtra is set to become the first coastal state to declare a state mangrove tree species as a symbol to enhance conservation of the salt-tolerant vegetation.The proposal from the state mangrove cell to declare Sonneratia alba or mangrove apple, an evergreen mangrove species found along the state’s coastline, as state mangrove tree was approved during a meeting of the recently constituted State Board of Wildlife (SBWL) on Friday.“The proposal was approved considering the ecological importance of mangroves and the biodiversity it hosts. The formal declaration will be made after minutes of Friday’s SBWL meeting are published,” said Nitin Kakodkar, chief wildlife warden and member secretary of the board. Known as white chippi in Marathi, Sonneratia alba grow up to five feet and bear white flowers with a pink base as well as green fruits, that resemble apple and are used to make pickles. They often grow on newly-formed mudflats and play an important role in combating land erosion. The flowers, which bloom at night, are pollinated by nocturnal creatures like bats. Distribution of this mangrove species is confined to the west coast and some parts of Orissa. The mangrove cell has documented its presence along wetlands in Thane creek, Bhandup, Vasai and Dombivli along major mudflats.Maharashtra already has the state tree (mango), state animal (giant squirrel), state bird (green pigeon), state butterfly (Blue Mormon), and state flower (jarul). “This species adds aesthetic value to the mangrove ecosystem and this needs to be recognised,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest, Mangrove cell.Sheetal Pachpande, assistant director (projects), Mangrove cell, said, “Other rare mangrove species were not considered as they are not easily seen, and it would be difficult to generate awareness about their importance.”Though the species was introduced in Maharashtra and available records show it is native to Andaman islands, the declaration stands as a symbol for conserving this threatened biodiversity, said Dr Suchandra Dutta, department of botany, RD and SH National College, Bandra.Of the 60 mangrove species recognised globally, Maharashtra has 20. Close to 75% of mangrove cover across Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane is dominated by the grey mangrove species named Avicennia marina. Last year, the cell had recorded a threefold increase in mangrove apple cover at creek edges from 2% to 6% across MMR since 2011. A 2015 study by the zoology department of Sathaye College, Vile Parle found that the leaf extracts of these species possess high antimicrobial properties, which can be used for development of drugs as antimicrobial agents for treating infectious diseases.Experts said these mangrove species regulate water quality. “The dense root network acts as a wall trapping while absorbing excess nutrients,” said Laxmikant Deshpande, a conservationist.First proposed in mid-2018, SBWL’s approval comes after two years since the board hadn’t been constituted until last month. “There is one thing very remarkable about this species. Its tall breathing roots (pneumatophores) represent its resilience to climate change and sea level rise. Where Avicennia, presently the dominant genus, could fail as the sea level rises, Sonneratia has the latent potential to thrive. It is as if this plant has instinctively equipped itself with a defence mechanism to fight future sea level rise. This is also symbolic of the planet’s hope to thrive in the face of changing climate and impending catastrophes,” said N Vasudevan, former mangrove cell head.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-first-indian-state-to-declare-state-mangrove-tree-as-symbol-of-conservation/story-UWiwIWpYQPfgo1rUAnsVXJ.html
08-08-2020||Mumbai||Development not at cost of ecology, says CM at first wildlife board meet||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday emphasised that development projects will not be done at the cost of damage to the ecology and environment. Thackeray, in the first meeting of the newly formed State Board for Wildlife (SBWL), said that for the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government development is not merely construction but also preservation of forest and wildlife. The CM approved three key projects in the state including the declaration of the 2,011 square kilometre (sqkm) Angria Bank as a protected area, appointing Sonneratia alba as state mangrove tree, and a recovery programme for Arabian Sea humpback whale. Maharashtra became the first state in the country to declare a state mangrove tree. Sonneratia alba is one of the important evergreen mangrove tree species in the coastal districts of Maharashtra, known as white chippi in local parlance as it bears beautiful white flowers. Angria Bank, a submerged plateau 120km off Malvan coast, if approved by the Centre, will be the first such marine protected zone in India. SBWL approved the recommendation to the Central government to notify Angria Bank as a designated area. SBWL also recommended starting a research programme including visual survey, genetics study, workshops, seminars and training for personnel to rehabilitate Arabian Sea Humpback whales. “We will be using a combination of acoustic and visual monitoring methods to understand the behaviour as well for long term conservation of the species. Our proposal is for five years at a cost of ₹6.12 crore,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove Cell). Kakokdar said it would be funded 60% by the Centre and remaining by the state. Thackeray, during the meeting, made it clear that henceforth all projects that come for approval from SBWL will be tabled only if they have a recent drone survey along with the requisite Environment Impact Assessment Report (EIA). “In the very first meet of the newly formed board, he has given out a firm message that wildlife and environment is as important as development, shan’t be compromised. More so, @CMOMaharashtra @OfficeofUT emphasised that all proposed human development projects must compulsorily come with not just EIA but present-day drone survey,” state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted after the meeting. One of the proposals on the agenda which was not approved was a renewal of the lease for bauxite mining in Minchebudruk village of Kolhapur district. “The mine falls next to Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary. The CM expressed his displeasure over such a proposal next to a wildlife sanctuary and dismissed it,” said a board member, who did not wish to be named. Aaditya, in a tweet, called for “balanced and sustainable” development. “Forest management and aquatic wildlife management has to be more robust, empathetic towards the biodiversity and ensure development that is balanced and sustainable,” the environment minister said in a series of tweets. Other key decisions include formation of a committee to study measures to reduce the population of tigers to avoid human-tiger conflict in Chandrapur. “It was highlighted that there have been over 150 deaths in Chandrapur between 2007 and 2020, and with over 50% of the state’s tiger population in one district, the situation is worrisome. Now, the state will constitute a committee at the Mantralaya level which will deliberate on possible measures to address this problem,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) and member secretary of SBWL. Mitigation measures suggested by sub-committees under SBWL for projects such as the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed rail, Delhi-Mumbai freight corridor, Goregaon-Mulund link road and Nagpur-Mumbai super expressway proposed around Sanjay Gandhi National Park, Tansa and Thane creek flamingo sanctuary, were presented before the board. “It was decided these mitigation measures in the form of animal underpasses and elevated corridors would be clubbed for all these projects and implemented simultaneously,” said Kakokdar. He added that the proposal to convert the Akola to Khandwa meter gauge railway line from the Melghat Tiger Reserve to a broad gauge railway line was rejected by the board and it was proposed that the railway line would bypass the tiger reserve. “We will also be exploring the declaration of areas such as Mogarkasa in Nagpur, Mahindri in Amravati, and Chandgad Patne adjoining Tillari in Sindhudurg, which were all proposed to be declared as conservation reserves,” said Kakodkar.

08-08-2020||City||Dera Bassi accounts for 41% Covid-19 cases in Mohali district||There has been no respite for residents of Dera Bassi sub-division in Mohali district, which has been continually recording the highest number of Covid-19 cases since the outbreak was first reported. As of August 7, the sub-division has 485 cases (41.4%).Kharar is next with 366 cases (31.3%), followed by Mohali city with 318 (27.2%). Dera Bassi sub-division comprises Dera Bassi town, Zirakpur and Lalru with a population of around four lakh. All towns are located on the Ambala-Chandigarh highway. Jawaharpur was its first village to be declared a hotspot with 46 cases on April 30. Later, the focus shifted to Mubarakpur village, where 26 cases were reported in May. Now, the count is going up because of cases coming in from the entire sub-division. Pointing out the likely reason, Dr Manjit Singh, civil surgeon, Mohali, said Dera Bassi was located on the interstate border and more people from other states were coming here to work in factories. Zirakpur too had a huge migrant population. “We are trying our best to take maximum samples from the area,” he added. Dr Vikrant Nagra, nodal officer for Dera Bassi, said Zirakpur and Dera Bassi were semi-urban areas with a large number of residential societies. Attributing the spike to aggressive sampling, he said most of the patients were the contacts of positive patients and had travel history. After Dera Bassi, Kharar sub-division comprising Nayagaon, Mullanpur, Kurali and some villages has reported 346 cases. Dr Harmandeep Kaur Brar, nodal officer for Covid-19 in the district, while sounding a note of caution, said though the lockdown had been lifted, people’s carelessness would mean a surge in infections. “If we do not observe precautions, the disease can strike us again in no time,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dera-bassi-accounts-for-41-covid-19-cases-in-mohali-district/story-Iezrjs4ILP9ex5hzzTbeQN.html

Mauli Jagran also had no case, but now has 18.Sectors 1 to 10 in the city’s northern part have the lowest number of active cases at seven. This was even lower 40 days ago when only Sector 9 had one case.SECTORS: FROM 44 TO 322 CASES IN 40 DAYSDuring the 40-day period between June 27 and August 7, the active cases in sectors rose by seven times, while in colonies and villages there was a fourfold rise.On June 27, the active cases in sectors were 44, which jumped to 322 within 40 days. In villages and cities, there were 42 Covid patients on June 27, but the figure climbed to 178 as of August 7.Experts say as the restrictions were eased phase wise, the infection was bound to spread due to movement and mixing up of population from different areas. Therefore, strict measures were required to contain the spread.“Deadlines should be set. Once a suspected person is tested, the reports should be available within 24 hours and the patient should be isolated immediately. The real job starts when the contacts of the infected person need to be located. On an average, 10 to 15 people, who may have interacted with the patient at home, work or during travel should be identified and tested. The process should be quick and subsequent action should be swift,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of the department of community medicine and school of public health, PGIMER.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-s-footprint-spread-to-76-localities-of-chandigarh-within-40-days/story-iZ7TOUlD6LpzcYRlSErUpM.html

The CSCL will soon allot the project to the lowest bidder – Larsen & Toubro Limited. Work on the plant is expected to start in September.Confirming the development, NP Sharma, chief general manager, CSCL, said, “Against the project price of Rs 329 crore, the company offered the lowest bid of Rs 283 crore.”Apart from the Diggian STP, four other plants in the city will also be upgrade. As the Diggian STP is the biggest, a separate tender was floated and four firms responded to it. For the remaining STPs – seven firms applied to upgrade the plants at Raipur Kalan and Raipur Khurd; and three for those at Dhanas and 3BRD.In October, CSCL had floated a ₹700-crore tender to hire a single agency to upgrade all five STPs of the municipal corporation (MC).However, the MC General House in November did not endorse the proposal, citing it was meant to benefit large firms only and the budget for the work was on the higher side.Settling the matter, the UT administration in its letter to CSCL and MC, asked to cancel the existing tender and split it into three parts – one for Diggian plant, one for the two STPs at Raipur Kalan and Raipur Khurd and another for the 3BRD and Dhanas STPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-smart-city-limited-shortlists-l-t-to-upgrade-diggian-sewage-treatment-plant/story-yZHRtSZ4YjH2NEdzsLuapL.html

Talking to the mediapersons while being taken to police station following their detention by Chandigarh Police as they march towards the Punjab governor’s house to stage a dharna, former Akali minister Bikram Majithia and party’s Rajya Sabha member Balwinder Bhunder demanded immediate dismissal of the Amarinder Singh government.“The the truth is that he paid a 20-minute visit to the Tarn Taran police lines that was turned into an army cantonment as the Congress government feared a backlash from the people,” they said. “People were summoned as if it was a durbar. A large number of them refused to come despite intense pressure from police deputed specifically for the purpose,” said Majitha.The two, who were flanked by relatives of the victims from Muchal village in Amritsar, said, “Instead of humiliating the victims’ kin by behaving like a feudal lord, he should have visited their houses and announced a compensation of Rs 25 lakh and a government job for each family.”‘CAPT FEARED PUBLIC WRATH’In Tarn Taran, addressing a press conference after a protest, SAD spokesman Virsa Singh Valtoha said the CM chose to return to Chandigarh within 15 minutes of getting down from his helicopter after he learnt of a massive protest nearby by the families of the tragedy victims. Valtoha was accompanied by former MLA Harmeet Singh Sandhu and party’s ex-district president Iqbal Singh Sandhu, said, “But even after coming here he could not face them and chose to retreat to his farmhouse in Chandigarh.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cm-s-tarn-taran-visit-mere-photo-op-joyride-says-sad/story-YgL0urNB1ZJwvc2oWX2EON.html

In a press statement, Jakhar said that those staging the dharna were the same people whose government’s posters were put up in broad daylight after committing murderous assault on Guru Granth Sahib. These are the same people who when in government had even taken back the case filed against the dera head,” he claimed. “Sukhbir must clarify whether he was deputy chief minister or not when these tragic and heart-rending incidents were happening in Punjab. It was during their government that the dera chief crushed the religious sentiments of Sikhs at Salabatpura,” he said. “When holy scriptures were stolen from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala in 2015, the so-called ‘panthic’ government of SAD instead of arresting the culprits opened fired at innocent protesters,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sukhbir-s-patiala-dharna-similar-to-blasphemy-by-dera-chief-jakhar/story-8kMQYShTkQVK9OxvsXCIAI.html
08-08-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab allows fixed-term industrial employment||The Punjab government has allowed all industrial establishments in the state to hire workers on fixed-term contracts of any duration to promote ease of doing business. A notification was issued by the labour department to amend the Indian Employment (Standing Orders) Punjab Rules, 1978, on Thursday to make a provision for fixed-term employment wherein workers can be hired by industrial units for any fixed duration for specific season or worker order, depending on requirement. The changes in employment rules, which were sought by industry associations for a long time, have made after approval from the state cabinet, allowing them flexibility in hiring workforce after enter into a written contract with them. “Their hours of work, wages, allowances and other benefits will not be less than that of a permanent employee. They will also be eligible for all statutory benefits available to a permanent workman proportionately according to the period of service rendered by him,” additional chief secretary, labour, Vijay Kumar Janjua said. The employers have been prohibited from converting existing permanent posts into fixed-term employment but they can do new hiring on contract. Janjua said the rules were drafted in June and the notification was issued after following the due process of calling objections and suggestions. The Centre had also approved the labour code last year to allow companies to hire workers on fixed-term contracts for any duration. In addition, the state government has exempted the industrial establishments engaged in continuous process industry from the provisions of the Punjab Industrial Establishment (national and festival holidays, casual and sick leave) Act, 1965, allowing flexibility to decide holidays as per their requirement. The micro, small and medium units have also been exempted from mandatory certification of standing orders under the industrial employment rules. The MSME will not require periodic approvals of these and will have to comply with provisions of the model standing orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-allows-fixed-term-industrial-employment/story-4IHaJToyFXcVjezSsXcA4N.html
08-08-2020||City||SET on liquor theft: ‘Smuggled liquor flowed in Haryana during lockdown’||The report of a special enquiry team (SET) constituted in May by the Haryana government to inquire into the instances of pilferage of liquor from warehouses has revealed glaring deficiencies in functioning of excise and taxation department and indicated collusion of officials in smuggling and illegal sale of liquor. The findings have also prompted Haryana home minister Anil Vij to recommend departmental action against an IAS and IPS officers. Assistant editor Hitender Rao takes a close look at the report. Why was the special enquiry team (SET) constituted by the Haryana government ? The trigger was revelations that large amount of seized liquor was pilfered from a godown in Kharkhauda in Sonepat during the lockdown period. What was its scope of inquiry? The SET was mandated to check whether the stock of liquor that was there on the date of sealing a warehouse was actually available or not, to examine the cases of seizure of illicit/ non excise duty paid liquor in Haryana during April 2019 to March 2020 by the police and excise departments separately, action and fines imposed by the excise department following recovery of liquor. The probe team was also asked to collect and collate the results of investigation of the FIRs registered from March 15 till April 10 for pilferage of liquor from wholesale Indian-made foreign liquor and country liquor godowns and also from the police malkhanas. What were findings of SET regarding illegal sale of liquor? Illegal liquor sale in Haryana took place between April 1, 2019 and May 10, 2010, a significant quantity of liquor was smuggled from Punjab, 8,337 liquor cases (each case has 12 bottles) were seized and 250 FIRs were registered. During the lockdown, the liquor found its way into various districts of Haryana from Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and also some state distilleries. How was the illegal liquor sale made possible? Systemic flaws in the functioning of excise department, lack of monitoring, non-implementation of its own instructions, and possibility of collusion or negligence by excise and police officials made it possible. What did the SET say about installation of closed circuit television cameras in distilleries? The excise and taxation commissioner (ETC) and collector (excise) admitted that they neither examined the video footage nor there are any instructions about examining the recordings, storing them and line of action in case lapses were detected. Had the department pursued the installation of video cameras in its right earnest, the possible mischief by distilleries and their ability to smuggle liquor without paying excise duty could have been checked to a great extent. What did the SET say about an IAS and IPS officer ? IAS officer Shekhar Vidyarthi as ETC ordered closure of liquor vends during the lockdown by only giving verbal instructions. In the absence of written instructions, permits and passes for movement of liquor were issued during the closure period by some districts. Vidyarthi was also held responsible for dilly dallying pieces of information sought by the SET and hampering the visit of the SET to a distillery. The SET said the role of the then Sonepat superintendent of police Pratiksha Godara needs to be probed. The SET observed that despite round-the-clock police guards deputed since March 2019, regular inflow and outflow of liquor took place from Kharkhauda godown suggesting clear connivance of police, especially the then local station house officer. What are the recommendations of SET? Devise a track and trace system for vehicles transporting liquor to other states and passing through Haryana, put in place standard operating procedures for streaming, storage and monitoring of video footage from distilleries and godowns, thorough audit of distilleries, destruction of seized liquor in respect of finalised cases by a set deadline, sufficient storage space for seized liquor at every district headquarter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/set-on-liquor-theft-smuggled-liquor-flowed-in-haryana-during-lockdown/story-nTdKLg5YvhcaVFXz34VgYL.html

08-08-2020||Mumbai||10,483 cases push state tally closer to 5L||Maharashtra inched towards the grim 500,000 Covid-19 cases milestone as it recorded 10,483 new infections on Friday, taking its tally up to 490,262. There were 300 fatalities, too, as the state’s toll rose to 17,092. The state conducted 81,655 tests – highest in a day since the first case was reported on March 9 –with a positivity rate of 12.83%. Maharashtra’s positivity rate over the past week (August 1-7) has improved to 17.85% from 22.17% during the July 15-21 period. The recovery rate of Maharashtra also continued to improve, as 10,906 patients tested negative for coronavirus, pushing it up to 66.76%. The national recovery rate stands at 67.62%. The state currently has 145,582 active Covid-19 cases, with 327,281 people having recovered. The recovery rate has improved over the past week, as 71,123 patients have been discharged in seven days. The state’s recovery rate was 60.68% on July 31.Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 862 cases on Friday, taking its tally to 121,012, and 45 deaths pushed up the city’s toll to 6,693. Pune district recorded 2,851 cases, highest in the state, and reported 70 deaths in 24 hours. A cause for concern for the state, however, has been the case fatality rate (CFR), which continues to be high. Maharashtra’s CFR is 3.49%, second only to Gujarat’s 3.82%. The national CFR stands at 2.04%. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday directed all the district collectors and divisional commissioners to ensure that the CFR was brought down on priority. “We will have to ensure that the second wave of the infection does not hit us, after having controlled it in many parts of the state. Aggressive tracing of the contacts, effective implementation of lockdown curbs in containment areas and timely treatment will help us in containing the spread and bringing the fatalities down,” he said.“District authorities should all be alert as the battle has not ended yet,” he said during the review meeting. Nandurbar, a tribal district in North Maharashtra, leads has the highest CFR of 5.9%, followed by Mumbai (5.5%), Solapur (5.3%) and Jalgaon (4.4%).Dr Raghunath Bhoye, civil surgeon, Nandurbar, said the time wasted in reports of the tests conducted and late referral of patients is leading to the high fatality rate. “We do not have RtPCR testing facility and are totally dependent on the one at Dhule district. We get the reports only after three days. Most of our deaths have been reported on the same day of admission or within hours after the patients come in. We have increased the number of daily tests to 250 from 40-50 a few weeks ago. We have also setup mobile facilities for testing and have been doing aggressive tracing of contacts. Our own RtPCR lab will be operational in the next couple of days, and it will help us in reducing the mortality rate in the next few days,” he said.Dr Avinash Supe, former KEM dean and member of the expert committee appointed by the state to recommend steps to curb the spread, said the fatality rate is high owing to the late referral of patients. “About 29% of the patients have died within 24 hours of admissions, while most of the remaining deaths occur in the first four days, which should be improved. Now the beds are available, medicines are available, we will now be able to bring the CFR down soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/10-483-cases-push-state-tally-closer-to-5l/story-aFkUR7k1hfPClqONfJq83L.html
08-08-2020||Chandigarh||HC questions Chandigarh admn’s failure to stop cartelisation in allotment of liquor vends||The Punjab and Haryana high court has questioned the Chandigarh administration for its failure to stop cartelisation or trade monopoly in allotment of liquor vends in the excise policy for 2020-2021. “..we are prima facie of the view that the action of the Chandigarh Administration in allotting more than 10 liquor vends to the same persons, who by formulating different companies applied for the tender process, is contrary to the purport and object to be achieved by clause 13 of the excise policy,” the bench of justice Jaswant Singh and justice Ashok Kumar Verma said during resumed hearing of a plea challenging the policy. The plea alleges that the administration’s policy is leading to “complete cartelisation and monopoly” of certain individuals through their firms. The excise policy does not promote free trade, as it states that for any brand of foreign liquor there shall be only five wholesale licensees, who shall further sell liquor to all the retail licensees. It had argued that the UT should have capped the highest bid and draw of lots could have been introduced so that cartels may not jack up prices to bag contracts. Same group got vends through 2 firmsThe court said that it has come to light that Bajaj Group has been allotted 15 liquor vends in the city, through two separate corporate entities: Bajaj Spirits Private Limited and Liquor World Venture Private Limited. The directors of both the companies are same. But excise officials have failed in performing their duties in complying with the conditions stipulated in clause 13, which says not more than one bid can be submitted by a company/firm/person for a particular licensing unit, and to curb the menace of cartelisation and monopolistic practices, a single person/entity is entitled for allotment of up to a maximum 10 vends, said the bench. The court observed that this happened despite the fact that along with bids the firms were to submit photograph, proof, PAN card and list of all directors as with the registrar of companies. “Once the directors running the company are same and still more than 10 liquor vends are allotted to the said persons, the purport and object to be achieved by imposing restriction under Clause 13 would be defeated,” adding that if persons are permitted to participate by formulating different entities, “we do not find any reason for imposing any restraint on any individual, as the same would be discriminatory in nature”. The restrictions have to be made applicable across the board for everyone or none, the bench added, asking the UT administration to submit response to some issues framed by it by October 27. The administration has been asked to address whether clause 13 conditions were violated as the department failed to check credentials of all the directors of firms, how it allowed single person/ entity to participate through artificial barrier of bidding through different firms and whether it did not amount to monopoly. It has also been asked to address if one person was allowed to bid through different entities, whether it did not defeat the purpose for which restrictions were imposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-questions-chandigarh-admn-s-failure-to-stop-cartelisation-in-allotment-of-liquor-vends/story-mhv2u3dWy2IYpo7PEkxAWM.html

The state government’s major tax collecting departments got 68 per cent of the targeted revenue in July. Its revenue collection was about 61 per cent of the target in June and 37.49 per cent in the first quarter of 2020-2021. “Yes, there has been an improvement in total earnings, though major revenue earning departments have remained far behind tax collection targets,” said a senior officer on condition of anonymity. The state government’s performance on revenue collection front also indicates that its total earnings of about Rs 10,675.42 crore in July 2020 were close to the total collections of Rs 10,926.36 crore in July 2019 when the major departments earned about 89.5 per cent of the targeted revenue. A close scrutiny indicates that the state government earned GST and VAT of Rs 6,024.16 crore in July 2020 against Rs 6,564.88 crore in July 2019. As the state government had recently revised excise duty on liquor, its earnings from excise have gone up considerably from Rs 2,112.69 crore in July 2019 to Rs 2,632.58 crore in July 2020. Its collections from stamps and registration remained at about Rs 1,365.55 crore in July 2020 against Rs 1,536.49 crore in 2019, while the state transport department earned Rs 474.59 crore in July 2020 against Rs 565.09 crore in July 2019. The mining and minor mineral department also collected higher revenue of Rs 178.54 crore in July 2020 against Rs 147.21 crore in the same month in 2019. As the state government is likely to table its first supplementary demands of grant for 2020-2021 in the monsoon session of the state legislature, commencing on August 20, the improvement in tax collections may have come as a big relief. The state government spends a sum of Rs 12,000 crore to Rs 13,000 crore every month on salaries and pension to its employees. As the total earning of the state government was Rs 10,675.42 crore in July, a wide gap remains between its earnings and expenditure. “I understand the targets set for 2020-2021 are higher than the previous year as has been the practice over the years. The state government’s earnings may be about 68 per cent of targets for July 2020. But there is still a wide gap between its earnings and expenditure. As earnings are going up now, the state government will be able to bring down the gap in the coming months. This may be a healthy sign,” said Yashvir Tyagi, former professor, department of economics, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/higher-revenue-collection-brings-hope-for-state-govt/story-yHa1SDZ2xKgUy5TBrb7F6H.html

At a joint press conference, state Congress chief Kumari Selja and party chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said only a probe monitored by a high court judge can fix the real kingpin of the liquor scam. “This half-baked investigation has only put smaller fries in the dock and provided safe escape to well connected real culprits,” Selja said.Surjewala said the liquor mafia was directly linked to politicians and senior officials occupying high positions in the state government. “The surprising fact is that this SET was neither empowered to hold any investigation under the code of criminal procedure nor did it have any legal validity,” he said. The Congress leaders also criticized the move to hold another investigation by the Vigilance Bureau. “This will mean there shall be investigation on an investigation. The ultimate objective of all these inquiries and investigations is to protect the well connected culprits and to cover up the nexus between the liquor mafia and ruling politicians,” the Congress leaders said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/liquor-scam-haryana-congress-slams-set-report-demands-hc-monitored-probe/story-jBvT3ZKl5rwGoaAOiAjNRK.html

Prime facie it seems to be a case “negligent handling of weapon”, said Raj Kumar, adding that probe is on. No FIR was registered till the filing of this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mystery-gunshots-fired-near-panchkula-chandigarh-leave-2-injured/story-M6q4L0nnpePn0lC0H4h25H.html
08-08-2020||Delhi||‘Now is not the time to rejoice, we cannot let our guard down’||Dr AK Singh Rana, the head of the department of surgery, who is the new medical superintendent (MS) of Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, spoke to Anonna Dutt about learnings from the Covid-19 pandemic, the mortality rate in the hospital, resuming the care of non-Covid patients, and expansion plans.Edited excerpts:What lessons did you learn in the last six months of the Covid pandemic? The invaluable lesson we have learnt is that everyone had to come together to enable us to take care of the patients with Covid-19. Patients suffering from the disease, including those suspected to have the infection, started coming to the hospital from March and health workers in respiratory medicine, internal medicine, and critical care medicine bore the brunt of it. Doctors, nurses, paramedics and staff from across departments pitched in and worked with a lot of dedication. In a recent review of Covid-19 deaths by the Delhi government, RML was one of 11 hospitals with the highest death toll. What is being done to reduce mortality? One of the problems with the calculation of high mortality rate in comparison to the number of admissions is that the deaths of people admitted to the hospital prior to the selected period, but who died during the said period, were included. The number of admissions had reduced during that period, that is why the number of deaths appears to be higher. Another issue—which was pointed out by physicians from several other hospitals—was the delay in admissions. We have observed that the death rate is higher when patients report to the hospital late — it could be because people are scared of coming to a hospital, public transport has not resumed full throttle, and there is an inertia among people over the last few months. The death rate is also high among old people with multiple comorbidities. With the number of Covid-19 hospitalisations on the decline, are we looking at moving to non-Covid services now? Now is not the time to rejoice; we cannot let our guards down. Other countries — like the US — saw a decline in the number of cases before the resurgence. But, yes, we need to look at how to go back to offering complete non-Covid treatment. Ever since the pandemic began, we have not closed our emergency services or the OPD at all. Next week, I have a meeting with all the heads of the departments to discuss what can be done. I want to have a plan in place so that we can gradually and safely move to taking care of non-Covid patients whenever experts feel that it is the right time. We cannot de-escalate all our preparations in one go. What are your plans for improving hospital infrastructure? We have an ambitious redevelopment plan for the hospital. With the population of Delhi growing, the old infrastructure has become inadequate. Horizontal expansion is no longer possible, we are now looking at vertical expansion. The construction of the super speciality block behind the trauma centre is about to start. It will have 332 beds; 68 with ventilators. The huge triangular area across the road — where the psychiatry department is located — will be used to construct the medical college (the hospital started an MBBS programme last year.) Then, an underpass will be constructed to connect it to the main building. A 300-bed student hostel will be constructed on a vacant plot nearby — and this will be used to relocate the departments moved from the triangular areas. We also have 2.1 acres of land where a dedicated maternity and child health centre will be constructed. An 832-room doctors’ hostel is already under construction. The old emergency and the OPD building will be razed to create high-rise buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/now-is-not-the-time-to-rejoice-we-cannot-let-our-guard-down/story-4WLDn7srEkOKpHkxnoYTYO.html
08-08-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Sample collection for Delhi’s second sero-surveillance ends||Collection of blood samples for the second round of serological surveillance in Delhi was completed on Friday, with administrations of the city’s 11 districts collecting samples from just over 15,000 people, intended to be representative of the Capital’s population. The results of the survey are expected early next week, officials said. “The results will be processed by a team at Maulana Azad Medical College, and are likely to be released by next week,” officials from Delhi’s health department said. The survey will indicate what percentage of the city’s population has developed antibodies against the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, since the first such survey was conducted between June 27 and July 10. Of those surveyed in that instance, 22.6% had antibodies against the infection. The highest number of samples were collected from Northwest district, followed by West, and Central. “We have been reporting new cases of the infection since the previous sero-surveillance, meaning that the proportion of people who have the antibodies are likely to be higher this time around. If 30 to 60% of the population has the antibodies, it will show that Delhi is on its way to developing herd immunity,” said a senior doctor from central district, on the condition of anonymity. Herd immunity is said to have been achieved when a significant proportion of the population has developed resistance to an infection, preventing its further spread. The results of the survey are, however, unlikely to change on-ground strategies, officials said. “We have to continue testing heavily, especially in areas that are reporting more cases, trace contacts of the infected persons, and isolate everyone to prevent the spread of the infection. Even if a high proportion of the people develop antibodies, we cannot relax containment measures right now,” said an official from the north district, which finished sample collection on Friday. Also read: Delhi records 1,192 fresh coronavirus cases, positivity rate dips to 5.1 per cent“ In the month since Delhi’s first survey, I am expecting that the prevalence of antibodies must have gone up to about 40%,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital. The government had announced on July 22 that a serological survey will be conducted during the first five days of every month to keep tracking the progress in the antibody levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sample-collection-for-delhi-s-second-sero-surveillance-complete/story-sIRI9KfWKXgASVlrNJeZNN.html
08-08-2020||Education||Delhi HC gives go-ahead for DU online exams, extra time to upload answer sheets||The Delhi High Court on Friday upheld Delhi University’s decision to conduct online open-book examinations (OBE) this year for final-year students from August 10 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, while passing a slew of directions for the smooth conduct of the test and giving students extra time to upload answer sheets.Justice Pratibha M Singh, while hearing petitions against the examination, said students had made enormous preparations and that the court was concerned over the manner in which processes in online tests can be streamlined.Around 240,000 final-year students are set to take the exams from August 10 as a one-time measure this year.The court said the question papers should be available on the portal and also emailed to the students. It said regular students will get complete three hours for answering the question papers and an additional hour for scanning and uploading the answer sheets.“Thus regular students would have a total period of four hours to complete the exam, scan and upload email the answer sheets. Similarly, students under PWD category are also given one additional hour for downloading the question paper, completing their answers and uploading the answer sheets i.e., a total of six hours,” the court said.It said DU should ensure the central email ID as well as email ID s of all colleges and departments have adequate capacity to receive and store answer sheets so that they do not bounce back.The court reconstituted a grievance redressal committee, comprising Justice Pratibha Rani (Retd. Judge, Delhi High Court) as chairperson and professor K S Rao, department of botany as deputy chairperson. Professor Kavita Sharma, department of commerce, B B Gupta, senior advocate and Kamal Gupta, advocate, are members.“The grievance redressal committee as constituted by DU is reconstituted to ensure fairness and transparency...The committee shall deal with all grievances of students in respect of downloading of question papers, uploading of answer sheets, technical glitches, delays in uploading and any other issues faced by students during the conduct of the OBE examinations,” the judge said in a 45-page order.It said the committee will take a decision on the grievances within five days of receipt of emails and notify students.It asked the university to declare the results at the earliest and said said students faced “extreme” challenges in the last six months, including they themselves or their family members suffering from Covid.The judge said even though students faced technical glitches using DU’s portal and during the mock tests, “DU has taken the stand that it is fully prepared to conduct the examinations”.The remaining aspects of protection of data and other issues would be heard on September 22.Students disappointed Many students and teachers were disappointed. Amal K Simon, a final-year BSc (physics hons) student of Ramjas College, said, “Many students like me are stuck in different parts of Kerala, which is experiencing severe rain and landslides. I live in Palakkad and there is no electricity in my area since the last two days. I do not know how I will attend the exams from Monday.”Rajib Ray, president of DU Teachers Association, said, “Reports that the high court has given permission to DU to conduct OBE is disappointing. Any form of online blended exam is discriminatory, unjust and lacks sanctity. Students without means and deprived of online teaching and study materials will be penalised.”Balaram Pani, dean of colleges in DU, said the university expects over 95% attendance in the exams. “The university is prepared. The administration has already announced that those who are not able to attend the exams remotely will get another chance to appear in pen and paper mode,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-hc-gives-go-ahead-for-du-online-exams-extra-time-to-upload-answer-sheets/story-4sy3utTx2oNKoMsYoQxbtM.html
08-08-2020||Education||CBSE allows students who took basic math to pursue subject in classes 11-12||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has decided to allow students, who had opted for basic mathematics in the class 10 examination this year, to pursue the subject in senior secondary classes in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The relaxation, the CBSE stressed, is only for the current academic year.The CBSE had for the first time introduced the option of basic and standard mathematics in the class 10 exams this year. Basic maths was for those who do not want to pursue the subject further and the standard math was for those who want to study mathematics as a subject in classes 11 and 12. Students who had qualified basic mathematics were given an option of appear for the standard math paper during compartment exams, in case they wanted to pursue the subject further.In a notification issued on Friday, CBSE controller of examination Sanyam Bhardwaj said, “Because of spread of Covid-19 and thus the delay in the conduct of the compartment examination 2020, it has been decided that students who have appeared for mathematics (basic) in class 10 exams and are desirous of pursuing mathematics in class 11, can opt for it, but only for the session of 2020-21.”“Before permitting mathematics in class 11 to such students, the head of the institution should be satisfied that the student has the aptitude and ability to pursue mathematics. This exemption is being given as a one-time measure to facilitate the present batch of students,” Bhardwaj added.Principals said the decision will be a huge relief to students who were waiting to take the math standard test during the compartment exams. Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu School in Rohini, said, “Keeping the present situation in mind, the CBSE has taken a student friendly decision.”Heads of Delhi government schools, where 73% of students had opted for basic mathematics this year, expressed reservations over the move. AK Jha, the head of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini, said, “Many students who had opted for basic mathematics are those who did not want to pursue the subject in higher classes. Now that there is an option, many parents may compel schools to allow their children to pursue the subject. This will be very challenging for principals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-cbse-allows-students-who-took-basic-math-to-pursue-subject-in-classes-11-12/story-YmFKwLFlWEyQ3zCjIKYw0K.html
08-08-2020||Delhi||Man held for attack on minor girl had murdered woman in 2006 for resisting robbery bid: Cops||The 33-year-old man who was arrested on Thursday for the alleged sexual assault and attempted murder of a 12-year-old girl in Paschim Vihar area had murdered a woman with the help of an accomplice for resisting a robbery bid at her home in Sultanpuri area in 2006, police said Friday. The girl continues remains critical at the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) and has been put on ventilator support . “Due to complications resulting from a head injury, she was shifted to the neurosurgery department. She continues to be critical and is on ventilator support,” said a doctor from the hospital, on condition of anonymity. She had undergone a surgery on the first day of admission. On Thursday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had visited the girl at AIIMS and announced ₹10 lakh for her family. On Friday, he tweeted, “I spoke to the doctors and parents of the 12-year-old girl, who was sexually assaulted, on phone. I had visited her in the hospital yesterday. She is still fighting for her life. Doctors are trying their best. Pls pray for her. In the meanwhile, police has arrested one person (sic).” Police officers investigating the case said that in 2006, a woman in her twenties was sleeping alone on the terrace of her house when Krishan alias Kakka and his associate (name not known) climbed to the terrace and tried to remove the gold earrings that she was wearing. “When she woke up and raised the alarm, the duo panicked and attacked her with bricks lying nearby. Hearing the woman’s screams, her family members reached the terrace and caught Krishan while his associate managed to flee,” said joint commissioner of police (western range) Shalini Singh .“Krishan was arrested, convicted and sentenced to life in prison. He told us that he was released from jail in 2015 on account of “good behaviour and conduct”. We are verifying his claims,” Singh said, adding that there was no mentioning of sexual assault on the woman in that case. Police said apart from verifying the facts in the 2006 case, they are also collecting information about the other suspect in that crime. “We are trying to get in touch with the investigating officer of the 2006 case and are going through the case file,” said an officer, who did not want to be named. A resident of outer Delhi’s Mangolpuri, Krishan is unmarried and lives with his mother. Apart from the 2006 murder case, Krishan is also involved in three other crimes ( excluding the present case of alleged sexual assault and murder attempt on the minor girl). Of the three, one is of a burglary that he had committed before 2006. Krishan, the officer said, committed two crimes in 2016, after being released from jail. In one, he had allegedly attacked and injured his brother during a family dispute. “Krishan was arrested in that case. He told us that his brother did not pursue the case further and turned hostile in the court, as they had resolved their dispute. We are verifying his claims,” the officer said. The second pertains to a burglary in outer Delhi, the details of which the police are gathering..During the interrogation in the present case, Krishan told the police that he was wandering in the girl’s neighbourhood with intent to commit a burglary. He entered the single room on the second floor, where the girl lives with her parents and sister, after seeing the rooms on the ground and first floors locked. “Krishan found the girl’s door ajar, went inside and was trying to lift a suitcase when she raised the alarm. He panicked and hit her on the head with a sewing machine in the room, causing her grievous head injuries. But even then, the girl did not give up the fight. She pushed him to the floor, sat on his chest and scuffled with him. This enraged Krishan. He picked up a pair of scissors lying nearby and stabbed her multiple times all over her body before fleeing the building,” the officer said, quoting Krishan disclosures. Joint CP Singh said Krishan’s version of events needs to be verified and for that the injured girl’s statement is crucial. “We will go with the girl’s version only. She is still critical and unfit to give a statement,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-held-for-attack-on-minor-girl-had-murdered-woman-in-2006-for-resisting-robbery-bid-cops/story-KpCSsCiACLyydBeXPGZzGI.html
08-08-2020||Delhi||Big push for electric vehicles to boost demand, cut air pollution||The Delhi government on Friday notified the Delhi Electric Vehicle (EV) Policy, 2020 -- with an aim to reduce air pollution and to kick-start the economy by spurring demand -- that offers subsidies,and road tax and registration free waivers, for electric vehicles bought in the Capital.The policy, launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday, also talks about increasing road tax for fuel-based vehicles, at least in the luxury segment, and imposing in certain parts of the city a congestion fee that EVs will be exempt from. The details of both the surcharges are still being worked out, transport minster Kailash Gahlot said. Addressing a digital press briefing, Kejriwal said the EV policy has been notified after consultations with consumers and experts from around the world over the past three years. “It is believed worldwide that China has a really good electric vehicle system in place. But, now I am sure that when discussions on electric vehicles will be held across the world after five years, Delhi will be leading the way in this field. I am happy to say that our policy is one of the most progressive policies of all the electric policies across the world,” he said.  The government aims to register at least 500,000 EVs in Delhi in the next five years. Delhi has over 83,000 electric vehicles out of a total of over 11 million vehicles registered in the city. Of the more than 83,000 registered EVs, over 75,500 are e-rickshaws. There are only over 900 private electric cars and over 3,700 e-two-wheelers in Delhi as of now. The Capital experiences a public health emergency every winter due to the rise in air pollution, which has become a recurrent annual crisis. “In the last five years, the people of Delhi have collectively worked together to reduce pollution levels, but we have to reduce it further,” Kejriwal said on Friday. “During the pandemic (lockdown), we saw that PM10 and PM2.5 levels witnessed a drastic reduction. We could see the clear skies and feel the clean breeze. So, this policy will give the Capital a much needed push towards a cleaner and greener Delhi,” he added. There are largely two problems militating against the rise of private EVs in Delhi -- the high cost of purchase, and the lack of sufficient charging infrastructure -- and the policy aims to address both.According to the document, those buying electric vehicles will be exempt from paying road tax and registration fee. At present, road tax ranges from 4% to 10% of the cost of the vehicle, while registration fee could cost up to Rs 3,000 In addition, a subsidy of Rs 5,000 per kWh of the battery capacity up to Rs 30,000 will be given on the purchase of each electric two-wheeler, auto-rickshaw, rickshaw and freight vehicle. For the first 1,000 e-cars or electric four wheelers, a subsidy of Rs 10,000 per kWh will be given, capped at Rs 150,000 per vehicle.To push people to shift to EVs, the policy also has a “scrapping incentive” for those who make the switch.“Many people own polluting petrol and diesel vehicles. Since EVs are still relatively costlier in the market, under this policy, now an old fuel-based vehicle can be exchanged while purchasing a new e-vehicle so that it reduces the cost of the EV further. This scrapping incentive is being given for the first time in the entire country,” Kejriwal said. Talking about providing adequate charging infrastructure to support the demand for EVs that the policy aims to create, Kejriwal said the government aims to set up at least 200 new EV charging stations across Delhi in 12 months. At present there are less than 25 operational authorised EV charging stations across Delhi. Kejriwal said the policy -- it will be valid for a period of three years, after which it will be revised -- will also help in creating jobs “at a huge level” in the fields of driving, servicing, financing, charging and so on.Gahlot said that the policy lays the maximum emphasis on two-wheelers, public transport and shared vehicles, and goods-carriers instead of private four wheelers.“To purchase an electric commercial vehicle, the government will also offer loans to the people on low-interest rates. There are two types of electric vehicles, one which runs on fixed charging and the second, in which there is a need for battery swapping. The incentives will be available on all kinds of electric vehicles. All Delhi government vehicles will be EVs in the next 12 months. All two-wheelers engaged in last-mile deliveries such as food delivery, e-commerce, logistics etc. will be expected to shift 50% of their fleet to electric by March 31, 2023, and 100% of their fleet by March 31, 2025,” the transport minister said. Kejriwal stressed that the grants offered by the Delhi government will be in addition to the subsidies offered by the Union government under its FAME India Phase 2 scheme, which offers similar incentives, especially on the purchase of electric two-wheelers and electric heavy passenger and goods vehicles, and has a total budget allocation of ₹10,000 crore nationally. The government will set up a State EV fund, which will encompass all the expenditure of the EV Policy. A State Electric Vehicle Board will be constituted for effective implementation of the EV policy and managing the EV fund, and the chairman of the board will be the transport minister. Besides, a dedicated EV cell will also be constituted. Experts and stakeholders from the industry welcomed the move. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said it is commendable that despite the economic slowdown this policy has set a target to achieve 25% electrification of new fleet by 2024. “This zero emissions mandate is needed to cut air pollution and toxic exposure. But firm milestones are needed for time bound implementation. This move is an important message for green recovery post pandemic,” she said adding that at present only 0.2% of Delhi’s registered vehicles are EVs. Naveen Munjal, managing director, Hero Electric Vehicles Private Limited, said the policy is “a great move towards a pollution-free nation”.Mahesh Babu, CEO, Mahindra Electric thanked the Delhi government and Kejriwal for announcing “a long term futuristic” EV policy. “Mahindra will work jointly to transform the mobility sector to a sustainable one in Delhi,” he said. RMI India, an independent think-tank that works with stakeholders to support India’s clean energy transition and which also worked with the Delhi government in this policy called the document a “game changer” in India’s EV story.“Anchored to the objective of improving Delhi’s air quality, it is by far the most comprehensive sub-national policy that focuses on making EVs affordable to consumers and gives confidence to the industry. The system-level approach to vehicle electrification and emphasis on enabling an EV ecosystem will ensure that supportive conditions are in place to enable the much needed transition to zero emission mobility in Delhi,” said Akshima Ghate, director, RMI India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/big-push-for-electric-vehicles-to-boost-demand-cut-air-pollution/story-AEmIqU6B5zcYZhpP1goVnN.html
08-08-2020||Delhi||Consider environmental impact before approving Nauroji Nagar plan, NDMC urged||Prominent environmentalists have written to the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) to assess the green impact before sanctioning the building plan for Nauroji Nagar commercial complex.The project is part of the Union government’s ambitious project to redevelop seven government residential neighbourhoods in south Delhi. As per the plan, a state-of-the-art commercial complex, spread over 25 acres, will come up in Nauroji Nagar. It will have 10-storeyed towers with parking space for 8,000 vehicles. The government plans to develop office space, exhibition halls, banquet halls and food plazas at the proposed complex.The commercial hub will be linked to the nearby residential government colonies, which are being redeveloped. The project is being executed by NBCC India.With the Delhi high court vacating the stay on the construction in Nauroji Nagar, NBCC India is in the process of submitting all necessary approvals to the NDMC to get approval.While the plan is yet to be sanctioned, experts point out that the Nauroji Nagar project can’t be considered a standalone project while giving approval. The letter has been written by environmentalists and civil society members Kanchi Kohli, Bhavreen Kandhari, Manju Menon and Meenakshi Nath.In the letter to NDMC chairman Dharmendra, they said, “The various issues that need to be looked into are water availability, use of public streets for traffic, generation and disposal of solid waste, increase in air pollution due to construction activity, loss of over 14,000 trees and increase in health hazards and many other related matters that are important to the well-being of Delhi-NCR…. Nauroji Nagar cannot be considered a standalone construction project in any approval process.”When contacted, a senior NDMC official said, “There were a few deficiencies in the plan that they (NBCC) had submitted. We have asked them to rectify it.” NBCC India has been asked to take submit approvals from various government bodies such as the Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC) on traffic related matters; the Delhi Urban Art Commission on aesthetic matters, and the requisite approvals from the fire and forest departments.“Once they submit all these permissions, the project will be put before the council meeting for approval. So far, they have not submitted any of these approvals,” the official said. According to NBCC India, all statutory approvals from fire department, the pollution control board and the forest department, among other, for the Nauroji Nagar redevelopment project have been obtained. “Regarding the UTTIPEC clearance, a comprehensive proposal covering all development colonies in the vicinity, including AIIMS, has been prepared and cleared by the core committee and working committee of the UTTIPEC and is being put before the governing body of UTTIPEC,” a senior NBCC India official, on condition of anonymity, said.Environmentalist Kandhari said the Nauroji Nagar project is part of seven general pool residential accommodation (GPRA) projects proposed and the NDMC should assess the impact of all these redevelopment colonies together before granting a final approval. “It is necessary to ascertain the total impact of these projects to prevent the burden of such impact being passed on to the people of Delhi,” she said.Stressing on the need for a detailed traffic assessment, she said these colonies are in areas that are already congested. “The projects are located near two major hospitals (AIIMS and Safdarjung). The construction of commercial infrastructure and increase in traffic can disrupt access to these hospitals,” she said.While vacating the stay, the high court bench had said, “We see no violation of the master plan and are of the view that the environmental clearances have been correctly given for the Nauroji Nagar project. Since NDMC is still seized of the matter, we may only observe that while granting the final sanction, the concerns of the petitioner be taken into account.”Kohli said the environmental aspects of Nauroji Nagar and the other six GPRA colonies need to be addressed on merit. “The court did not assess or adjudicate on issues such as water, traffic, biodiversity, ecology or air pollution. On the contrary, the judgment has recorded that all environmental concerns are significant and the NDMC should consider it while approving the project.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/consider-environmental-impact-before-approving-nauroji-nagar-plan-ndmc-urged/story-Snveo7cCrif8USpDaoJetJ.html
08-08-2020||Delhi||Applicants shortlisted for 1 million jobs on Delhi govt’s job portal||For around 1 million jobs that were posted on the Delhi government’s job portal launched on July 27, employers have either employed or shortlisted applicants, even as around 900,000 more posts on the portal have been put up, said Delhi’s labour and employment minister Gopal Rai on Friday.Rai said, “We had set up a task force to analyse the job details posted on the portal. Around 350,000 entries were cancelled because of duplication or lack of details. Around 1,000,000 entries were closed, which means employers have either hired or shortlisted applicants for these posts.”“However, around 900,000 posts in the job portal are still open at this juncture as against 864,000 candidates who have updated their resumes but are still to get work. We urge more people to register in the portal,” said Rai.The job portal was launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on July 27, on the recommendation of a committee set up by the Delhi government to advise them on economic revival in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The portal was launched primarily to help people who lost their job during the nationwide lockdown that was imposed on March 25 to arrest the spread of Covid-19. However, anyone can register and create profiles.As many as 6,271 companies have so far posted job vacancies on the portal, apart from thousands of entrepreneurs—in sectors that include banking, finance, e-commerce, insurance, hospitality services, security and few cooperatives based in other states, said Rai.He further said that the highest job availability at this point is in sales, data entry, customer support, teaching, tele-caller, warehouse management, lighting, information technology, hardware networking and doorstep delivery of products.“We are aware of the fact that many construction workers will not have access to the Internet. I request the youth of Delhi to help such persons. There are various private websites for jobs but this website is completely free. I want to inform every citizen that nobody will need to pay a single penny through this platform,” said Rai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/applicants-shortlisted-for-1-million-jobs-on-govt-portal/story-I4AvZyEEvxhiZenyaoXjOJ.html
08-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: Police circular does not cause prejudice, says Delhi high court||The Delhi High Court on Friday said that a July 8 circular issued by a Delhi police crime branch chief related to the investigation into the February riots did not cause prejudice to any community. The court, while refusing to quash the order, also said that investigating officers need not follow any such circular because there are enough laws in place for investigating purposes. On July 27, two riot victims had filed a plea citing a news report in an English daily about the circular. The two, in their plea, stated that special commissioner of police Praveer Ranjan had directed his team to be careful while arresting Hindu persons for the north-east Delhi riots. The plea seeking the court’s intervention to quash the order was filed by the victims, through advocate Mahmood Pracha.When the contents of the circular were widely circulated on social media last month, the police had tweeted that the order clearly mentioned that any arrest, irrespective of any class, community or religious group, must be made based on evidence, and not give an impression of being arbitrary. The police wrote that the order mentioned intelligence reports regarding the arrest of Hindu youths, which had led to some resentment, as a backdrop to sensitise officers about the case.During the hearing on Friday, justice Suresh Kait said, “I have noticed, while going through the petition, that the electronic and print media have reported news that is against the letter and spirit of the order issued by respondent no. 4 (Ranjan)... I suggest to the media, the fourth pillar of democracy, that news should be reported after verifying facts so that there is no hate between communities in this country.”The police also produced similar communications (orders and circulars) given to investigating officers in the past about such intelligence inputs .The judge reminded investigating officers that they need not be influenced by an order or instruction by their superiors but clarified that no prejudice was caused to the people of any community by this circular.Advocate Pracha had said in the plea, “According to the news report, the special commissioner had sent out a circular that there was a degree of resentment in the Hindu community against the arrest of certain Hindu persons, and directed investigating officers to be careful in the future when making arrests. The arrests of persons should be made only after discussing evidence with special public prosecutors who have been appointed to represent the police in these cases.” On Friday, agreeing with the submissions of officer Ranjan, who was present during the last date of hearing, the judge said that the persons accused in the case have already been charged and that the July 8 order issued by the senior police officer would not cause prejudice.“This period was unfortunate for everyone in Delhi. So I think we should not continue it (petition) further,” the judge remarked during the hearing.It said the observation made by the court would not cause prejudice to Ranjan or any other officer in their service careers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-police-circular-does-not-cause-prejudice-says-high-court/story-gk4RwaclSptyv6j1Qff8PJ.html
08-08-2020||Gurugram||Property IDs in next 15 days across Haryana, says govt||The Haryana government on Friday said that property IDs would be issued in areas under nine municipal corporations and 15 municipal committees across the state within the next 15 days. A special mechanism for registration of properties in controlled areas is also being developed under which no-objection certificates (NOCs) would have to be issued by the departments concerned within 14 days. The area for registration of plots in controlled area would be increased to one acre from current two kanals, it said.Addressing mediapersons in Chandigarh on Friday, deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said that the objective of all these steps was to streamline the mechanism of registering property deeds and to reduce human intervention to the minimum. “A review meeting in this regard was held on Thursday in which it was decided that for registration of plots in controlled areas the area would be increased from two kanals at present to one acre. This is being done to ensure registration of plots for unauthorized development of colonies is stopped,” said Chautala. In controlled areas, the deputy CM said, the department of town and country planning has been asked to create a mechanism so that NOCs can be issued in a time bound manner or else a process would be created for deemed approval as it happens for other departments. Chautala also said that they have decided to create a portal that will allow people to pay their pending property tax and development tax online so that they can get the NOC automatically. “Within next one month, all the related departments will be linked online so that registries can be carried out without any hassle,” he said. The revenue department, he said, will be making the process of registration deeds easy and simple to carryout. He also said that divisional commissioners of Gurugram, Bahadurgarh, Sonipat, Ambala and Faridabad have been asked to enquire into irregularities pertaining to registeries and send a report within 14 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/property-ids-in-next-15-days-across-haryana-says-govt/story-4mDfxrbBmg3bTvBJkyfQUI.html
08-08-2020||Delhi||Decomposed body of man found wrapped in gunny bag near Tughlaqabad Fort||The decomposed body of an unidentified man, aged around 30 years, was found wrapped in a gunny bag and dumped in a forested area near the Tughlaqabad Fort in south Delhi late Thursday morning, the police said. The police said four words – Heena (or Reena) Shambhu, Durga, and Devi -- were tattooed in English on the left forearm of the man. Officers believe that the names could be his and/or those of his loved ones. A silver metallic ring with black stone was found on the right hand while a copper metallic ring was there on the left hand. Police suspect that the man may have been killed elsewhere and his body dumped in the forested area to mislead investigators. Deputy commissioner of police (south-east) RP Meena said around 11am Thursday, the Govindpuri police received a call regarding the body lying in the forested area. A team went there and found that the body had decomposed beyond identification. “We have registered a case of murder and have formed teams to establish the man’s identity, nab his killers and ascertain the motive behind the crime. The details about the man’s physical appearance, clothes he was wearing, and the tattoos along the pictures of the body have been uploaded on the Zonal Integrated Police Network (ZIPNet),” the DCP said. Meena said the investigating teams are preparing a list of men, in the age group of 20 to 40 years, who had been reported missing in Delhi-NCR in the past seven to 10 days. “Apart from scanning ZIPNet, our teams would also be visiting police stations in Faridabad, Noida, Gurugram, and Ghaziabad for investigation purposes,” he said. The police said some tyre marks were found near the spot where the body was dumped. The spot is located nearly 20 metres away from the main road. The footage from CCTV cameras on the route leading to the spot is also being scanned for clues, the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/decomposed-body-of-man-found-wrapped-in-gunny-bag-near-tughlaqabad-fort/story-aB4RE4s5luIrY76g6INjnJ.html

Also, when the facility is being constructed on open ground they should consider the natural calamity possibility as it is monsoon.”Pawar said, “There should be a proper audit of electric supply, water supply, approach roads and guidelines given by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) should be strictly followed.”“The authorities should ensure doctors and nurses are provided with good facilities, he added.Pawar said, “State government will provide good health facilities to the residents during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. These jumbo facilities will help deal with the bed shortage problem.”Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar, district collector Naval Kishor Ram, Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) metropolitan commissioner Suhas Diwase were present with Pawar for the site visit.Meanwhile, Pune district guardian minister Ajit with the help of Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana launched ‘Mission Pune zero’.

These vans will visit places with maximum population and conduct tests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-jumbo-centres-ajit-pawar-orders-contractors-administration-to-ensure-icmr-guidelines-strictly-followed/story-cCGiXJKgsxRxRQvhQPvA5K.html
08-08-2020||Delhi||Only 50% students pay annual fees at Delhi’s tech varsity by deadline||Of over 7,000 students at the Delhi Technological University, around 50% have paid the annual fee for the upcoming session, university officials said. This varsity had given them less than a week’s time to pay the nearly Rs 2 lakh fee, students said, with August 5 being the last date for fee submission. After that, the varsity had warned of a late fee ranging from Rs 2,000-10,000 and after August 27, their names may be struck off the rolls.A handful of students also protested outside the university on Friday demanding that they be allowed to pay the fee in instalments as many families were in financial distress. BTech students have to pay their annual fee of Rs 1, 90,000 by August 5 while BBA and BA students have to pay Rs 90,000. Anoop Lather, the university’s public relations officer, “As per data received by our accounts and computer department, around 50% of students have already paid their fee by Thursday. Keeping the Covid-19 situation in mind, we have granted fee concessions to around 500 students like we did last year. Apart from that, we have allowed students to submit the loan application details for late fee exception if their loan hasn’t been processed yet.” Lather, however, said there has been no extension of the last date so far.In a July 24 directive that was uploaded on the university’s website on July 28, the university had mentioned that students who pay the fee after the August 5 deadline, between August 6 and 13, will have to pay a fine of Rs 2,000. Those who pay between August 13 and 20 will have to pay a fine of Rs 5,000; and those who submit the fee between August 20 and 27 will have to pay a fine of Rs 10,000. Students who fail to pay by then may have their names struck off university rolls.Those who fail to pay their fee by August 27, may have their names struck off the rolls.While the university said it has allowed some concessions, students believe that these may not benefit all. Sumit, 18, said his father, who works as a plumber, had found no work during the Covid-19 lockdown for four months.“We have been trying to avail of bank loans to pay the fee but that too wasn’t possible as we live in a rented accommodation. We have asked our relatives for some help but they don’t have the means to help us right now,” said the Gokalpuri resident, who is a second-year engineering student. He had applied for a scholarship but the money hasn’t come through, Sumit said.Manish Kumar, 18, a second-year engineering student from Bihar was already reeling under the stress of his father losing all crops to floods in Saharsa district when the fee notification came on July 28.“Even though I have a scholarship and have to pay a lesser amount than the others, I have written to the university saying that I won’t be able to pay the fee before September,” Kumar said. The first-generation learner lives with his relatives in Delhi and is looking to give tuitions to earn some money, but the Covid-19 health crisis has made it difficult. “Students were barely given a week to arrange such a huge sum of money. Many of my classmates have not been able to arrange the money,” he said.Vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh said, “Students in distress or from marginalised backgrounds should write to the registrar or dean and we will find a way to resolve issues on a case-to-case basis.”Students are also worried about how the fee issue would impact their stay in college. Aparnendu Ram Tripathi, president of ABVP-DTU unit, said, “There has been indirect communication that those wanting to sit for college placement must pay their fee. Students unable to do so have been asked to write to the vice chancellor. This has caused additional stress to students during a pandemic.” Lather responded to this saying, “This isn’t a new development. All dues must be cleared before events like examinations or placements. For needy students, there are committees in place to check their applications over fee concession and take decisions accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/only-50-students-pay-annual-fees-at-delhi-s-tech-varsity-by-deadline/story-gcwXCBsjbyXxV43Y9U7nWO.html

Anup Sharma, 48, said he was on a morning walk around 7am on when a man snatched his gold chain and fled with his accomplice waiting on a black motorcycle at a distance. Anup sustained bruises on his neck in the incident. Investigation revealed that the snatchers were following Anup and on finding an opportunity, snatched his chain. On his complaint, a case under Sections 379A (snatching) and 356 (assault or criminal force in attempt to commit theft of property carried by a person) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Sector 39 police station.In similar modus operandi, two men on a black motorcycle snatched a woman’s gold chain while she was taking a walk in Phase 3B1, Mohali, on Wednesday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/snatchers-take-away-man-s-gold-chain-in-sector-37/story-mzbdgNZCbHFTF9F8lWZg1M.html
08-08-2020||World||Brazil near 100,000 deaths from Covid-19||Brazil was leaping toward a grim milestone — 100,000 deaths from Covid-19 — on Saturday, and five months after the first reported case, the country had not shown signs of crushing the disease.Brazil, a nation of 210 million people, has been reporting an average of more than 1,000 daily deaths from the pandemic since late May.The Health Ministry on Friday said there had been a total of 2,962,442 confirmed infections with the new coronavirus and 99,572 deaths — tolls second only to the United States. And as in many nations, experts believe that both numbers are severe undercounts due to insufficient testing.In a tribute to Covid-19 victims, the non-governmental group Rio de Paz placed crosses and a thousand red balloons on the sand on the famed Copacabana beach Saturday.“It’s very sad. Those 100,000 represent various families, friends, parents, children”, said Marcio Silva, 55, who lost his children in the pandemic and joined the tribute.One poster read: “100 thousand: Why are we the second country in number of deaths?” At the end of the tribute, members of the NGO released the balloons, which sailed into the sky.President Jair Bolsonaro — who himself reported being infected — has been a consistent skeptic about the impact of the disease and an advocate of lifting restrictions on the economy that had been imposed by state governors trying to combat it. He has frequently mingled in crowds, sometimes without a mask.“I regret all the deaths, it’s already reaching the number 100,000, but we are going to find a way out of that”, Bolsonaro said in a Thursday night Facebook transmission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-near-100-000-deaths-from-covid-19/story-CZyf5u9HYlBrIaIM2IvSVO.html
08-08-2020||World||Protests in Beirut amid public fury over massive blast||Police fired tear gas and clashed with demonstrators in Lebanon’s capital on Saturday at the start of a planned protest over this week’s massive explosion that devastated large parts of Beirut and killed more than 150 people.Thousands of people poured into Beirut’s main square, where they set up symbolic nooses to hang politicians whose corruption and negligence they blame for Tuesday’s explosion at the Port of Beirut.The huge blast was caused by thousands of tons of ammonium nitrate improperly stored at the port for more than six years, apparently set off by a fire. It was the biggest in Lebanon’s history and caused an estimated $10-15 billion worth of damage, according to Beirut’s governor. It also left hundreds of thousands of people homeless.The protest Saturday was the first significant demonstration since the explosion and organizers planned to hold a symbolic funeral for the dead. As the protest got underway however, small groups of young men began throwing stones at security forces. Near parliament, riot police fired tear gas at protesters who hurled stones and tried to jump over barriers that close the road leading to the legislature. The protesters later set on fire a truck that was fortifying barriers on a road leading to parliament.The gathering at Martyrs Square and outside the parliament building and government headquarters came amid popular anger against Lebanon’s political leadership. The country’s ruling class, made up mostly of former civil war-era leaders, is blamed for widespread corruption, incompetence and mismanagement that contributed to Tuesday’s explosion.The army issued a statement reminding the protesters to act peacefully and abstain from closing roads or attacking public or private property. Police also issued a statement after the protests began urging people to act “in a civilized way far away from violence.”The protest came as senior officials from the Middle East and Europe arrived in Lebanon in a show of solidarity with the tiny country that is still in shock suffered after Tuesday’s blast.Lebanon is mired in its worst economic and financial crisis in decades making it difficult for many people who had their properties damaged to fix them.In a show of anger, the president of the Christian opposition Kataeb party said its three legislators have decided to resign from Parliament over this week’s “disaster.” Sami Gemayel called on every “honorable” member of parliament to resign and work for the “birth of a new Lebanon.”A senior Kataeb party official was killed in the blast, which claimed at least 154 lives, wounded more than 5,000 people and laid waste to the country’s largest port and nearby areas.Also killed were 43 Syrians, the country’s embassy in Beirut said. Lebanon is home to some 1 million Syrian refugees.The Dutch foreign ministry said Saturday that Hedwig Waltmans-Molier, the wife of the Netherlands’ ambassador to Lebanon, had also died of injuries sustained in Tuesday’s blast.Documents that surfaced after the blast showed that for years officials had been repeatedly warned that the presence of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate at the port posed a grave danger, but no one acted to remove it. Officials have been blaming one another since the explosion and 19 people have been detained including the port’s chief, head of Lebanon’s customs department and his predecessor.“We will support Lebanon through all available means,” Ahmed Aboul Gheit, the secretary-general of the 22-member Arab League told reporters after meeting President Michel Aoun on Saturday morning. Aboul Gheit said he would take part in a donors conference for Lebanon in France on Sunday and convey Lebanon’s demands to the international community.Later on Saturday the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, arrived in Beirut for a brief visit. Turkey’s vice president and the country’s foreign minister arrived Saturday morning and met Aoun, saying that Ankara was ready to help rebuild Beirut’s port and evacuate some of the wounded from Lebanon to Turkey for treatment.At the site of the blast in Beirut’s port, workers were still searching for dozens of people who have been missing since Tuesday. Bulldozers were also seen removing debris near the giant grain silos that are still partly standing.International aid has been flowing to Lebanon for days and several field hospitals have been set up around Beirut to help treat the wounded.President Donald Trump said Friday that he had spoken by telephone with Aoun and French President Emmanuel Macron, who paid a brief visit to Lebanon on Thursday. Trump did not mention the investigation, but noted that medical supplies, food and water were being sent from the United States, along with emergency responders, technicians, doctors and nurses.The ammonium nitrate, a chemical used in fertilizers and explosives, originated from a cargo ship called MV Rhosus that had been traveling from the country of Georgia to Mozambique in 2013. It made an unscheduled detour to Beirut as the Russian shipowner was struggling with debts and hoped to earn some extra cash in Lebanon. Unable to pay port fees and reportedly leaking, the ship was impounded.In 2014, the material was moved from the ship and placed in a warehouse at the port where it stayed until the explosion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-in-beirut-amid-public-fury-over-massive-blast/story-GD2nlu6gIJPlJqqVo1bUfI.html

08-08-2020||World||Schools face big coronavirus test as students return to classroom||Reopening schools is easy. Keeping them open will be the hard part.As educators prepare to welcome students back to class for the first time in months, schools’ ability to quickly identify and contain coronavirus outbreaks before they get out of hand will be put to the test in thousands of districts around the country.Newly reopened schools in Mississippi, Indiana and Georgia have already reported infections just days into the academic year, triggering virus protocols that include swiftly isolating infected students, tracing their contacts and quarantining people they exposed.“It doesn’t matter if you open schools in July, like we did, or if you open in August, September or October. All schools are going to have to deal with the issue of positive Covid-19 test results,” said Lee Childress, superintendent of Corinth School District in Mississippi, where more than 100 students are quarantined at home after being exposed to a handful of infected classmates.Schools are trying to mitigate the risk of transmission by spreading desks apart, serving meals in the classroom and keeping groups of students together throughout the day. Many schools — but not all — will require students and staff to wear masks, which health experts say is critical to cutting down on spread.Administrators say it might be difficult to control the mixing and mingling that happens at every school. Asymptomatic carriers could silently spread the virus to many others. A student might not remember every contact, or be reluctant to tell the truth because that would mean forcing friends into quarantine.Contact tracing might prove difficult “when you have that many students and they have multiple contacts inside of a building,” said Dallas schools chief Michael Hinojosa.Schools are reopening as new infections run at about 55,000 a day in the U.S. While that’s down from a peak of well over 70,000 in the second half of July, cases are rising in about half of the states, and deaths are climbing in many of them.In Indiana, where case numbers and the positivity rate have been rising, a student showed up to class outside Indianapolis before getting the results of a virus test. Greenfield-Central Junior High soon learned he was positive.It was the first day of school.“We felt like we were at a good place to start school and then, through no fault of our own, a kid comes to school who shouldn’t have been there,” Superintendent Harold Olin said, acknowledging “uncomfortable” conversations with parents whose children then had to be quarantined.Because it was the school system’s first case, Olin himself grabbed a tape measure and headed to the infected student’s classroom to figure out who was seated nearby so they could be notified of their potential exposure.Jason Martin’s son, Houston, who attends seventh grade at Greenfield-Central, was among those forced to learn remotely for 14 days.“Clearly, he’s disappointed,” Martin said. But the school “responded pretty well from a bonehead parent making a decision to send their kid to school knowing they have a pending COVID test result.”The question of whether an infected student or staffer should trigger an automatic shutdown has divided school officials.New York City’s public school system, the largest in the U.S., says it will automatically shutter classrooms or buildings for 14 days at a time, depending on the severity and circumstances of an outbreak. In hard-hit Texas, school systems in Houston and Dallas say they will close a building for up to five days if a student or staffer tests positive, to allow for cleaning and to give contact tracers time to do their work.It’s too risky to try to keep a school open while officials figure out who might have been exposed, Hinojosa said.“Until there’s a vaccine, just be prepared to have these rolling shutdowns,” he said.Others administrators say they will try to keep schools open during an outbreak, counting on quick action to keep a lid on it.In Pennsylvania, the Bethlehem Area School District intends to keep classrooms open if there’s a confirmed case. “One closure decision can lead to a potentially crippling and precedent-setting domino effect of closures throughout the school district,” the district says on its website.Dr. Ibukun Akinboyo, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Duke University, said even the best plans for reopening and responding to sick students and staff are going to run into trouble if there’s a high level of community spread.“Whatever is happening in the community will likely play out in the schools as well,” she said.In Mississippi, where more than 20% of virus tests have been coming back positive, at least eight students and one staff member in Corinth have tested positive since school resumed last week. District officials used classroom seating charts to determine who needed to be quarantined.The tally through Friday: 122 people.Nurses, administrators and teachers have worked together to identify the infected students’ close contacts — anyone who was within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes. But at some point, contact tracing ceases to be practical, and a school might have to close, Childress said.“I think if you have a large number, the process could quickly become unmanageable, and that would be something that we would know when we see it,” he said.Joel Barnes and his wife are rethinking their decision to send their four kids back to Corinth schools after their son was exposed at the high school. They are awaiting the results of his virus test.“We expected there to be some cases of COVID, but we’re honestly surprised that it happened so quickly and has spread to so many so rapidly,” said Barnes, who has lung and nerve damage from a car accident and worries about contracting the virus. “Now it’s taken off.”The couple have pulled two of their children from school in favor of remote lessons.“In hindsight, we wish we’d gone virtual from the start,” he said.Joseph Allen, who directs a program at the Harvard University School of Public Health focused on healthy buildings, said masking, contact tracing and quarantining are all important — but so is proper ventilation and air filtration, which Allen said too many districts are ignoring.Small, inexpensive steps like opening windows, equipping classrooms with box fans and portable air purifiers, and holding classes outside can make a big difference in keeping the virus at bay, even if an infected student or teacher shows up, Allen said.“We need to get a bit more creative with schools,” he said. “If we don’t do those upfront things, we’re going to have cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/schools-face-big-coronavirus-test-as-students-return-to-classroom/story-EaSNmpgkm0f5kzVIeZk8rI.html

The risk to safety was low and test results from Randox kits were not affected, it said.Up to 741,000 unused Randox kits are estimated to be in the system, either at warehouses, at care homes or at private homes. The ministry gave instructions on how to return them.Randox said the recall was a “regulatory measure” that applied only to sample collection kits within the NHS programme. Private customers or kits were not affected, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-orders-recall-of-741-000-coronavirus-testing-kits-over-safety-concerns/story-f1gSL62SXtRxi7gYzF8NqL.html
08-08-2020||World||US President Trump among world leaders to take part in Lebanon Aid Conference||Global leaders including US President Donald Trump will participate in an international aid conference on Sunday to support Lebanon, as the country, crippled by corruption, a banking crisis and growing popular defiance against the authorities, is seeking massive relief after blasts in Beirut.The video-conference will be co-hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron and the United Nations. Macron said he would make sure any aid goes directly to the Lebanese people and not into “corrupt hands,” during a visit to Beirut on Thursday.Several allies of Lebanon have offered support since Tuesday’s explosions in the port of Beirut that left over 150 people dead, many missing, more than 5,000 injured and close to 300,000 people homeless as the blast partially destroyed the city. Authorities said the biggest explosions in Beirut’s history caused an estimated $10 billion to $15 billion worth of damage.Gulf states, European nations and the US have sent mobile clinics, food and medicine to the country. European Council President Charles Michel was in Beirut on Saturday and promised support.The chief of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, pledged to mobilize regional efforts to provide support. Turkey said it is ready to help rebuild the port, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported, citing Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay during a visit to Lebanon on Saturday.Also read: Wife of Dutch envoy to Lebanon dies after being hurt in Beirut blastThe country, which is almost entirely reliant on imports of fuel, food and material, may use Turkey’s Port of Mersin, on the Mediterranean, until the Port of Beirut is rebuilt and Ankara is ready to also help reconstruct the buildings nearby and send medical assistance and food aid, the agency said on Twitter.Promises of relief come as the leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah rejected rumors that the militant group had stashed weapons at Beirut’s port before this week’s devastating explosions. Officials have blamed the accident on a vast store of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, unloaded from a ship in 2014 and kept at the port despite repeated safety warnings.“We don’t have anything at the port, not weapons, missiles or ammunition or nitrate or anything else at all. Not now, not in the past or the future,” Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech.Lebanon’s president Michel Aoun said on Friday an investigation would examine whether it was caused by a bomb or other external interference. “The cause has not been determined yet. There is a possibility of external interference through a rocket or bomb or other act,” Aoun said.To protest the current government supported by Hezbollah, the Kataeb party -- a Christian group that opposes the ruling majority -- announced the resignation of its members from the parliament on Saturday, Lebanon-based MTV channel said on Twitter. The general secretary of the party, Nizar Najarian, was killed in the explosion. He was chairing a meeting for the party at its headquarters near the site of the blast. Marwan Hamade, from the party of Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, and independent lawmaker Paula Yacoubian also announced their resignations.A Shattered Beirut Leaves Lebanese Asking If They Have a FutureLebanon has arrested 20 people, including port and customs officials, and placed everyone who had an official role at the port since 2014 under house arrest. A team of French explosive experts arrived in Beirut Thursday to help with the investigation that’s being led by the Lebanese army and police intelligence.The explosion came as Lebanon is reeling under its worst financial meltdown in decades and the government’s inability to implement reforms and tackle corruption as demanded by the international community.The administration is in talks with the International Monetary Fund for a $10 billion loan program, but those negotiations had stalled over internal disputes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-leaders-to-hold-lebanon-aid-conference-on-sunday/story-NsSHTHHirCyHdghtRw9WpI.html

Tuesday’s blast caused extensive damage to the Dutch embassy, injuring four other people connected to it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wife-of-dutch-envoy-to-lebanon-dies-after-being-hurt-in-beirut-blast/story-ZS4izpILdsn03e4vbaUjjL.html
08-08-2020||World||‘Can’t afford to rebuild’: Furious Lebanese count their losses from blast, plan demonstration||As Beirut mourns its dead and grapples with the scale of rebuilding after this week’s massive blast, some Lebanese activists planned to demonstrate in the city on Saturday, angered by the government’s response to the disaster.Tuesday’s port explosion, the biggest in Beirut’s history, killed 154 people, injured 5,000 and destroyed a swathe of the city. Some residents, struggling to clean up shattered homes, complain the state they see as corrupt - there had been months of protests against the government’s handling of a deep economic crisis before this week’s disaster - has let them down again. The demonstration was planned for Saturday afternoon.“The people are doing your work, shame,” someone wrote on the dust covering a car window, referring to Lebanese leaders.The prime minister and presidency have said 2,750 tonnes of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, which is used in making fertilisers and bombs, had been stored for six years without safety measures at the port warehouse.President Michel Aoun said on Friday an investigation would also examine whether it was caused by a bomb or other external interference. Aoun said the investigation would also weigh if the blast was due to negligence or an accident. Twenty people had been detained so far, he added.‘WE CAN’T AFFORD TO REBUILD’Some residents wondered how they would ever rebuild their lives.Tearing up, Bilal Hassan used his bare hands to try to remove debris from his home located a few hundred metres from where the port blast hit. He has been sleeping on a dusty couch besides pieces of splintered glass.When his three wounded teenage children ran for their lives they left blood stains on the staircase and walls.“There is really nothing we can do. We can’t afford to rebuild and no one is helping us,” he said, standing beside a large teddy bear that was blown across his home, and a damaged photograph of him and his wife.Bulldozers ploughed through the wreckage of mangled homes and long rows of flattened cars as soldiers stood by. Volunteers with shovels streamed through streets.Danielle Chemaly said her charity organisation, whose headquarters was destroyed, had provided assistance to 70 families who were left homeless by the explosion.“We have given people initial help but we don’t know what we can do for families in the future. It requires major projects,” she said. Officials have said the blast could have caused losses amounting to $15 billion. That is a bill that Lebanon cannot pay after already defaulting on a mountain of debt - exceeding 150% of economic output - and with talks stalled on a lifeline from the International Monetary Fund.AID FROM ABROADFrance and other countries have rushed emergency aid to Lebanon, including doctors, and tons of health equipment and food. The blast destroyed Lebanon’s only major grain silo and U.N. agencies are helping provide emergency food and medical aid. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he would join a conference call with Lebanon’s president and other world leaders on Sunday to discuss aid to the country.For ordinary Lebanese, the scale of destruction is overwhelming.“It felt like a mini atomic bomb,” said George Rohana, sitting beside a supermarket that was demolished. A few onions were left in the debris of the blast that tore a huge hole through the shop into an adjacent apartment.“Now we have a situation where people are stealing metals and other items from the destruction,” said Rohana. “The other day someone walked away with a broken toaster.”  (Reporting by Michael Georgy; Editing by Frances Kerry)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-t-afford-to-rebuild-furious-lebanese-count-their-losses-from-blast-plan-demonstration/story-TZjN5kQFP2hIX9WlbDFSFM.html
08-08-2020||World||Canada to impose ‘dollar-for-dollar’ retaliatory tariffs on US goods||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has asserted his government will implement “dollar-for-dollar” retaliatory measures after US president Donald Trump announced new tariffs on imports of Canadian aluminum.Canada and the United States have had bitter exchanges over tariffs imposed by the latter on steel and aluminum but most issues appeared to have been resolved with the new United States Mexico Canada regional free trade deal to replace the older NAFTA coming into existence this year.However, Trump used the stage of an election rally in Ohio to announce that Washington will impose a 10% tariff on Canadian aluminum to which Trdeau replied in a tweet saying, “In response to the American tariffs announced today, Canada will impose countermeasures that will include dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs.” The Candian prime minister did not specify what shape and which sectors the countermeasures will impact. But his stand was mirrored by that of deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland, who made the same point in a statement released by her office. “”Canadian aluminum does not undermine US national security. Canadian aluminum strengthens US national security and has done so for decades through unparalleled co-operation between our two countries,” she addedThe tariff war between the neighbouring nations comes as a repeat of events of 2018 when Canada had retaliated by imposing $ 16.6 billion worth of tariffs on American products entering the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-impose-dollar-for-dollar-retaliatory-tariffs-on-us-goods/story-dsGnHQphT3hDiDZ8W3erBO.html
08-08-2020||World||Turkmenistan to let WHO conduct independent coronavirus sampling||The World Health Organization has secured permission to conduct independent sampling in officially coronavirus-free Turkmenistan, after expressing “serious concern” over rising pneumonia cases there, a WHO official said. A Saturday state television report showing a teleconference involving Turkmenistan’s leader Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov and WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made no mention of WHO concern over pneumonia cases or Berdymukhamedov’s pledge over sampling. But Hans Kluge, the WHO’s Europe director, said the United Nations health body had “expressed serious concern about (a rise) in #COVID19 negative pneumonia” in Turkmenistan during the Friday call with Berdymukhamedov that he also participated in. The WHO “urged for a @WHO team to sample independently #COVID19 tests in-country & take to @WHO reference labs. President agreed,” Kluge tweeted on Friday, without offering further details. A WHO mission visited the secretive gas-rich Central Asian state last month and advised the country to adopt measures including contact tracing “as if Covid-19 were already circulating” but stopped short of saying that it thought the government was covering up coronavirus cases.Turkmenistan has since implemented a nationwide lockdown and warned citizens to wear masks, citing “dust” and “pathogens” carried by wind, rather than the virus. State television said Berdymukhamedov had raised the issue of a “pneumonia of unknown etymology, which is rapidly spreading in our (Central Asian) region” in the call with the WHO, without saying if the pneumonia had reached Turkmenistan. Berdymukhamedov even speculated that pneumonia cases in the region could be linked to a “new coronavirus.”“I am confident in the need to consolidate the efforts of states in the very near future to correctly diagnose this disease under the patronage of the World Health Organization,” Berdymukhamedov was reported as saying. Health is an important feature of state propaganda in ex-Soviet Turkmenistan, which has also claimed in the past to have zero cases of HIV/AIDS.All-powerful Berdymukhamedov, a 63-year-old former dentist and health minister, is regularly shown cycling and working out and has overseen a government clampdown on tobacco use.The country is regularly cited as among the most repressive in the world with no free press or independent institutions to check the power of Berdymukhamedov, who is known as the Arkadag, or “protector.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkmenistan-to-let-who-conduct-independent-coronavirus-sampling/story-ZMNmbxvbHZEpGfQRWsWoTK.html
08-08-2020||World||Is France helping Lebanon, or trying to reconquer it?||It was almost as if Emmanuel Macron forgot that Lebanon is no longer a French protectorate.Visiting explosion-ravaged Beirut this week, France’s leader comforted distraught crowds, promised to rebuild the city and claimed that the blast pierced France’s own heart. “France will never let Lebanon go,” Macron said. “The heart of the French people still beats to the pulse of Beirut.”His critics denounced the overtures as a neocolonialist foray by a European leader seeking to restore sway over a troubled Middle Eastern land – and distract from mounting problems at home. A meme circulating online dubbed him Macron Bonaparte, a 21st century Emperor Napoleon.But Macron’s defenders — including desperate Beirut residents who called him “our only hope” — praised him for visiting gutted neighborhoods where Lebanese leaders fear to tread, and for trying to hold Lebanon’s politicians accountable for the corruption and mismanagement blamed for Tuesday’s deadly blast.Macron’s visit exposed France’s central challenge as it prepares to host an international donors conference for Lebanon on Sunday: how to help a country in crisis, where French economic ties run deep, without interfering in its internal affairs.“We are walking on the edge of a precipice. We have to aid, support and encourage the Lebanese people, but at the same time not give the impression that we want to establish a new protectorate, which would be completely stupid,” said Jack Lang, a former French government minister who now heads the Arab World Institute in Paris. “We must find new, intelligent solutions to aid the Lebanese.”France’s ties with Lebanon reach back at least to the 16th century, when the French monarchy negotiated with Ottoman rulers to protect Christians – and secure influence — in the region. By the time of the 1920-1946 French mandate, Lebanon already had a network of French schools and French speakers that survives to this day — along with France’s cozy relationships with Lebanon’s power brokers, including some accused of fueling its political and economic crisis.A surprising online petition emerged this week asking France to temporarily restore its mandate, saying Lebanon’s leaders have shown “total inability to secure and manage the country.”It’s widely seen as an absurd idea – Macron himself told Beirut residents Wednesday that “it’s up to you to write your history” – but 60,000 people have signed it, including members of France’s 250,000-strong Lebanese diaspora and people in Lebanon who said it’s a way to express their desperation and distrust of the political class.Aside from a show of much-needed international support, many in Lebanon viewed Macron’s visit as a way to secure financial assistance for a country wracked with debt.The French leader also managed to bring the divided political class together, if briefly. In a rare scene, the heads of Lebanon’s political factions — some of them still bitter enemies from the 1975-1990 civil war — appeared together at the Palais des Pins, the French embassy headquarters in Beirut, and filed out after meeting Macron.But to many, the visit was seen as patronizing. Some lashed out at the petition and those celebrating “France, the tender mother.”One writer, Samer Frangieh, said Macron gathered the politicians as “schoolchildren,” reprimanding them for failing to carry out their duties.There were other, more subtle jabs against France’s show of influence. While Macron was touring neighborhoods torn apart by the explosion, the health minister in the Hezbollah-backed government toured field hospitals donated by Iran and Russia, major power players in the region.“I get the people who want the mandate. They have no hope,” said Leah, an engineering student in Beirut who did not want her last name published out of concern for political repercussions. She spoke out strongly against the idea, and against those who see Macron as Lebanon’s “savior.”She said that risks worsening Lebanon’s divisions, as Maronite Christians and French-educated Muslims embrace Macron while others lean away. “He hasn’t resolved his issues with his country, with his people. How is he giving advice to us?” she asked.In Paris, Macron’s domestic political opponents from the far left to the far right warned the centrist leader against creeping neocolonialism, and extracting political concessions from Lebanon in exchange for aid. “Solidarity with Lebanon should be unconditional,” tweeted Julien Bayou, head of the popular Greens party.Macron himself firmly rejected the idea of reviving the French mandate.“You can’t ask me to substitute for your leaders. It’s not possible,” he said. “There is no French solution.”But he made a point of noting that he plans to return to Lebanon to verify that promised reforms are being undertaken on Sept. 1, the 100th anniversary of the declaration of Greater Lebanon – and the beginning of French rule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-france-helping-lebanon-or-trying-to-reconquer-it/story-HPZ9lPb1LDzrf2kIkl46AN.html
08-08-2020||World||Beijing’s top Hong Kong office says US sanctions are ‘clowning actions’ and ‘ridiculous’||Beijing’s top representative office in Hong Kong said on Saturday that sanctions imposed by Washington on senior Hong Kong and Chinese officials were “clowning actions” that would not frighten or intimidate Chinese people. The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on Luo Huining, the head of China’s Liaison Office, as well as Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and other current and former officials that Washington accuses of curtailing political freedoms in the global financial hub. The move ratchets up already strained tensions between the United States and China, more than a month after Beijing imposed sweeping national security legislation on Hong Kong that drew condemnation from Western governments and rights groups.“The unscrupulous intentions of the U.S. politicians to support the anti-China chaos in Hong Kong have been revealed, and their clowning actions are really ridiculous,” the Liaison Office said in a statement. “Intimidation and threats cannot frighten the Chinese people.” Luo, the most senior mainland political official based in the Chinese-controlled territory, said US sanctions on him indicated he was doing what he “should be doing for my country and Hong Kong”, according to the statement. As well as Luo and Lam, the sanctions target Hong Kong police commissioner Chris Tang and his predecessor Stephen Lo; John Lee, Hong Kong’s secretary of security, and Teresa Cheng, the justice secretary. Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing, was also on the list. The sanctions freeze any US assets of the officials and generally bar Americans from doing business with them.The Treasury Department said Beijing’s imposition of “draconian” national security legislation had undermined Hong Kong’s autonomy and set “the groundwork for censorship of any individuals or outlets that are deemed unfriendly to China.” Beijing imposed the law directly on Hong Kong just before midnight on June 30, circumventing the city’s legislature, and the city’s officials were not aware of the details of the law until it was implemented.Police chief Tang told local media on Saturday that maintaining the security of the country and Hong Kong was his responsibility and foreign sanctions were meaningless to him.The security legislation targets what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.Some political analysts say the national security law coming directly from Beijing and bypassing Hong Kong’s legislature signals the start of a more authoritarian rule in the semi-autonomous city and a march toward mainland control.Critics fear the legislation will crush wide-ranging freedoms in Hong Kong denied to people in mainland China that are seen as key to its success as a global financial centre.Supporters of the law say it will bring stability after a year of sometimes violent anti-government protests that plunged the city into its biggest crisis in decades..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-s-top-hong-kong-office-says-us-sanctions-are-clowning-actions-and-ridiculous/story-1CjdG99XRw3x7r3HyMXJVP.html
08-08-2020||World||China-US ties plunge further over Hong Kong sanctions||China on Saturday slammed the United States for imposing “barbarous” sanctions in response to Beijing’s crackdown in Hong Kong, capping a dramatic week of deteriorating relations between the world’s two biggest economies.In the toughest US action on Hong Kong since China imposed a sweeping new security law on the territory, Washington on Friday sanctioned a group of Chinese and Hong Kong officials -- including the city’s leader Carrie Lam.The move came after President Donald Trump’s administration forced Chinese internet giants TikTok and WeChat to end all operations in the US, in a twin diplomatic-commercial offensive set to grow ahead of the US presidential election in November.China on Saturday criticised the sanctions as “barbarous and rude”.“The ill intentions of US politicians to support people who are anti-China and messing up Hong Kong have been clearly revealed,” Beijing’s Liaison Office in Hong Kong said in a statement.The Treasury Department announced it was freezing the US assets of Chief Executive Carrie Lam and 10 other senior officials, including Luo Huining -- the head of the Liaison Office.It accused the sanctioned individuals of being “directly responsible for implementing Beijing’s policies of suppression of freedom and democratic processes”.The move criminalises any US financial transactions with the sanctioned officials.In a short statement, Luo said he welcomed the blacklisting.“I have done what I should do for the country and for Hong Kong,” he said.“I don’t have a dime’s worth in foreign assets.”TENSIONS SPIKE AHEAD OF ELECTIONBeijing’s security law was imposed in late June, following last year’s huge pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, sending a political chill through the semi-autonomous city.Since then, authorities have postponed elections, citing the coronavirus pandemic, issued arrest warrants for six exiled pro-democracy activists and launched a crackdown on other activists.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the security law violated promises made by China ahead of Hong Kong’s 1997 handover that the city could keep key freedoms and autonomy for 50 years.“Today’s actions send a clear message that the Hong Kong authorities’ actions are unacceptable,” Pompeo said in a statement.The US measures come three months ahead of the November election in which Trump, who is behind his rival Joe Biden, is campaigning hard on an increasingly strident anti-Beijing message.As public disapproval has grown for his handling of the pandemic, Trump has pivoted from his previous focus on striking a trade deal with China to blaming the country for the coronavirus crisis.TIK TOK, WECHAT BANSOn Thursday, Trump made good on previous threats against WeChat and TikTok -- two Chinese-owned apps with major audiences that US officials say pose a national security threat.In an executive order, Trump gave Americans 45 days to stop doing business with the platforms, effectively setting a deadline for a potential, under-pressure sale of TikTok to Microsoft.The move also threw into doubt the American operations of WeChat’s parent firm, Tencent, a powerful player in the video game industry and one of the world’s richest companies.China condemned the move as “arbitrary political manipulation”.The new restrictions sent Tencent shares tanking as much as 10 percent at one point in Hong Kong trade on Friday, wiping almost $50 billion off its market capitalisation.Trump’s order claimed TikTok could be used by China to track the locations of federal employees, build dossiers on people for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage.TikTok has repeatedly denied sharing data with Beijing.WeChat is a messaging, social media and electronic payment platform and is reported to have more than a billion users, with many preferring it to email.The latest US actions follow a protracted battle over Huawei, the Chinese network and smartphone giant accused by the Trump administration of being a tool for espionage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-us-ties-plunge-further-over-hong-kong-sanctions/story-g2FFlgapLDeppKIeWiSeUI.html
08-08-2020||World||US court will rehear Epstein victims’ claims over plea deal||A federal appeals court has decided to reconsider claims that Florida federal prosecutors violated the rights of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex abuse victims by not informing them about a secret plea deal.The Atlanta-based 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals vacated a previous panel’s 2-1 decision rejecting an effort to undo an agreement federal prosecutors made with Epstein more than a decade ago. Instead of facing stiff federal charges, Epstein was allowed to plead guilty to lesser state crimes and served a relatively short jail sentence.Some of the victims have long claimed the Miami US attorney’s office violated their rights by not informing them of the plea deal. This decision by the appeals court will allow their argument to be heard by the full court.“I had confidence this day would come,” one of the victims, Courtney Wild, said in a statement on Friday. “We have fought for 12 years, and as I’ve said before, no matter how many obstacles pile up, we will never give up fighting for what is right.” Epstein, a wealthy financial adviser, died at age 66 last year in a New York jail after he was indicted on multiple charges related to the sexual abuse of dozens of underage girls over many years. His longtime friend and cohort, Ghislaine Maxwell, is now facing charges related to the same series of events and is jailed in New York.In the earlier ruling by the 11th Circuit three-judge panel, the judges found that because prosecutors never brought charges against Epstein in Florida, the victims were not entitled to any relief under the federal Crime Victims’ Rights Act. They are seeking to overturn Epstein’s plea deal, which could expose others who were involved to prosecution.An attorney for the victims, University of Utah professor Paul Cassell, said in an email that the decision will provide a chance for them to possibly undo the Florida plea deal.“This is an important ruling for crime victims, not just for Epstein’s victims but all victims of federal crimes. We look forward to arguing before the full 11th Circuit that (the) ‘secret’ plea deal violate the Crime Victims’ Rights Act and that this particular deal should be rescinded,” Cassell said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-court-will-rehear-epstein-victims-claims-over-plea-deal/story-eB7Zt3woMuHgWCUg1F2tAP.html
08-08-2020||World||US counterspy chief warns Russia, China, Iran trying to meddle in 2020 election||The top US counterintelligence official on Friday warned that Russia, China and Iran will all try to interfere in the 2020 presidential election, with Russia already trying to undercut Democratic candidate Joe Biden.In an unusual public statement, William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said the three countries were using online disinformation and other means to try to influence voters, stir up disorder and undermine American voters’ confidence in the democratic process.President Donald Trump, asked at a news conference in New Jersey how he would respond to interference in the November 3 vote, said: “We’re going to watch all of them, we have to be very careful.”He added that he believed Russia, China and Iran all wanted him to lose the election.Foreign adversaries also may try to interfere with US election systems by trying to sabotage the voting process, stealing election data, or calling into question the validity of election results.“It would be difficult for our adversaries to interfere with or manipulate voting results at scale,” Evanina said.Trump repeated his refrain that the biggest risk to the integrity of the election was mail-in ballots. “It’s much easier for them to forge ballots and send them in, it’s much easier for them to cheat with universal mail-in ballots,” he said, referring to foreign countries.Trump has been attacking the idea of voting by mail ever since a resurgence in coronavirus infections made it less likely that people will want to vote in person in November, saying despite research to the contrary that mail-in voting is vulnerable to fraud.Multiple reviews by US intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia acted to boost Trump’s 2016 campaign and undercut his rival Hillary Clinton’s chances in that election. Trump has long bristled at that finding, which Russia denies.Evanina warned on Friday that Russia is already going after former vice president Biden and what it regards as an anti-Russia US “establishment.”In a statement, the Biden campaign said Trump “publicly and repeatedly invited, emboldened, and even tried to coerce foreign interference in American elections.”Evanina said Andriy Derkach, a pro-Russia Ukrainian politician, has been “spreading claims about corruption - including through publicized leaked phone calls” to undermine Biden’s campaign and the Democratic Party. Trump supporters in the US Senate have launched investigations questioning Biden’s son Hunter’s involvement in alleged business activities in Ukraine.Evanina said “Kremlin-linked actors” also are trying to “boost President Trump’s candidacy via social media and Russian television.” He said his agency assessed that China would prefer that Trump not win re-election, because Beijing regards him as too unpredictable. He said China has been expanding efforts to influence US politics ahead of the election to try to shape US policy, exert pressure on US politicians it regards as anti-China, and deflect criticism of China.Evanina said Iran is likely to use online tactics such as spreading disinformation to discredit US institutions and President Trump and to stir up US voters’ discontent. The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Mark Warner, thanked Evanina for his warning in a statement and added that all Americans “should endeavour to prevent outside actors from being able to interfere in our elections, influence our politics, and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions.”Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Trump’s re-election campaign, insisted that Trump has been “tougher on Russia than any administration in history.” “We don’t need or want foreign interference, and President Trump will beat Joe Biden fair and square,” Murtaugh added.Many officials who oversee US election technology and outside security experts now worry less about hacking in the elections than about misinformation and logistics such as a shortage of poll workers and slowdowns at the US postal service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-counterspy-chief-warns-russia-china-iran-trying-to-meddle-in-2020-election/story-OFiHvB7dJjP5wZOKib23nO.html

The study suggests that asymptomatic people who are infected with the coronavirus carry similar levels of the pathogen in their nose, throat and lungs as those with symptoms. The study was carried out by a team of researchers from Soonchunhyang University College of Medicine in South Korea. The experts analysed swabs taken from over 300 patients between March 6 and 26. Of the total, 193 patients were symptomatic while 110 were asymptomatic.Also read: California processing Covid-19 backlog of up to 300,000 lab recordsAccording to the experts, it was found that many individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection remained asymptomatic for a prolonged period. The study, therefore, calls for all infected persons to be isolated regardless of symptoms to contain the spread of the contagion.The study is also among the first few to distinguish between pre-symptomatic Covid-19 patients with the asymptomatic ones. Previously, it was found that an estimated 30 percent of Covid-19 patients never develop symptoms. Asymptomatic patients, however, were reported to test negative for the virus sooner when compared to patients with symptoms.  The authors said their findings “offer biological plausibility” to reports of asymptomatic transmission, adding that the analysis only looked at the amount of viral genetic material present. The team did not attempt to follow the subjects to see if that translated to the spread of the infectious virus.(With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-finds-asymptomatic-covid-19-patients-spread-virus-similar-to-symptomatic-ones/story-PVWvjjynwCcHCADTmdJ0aL.html
08-08-2020||World||Donald Trump says he’ll order unemployment payments if impasse persists||President Donald Trump said that if he can’t reach agreement with Democrats over stimulus legislation, he’s prepared to sign executive actions to provide expanded unemployment benefits, a temporary payroll tax deferral, eviction protection and student-loan relief.“If Democrats continue to hold this critical relief hostage, I will act under my authority as president to get the American people the relief they need,” Trump said Friday at a news conference at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.The president blamed top Democrats -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer -- for failing to agree to a deal, and said they’re trying to influence the outcome of November’s election.Trump’s announcement signalled that he was giving negotiators more time in negotiations with Democrats over another coronavirus relief package, with the two sides trillions of dollars apart on overall spending and on key issues, including on aid to state governments and the amount of supplementary unemployment benefits.To act on his own, the president is relying on an expansive and controversial reading of executive power that likely will face legal challenges. Trump told reporters that he’s not concerned about getting sued.Pressure DemocratsTrump’s advisers say executive action could pressure Democrats to reduce their demands and allow him to argue to voters that he’s looking out for their well-being amid congressional inaction.Two people familiar with the matter said Trump would extend the supplemental unemployment insurance at a $400-per-week level, a reduction from the $600 in the last stimulus bill. It wasn’t clear what mechanism he would use to fund the extension or how long it would be in place.Trump said his payroll tax order would eliminate the levy until the end of the year and it would be retroactive to July 1st.Trump told reporters the orders could be completed “by the end of the week. They’re being drawn by the lawyers right now.”Pelosi and Schumer said they again offered to cut $1 trillion from the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion proposal if Republicans would raise the top-line number of their plan by $1 trillion.“We are willing to make compromises,” Schumer said at a news conference before going into the Friday session. “The speaker made a very fair offer.”Demanding ConcessionsAfter the talks ended Friday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would recommend to the president that he sign the executive orders.The White House has demanded concessions from Democrats on unemployment insurance and aid to state and local governments, and that will be key to any further talks, Mnuchin said. The state aid has been a particular sticking point with Trump, which he opposes and emphasized in a tweet Friday.Pelosi said Friday Democrats still demand $915 billion while Republicans are only offering $150 billion. Mnuchin said remains to some aid related to Covid-19 and to help firefighters and police.There also are differences on the Democrats’ demand to extend the $600 a week supplemental unemployment bonus that has expired, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s insistence on a temporary liability shield for companies, schools and other organizations.One of the biggest hurdles is disagreement on the overall size of the package. Schumer said a majority of Democrats won’t vote for a package of less than $2 trillion. The party controls the House and their votes would be needed to get any legislation through the Republican-led Senate, given internal GOP divisions.Republican StanceSenate Republicans wouldn’t be able to back any deal of $2 trillion or more, given that as much as $1 trillion of the March stimulus package remains unspent, according to a GOP aide in that chamber. Schumer pointed out that some of Republican senators would be unlikely to support a bill regardless of size.Friday’s talks took place after Labor Department reported a 1.76 million jump in payrolls in July, beating most estimates. The unemployment rate fell to 10.2%, still higher than at the peak of the Great Recession in 2009. And higher-frequency data are turning more negative, as businesses use up the last of their federal loans and reduced jobless benefits pressure consumer spending.Democrats had criticized the president when he had threatened the idea of executive orders during negotiations.“An executive order will leave millions of people out,” Schumer said Thursday. “It will be litigated. It won’t be effective and things will get worse. So we urge them to rethink their position.”On the payroll levy, because the president alone can’t cut taxes, Trump would be simply delaying the due date for the tax, which is paid jointly by employers and employees and goes to fund Social Security and Medicare.The administration might hope that employers will stop withholding the money from Americans’ paychecks, with voters in turn pressuring Congress to eventually pass legislation forgiving the accumulated amount.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-ll-order-unemployment-payments-if-impasse-persists/story-S3qjpz6uP2XhQT3P26CPNK.html
08-08-2020||World||California processing Covid-19 backlog of up to 300,000 lab records||California officials have identified two data glitches that caused the state to undercount new coronavirus cases for more than a week, leaving a backlog of as many as 300,000 lab records to process.The held-up test results will probably be worked through in one to two days, Mark Ghaly, California’s Health and Human Services secretary, said in a briefing Friday. The data reporting issues, first disclosed on Tuesday, have left public health officials unable to trust numbers showing cases slowing in the state with the most US infections.Two overlapping issues created the problem, Ghaly said. On July 25, a server outage in the state’s centralized reporting system prompted workers to install a temporary patch that, over days, interfered with the proper flow of lab records. Then, on the 31st, the system stopped receiving records from one of the largest commercial labs in the state’s testing program, Quest Diagnostics, after a certificate that needs to be renewed every two years expired.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayBoth problems have since been fixed, Ghaly said. But state officials are now building a new system to track disease data, since the old one, known as CalREDIE, wasn’t designed to handle this many records.There are 250,000 to 300,000 lab records that are left to process, and the exact effect on California’s coronavirus case counts isn’t yet known, Ghaly said. The state’s 14-day average rate of positive tests -- which may be affected by the backlog -- is at 6.1%. Some of the jammed-up records will be duplicates, while others will be for other infectious diseases tracked by the same systems.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage California has more than 538,000 confirmed virus cases, and on Friday became the third US state to exceed 10,000 deaths from Covid-19. Earlier this week, before the data glitches came to light, Governor Gavin Newsom said slowing new case counts offered “encouraging” signs the state may have turned a corner in its outbreak.Ghaly said that after checking with hospitals around the state, he believes accurate data won’t change the underlying trend of improvement. New case counts, he said, appear to be stabilizing and trending down after July’s spike. The state’s data show hospitalizations, unaffected by the reporting issues, have fallen 17% from a peak.“We do feel confident in the trends,” Ghaly said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-processing-covid-19-backlog-of-up-to-300-000-lab-records/story-SltBz056TdVTRwBvaIjoMN.html
08-08-2020||World||US officials: Russia vs Joe Biden, China vs Donald Trump pre-election||US intelligence officials believe that Russia is using a variety of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden ahead of the November election and that individuals linked to the Kremlin are boosting President Donald Trump’s re-election bid, the country’s counter intelligence chief said Friday in the most specific warning to date about the threat of foreign interference.US officials also believe that China does not want Trump to win a second term and has accelerated its criticism of the White House, expanding its efforts to shape public policy in America and to pressure political figures seen as opposed to Beijing’s interests.The statement from William Evanina is believed to be the most pointed declaration by the US intelligence community linking the Kremlin to efforts to get Trump re-elected — a sensitive subject for a president who has rejected intelligence agency assessments that Russia tried to help him in 2016.It also links Moscow’s disapproval of Biden to his role in shaping Obama administration policies supporting Ukraine, an important US ally, and opposing Russian leader Vladimir Putin. That assertion conflicts with the narrative advanced by Trump, who has made unsubstantiated claims that Biden’s actions in Ukraine were intended to help the business interests of his son, Hunter.Evanina’s statement, three months before the election, comes amid criticism from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional Democrats that the intelligence community has been withholding from the public specific intelligence information about the threat of foreign interference in American politics.The latest intelligence assessment reflects concerns not only about Russia but China and Iran as well, warning that hostile foreign actors may seek to compromise election infrastructure, interfere with the voting process or call into question voting results. Despite those efforts, officials see it as unlikely that anyone could manipulate voting results in any meaningful way, Evanina said.“Many foreign actors have a preference for who wins the election, which they express through a range of overt and private statements; covert influence efforts are rarer,” said Evanina, director of the National Counter intelligence Security Center. “We are primarily concerned about the ongoing and potential activity by China, Russia and Iran.”Concerns about election interference are especially acute following a wide-ranging effort by Russia to meddle in the 2016 election on Trump’s behalf through both the hacking of Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign aimed at sowing discord among US voters. Trump has routinely resisted the idea that the Kremlin favoured him in 2016, but the intelligence assessment released Friday indicates that unnamed Kremlin-linked actors are again working to boost his candidacy on social media and Russian television.The White House responded to Friday’s news with a statement saying “the United States will not tolerate foreign interference in our electoral processes and will respond to malicious foreign threats that target our democratic institutions.”“The United States is working to identify and disrupt foreign influence efforts targeting our political system, including efforts designed to suppress voter turnout or undermine public confidence in the integrity of our elections,” said the statement from National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot.In a separate statement, the Trump campaign said it didn’t want or need foreign assistance and said China and Iran were opposed to Trump because “he has held them accountable after years of coddling by politicians like Joe Biden.”Democrats in Congress who have participated in recent classified briefings on the election interference threat have expressed alarm at what they have heard. They have urged the US intelligence community to make public some of their concerns, in part to avoid a repeat of 2016, when Obama administration officials were seen as slow and overly deliberate in their public discussion of active Russian measures in that year’s election.A bipartisan congressional report released by the Senate intelligence committee earlier this year said the Obama administration was ill-prepared to handle the interference and failed to respond effectively as officials feared getting caught up in a heavily politicized environment and undermining the election.When it comes to Russia this year, US intelligence officials assess that it is working to “denigrate” Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia “establishment” among his supporters, Evanina said. US officials believe that tracks Moscow’s criticism of Biden when he was vice president for his role in Ukraine policies and his support of opposition to Putin inside Russia.The US statement called out by name Andriy Derkach, a pro-Russia Ukrainian lawmaker who has been active in leveling unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Biden and his son concerning Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas company on whose board Hunter Biden sat. That effort has included publicizing leaked phone calls.Democrats, including members of the Senate intelligence panel, have voiced concerns that an ongoing Republican probe into Hunter Biden and his work in Ukraine would parallel Russian efforts and amplify Russian disinformation. That investigation is being led by Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the chairman of Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee. He has denied any wrongdoing.Though US officials allege that China has its own preference, the statement Friday did not directly accuse Beijing of election interference or taking action to prop up Biden.Instead, the statement said, China views Trump as “unpredictable” and does not want to see him win reelection, Evanina said. China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of the November election in an effort to shape US policy and pressure political figures it sees as against Beijing. The Trump administration’s relationship with China has taken a starkly more adversarial tone, including the closure last month of Beijing’s consulate in Houston and an executive order Thursday that banned dealings with the Chinese owners of consumer apps TikTok and WeChat,“Although China will continue to weigh the risks and benefits of aggressive action, its public rhetoric over the past few months has grown increasingly critical of the current administration’s Covid-19 response, closure of China’s Houston consulate and actions on other issues,” he wrote.On Iran, the assessment said Tehran seeks to undermine US democratic institutions as well as Trump and divide America before the election.“Iran’s efforts along these lines probably will focus on online influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-US content,” Evanina wrote. “Tehran’s motivation to conduct such activities is, in part, driven by a perception that President Trump’s re-election would result in a continuation of US pressure on Iran in an effort to foment regime change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officials-russia-vs-joe-biden-china-vs-donald-trump-pre-election/story-hgtEgf3BLenqoNAMqaBjmO.html
08-08-2020||World||Prachanda’s security guards test Covid positive, PM Oli gets more time||Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli appeared to have bought some time, sealing the locality that is home to his prime rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ after six guards on his security detail tested positive to the coronavirus disease.The precautionary measure helps PM Oli avoid any meeting with Prachanda who has lately, amped up his attacks on the prime minister and this week told party workers to prepare for the worst. It was a message that Dahal had conveyed to PM Oli’s emissary, the Nepal Communist Party’s deputy leader in parliament Subas Nembang, also on Thursday.That is before authorities sealed off parts of Khumaltar, the neighbourhood outside the capital city that Dahal shifted to in 2017 when he couldn’t find a house in Kathmandu with enough parking space for his security entourage. Six security guards deployed to protect Dahal had tested positive. In a Facebook post, Dahal’s daughter Ganga, who assists her father, said everyone else in the family and the secretariat had tested negative. The order to seal off the area around the Dahal residence came soon.Kathmandu watchers say the Covid order issued by the Oli government offers a reprieve to the prime minister who has been at his wits’ end trying to bunk party meetings. Last month-end, the NCP’s standing committee had gone ahead to hold its meeting without PM Oli after the prime minister postponed it once again.Dahal, who had been negotiating a way out to end the deadlock with PM Oli, last month reversed his stand after reports that the Oli camp may have quietly registered his old party - CPN-UML - with the Himalayan nation’s election commission. The ruling Nepal Communist Party was formed in 2018 with the merger of PM Oli’s CPN (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and the Dahal faction’s CPN (Maoist Centre).The Dahal faction suspects that PM Oli was preparing to break up the NCP at a time of his choosing. That the wily Oli had no plans to strike a compromise with detractors who want him to give one of his two positions - PM or the NCP’ co-chairman - became clear this week when during a visit home, he declared that “there was no question of resigning in the middle of the journey”.Dahal responded the next day, Wednesday, with a long statement to a select group of journalists, asking party cadres to prepare for the “worst”. At the briefing that he addressed jointly with three senior party leaders Madhav Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal and party spokesperson Narayan Kaji Shrestha, Dahal said: “Our main concern is not about gaining power, what we want is to follow the proper procedure while running the NCP. We are not focusing on gaining any position, but our fight is against the wrong trend developing in the party”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prachanda-s-security-guards-test-covid-positive-pm-oli-gets-more-time/story-bhdzIlanwwF83fdh4SkCmM.html

08-08-2020||World||Mike Pompeo rejects Congress’ subpoenas for IG, Biden probe info||Secretary of state Mike Pompeo on Friday rejected congressional subpoenas issued for him and for the State Department to provide information and testimony to lawmakers about two politically charged developments. The refusals set the stage for an escalation in the confrontation between the State Department and the Democratic-controlled House ahead of November’s elections.In letters sent to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Pompeo and the State Department’s acting legislative affairs chief said they had no intention of complying with the subpoenas. They said the subpoenas were politically motivated, without merit, and unnecessary as the information and testimony could be otherwise obtained. The letters were obtained by The Associated Press shortly after they were sent to Capitol Hill.While congressional subpoenas are legally binding, the Trump administration through various Cabinet agencies has repeatedly refused to comply with House demands with little consequence. There was no immediate response to the letters from the committee, although the panel later announced it was seeking testimony from another official in an unrelated matter.In one letter, Pompeo said committee chairman, Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, was out of line in issuing the subpoenas, which he said were “outrageous” and ignored the State Department’s good faith efforts to answer questions about the firing of the department’s inspector general and the provision of Ukraine-related documents to Republican-controlled Senate committees.Engel had issued the subpoenas on July 31 and Aug. 3, complaining that Pompeo and the State Department were “stonewalling” repeated requests for information on both matters.The first subpoena demanded that the State Department turn over to Engel’s committee copies of thousands of pages of documents he said the department had given to the Senate regarding former Vice President Joe Biden as well as his son, Hunter, for his work for a gas company in Ukraine while his father was vice president.It also asked for internal department emails about responding to Congress. It said Pompeo had delivered more than 16,000 pages of records to the Senate but refused to send the same materials to the Democrat-led House.In response, the State Department’s acting head of legislative affairs, Ryan Kaldahl, said the agency was not obliged to provide the documents to any committee not conducting its own investigation into the matter. He suggested that Engel’s committee seek copies from its Senate counterparts.Kaldahl also said the committee had not shown that its demand was for a legitimate legislative purpose and suggested that it was entirely partisan. “The department is unable to consider whether any accommodation is possible in response to the committee’s requests unless the committee explains in detail its legislative purpose,” he wrote.The second subpoena demanded the testimony of four senior State Department officials about the firing in May of department Inspector General Stephen Linick, which Democrats have alleged came in retaliation for probes the watchdog was conducting into Pompeo. Pompeo has denied knowledge of any investigation into his own conduct.In rejecting that subpoena, Pompeo said in a letter to Engel that most of the officials in question, including the Under Secretary of State for Management Brian Bulatao and others, were prepared to be interviewed voluntarily and repeated that offer.“Mr. Bulatao and the other requested witnesses will appear and unambiguously refute your baseless accusations and provide full transparency before the elected representatives of the American people,” Pompeo wrote.“Furthermore, let me express how outrageous it is for you to suggest that the depart,ent is ‘stonewalling’ any investigation into the president’s replacing of Steve Linick,” he wrote, citing at least four offers for Bulatao and others to appear before the committee.Congressional aides have said those offers were unacceptable because they were contingent on dropping other avenues of inquiry.Shortly after the letters were sent, Engel announced he was seeking testimony in an unrelated matter from the US ambassador to Britain, Robert “Woody” Johnson on Sept. 30. Johnson is alleged to have tried to weigh in with British officials to move the British Open golf tournament to one of Trump’s resorts and also is accused of inappropriate racist and sexist behaviour.This is not the first time Pompeo has rebuffed a House subpoena. He did not comply with a subpoena to provide documents during the House’s impeachment inquiry into Trump last year, and several other Trump administration officials refused to testify in that probe.The administration’s record of complying with subpoenas is poor and has left congressional Democrats flustered with little recourse except in the courts.The House Judiciary Committee sued former White House Counsel Donald McGahn for his refusal to testify about former special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report in April 2019, and that case has been tied up in courts. On Friday, an appeals court said that the committee can make the claim in court, reversing an earlier court decision.While the decision was good news for the committee, the matter won’t be resolved any time soon. One of the dissenting judges in that case noted that the House session ends Jan. 3, and “the chances that the committee hears McGahn’s testimony anytime soon are vanishingly slim.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-rejects-congress-subpoenas-for-ig-biden-probe-info/story-cMmjSAsWMUUO5FiYrWHVQI.html

08-08-2020||India||I’m blessed to have good command over Hindi, says Saurabh Saraswat||Actor Saurabh Saraswat has been in the reel world for six years but his first OTT outing last month has established his connection with the masses in the real sense. “The appreciation I am getting after the release of ‘Mafia’ is overwhelming. The reach of this digital platform is phenomenal. I have done an international film ‘CRD’ and my short feature film ‘Gray’ was screened at the Cannes Film Fest,” says the actor. But he makes a point: “As an actor, there is not much of a difference between conventional cinema and OTT platform. It was fun playing the two phases of life in ‘Mafia’. My independent films helped me train for this role.” Saurabh hails from Ajmer but has his roots in Uttar Pradesh. “My mother is from Pharay near Mathura while my father is from Kasganj. In 1970s, our families shifted to Rajasthan. I have been to Agra, Moradabad, Aligarh and Mathura as our relatives still live there,” he says. The actor says he is blessed to have a command over Hindi. “As my parents are from UP, they speak clear Hindi and it came naturally to me also. Besides, I live in a locality that has like-minded migrants from the same belt. So, I got a ‘mahaul’ (atmosphere) of Hindi even while living in Ajmer.” Acting came to him naturally. “I started with theatre in school. As all are engineers and doctors in my family, a professional course was kind of mandatory for me too. I did engineering studies from Jaipur but also remained dedicated to theatre. Then I took up a job in a software company in Delhi and kept doing theatre. I decided to quit the job and made it to the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune.” Subsequently, the actor shifted to Mumbai. “I did some episodes of Crime Patrol. In 2014, I got an international project ‘CRD’. I prepared hard for the film. For one year, I learnt French and trained myself physically, read a lot of Shakespeare and other playwrights. But the film released much later,” says Saurabh. For bread and butter, Saurabh started organising acting workshops. “I also started doing theatre – writing, acting and directing. Then I got ‘Cat Sticks’, which was based on a drug addict and shot in Bangla, Hindi and English. It went to many film festivals. I did a feature film ‘Gray’ where I played a gay character. The same director gave me ‘Nameplate’ and now I am in a happy phase with my OTT series.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-m-blessed-to-have-good-command-over-hindi-says-saurabh-saraswat/story-UuQz1ItYG7wnXFEgomSb6H.html
08-08-2020||India||‘Politically motivated’: Mumbai Police tells SC about Bihar FIR in Sushant Singh’s case||Actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death probe is turning into a mud-slinging match between the Mumbai Police and Bihar Police at the top court. On Saturday, the Mumbai Police filed an affidavit stating that the FIR lodged by Bihar Police on a complaint filed by Sushant’s father was politically motivated and done at the instance of the chief minister of Bihar. This has given an interesting turn to the case ahead of the Supreme Court hearing the transfer petition filed by Sushant’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty on Tuesday. She has sought transfer of the FIR lodged at Patna to Mumbai. Mumbai Police even called out the “indecent haste” shown by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in lodging a FIR on the recommendation from the Bihar government and even constituting a team to begin probe into abetment of suicide charge against Rhea, her family members and two friends. “The indecent haste with which the CBI has proceeded in this regard, speaks for itself, regarding the bonafides of all involved in this exercise,” stated the Mumbai Police in its affidavit filed through advocate Sachin Patil. The affidavit termed the CBI FIR without “legal sanctity” as it was filed without consent of Maharashtra, which alone is entitled to give consent under Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act and not Bihar. The developments came on a day when Sushant’s father KK Singh filed his reply in the apex court terming Rhea’s petition as “infructuous” following CBI taking over the case. The late actor’s father even accused the Mumbai Police of inaction as he questioned why even after 54 days of enquiry no FIR was registered. “If the respondent No.3 (State of Maharashtra) has found no evidence qua the petitioner (Rhea) in 54 days of enquiry, it only reflects one conclusion that the Respondent No.3 is trying to shield the Petitioner for the reason best known to them,” Sushant’s father stated in his affidavit settled by senior advocate Vikas Singh. Defending the charges against them, Mumbai Police wondered why the father of the late actor did not approach them for registering FIR against Rhea and her family members. Citing a Ministry of Home Affairs circular of May 10, 2013, the Mumbai Police claimed that at best, Bihar Police ought to have registered a Zero FIR and transferred the same to Bandra Police.Making a big charge against its Bihar counterpart, the Mumbai Police said, “The registration of the FIR at Rajeev Nagar Police Station, Patna, Bihar was politically motivated and due to extraneous reasons.” To support this statement, the affidavit cited a newspaper report annexed to Rhea’s petition which said that while Bihar Police was hesitant to file FIR, it was the Bihar chief minister and another minister who persuaded them to register it. The mud-slinging was not limited to that alone. Commenting on Bihar’s decision to recommend a CBI probe, the Mumbai Police said, “Recommendation of respondent no 1 (Bihar government) to transfer investigation into FIR by CBI bristles with malafides and same is void ab initio.” Such a thing could lead to a “chaotic situation” as the accused or complainant would then choose their own state police to initiate investigation into a case. Already, the Bihar Police had accused Mumbai Police of shielding Rhea and obstructing probe into the FIR lodged at Patna. The turf war between the two police forces was at display when Bihar-cadre Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Vinay Tiwari who landed in Mumbai on August 2 to expedite probe was forcibly quarantined. The Bihar government had claimed this was an “afterthought” as the four officers of Bihar Police Special Investigation Team (SIT) who landed in Mumbai on July 27 were not similarly quarantined. The Mumbai Police has denied of having obstructing the probe and claimed that Vinay Tiwari was quarantined by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai and not the police. Further, it said that the four officers who landed earlier ought to have quarantined themselves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/politically-motivated-mumbai-police-tells-sc-about-bihar-fir-in-sushant-singh-s-case/story-EUCW72uidTgTFBiQ64vn7K.html

The victims – Veeraiah, Kumaraswamy, Venkataratnam and Srinivasulu – belonging to Scavengers’ Colony in Tirupati town succumbed at the SVRR government general hospital, where they were admitted by their relatives on Thursday evening. “The family members told us that they were addicted to liquor consumption and might have consumed sanitiser as they could not get liquor due to lockdown being in force in the town. We are awaiting the forensic report to get the confirmation whether they had consumed only hand sanitiser or something else,” Tirupati (urban) superintendent of police A Ramesh Reddy told Hindustan Times. He, however, said the four victims were in no way connected to one another and they were isolated incidents. “There are three dealers supplying hand sanitisers in the town and there is no evidence of all the four buying the liquid from the same shop and consuming it together. Yet, we are investigating into the incident,” Reddy said. The SP said the victims also did not fall under the lower strata of the society. “Our enquiries with their family members revealed that they were earning reasonably good money. May be, they had consumed sanitiser due to non-availability of liquor,” he said. Tirupati East police have registered a case under Section 176 of Criminal Procedure Code (suspicious death). YSR Congress party MLA from Tirupati Bhumana Karunakar Reddy visited the hospital and called on the family members of the four victims at the mortuary. “It is unfortunate that four people had consumed sanitiser for intoxication. It is very dangerous to consume such liquids. I request the people not to get addicted to liquor,” Reddy said. Ten people had died of consuming alcohol-based sanitiser at Kurichedu town in Prakasam district in a span of two days in the last week of July. Most of them are poor people and three of them are beggars. Following the incident, the state government cracked down on sanitiser makers, illegal liquor shops and spurious liquor manufacturers. The Special Enforcement Bureau authorities conducted surprise raids on these units and identified 345 places where spurious liquor was being made. Cases have been booked against 76 companies which were involved in making of hand sanitiser without licences. “The police also identified 144 people who were consuming hand sanitisers and counselled them,” a senior police official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-absence-of-liquor-in-tirupati-4-people-die-after-consuming-hand-sanitiser/story-O7xhBKxdicBUlicjOvKIhN.html

08-08-2020||India||With Roy Naik’s induction in BJP; Goa’s infamous police drug-peddler nexus comes full circle||August 3, 2010. The monsoon session of the Goa Legislative Assembly was at its height and the Digambar Kamat led government was proposing government demands for the approval of the House. The then leader of Opposition Manohar Parrikar had just moved in an adjournment motion which was promptly rejected by the Speaker. Eager to make his point the opposition benches led by Parrikar stormed the well of the House forcing the adjournment of the house not once, but twice. The reason? A day earlier (August 2, 2010) the mother of Scarlett Keeling the British teenager found naked and dead on the Anjuna beach in Goa had deposed before the Children’s Court in Goa that Roy Naik, the younger son of the then Home Minister Ravi Naik was among those who gave her daughter drugs resulting in an international scandal and pushed the Congress-led government on the backfoot. “There is a direct allegation against the Home Minister of the State. We want a CBI inquiry,” Parrikar had loudly insisted after the motion was turned down. Fast forward to August 6, 2020, and Roy Naik was welcomed into the BJP along with his elder brother Ritesh. Damodar Naik, a former BJP MLA, who was the first to the well of the house to force an adjournment demanding an inquiry against Roy was now the host of the welcome ceremony. State BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade feigned ignorance when asked about the party’s duplicity in welcoming the same Roy into the party fold. “There are so many Roys. This is Roy Ravi Naik. Our party has never made any allegation against Roy Ravi Naik, if you have the proof, please show me. Then I will speak,” Tanavade told reporters at the ceremony without flinching. But the irony was not lost on former minister Mickky Pacheco who headed a house committee set up by Parrikar after the BJP came to power in 2012. “I confirm that it’s Roy Naik the son of former Home Minister and present Ponda legislator Ravi Naik, who was involved in the drug trade. While investigating cases (as house committee chairman) it came to light that Roy Naik, was involved in the drug trade. A 25-page report was submitted to the house (in 2012),” Pacheco said. The report Pacheco authored was not formally accepted by the government after two members of the committee both from the BJP refused to sign it. Curiously the non-BJP members of the house committee gave it their assent. As recently as 2018, Roy was being probed by a special investigation team of Goa Police for his alleged involvement in the nexus between Goa Police officials and drug dealers. The probe however remained inconclusive with officials claiming that there wasn’t enough evidence to indict the former home minister or his son. Roy had denied any involvement with any drug nexus. “I have absolutely no nexus with any drug dealing nor have I ever met Atala or his friend Lucky Farmhouse,” Naik had said back in 2010. He did not respond to phone calls or text messages send by this correspondent. The Congress put on a bright face with the departure of the two sons of the current MLA. “The pandemic has resulted in a cleaner environment. [A] bright future for INC-Goa [is] clearly visible. Insecurity is rife in BJP... Goans will explain in 2022,” state Congress president Girish Chodankar, said.In an interview with an Israeli newspaper Lucky Mangrada, a former girlfriend of alleged drug dealer Yaniv Benaim alias Atala had claimed that Roy would regularly visit her boyfriend besides also accusing several Goa policemen of being in cahoots with drug dealers. Upon his arrest Atala also later confessed the police would sell seized drugs back into the market. The revelations sparked a scandal that led to the arrest of seven policemen including the then head of the Anti Narcotics Cell of the Goa Police. The arrested cops have since been reinstated, completing the circle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-roy-naik-s-induction-in-bjp-goa-s-infamous-police-drug-peddler-nexus-comes-full-circle/story-USjtByxwHj5aCAe1LTx4FM.html
08-08-2020||India||Sangh offshoot gives suggestion to govt on job creation||The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) has urged the union government to draft schemes to protect existing jobs in sectors such as agriculture and handloom and also ensure avenues for employment by designing migrant worker centric plans that take into account specific sectors such as construction workers, street vendors and hospitality workers. The suggestions were made at an interaction between the functionaries of the BMS an offshoot of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and eight union ministers who are part of the Group of Ministers (GOM) on employment and skill development chaired by union minister Thawar Chand Gehlot on August 6 and 7, people aware of the developments told Hindustan Times. Citing the impact of coronavirus disease outbreak on economies across the globe and employment, the Sangh functionaries underlined the need of reverse job cuts in sectors such as plantation, beedi industry, handloom and fishing and recognise community based professions. The labour wing of the RSS, the ideological fount of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has also called for identifying districts that offer mass employment with local resources and local potential so that the government can offer assistance to help them increase employment avenues. Development of village clusters in each district followed by integrated development of villages was also suggested said a person aware of the details. “Job losses and economic slowdown have not happened only because of the pandemic. It is an ongoing problem. What we are suggesting is that the government should invest in sustainable policies that will deliver long –term solutions,” said Vrijesh Upadhyay, the general secretary of BMS. Panning the need of providing jobs through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in the wake of the pandemic; the BMS has suggested tweaking of the criteria for providing jobs to registered workers. Family should not be the basis for providing work, instead Individual should be the basis, it has said, adding that a minimum of 100 working days under the scheme should be provided to individuals. The labour wing also wants suspension of the scheme for duration crop seeding and cutting so that work on farms is not affected because of labour shortage. MGNREGA at present offers not less than 100 days of unskilled manual work as a guaranteed employment in a financial year to every household in rural areas as per demand. The BMS also wants a policy to restrict production of certain items which, tiny, micro and cottage industries can produce and big companies and multinational corporations are barred from producing. This suggestion, the BMS said, will be necessary to protect rural economy. Biswajit Dhar, professor of economics at the Jawaharlal Nehru University backed the suggestion to offer MGNREGA jobs to individuals, instead of households. When the demand for jobs particularly in the wake of migration on account of the pandemic is high, Dhar said the government should ensure those who are willing to work have jobs. “We cannot have involuntary unemployment. Whoever is willing to work should be offered a job,” Dhar said. The second suggestion that he supported was the policy of reserving production for smaller units. “The government can identify a set of activities that will be reserved for the small, micro or cottage industries so that they can then give focused attention to them including long term loans,” he said. The interaction was attended by BMS’s all india organising secretary B. Surendra and zonal organising secretary Pawan Kumar, while the union ministers present included Thawar Chand Gehlot; Arjun Munda; Mahendra Nath Pandey; Santosh Gangawar; Prahlad Singh Patel; G Kishan Reddy; V Muralidharan and Pratap Sarangi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sangh-offshoot-gives-suggestion-to-govt-on-job-creation/story-ZAdXSl2MueCaBiI45depUL.html
08-08-2020||India||Andhra govt moves SC challenging lower court’s order stalling formation of 3 capitals||The Andhra Pradesh government on Saturday moved the Supreme Court challenging the high court’s interim orders granting stay on the formation of three capital cities for the state. In a special leave petition filed in the apex court, the state government argued that the high court had issued orders staying the implementation of gazette notifications on abolition of the AP Capital Region Development Authority and formation of three capitals for a decentralised development without any valid reasons. Stating that the high court orders were against the principles of natural justice, the state government requested that the Supreme Court put a stay on the high court’s orders. The petition is expected to come up for hearing on Monday, an official in the chief minister’s office familiar with the development said. On August 4, a three-member division bench of the state high court comprising Justice Rakesh Kumar, Justice Sesha Sai and Justice Satyanaryana Murthy granted a 10-day stay on the implementation of the gazette notifications and asked the state government to file a counter within 10 days. The high court issued interim orders acting on a petition filed by Rajadhani Rythu Parirakshana Samithi (Committee of farmers to protect the capital). It ordered that the state government maintain status quo with regard to Amaravati as the capital city and not to proceed with any moves with regard to the shifting of executive capital from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam. On July 31, the Jagan Mohan Reddy government issued two separate notifications – one on abolition of the AP Capital Region Development Authority formed in December 2014 to develop Amaravati as the capital of Andhra; and the second one on formation of three capitals for the state – executive capital at Visakhapatnam, judicial capital at Kurnool and legislative capital at Amaravati. Meanwhile, state legislative assembly speaker Tammineni Sitaram on Friday observed that the courts could not trespass into legislative functions. “State legislature and judiciary are different pillars of democracy and they cannot trespass into each other’s powers,” he said. He reminded that senior Telugu Desam Party leader Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, who the speaker of the assembly in combined Andhra Pradesh in 1977, had given a ruling that legislative decisions could not be challenged in the court of law. “The same thing is still in force now. But the TDP leaders are moving the high court challenging the passage of the three capitals bill by the state legislature. Why is Ramakrishnudu opposing the bill now?” Sitaram asked. Ramakrishnudu, however, said the courts could definitely review the decisions of the legislature when they were in violation of the Constitution and the laws of the land. He clarified on Saturday that his ruling given in the capacity as speaker in 1997 was still valid and said that the courts shall not interfere with the functioning or debates or rulings of the House. “But if the House makes any legislation violating the Constitution or law, it can be questioned in the court of law,” he argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-govt-moves-sc-challenging-lower-court-s-order-stalling-formation-of-3-capitals/story-ONom2VNoqK1GlODf6L4bII.html

We are also willing to offer any assistance to the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau in order to help gather facts and any other safety and security information which may be pertinent to this tragic event,” the statement from the association said.Also Read: Day after Kozhikode air crash, stories of heartbreak and heroismCivil aviation minister was more direct in his rejection of speculations about the cause of the accident and ruled out any laxity on the part of the aviation authorities. He also addressed the issue of the air strip being inadequate for landing of wide body aircrafts.“I would like to remind my colleagues that the aircraft involved in the incident at Kozhikode was a B-737-800 which is NOT a wide body aircraft. As far as wide body aircraft are concerned, DGCA had carried out a thorough assessment & prescribed comprehensive mitigation measures,” he said in a statement on Saturday.The flight was operated by Deepak Sathe, a highly rated former India Air Force pilot and his co-pilot from Mathura, Akhilesh Sharma. Sharma’s wife Megha is expecting a child within a fortnight and has not been told about her husband’s death. Civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri earlier today said that the pilots operating the Air India Express flight were very experienced. Deepak Vasant Sathe, who was the commander of the flight, had 10,000 hours of flying experience on the Boeing 737 aircraft. He had flown 6,662 of these hours as the commander. His 32 year old co-pilot, Akhilesh Sharma, had experience of 1,728 hours of flying with the 737 aircraft.Also Read: Air India mourns Kozhikode tragedy with ‘black’ logo on social media handlesPuri added that Sathe had also landed successfully on the challenging tabletop Calicut airport at least 27 times, including more than 10 times this year itself.The civil aviation ministry has ordered a probe by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB). Two black boxes containing the digital flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder have been recovered from the crash site earlier today and will be crucial to the investigations.The AAIB is mandated to investigate aircraft accidents and obtain a preliminary report before assisting in setting up the committee of inquiry and formal investigation in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) rules.The spaces at the ends of the runway at the Kozhikode airport has been questioned as inadequate for landing in tough situations. Several international airlines had stopped landing bigger aircraft at the airport due to safety concerns.The crashed flight had also aborted two landing attempts last night before making the final attempt from the opposite side. It aborted the second attempt with 2,000 feet to go.Civil aviation expert Captain Mohan Ranganathan believes that the pilot should have diverted to Coimbatore, as the conditions in Kozhikode were not conducive for a landing. Ranganathan says that he had warned the authorities in 2011 after the Mangalore crash that the Calicut runway was unsafe for landing and needed to be reevaluated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-kerala-plane-crash-theories-rise-pilots-body-makes-an-appeal-govt-presents-defence/story-7ZXScwoqM8qf8mEbQXKs9H.html

08-08-2020||India||Chandrika Rai, father-in-law of Tej Pratap, all set to join JD (U)||Chandrika Rai, a former Bihar minister and a confidant of Lalu Prasad, chief, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), who later became his relative through a matrimonial alliance, is all set to do a political somersault and join the ruling Janata Dal (United).He is likely to join the JD(U) after he is discharged from Patna’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), where is undergoing treatment following contracting SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Rai, the son of former Bihar chief minister Daroga Prasad Rai, has made up his mind to contest the upcoming assembly elections – slated to be held in October-November – from his traditional Parsa assembly seat.However, his next political move became evident from a social media post. He appealed to his supporters to register their names, along with their mobile numbers, on JD (U)’s digital platform. Rai, whose daughter Aishwarya was married to Prasad’s eldest son Tej Pratap in 2018 until it fell apart a few months later over marital discord that had hit the headlines and strained the ties between the two well-known political families of Bihar, has been a six-time lawmaker. He had become a member of the Bihar legislative assembly (MLA) for the first time on a Congress ticket in 1985. However, though he was denied a ticket by the Congress for a second successive term, he won as an Independent and later joined the RJD. He was a prominent member of successive RJD governments, helmed by Prasad and then by his wife Rabri Devi following his indictment in the multi-crore fodder scam. Rai was also a minister in the short-lived mahagathbandhan, or the grand alliance government, among the JD(U), the RJD and the Congress. Speculations have been rife that Rai will join JD(U) since he quit the RJD in February. He fell out with Prasad’s family after Tej Pratap filed for divorce months after marrying Aishwarya in 2018. Later, Aishwarya had complained of being ill-treated by Prasad’s family members. In the 2019 parliamentary election, Prasad had fielded Rai from the Saran Lok Sabha seat, despite Tej Pratap Yadav’s stiff opposition. Rai had lost to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Rajiv Pratap Rudy, a former Union minister.Though Rai quit the RJD in February, he had snapped all ties with the party prior to that, as he had stopped attending its organisational meetings. RJD has chalked out plans to checkmate Rai’s next political move. The party has inducted Rai’s niece Karishma Rai, the daughter of his elder brother Bidhan Chandra Rai, on July 19 and is considering to field her against him from the Parsa assembly seat.In Bihar’s family political saga, one more scene-stealer appears to be on the cards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chandrika-rai-father-in-law-of-tej-pratap-all-set-to-join-jd-u/story-a31E5k5WhCGsa8KvZ9a9zI.html

08-08-2020||India||Indian, Chinese armies hold talks on Ladakh’s Depsang plains||Senior military commanders from India and China on Saturday met in the Daulat Beg Oldie sector and held talks on reducing tensions along the contested Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh, with focus on thinning the buildup of troops and weaponry in Depsang plains where the forward deployment of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army has disrupted the Indian Army’s patrolling patterns, people familiar with the developments said. Heightened concerns about Depsang come from an earlier intrusion in this sector in 2013, when the PLA set up positions 19 km into the Indian side of the LAC and triggered a face-off that took three weeks to resolve. The PLA’s forward deployments in Depsang have hindered the access of Indian soldiers to several patrolling routes including the ones leading to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11A 12 and 13, said one of the officials cited above. The military buildup in this sector includes deployment of tanks and artillery by the two armies, said a second official. The Depsang plains lie south of DBO in a strategic area that the military calls Sub-Sector North (SSN). DBO is the country’s northernmost outpost where India operates an advanced landing ground to support its forward military deployments. “Depsang is more of a pressure point as the PLA’s reported deployment in forward areas has disrupted the Indian Army’s patrolling pattern. It has become more time consuming for the army to dominate the LAC. But as long as talks are on there is hope for a mutually-acceptable solution to the dispute,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations. The latest round of military talks between division commander-ranked officers came days after their bosses (the corps commanders) met on August 2 to discuss the next stage of disengagement at a time when negotiations have hit a roadblock due to differences between the two sides in the Finger Area and the PLA’s reluctance to vacate positions held by it in what New Delhi claims as Indian territory. The outcome of Saturday’s talks wasn’t immediately known as there was no official word from the army. The division commander-ranked officers have met a few times after the border row erupted in early May, but this was their first meeting after the corps commanders from the two sides began discussions on disengagement and de-escalation on June 6. The latter have met five times so far. The Finger Area—a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range overlooking the Pangong Lake—has emerged as the hardest part of the disengagement process with little hope of immediate resolution. The August 2 military negotiations came three days after Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong said his country’s traditional boundary line on the northern bank of the Pangong Lake was in accordance with the LAC and there was no case of Beijing expanding its territorial claim. The ambassador’s contention was a clear indication of the Chinese hard line on its claims in the Finger Area, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-chinese-armies-hold-talks-on-ladakh-s-depsang-plains/story-SlnwijHCFvcbHm9JexLUnI.html
08-08-2020||India||‘Rhea Chakraborty’s plea to transfer case pointless’: Sushant Rajput’s father||The father of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput has told the Supreme Court that the petition filed by his son’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty seeking to transfer the police case from Patna to Mumbai has become unnecessary after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) took up the case.The statement came on a day when Mumbai police informed the Supreme Court, in a sealed cover, about the status of its probe into the actor’s death at his Bandra house on June 14.In his response affidavit filed ahead of the hearing of the case on Tuesday, Sushant’s father stated that even after 54 days of inquiry, the Mumbai police had not found any ground to register an FIR. “If the respondent No.3 (State of Maharashtra) has found no evidence qua the petitioner (Rhea) in 54 days of inquiry, it only reflects one conclusion that the Respondent No.3 is trying to shield the petitioner for reasons best known to them.”He informed the Court that prior to his son’s death, in two complaints dated February 19 and February 25, he informed the Mumbai police about an apprehension of threat to his son’s life on which no action was taken. The father further accused the Mumbai police of showing no urgency in conducting the inquest proceedings in order to find the culprits responsible for his son’s death.Pointing to the language employed in Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) relating to inquest, he said, “The Inquest proceeding under Section 174 CrPC refers to term such as ‘immediately’ and ‘forthwith’ which reflect the nature of urgency expressed by the legislature in preparing an inquest report by the police officer.” In the present case, Rhea was questioned four days after the incident. With his complaint now entrusted to the CBI, father of the late actor said, “the present transfer petition has become infructuous.” He said that Rhea will now have to file a fresh petition challenging the probe by CBI as the case no longer rests with Bihar police.He referred to Rhea’s tweets on social media platform where she had requested the Union home minister for a CBI enquiry into Sushant’s death.“Now since the Respondent No.1 (State of Bihar) has entrusted the FIR to the CBI and Union of India has accepted the said request, the Petitioner should not have any grievance in this regard,” the affidavit said.The affidavit further explained that CBI can proceed with the case even if Maharashtra was unwilling to give consent. It referred to a recent case decided by the Supreme Court in Kanwal Tanuj v State of Bihar (2020) to state, “no consent would be required from another state once consent is given from the state which had registered the FIR.” The late actor’s father even defended the registration of his FIR with Bihar police, claiming that “the consequence of a criminal breach of trust and criminal misappropriation” suffered by his son would impact him as he was the Class I legal heir of his unmarried son and the money (left by his son) was required to be “returned or accounted for” to him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rhea-chakraborty-s-plea-to-transfer-case-pointless-sushant-rajput-s-father/story-087dRd3pTo7H6e0lhIFd9I.html

Prompted by former congress president Rahul Gandhi’s reminder during his virtual meeting with party leaders on Thursday, AICC in-charge for Bihar, Shaktisinh Gohil, arrived in Patna on a two-day visit supposedly to begin the seat-sharing negotiation with RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and leaders of other allies. During his virtual meeting with senior Bihar leaders on July 4, Gandhi had told Gohil to wind up the seat-sharing deal with allies by the month-end, so that the party could focus on selected seats to bolster its electoral prospects. Talking to HT, Gohil had also said that the seat adjustments among the coalition partners would not be stretched. Immediately after his arrival from Delhi, Gohil went straight to meet senior party and CLP leader Sadanand Singh and former governor Nikhil Kumar to solicit their views before launching the crucial seat-sharing talks. “The in-charge has arrived and hopefully the deal would be finalized soon, as leaders of all parties want to settle it,” said Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha. Also Read: Bihar is going to change ‘disha and dasha’ of India: Rahul GandhiDuring the July 4 meeting with Gandhi, former BPCC chief Anil Sharma had floated a formula for seat-sharing, suggesting 101 seats contested by the JD(U) under Grand Alliance (GA) in 2015 could be split between the RJD and the Congress in 60/40 ratio for an honourable agreement.In the last assembly polls, the Congress had contested 41 seats and won 27, while the RJD had fielded 101 candidates and won 80 seats. “In case of distribution of seats, the RJD and the Congress should leave seats in ratio of 60:40 from their quota,” Sharma had pointed out. Party insiders, however, said that expecting a reasonable and respectable allocation of seats with the RJD’s bid to project Tejashwi Prasad Yadav as the alliance’s CM candidate, may be wishful thinking. The RJD wants to contest 150 seats out of total 243, leaving little scope for adjustments for allies. Seat-sharing deal in the Lok Sabha polls was also not encouraging for the Congress. Also Read: Govt gone missing: Rahul targets Centre as India crosses 2 mn Covid-19 casesThe RJD does not appear keen to resolve the seat adjustment issue without finalizing the leadership issue. RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari said, “Seat allocation and other issues would be resolved on time.” Citing previous electoral results since 2005 in Bihar, Sharma pointed out that the RJD has been a big loser when not contesting in alliance with the Congress.“Good sense will prevail on the RJD to be considerate in seat-sharing exercise, realising the importance of Congress on the basis of past elections,” Sharma said, while asking to urgently set up a coordination committee for GA issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reminded-by-rahul-gandhi-gohil-rushes-to-patna-for-seat-sharing-talks-with-rjd/story-gg80ujzCXCR6RUBPKWc6FI.html

08-08-2020||India||Day after Kozhikode air crash, stories of heartbreak and heroism||A day after the Air India Express plane crashed at the Kozhikode international airport, there were heartrending scenes of anxious families and relatives of passenger thronging hospitals for information about their kin.Some of the more desperate people were seen engaged in heated conversation with harried hospital workers who tried to ensure Covid-19 protocol that meant no crowding. An aged woman was crying in one corner of a private hospital. Her 32-year-old son survived the crash but she was told he received serious brain injury and was on ventilator.Among those who waited anxiously outside the Baby Memorial Hospital in Kozhikode was P Noufal. His sister Nafia and her five year-old daughter were there in the ill-fated flight. While his injured sister was brought to the Baby Memorial Hospital her daughter was not seen around. He made several rounds to many hospitals on Saturday and finally found his niece in a private hospital with her both legs bandaged. Seven-year-old twins Zain and Zamil were lucky. They had received minor injuries and were discharged from the hospital in the morning but fear was writ large on their faces.Mohamad Riyaz (25) was forced to come on leave by his parents to see a suitable bride for him. His body lies in a mortuary waiting for the Covid-19 test. The state government has made it clear that all bodies will have to undergo Covid-19 tests. Among the dead are five children below 10 years. There were four pregnant women on board and out of them one died and two are in hospital.“We were happy when we were about to land and I told my wife sitting beside me that rain was a welcome sign. But it was short-lived. Suddenly there were big jerks and loud cries. I tumbled out of my seat and lost consciousness. When I opened my eyes at the hospital I was happy to see my injured wife. A pregnant woman, who was sitting beside us, was not so lucky,” said a survivor.“We received 44 patients with four deaths including pilot Deepak Sathe and co-pilot Akhilesh Kumar. Initially there was some confusion but we managed it well later. Out of 44 patients seven are critical,” said Dr Azad Moopan, MD of Aster Health Care, a leading health chain in Kerala.Local people who were the first to reach the accident site won praise for their efforts, have been asked to go into quarantine. Survivors and officials alike vouched that they saved many of the trapped passengers.After one of the dead tested positive on Saturday, local rescuers have been asked to go into quarantine by state health minister K K Shailaja but praise poured in from many quarters. “The state will always remember their work but we have to take precautions also,” she said. Since it was an evacuation flight it carried many aged, children and pregnant women. “It was a miracle we limited the damage. Local people who were the first to reach the spot turned into real heroes. The entered the aircraft which was billowing smoke risking their lives to save many. We have one point to save maximum lives and they played a stellar role in it,” said Malappuram district collector K Gopalakrishnan who reached the spot in 30 minutes. ”It was raining heavily and we suddenly heard a deafening sound and aircraft came out of the boundary wall and fell on the road. We couldn’t believe it. Soon we heard cries for help. Smoke was billowing and there was a smell of fuel also. It was a heart-rending scene once we entered it with much difficulty,” said Mohamad Sahal one of the first to reach the spot. He said they took out at least two dozen people before the rescue team arrived. “Initially we did not wait for ambulances and evacuated many in private vehicles and taxis. We also helped police in controlling vehicles to make way for ambulances. The pilot was not dead when we retrieved him from a mangle of debris,” said P Afzal, another local resident. He did not identify the pilot. “I saw an old man crying for help and I tried to pull him out. But his limb came off, but still I took him out and carried him on my shoulders to the nearby vehicle,” said Abhilash, a college student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-kozhikode-air-crash-stories-of-heartbreak-and-heroism/story-wqSgmz0ssyhzeAJVIlFg0K.html
08-08-2020||India||Kerala landslide death count climbs to 27, more than 40 still missing||With 12 more bodies recovered from the mound of debris and slush on Saturday, the casualties in the landslide at a tea estate near Rajamala in Idukki district in Kerala went up to 27 even as rescue personnel, braving inclement weather, continued their search for 42 missing people.State power minister MM Mani, who is camping at the accident site, admitted that there is little hope for any survivors now. “The situation is really bleak,” he said. The massive landslide took place in the early hours of Friday after a portion of Pettimudi hills caved in razing a colony of tea plantation workers.The Idukki district administration said missing numbers are likely to go up as many students staying in hostels had returned to their shanties (layams) due to the Covid lockdown. Officials were depending on the employment registry of the Kannan Devan Hill Plantation (KDHP) Limited where they were on the roll, but social workers and local leaders said many like students and guests were out of the registry. “There is some confusion about the exact number of missing,” said Idukki collector H Dineshan.There are reports a former panchayat member of Munnar Ananda Siva and his 21 members of the extended family are among the missing. Hoping against the hope, relatives have crowded the area and were seen pleading with rescue officials to search particular points. Some of them broke down hysterically saying at least they should get bodies of the missing. Survivors said they are not happy to be saved as many of their relatives are among missing.“Rajamalai area was not landslide-prone. So we did not take much precautions here. In the 2018 and 2019 floods, the area was least affected. Power and communication lines were cut off in the last four days. This really aggravated the situation,” said district panchayat president Kochu Thresia, adding heavy rains that lashed the area disrupted rescue work several times.Some areas in Idukki received 220 mm rain, said the Met regional office. At least six teams of the National Disaster Response Force are carrying out the relief police and fire force personnel. Minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan who came to Kozhikode to meet the injured in the plane crash said he will be going to Idukki on Sunday as directed by the Prime Minister.The PM had announced an ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh each to the victims and the state government Rs five lakh. KDHP also announced a relief of Rs 2 lakh to the affected.Meanwhile, the weather department has issued a red alert in five districts: Idukki, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad and Kannur. All major rivers in the state are in a spate and dams swollen as torrential rains continue to pound many areas. Five more flood-related deaths were reported from other areas of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-landslide-death-count-climbs-to-27-more-than-40-still-missing/story-dkSxIs5ezauc3XiqB1grMN.html
08-08-2020||India||India-China can overcome differences with some kind of equilibrium, says Jaishankar on long-term ties||India and China can overcome their differences in the long-term if they reach “some kind of equilibrium” but achieving this is one of the big challenges faced by the country, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Saturday. Jaishankar made the remarks while participating in an interactive session organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) as part of its “India@75 Summit - Mission 2022” initiative. The event looks ahead at India in its 75th year of independence in 2022 and seeks to bring together stakeholders such as industry and government to work on a vision. Replying to a question on whether India and China, which are currently engaged in a tense border standoff, could be friends in the coming decades, Jaishankar said the two countries are neighbours and demographically unique as they are the only ones with populations of more than one billion. Also read | The PLA Aggressors: China’s eight top commanders who led Ladakh adventureChina is the world’s second largest economy and India is set to become the third largest, and the period of their difficulties and the period of their “re-emergence in a very strong way in international politics” were not far apart, he said. “We are seeing the parallel but differential rise of the two countries... To my mind, what it does is it puts a huge premium on reaching some kind of equilibrium or understanding between the two [in the interests of both countries]. How to do that is one of the big challenges that we face,” Jaishankar said. The border standoff, which emerged in the open in May, has taken India-China relations to a new low. Both countries have mobilised tens of thousands of troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), especially in Ladakh sector, after a brual clash on June 15 caused the death of 20 Indian soldiers and unspecified Chinese casualties. Efforts to disengage and de-escalate the tensions have run into problems as the Chinese side hasn’t pulled back its troops are several key friction points on the LAC, such as Pangong Lake and Depsang. Jaishankar said he believes the world “has a lot riding on” India and China reaching equilibrium, given the size and impact of both countries. “It is not an easy question to answer, there are problems [that are] well laid out. Certainly, it’s something which I feel is very central to our foreign policy calculations,” he said. Also read: India, China to hold senior military-level talks, disengagement at friction areas on agendaHe said a good foreign policy is one that addresses national and economic security and advances the country’s goals and aspirations in a competitive environment. Such a policy depends on skill and agility to build “capabilities strongly, deeply [and] much faster”, he added. In this regard, Jaishankar held up China as a “remarkable example of our lifetime” and pointed out that India too is doing its bit by weighing in on big issues such as climate change and shaping big debates on matters such as terrorism. Jaishankar also said India’s approach was based more on issues as the country is now dealing with a “much more loose architecture” with more poles and less rules, where overlapping interests are a key factor in working with other nations. “The country which is able to navigate best by finding overlapping interests and working with most countries is going to be very successful in diplomacy,” he said, adding that this would mean a country has to be less dogmatic and less dependent on global chains and global sources while striving for strategic autonomy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-can-overcome-differences-with-some-kind-of-equilibrium-says-jaishankar-on-long-term-ties/story-yrT9pHRvxasvoPxWalea8L.html

It also said that Rs 3 lakh would be provided to those people whose houses had been damaged by less than 50 per cent. Assistance of Rs 10,000 per family would be provided to people whose household goods have either been lost or damaged due to the rains.Heavy rain continued to batter the coastal Karnataka districts of Udupi, Mangalore, Uttara Kannada as well as some of the northern districts of the state. Several major rivers continued to be in spate. However, the situation was a little better in Kodagu which has borne the brunt of very heavy rainfall.With the weather improving a little, an NDRF team finally managed to extract the body of Swami Ananda Teertha the brother of the chief priest at the temple of Talacauvery. However, four more bodies including that of the chief priest Narayan Achar, his wife, and two assistants are still missing after landslides in the Brahmagiri hills swept away the house in which they lived. One more person died in Chikamagalur district today taking the total number of people who have died due to the heavy rains in the state to four with four more people still unaccounted for.A political controversy broke out over the proposed move by the state government to open more liquor outlets in rural areas of the state and also permit the online sale of liquor.Former CM and JDS leader H D Kumaraswamy hit out at the proposed move saying “After faltering in mopping up revenue the state government is mulling over allowing door delivery of liquor by enabling online sales besides starting new MSIL shops in rural areas. I demand that the state government drop its plans. The government should back out from taking such a foolish decision. Otherwise, agitation is inevitable,” he warned.Kumaraswamy said that the opening of new liquor shops in times of distress will spoil the society’s health. He also said that it is not fair for the government “to fill its coffers by robbing people’s money like this”.However, Deputy CM C N Ashwath Narayan accused opposition parties of playing politics even during floods and the Covid-19 pandemic. He said that they should play a constructive role. A senior government official, who did not want to be identified, as he is not authorized to speak to the media said, “The excise commissioner has only held consultations on opening more stores and allowing online sales of liquor. No final decision has been taken yet, in this regard, and therefore any further comment on this might be premature.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-govt-announces-aid-for-flood-hit-as-rain-continues-to-batter-coastal-areas/story-csa1EnVPjIZSHHPl2exAZI.html

Harendra Tyagi, a resident of Aswar village of Bhind district, was arrested on June 23 for allegedly beating a local shopkeeper and was booked under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 294 (using obscene language), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 329 (Voluntarily causing grievous hurt to extort property). Tyagi was arrested and taken into judicial custody on June 24, police said. Harendra Tyagi’s advocate Sushant Tiwari filed the bail application on the ground that Tyagi is aged 18 years and is a bright student.“Tyagi secured 75% marks in class 12 in 2019. Tyagi is preparing for Pre-Agriculture Test (PAT) to take admission in the agriculture college.The test has been postponed due to Covid-19 and will be organised in coming months, and if he was not granted bail, it would spoil his future. Looking at the challenging time of Covid-19 pandemic situation, his case was sympathetically considered. Even otherwise, he learnt the lesson hard way and would mend his way and would become a better citizen,” said Tiwari. Considering these facts, justice Anand Pathak granted him bail on Tuesday and also put a special condition of digital detoxification so that he could concentrate on his studies, says Kamlesh Kori, government lawyer presenting the police. In his order, the judge said, “Applicant shall remove himself from the WhatsApp and Facebook group and other Social Media groups for next two months and would not be present on any social media platform at all for two months for digital detoxification for personal reasons or for other reasons, otherwise bail shall be considered withdrawn. Every month the applicant shall have to submit a report about his digital detoxification at the concerned police station and any default shall dis-entitle him from benefit of bail.

This is Raje’s second meeting with a senior BJP functionary after she met party President JP Nadda yesterday following murmurs that she had been tacitly helping the Ashok Gehlot government survive the crisis in the state and was not in favour of any potential move to induct Sachin Pilot into the BJP.Raje has not addressed the allegations specifically but stated that she remained committed to party ideals as a loyal member while some people were trying to misinform without any factual basis.She is believed to have discussed the political situation in the state with Nadda with only a few days to go before the crucial assembly session beginning on August 14, which may end up deciding the fate of Gehlot government, surviving on a wafer thin support.Raje’s meeting with Nadda yesterday and Rajnath today will be watched keenly since she has largely maintained silence on the political machinations unfolding in the state in the aftermath of Pilot’s rebellion last month. She has also kept away from most BJP meetings in Jaipur since the crisis broke out. People familiar with the developments have suggested that Raje discussed the party’s options in Rajasthan in her meeting with Nadda and apprised him of her views.The fate of the Rajasthan Congress is also hinged on Rajasthan High Court’s verdict on the validity of last year’s announced merger of six BSP MLAs with the Congress party. Earlier today, Rajasthan speaker CP Joshi sought transfer of petitions challenging the merger from the Rajasthan High court to the Supreme Court.The single judge bench of the HC was expected to deliver the verdict in the case on August 11, three days before the assembly session begins.Another key battle within the political war for power in Rajasthan could be influenced by the outcome of the Sachin Pilot’s legal challenge to disqualification petition served on him and other 18 Congress MLAs in his support. The matter is pending before the Supreme Court.A sign of political activities in the state heating up for a final showdown was also seen in the BJP’s bid to herd its MLAs, especially those from tribal areas, fearing they may be poached by the Congress ahead of the assembly session which may see a floor test to determine the power sweepstake in the state. Some BJP MLAs have been sent to Gujarat.The Congress has 107 MLAs in the Assembly, 19 of them are in Haryana with party rebel Sachin Pilot and are unlikely to vote for the Gehlot government. Assembly Speaker CP Joshi and a bed-ridden MLA are among the remaining 88 MLAs including 75 MLAs from opposition parties, the BJP and the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party.Eighty-six Congress legislators, 10 Independents, 2 from BTP, one CPM and one RLD MLAs are supporting Ashok Gehlot government and are camping in two hotels in Jaisalmer. The 107 include six BSP MLAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-days-before-rajasthan-shodown-vasundhara-raje-meets-rajnath-singh/story-4m5e3BvgfAAMGCZKiM46tK.html
08-08-2020||India||J&K Police arrest 5 five alleged overground workers of LeT’s terror financing module||The special operations group (SOG) of the Jammu and Kashmir Police arrested five overground workers of the banned proscribed Lashkar-e-Taiba in Jammu as the probe into a terror financing module busted last month continued, inspector general of police of Jammu region, Mukesh Singh said Saturday. Singh did not say when the five men were arrested but it came in the run up to Independence Day celebrations. The arrested men have been identified as Tauqeer Ahmad Batt, Asif Batt, Khalid Latief Batt, Ghazi Iqbal and Tariq Hussain Mir. All of them hail from Doda.On July 19, a team of the SOG Jammu had apprehended one Mubashir Farooq Batt with consignment of 1.5 lakh of Indian rupees meant for hawala transaction. The money was concealed in a tiffin box. “During investigation of the case, SOG Jammu apprehended five more suspects involved in the module. They have admitted their involvement in the case,” said Singh. The IGP also said that all the six accused were in contact with their handler in Pakistan identified as Mohammad Amin Batt who also uses aliases of Haroon Khubaib. Amin is the son of Dawood Batt of Kathawa, Thathri in Doda. “He remained a district commander of the LeT in Doda and exfiltrated to Pakistan in 2007,” said the officer. “All of them were tasked to identify naïve and gullible youth for recruitment in terror ranks, providing logistics and strengthening LeT cadre in the region, sharing information about presence of security forces and their important locations to Pakistani handlers, transportation of arms and ammunition from one location to another and distributing money among the families of active and deceased terrorists,” he added. During questioning of all the six overground workers police found that they received an amount of Rs 12,19,704 through different means on different occasions as part of this module. During interrogation of a suspect identified as Mohammad Irfan Khan of Bijarni in Doda, it came to fore in early July that he along with two of his associates Ghazi Iqbal and Amir Batt had hoisted the Pakistani flag at Lal Draman in Doda. “They were tasked by their Pak handler Haroon to do so. It has been further corroborated by Ghazi Iqbal, who admitted that he had received a call from Haroon for hoisting the Pakistani flag and subsequently he purchased cloth from a local shop at Doda town and stitched that flag by himself,” said the officer. On August 5, on the disclosure of Tariq Hussain Mir, SOG Jammu recovered three more tiffin boxes from his house which contained Rs 40,700, which he had received as consignment on different occasions from Pakistani handlers as part of this module, said the IGP. “The involvement of four accused from Kashmir has also surfaced. Moreover, it has come to notice that the module has its links in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab as well,” he said. Further investigation into the case is underway to unearth terror financing channels and overground workers network used for providing financial support and motivating youth to join terror outfits in Jammu and Kashmir, Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-police-arrest-5-five-alleged-overground-workers-of-let-s-terror-financing-module/story-kMQx24KCIYceK6uzyBfUJM.html

08-08-2020||India||Six Rajasthan MLAs facing disqualification seek transfer of case to Supreme Court||Six MLAs from Rajasthan, who were elected to the assembly on Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) tickets and subsequently merged with the Congress party in 2019, moved the Supreme Court on Saturday seeking transfer to the apex court of a disqualification petition filed against them by BJP MLA, Madan Dilawar before the Rajasthan high court.The petitioners contended that they are seeking transfer of the case to the Supreme Court because the legal issues raised in the petition before the Rajasthan high court are already under the consideration of the top court in another case from Assam, Mr. Mithou Krose v. Imtilemba Sangtam.“Therefore, the present transfer petition is being moved so that there may be a uniform interpretation of the law,” the plea filed through advocate Amit Pai said.The Congress government in Rajasthan is resting on shaky foundations after former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot along with 18 MLAs were rumoured to be quitting the party after he came out in the open against chief minister Ashok Gehlot. Rajasthan assembly speaker, CP Joshi had initiated disqualification proceedings against them but the same was stayed by the high court on July 24. An appeal by the speaker against the high court order is pending before the Supreme Court.Pilot and other dissident MLAs have maintained that they never had the intention to leave the Congress party and were merely exercising their right to criticize the party leadership and the functioning of the chief minister.Meanwhile, Madan Dilawar had moved the Rajasthan high court on July 28 seeking disqualification of the six former BSP MLAS on the ground of defection under 10th schedule of the Constitution.The six MLAs, Lakhan Singh, Rajender Singh Guda, Deepchand, Joginder Singh Avana, Sandeep Kumar and Vajib Ali were elected to the Rajasthan assembly in December 2018 on BSP ticket. They later submitted a joint application to assembly speaker intimating the latter of their unanimous decision to merge with the Congress party on September 16, 2019. The request was approved by the speaker on September 18, 2019.This was challenged by Dilawar who filed a plea before speaker in March 2020 for disqualification of the six MLAs on the ground of defection. The 10th Schedule of the Constitution of India contains provisions relating to disqualification of lawmakers for defection. One of the grounds for disqualification as per paragraph 2 of the 10th schedule is voluntarily giving up membership of the political party on whose ticket the lawmaker was elected.The speaker had rejected Dilawar’s plea on July 22 after which he approached the high court challenging the speaker’s decision. The high court issued notice to the speaker on July 30.The petitioners submitted that as per paragraph 4 of the 10th schedule, when two-thirds of the members of a political party within the assembly merges with another political party in the assembly, then such members will be immune from disqualification. There is no requirement that the parent party, i.e. BSP merging with Congress at the national level so as to save the members of the party within the assembly from isqualification.“The entire basis for the petition (by Dilawar) pending before the high court is that there has been no merger between the BSP and the Congress. It is submitted that the speaker of the legislature, while acting under Paragraph 4, is not concerned with the happenings outside the legislature, so long as two-thirds of the legislature party (i.e. members of a party within the assembly) has accepted the merger,” the petition said. In the present case, the entire legislature party of the BSP merged with the legislature party of Congress, and therefore, the condition laid down in paragraph 4 is satisfied to not attract disqualification, the plea added.It was also pointed out that this issue was pending before the top court in the case of Mithou Krose. That case is an appeal against a 2015 judgment of the Gauhati high court which had taken the view that the only requirement under paragraph 4 is of the merger of the legislature party and there is no requirement of the merger of the parent political party. “There is an urgent need to clarify the law in respect to the scope of Paragraph 4 of the 10th schedule to ensure that there are no conflicting judgments,” the petitioners said seeking a transfer of the case to the apex court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-rajasthan-mlas-facing-disqualification-seek-transfer-of-case-to-supreme-court/story-kqr1TZ3FEMHQvaBEgpauMN.html
08-08-2020||India||Activist Rehana Fathima surrenders before police||Controversial activist Rehana Fathima surrendered before the police here on Saturday, a day after the Supreme Court dismissed her anticipatory bail plea in cases against her for circulating a video in which she was semi-nude, allowing her minor children to paint on her body. Police said Fathima presented herself before the South Police station under the Kochi Commissionerate this afternoon.Also read: No anticipatory bail, SC pulls up Kerala activist for ‘obscenity’ The activist will be produced before the magistrate court here after completing formalities of her arrest, they said. The allegation against Fathima, who made an attempt to enter the hill shrine of Lord Ayyappa in Sabarimala in 2018, is that she asked her children, a boy and girl aged 14 and 8 respectively to paint on her semi-nude body. The video was shot by her and uploaded on social media. After the video was found by the Cyber Dome of Kochi Police, a case was registered against the activist in June, for offences punishable under various sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act), Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. Dismissing the anticipatory bail petition of Fathima, the Supreme Court on Friday had said the court is a little baffled at the kind of case that has come up before it. The top court further observed as to what kind of impression the children will get about the culture of this country through such videos.Also read: Rehana says kids painted her body for sex education, court rejects argument, bail plea A bench of Justices Arun Mishra, B R Gavai and Krishna Murari said this kind of thing is unthinkable and would leave the society in a bad taste. She had moved the apex court after the Kerala High Court on July 24 dismissed her anticipatory bail plea, observing that it was not in a position to agree with the petitioner that she should teach sex education to her children in this manner. Earlier, the woman was also booked by the police in Pathanamthitta district under the Information Technology Act and the Juvenile Justice Act on a complaint lodged by BJP OBC Morcha leader A V Arun Prakash. The Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights had also directed the police to register a case against the woman under various sections of the POCSO Act. After the Supreme Court allowed women in traditionally barred age groups of 10-50 into the Sabarimala temple in September 2018, Fathima made an attempt to enter the shrine, but had to retreat following protests by Hindu activists and devotees. Fathima was sacked from employment by the state-run BSNL in May this year for her intentional act of outraging the religious feelings of devotees through social media posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activist-rehana-fathima-surrenders-before-police/story-pig4ZhR47RYq1YkPkbpU4J.html

The CM has also directed the officials to create posts for village development officer (VDO) and block development officer (BDO) for the 1,456 and 57 new gram panchayats and panchayat samitis, respectively. Sacked deputy CM Sachin Pilot, who is engaged in a bitter power tussle with CM Gehlot and enjoys the backing of 18 rebel Congress lawmakers, was handling the rural development ministry. Gehlot has approved 6,310 new hires in the health department and 988 and 326 in animal husbandry and police, respectively. The CM has cleared the proposal for the recruitment of 6,310 community health officers (CHOs) on a contractual basis at districts and block levels. Under the Ayushman Bharat Abhiyan, all health care institutions up to the level of sub-centre in the state will be made operational as health and wellness centres by 2022. Gehlot approved the creation of 400 new posts, including 200 each for livestock assistants and Jaldhari, at the new veterinary sub-centres to be opened in 2020-21. A livestock assistant and Jaldhari will be posted at each veterinary sub-centre.

The posts are approved for Rajasthan Armed Constabulary (RAC) battalions, newly constituted Mewad Bhil core Banswara, Maharana Pratap RAC India Reserve Battalion, 14th battalion of RAC and district police Bhiwadi. Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the main opposition in the state, has taken credit for CM Gehlot’s announcement for new job openings across government departments. BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said his party has been raising the recruitment issue for long. “These posts should have been approved a year ago. But the state government is doing it, when its own fate hangs in balance. Employment could have been provided on time,” he alleged. Political analyst Narayan Bareth said the Gehlot government is working towards a plan. “Initially, it was working on the right to healthcare and followed by Covid-19 management. Now, it is looking to provide employment, as part of its poll manifesto that it is trying to fulfil,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cm-gehlot-approves-recruitment-proposal-for-over-7-000-government-posts/story-rlznc9og55i3w6cxtMHnuN.html
08-08-2020||India||CAT seeks response from Centre, U’khand on whistleblower’s plea for deputation in Lokpal||The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) Allahabad Division Bench has sought responses from Centre and the Uttarakhand government within six weeks on Indian Forest Services (IFS) officer Sanjiv Chaturvedi’s application that a decision be taken on his request to seek deputation in the national anti-corruption body Lokpal’s investigation wing. The order was issued on August 4, but a copy of the order was made available on Saturday. HT has a copy of the order and other related documents. In November last year, Chaturvedi, a 2002 batch IFS officer, who is currently Chief Conservator of Forests in Uttarakhand, had written a letter to Lokpal seeking deputation to serve in its investigation wing. The state government gave its no-objection certificate to Centre government regarding his deputation plea on December 23 last year, leaving it for Centre to take the final decision. Responding to the NOC, the Union ministry of environment and forests wrote to the state government on February 4 that “the notification of vacancy in Lokpal, relevant to subject matter, maybe furnished to this ministry to further process the request of Sanjeev Chaturvedi, IFS, at the earliest” Following the development, Chaturvedi filed an application in CAT Allahabad bench, whose circuit bench sits in Nainital for a week every month in normal times. During the epidemic, the circuit bench of CAT could not sit in Nainital and this case was heard through video conferencing. Chaturvedi in his plea had sought relief from CAT to summon the records of the case and issue directions to Centre to pass appropriate orders on his deputation plea in Lokpal “with positive recommendation in view of fulfilment of all the statutory requirements under IFS Cadre Rules, 1966, on grounds of equity.. in accordance with the objectives of the establishment of the institution of Lokpal.. in public interest” and not to reject his deputation plea on “any ulterior/subjective/oblique consideration.” In his application, Chaturvedi stated that “there may be attempts on the part of Respondent No.1 (Centre), to get the said NOC withdrawn so as to pre-empt the case of applicant…which if allowed would result in irreparable loss to applicant..” The IFS officer, while seeking interim relief, stated in his application that Centre and Uttarakhand government be directed to maintain status quo, in respect of NOC/recommendation granted by the state government in its December 23, 2019 letter till the disposal of the case (in CAT). Hearing the matter on August 4 through video conferencing, the Allahabad bench of CAT ordered “Let counter reply on behalf of both the respondents (Centre and Uttarakhand govt) be filed within six weeks. Applicant (Chaturvedi) is directed to file his rejoinder within two weeks thereafter. Both the counsels are also directed to file their objection separately on the request of interim relief within three weeks. The matter has been listed for next hearing on August 27. Chaturvedi served as Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO) of AIIMS, Delhi (June 2012 to June 2016), where he came into the spotlight for his fight against corruption and investigating over 200 cases of graft. In 2015, he was awarded Ramon Magsaysay Award for his fight against corruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cat-seeks-response-from-centre-u-khand-on-whistleblower-s-plea-for-deputation-in-lokpal/story-6TooZLhGFC7cg15J9T72fK.html

Mahatma Gandhi not only saw it but also made it possible through a campaign to connect the masses with the freedom struggle,” PM said, stressing on the importance of cleanliness in empowering masses.The centre has been launched as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and to mark the country’s progress in achieving sanitation and mitigating squalid living through the Swachh Bharat Mission and to serve as an inspiration for its adoption by masses including the new generation.“Around 60 crore Indians were connected with cleanliness living in 60 months due to the drive. The drive has given poor and the downtrodden dignity and confidence while giving them conditions for a healthy life,” PM Modi told the children.He also outlined the importance of hygienic living in battling the coronavirus pandemic.“We have to step out and carry out our business and still safeguard ourselves from Corona. For this we have to wear masks, maintain 6ft distance and avoid spitting in the open,” said the PM.Earlier, he took a round of the new facility and watched an audio visual presentation highlighting its features.

Santosh Trivedi, the priest protesting since June 12 sits outside the temple bare chested and meditates as a sign of dissent, demanding the dissolution of the Board.The priests’ community in the state has been demanding the dissolution of Devasthanam Board and withdrawal of the Kedarnath master plan. Brijesh Sati, spokesperson for Devbhoomi Tirtha Purohit Haqhakudhari Mahapanchayat, a priests’ body in the state said that Trivedi has informed all other priests that he will find an auspicious time for bhoomi Samadhi at Kedarnath. “Upset with the state government’s response towards his protests, with no call for an amicable conversation Acharya Trivedi has decided to take bhoomi samadhi near Shankaracharya’s Samadhi at Kedarnath shrine. He will consult with priests of all the four shrines and find an auspicious time before the bhoomi samadhi,” said Sati. Vinod Shukla, president of Kedarnath Tirtha Purohit Mahasabha, said, “First the government constituted the Devasthanam Board without the consent of the priests and after that, under the Master Plan, efforts are being made to take over the property of Kedarnath’s priests’ under its control. We will continue to strongly oppose this move.” Officials from the Char Dham Devasthanam Board, could not be reached for a comment. On July 21, the Uttarakhand high court dismissed the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Rajya Sabha member Subramanian Swamy against the state government’s takeover of the Char Dhams and 51 other shrines through the formation of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board. The court ruled that the ownership of the temple properties would vest in Char Dham shrines and power of the Board would be confined only to the administration and management of the properties. Last December, the Uttarakhand assembly had passed the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Bill. In January, Uttarakhand Governor Baby Rani Maurya gave her assent for the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, 2019. Aggrieved priests had threatened that they would move the HC against the Act, as they claimed to have been kept in the dark about the new law.

The IMA thus requests the government of India to provide adequate attention for the safety and welfare of doctors during the pandemic,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, National President, IMA Dr R V Asokan, Secretary General, IMA, said the mortality rate among doctors due to Covid-19 has reached an “alarming proposition” now. “Saving each and every life of a doctor will ensure safety of thousands of patients who depend on their care. Doctors who have died in line of their professional duty merit favourable consideration for succour and solace to their families. It is thus pertinent for the IMA to also draw your attention to the demoralising effect to our healthcare community,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ima-says-nearly-200-doctors-in-india-have-succumbed-to-covid-19-requests-pm-s-attention/story-1K3dadvNuDUvgQYX7zSEhM.html

The initiative is an interactive experience centre on Swachh Bharat Mission established in Delhi to showcase various aspect of the flagship social change drive undertaken by the NDA government in its first term between 2014 and 2019.“I am happy to see that you are interested in issues of cleanliness,” he told a group of 36 school kids, who were picked to represent the 36 states and Union Territories of the Indian federal state.“We have to step out and carry out our business and still safeguard ourselves from Corona. For this we have to wear masks, maintain 6 ft distance and avoid spitting in the open,” PM Modi told the children.Earlier, the PM watched a short video on ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’ at the Rashtriya Swachhta Kendra. He also went through a 360 degree audio-visual show, which narrates the sanitation journey in a story form.The 11 zones at the centre represent the 5 year journey of the Swachh Bharat Mission from 2014 to 2019 depicting the behavioral change brought up in 6 lakh villages for giving up open defecation practice. This is often described as the largest behaviour change campaign in the history of the world.The first zone at the centre contains Mahatma Gandhi’s thoughts on sanitation and cleanliness, captured through hologram technology and audio visuals.Second zone presents the sanitation related problems that existed before the drive began including open defecation and safety and hygiene risks posed to women, elderly and children of the family who were forced to relieve themselves in the open.Fourth zone displays the process to be followed to achieve complete sanitation and the fifth zone displays various milestones, launches, campaigns and other information of the drive broken up into years.Sixth zone lists contributions of the women folk including women sarpanches, Aasha workers in making the drive successful through awareness drives.Another zone is dedicated to Swachhta Champions—listing inspirational stories of such personalities who have made remarkable and defining contributions in the field.The Rashtriya Swachhata Kendra is a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lessons-from-swachhta-mission-important-in-fighting-coronavirus-says-pm-narendra-modi/story-hWGprrjJBxxDMtl8noL9vO.html
08-08-2020||India||45% of central funds for rural jobs, subsidised food spent till July due to Covid-19 crisis||Almost half of the central funds meant for rural employment guarantee scheme and subsidised ration – the two central schemes that have helped to deal with the economic distress due to Covid-19 - have already been spent in the first four months of financial year 2020-21, government data shows.While the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA) enabled 90 million households to get work between April and July 2020, subsidised ration under National Food Security Act (NFSA), also called public distribution system (PDS), was provided to an average 720 million people every month during this period. According to the central government data, till July 2020, around 45% of Rs 1,01,500 crore for NREGA and 44% of 1,15,569 NFSA funds for the current financial year has already been allocated to the states.The data also pointed out that the demand in these two schemes came down in the month of July after peaking in June, indicating that who had left for villages may be migrating back to cities or moving elsewhere looking for work, as industrial activity has started in and around urban centres.Under MGNREGA, 24.2 million households were provided work in July as compared to 38.9 million in June (highest ever under the scheme for a month) and 33.1 million in May. “The employment in July was less because migrant workers returned to cities and labourers got engaged in sowing work that started in July after a good spell of rains,” said Nikhil Dey, former member of NREGA’s Central Advisory Council, and an activist working in rural areas of Rajasthan. This year, employment provided under the scheme, which guarantees 100 days of work in a year, is almost 50% more than in 2019 and 2018, he said. Also, the number of people provided 100 days of employment during the period is almost three times of the number in 2019. Himanshu, associate professor in department of labour studies in Jawaharlal Nehru University, who uses only his first name, said NREGA has provided social security to rural poor, for which, it was envisaged, and this is amply clear from the data. “Covid-19 has shown that wages under NREGA has to be realistic as they are very low as compared to minimum wages notified by the state governments,” he said. Similarly, the disbursement of subsidised ration peaked in the month of June with 94% of the 800 million identified beneficiaries under NFSA getting food grains. In July, the disbursement came down to 91%, which was about seven percentage points less than the number in June and July of 2019. In terms of food grain disbursed, 28 lakh tonnes of rice and 21 million tonnes of wheat was given to the needy in June, which went down to 24.41 lakh tonnes of rice and 19.91 lakh tonnes of wheat in July. Still, this is about 20% more food grains given to the beneficiaries as compared to June and July 2019, the official data showed. However, employment generated under NREGA and ration disbursed under NFSA in July was still higher than the pre-lockdown that started on March 24, 2020. The officials expect the off-take to remain high in these two schemes and other rural development programmes till the end of this year. Financial crunch The NREGA funds are given to states to pay wages to workers and buy raw material for asset creation. The money, in the form of food subsidy, is given to the Food Corporation of India for supplying grains from its stocks to different states for PDS. “We are left with very less money under NREGA for the current financial year,” said a rural development ministry official, while briefing the Parliamentary standing committee on labour on Friday. At this pace, the official said, the NREGA funds would be exhausted by early December. He, however, added that as NREGA is a demand driven scheme, the Central government has to pay to the states and the finance ministry has assured that there would be no shortage of funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/45-of-central-funds-for-rural-jobs-subsidised-food-spent-till-july-due-to-covid-19-crisis/story-7Lyj8edgn1RuEabBTgBDZJ.html

The snake was rescued from Bindukhatta area of Nainital from a local resident’s house where it was hiding. According to forest officials, the rare snake was first spotted in Lakhimpur Kheri area of Uttar Pradesh in 1936 from where it got its scientific name ‘Oligodon kheriensis’. The suffix ‘kukri’ in its name comes from the kukri or curved knife of Gorkhas as its teeth are curved like the blade of the kukri. Nitish Mani Tripathi, divisional forest officer (DFO) Terai East said, “Goula forest range team got a call for rescue of a snake on Friday morning from Kavindra Koranga, a resident of Kurriya Khatta village in Bindukhatta area of Nainital district”. “When we went there to rescue the snake, villagers had caught the snake and kept it a plastic sack” he said. Tripathi said after rescuing the snake from the spot, the team was surprised. “It was the rare of rarest snakes - Red Cora Kukri snake. The team rescued it and released it in the forest.” Vipul Mourya, wildlife expert from Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII) said Red Coral Kukri is a very rare snake and has been spotted only twice so far in Uttarakhand. “It was reported in 2015 in the Surai forest range of Terai East forest division. Earlier in 2014, this snake was reported in Surai forest range near Uttar Pradesh border but then it was found dead,” he said. Red Coral Kukri snake is listed in schedule 4 of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972. It is found in red and bright orange colours. This non-venomous snake is nocturnal and feeds on earthworms, insects and larvae.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-forest-officials-rescue-very-rare-red-coral-kukri-snake/story-a1JAjzNNeA3IYNdpb6GqVK.html

In Dakshina Kannada, heavy rains have submerged several areas in Bantwala and Belthangady, among others, with the Netravati river overflowing and also water being released from nearby dams. Officials said incessant rains in Cauvery river catchment areas have led to increased inflow in the Krishna Raja Sagara dam in Mandya district. Water is being released from it and people living in low lying areas have been warned, they said. There is also a flood like situation in Najanagudu and nearby areas of Mysuru as the swollen Kapila river has inundated roads connecting Ooty in neighbouring Tamil Nadu, with water being released from Kabini dam. There has been some respite from heavy rains in certain parts of Kodagu, which has been ravaged by floods and landslides. However several areas of the district continue to be in deluge with the Cauvery and Lakshmana Tirtha rivers overflowing due to rains in the hilly areas. There are also reports of landslides in some parts of the district.

There are also reports of landslides at a few places in Charmadi ghat region of Chikkamagaluru and the road connecting to Dakshina Kannada has been closed temporarily. Though Belagavi district has had some respite from the heavy rains, flood like situation continues to persist as the Krishna river and its tributaries are swollen due to continued inflows because of rains in neighbouring Maharashtra. Some areas and roads in the district’s Chikkodi and Nippani are inundated, the sources said. Inflow has also increased to the Tungabhadra dam in Hosapete of Ballari district due to rains in the catchment areas of Shivamogga and Chikkamagaluru. Authorities have alerted people living in low lying areas about opening dam gates to release water anytime with rising inflow. There is a similar flood like situation in parts of Yadgir, Raichur and Bagalkote districts with water being released from various dams.The state government has released Rs 50 crore for emergency relief and has announced Rs 10,000 as immediate relief each to affected families.

08-08-2020||India||Civil aviation expert’s 2011 warning about ‘unsafe’ KIA runway fell on DGCA’s deaf ears||Civil aviation expert Captain Mohan Ranganathan believes that the pilot of Air India Express Boeing 737 — a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) evacuation flight from Dubai — should have diverted to Coimbatore, as the conditions in Kozhikode International Airport (KIA), Kerala, were not conducive for a landing because of a downpour and had also warned the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) authorities in 2011 that the runaway is unsafe and needed to be reevaluated, especially in wet conditions. “The visibility was fine,” said Captain Ranganathan. “However, it was not prudent to land at the KIA because of the downpour,” he added. WATCH | The 2 other ‘dangerous airfields’ in India: Capt Ranganathan on Kerala crashCaptain Ranganthan, an aviation safety consultant and a former instructor pilot of the Boeing-737 specialising in wet runway operations, said he was surprised that the DGCA authorities gave permission to the flight to land at the KIA. “The KIA runway is not safe,” said Captain Ranganathan. “Not much has changed since I was there last. Fortunately, a Boeing-737 was landing and not a wide-body aircraft,” he said. Earlier, he had warned the DGCA authorities in 2011 that the KIA runway was unsafe for landing and needed to be reevaluated. “It is a dangerous situation, especially in wet conditions. KIA runway 10 approaches should not be permitted in view of the lack of RESA (runway end safety areas) and the terrain beyond the end of the runway,” Captain Ranganathan had said in his report. He had suggested that a 240-metre (m) RESA should immediately be introduced and the runway length should be reduced to make flight operations safe. “There should 150 m on either side to avoid aviation disasters,” Captain Ranganathan told HT. “But there is not sufficient area there. It has always been dangerous,” he added. He had cautioned DGCA authorities after Air India Express Flight 812 from Dubai had crashed in Mangaluru on May 22, 2010, killing 158 people on board. The KIA has a tabletop runaway similar to that of Mangaluru International Airport (MIA). The flight with 190 passengers on board overshot the KIA tabletop runway and dropped about 35 feet into a gorge on Friday evening. Officials had said 18 people, including the pilot Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe and the co-pilot, have died in the accident and over 140 more are injured, some of them seriously.

I am grateful for Bebu in my life. I am grateful for sir in my life. I am grateful for ma’am in my life. I am grateful for Fudge in my life. I am grateful for all the love in my life,” read the note released by Chakraborty.Explaining the names in the Sushant’s note, Chakraborty left a message, saying, “And this is his handwriting Lillu is Showik, Bebu is me, sir is my dad, ma’am is my mom, Fudge is his dog.” However, it wasn’t clear when the note was written or how she found it. “The only property of Sushant that I possess,” said Chakraborty posting the image of a water bottle which she claims is of the late actor.The ED questioned actor Rhea Chakraborty for over eight hours on Friday.The agency, which investigates money laundering and foreign exchange violations, questioned Chakraborty’s brother, Showik, and her business manager, Shruti Modi, who also worked for Rajput.Their statements were recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).Requesting anonymity, ED officials privy to the details said the agency was looking into Chakraborty’s income tax returns and investments. The officials said Chakraborty responded to most of the questions. ED is expected to focus on Chakraborty’s income, business deals and professional deals.The ED filed a case on July 31 on the basis of a first information report (FIR) by the Bihar Police. The FIR was registered following a complaint by Rajput’s father KK Singh who accused Chakraborty and her family of abetting the Bollywood actor’s suicide and siphoning of his money. He also alleged that his son’s credit cards were with Chakraborty. In addition to the ED, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), too, has launched a probe on the request of Bihar and has named Chakraborty, her brother and four other family members apart from unknown persons as accused. Chakraborty initially refused to appear before the agency, citing her appeal pending before the Supreme Court. She has requested that the FIR filed in Patna be transferred to Mumbai, arguing that Bihar Police have no jurisdiction. Bihar rejected the claim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-property-of-sushant-i-have-rhea-chakraborty-after-ed-questioning/story-nHR1Q79J5JrpsnrhLt5B5J.html

The incident took place around 2 pm at Venus Chowk, following which firefighters from the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) rushed to the spot. Of those injured, three have sustained severe injuries while others have suffered minor injuries. The injured have been taken to the hospital. The person who died in the accident is identified as Pappu Gupta, 34, and ran the snack centre, the civic body claimed. As per the UMC’s primary investigation, the blast caused a major fire inside the shop which resulted in the charring of all properties inside the shop. “One person has died in the incident who was inside the shop while twelve others who were around and reached to help also suffered injuries. Primarily, we suspect that the blast in the cylinders led to fire. Our team is at the spot and investigating the case,” said Yuvraj Badhane, public relations officer, UMC. Ulhasnagar Shopkeepers Association president Jagdish Tejwani said, ”As soon as I learned about the incident I rushed to the spot. One person has died in the incident while others who are severely injured were taken to the hospital. The fire also affected the nearby fruit shop. As per my observation, there were three cooking cylinders inside the shops without any fire safety norms.” He added, “According to the locals, the person who died in the accident slipped and a vessel containing hot oil fell over him which caused him severe burns.”A fire officer from the UMC, who did not wish to be named said, ”We have managed to cool down the blaze and bring it under control. We are investigating the cause of the blast and the fire.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fire-at-snack-centre-in-ulhasnagar-kills-one-five-injured/story-DjUFtzFNBXeUvagqjr0YNL.html
08-08-2020||India||Kozhikode mishap has striking parallel with 2010 Mangaluru crash||Friday night’s plane crash at Kozhikode international airport has striking similarities with the mishap at Mangaluru airport ten years ago when an Air India Express flight from Dubai carrying 166 passengers overshot the runway before bursting into flames, aviation experts say. Eight persons survived the crash. Both mishaps occurred during landing at tabletop airports in rainy conditions. Captain of the aircraft that crashed in Mangaluru, Z Glucia was an experienced pilot like Deepak V Sathe (59) who was in command of the aircraft in Kozhikkode. An inquiry into Mangaluru crash later found that pilots misjudged the length of the runway which resulted in the aircraft overshooting the air strip. In both cases, the pilot and co-pilot were among victims. “There are many similarities between two mishaps. Both airports have similar structure and in both cases it happened during landing. But in the latest case whether pilots were trying to save the lives of passengers can be ascertained only after an inquiry,” said aviation expert Jacob Philip. There are reports that Captain Sathe made three rounds to empty the fuel which prevented the plane from catching fire. A crew member of Capt Sathe’s aircraft later told airport authorities that the flight did not try to land some time due to poor visibility and they tried the touchdown only after visibility improved. She also said the flight landed almost safely but it went out of control on the runway and suddenly veered off the strip and crashed against the compound wall before plunging into a 35-feet road below the airstrip. The final conversation between the air traffic control(ATC) and pilot prior to the landing also showed no signs of any distress. Experts said a tabletop airport often creates an optical illusion, especially when the vision is affected by heavy rains. Airport officials said visibility was 2000 metres when the aircraft landed at the airport but it was raining heavily. Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri who visited the accident site on Saturday said it is too early to compare the latest mishap with the Mangaluru crash. “Tabletop airports are everywhere. It is true they pose some challenges to pilots. We have learnt enough lessons from Mangaluru mishap and it is too early to compare the latest with it,” he said in Kozhikode. Tabletop airports are usually located at the top of a hill or high plateau surrounded by gorges Former Director General of Civil Aviation Bharat Bhushan told a news channel that he had warned several times about the short runway of the airport for the wide-bodied aircraft and during his tenure he tried his best to widen the airport runway but due to many pulls and pressure it failed to materialize. He said the spot where the plane crashed was included in the project for development. In initial plan for Kozhikode airport, which was opened in 1988, runway was 2860 m but later it was later reduced to 2700 m due to paucity of land. It has the shortest runway among the four airports in the state. The aircraft which crashed Friday night had flown to the UAE four times this week itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kozhikode-mishap-has-striking-parallel-with-2010-mangaluru-crash/story-2lc709jV8ohEqZ9naDBDuN.html

He had fed many people stranded without a job in the Arab country. Pilassery told his relatives and friends in India that he will be coming in the last along with his family, just that it turned out to be his last journey.Pilassery was among the 19 who got killed in Friday’s airplane crash in Kozhikode, however, his wife Ameena and daughter Fathima, escaped with injuries.

08-08-2020||India||Runway issue at Kozhikode airport was resolved, says AAI chairman||Airport Authority of India chairman Arvind Singh said Saturday that issues with the runway at the Kozhikode airport where an Air India Express flight crashed Friday evening had been resolved.“Directorate General of Civil Aviation had some issues with the runway in 2015, but after resolving those issues, clearance was given to it in 2019. The jumbo jets of Air India also used to land there,” ANI quoted Singh as saying.He also said that the aircraft could not land on the designated runway. “The aircraft could not land at a runway on which it had to, then landing was tried on another runway where the mishap happened. We are monitoring situation and the airport will become operational soon. An alternative facility in Nagpur is also under progress,” he said.At least 18 people, including the pilot and the co-pilot, were killed when the aircraft with 190 people on board overshot the runway amid heavy rain at Kozhikode airport and fell into a valley and split into two. The flight was bringing Indians stranded in Dubai amid Covid-19 pandemic under the government’s Vande Bharat Mission.A probe 10 years ago after a similar crash at Mangalore airport, had pointed out the dangers of tabletop runways. India has three tabletop airports from where scheduled flights operate. These are Mangalore, Kozhikode and Lengpui (Mizoram). The probe report said that because of the undulating terrain and constraints of space, these airfields require extra skill and caution while carrying out flight operations. “The hazard of undershooting and overshooting, in particular, can lead to grave situations, as was the case in this (Mangaolre) accident. These table-top runways also have a problem of access roads around the airfield, which may need to be used in case of aircraft accidents,” it added.Friday’s crash at Kozhikode has an eerie similarity to the Mangalore accident on 22 May 2010 when a Boeing 737-800 Air India Express Flight from Dubai crashed on landing at Mangalore amid rain. The aircraft had overshot the runway and fell a hillside and burst into flames killing 158 of the 166 people on board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/runway-issue-at-kozhikode-airport-was-resolved-says-aai-chairman/story-SnK7bTaqvOLNz60d70NCNI.html

He added that the accused in the PMC Bank fraud case was not able to ascertain his health condition or the treatment provided to him.Additional public prosecutor Prajakta Shinde, however, submitted that the petitioner only required an endoscopy, which can be done at King Edward Memorial Hospital at Parel. She also pointed out that all other parameters of the HDIL promoter were in order and thus he was not required to be shifted to any private hospital for treatment.Advocate Hiten Venegaonkar, who appeared for the Enforcement Directorate, pointed out that Wadhawan has filed a plea for the same relief before the sessions court and it has not been decided yet.In view of this, the bench directed the sessions court to decide the plea on or before August 19 after hearing both the sides. HC also granted liberty to the prosecution to produce his latest medical reports for consideration of the sessions court.On September 30, 2019, the economic offences wing of the Mumbai Police registered an offence in connection with the purported fraud at PMC Bank, a multi-state cooperative bank having 137 branches in six states.According to the Reserve Bank of India, the PMC bank had masked 44 problematic loan accounts involving advances to the tune of Rs. 7,457.49 crore, most of which went to the HDIL, by tampering with its core banking system to ensure the loan accounts did not reflect in the regular bank record and were not visible to auditors.The bank had created 21,049 fictitious accounts to ensure its master data matched with the loan disbursals of Rs. 7,457.49 crore, the RBI had stated in an affidavit filed in the High Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-asks-jail-authorities-to-provide-hdil-promoter-rakesh-wadhawan-with-his-medical-record/story-FCT99XMyCDt3TkKZnsjmBN.html

During the interview, Ranganathan, who is a member of a safety advisory committee constituted by the civil aviation ministry, said he had submitted a report around nine years ago, warning that the Calicut (now Kozhikode) airport was not safe for landings.“The warnings were ignored... in my opinion, it is not an accident but a murder.

There’s no escape for an aircraft if it overruns,” he explained. “You will find another major accident either in Patna or Jammu airport.

Some of the crew are accepting even VOR approach on Runway 10. The reason is the lower minima than Runway 28.

08-08-2020||India||Kozhikode’s tabletop runway risky for landing, officials warned 10 years ago||The tragic accident in Kerala last evening when a plane attempting to land amid heavy tailwinds and rain on the table-top runway at the Kozhikode airport has once again shone light on the safety concerns over flight operations at such runways in the country. Eighteen people, including two pilots, were killed in the accident. The safety concerns were first raised following the 2010 Air India Express crash in Mangalore that killed 160 people on board. A court of enquiry report by a former Indian Air Force chief had warned of the hazards of overshooting the paved surface during take-off.ALSO WATCH | Kerala plane crash ‘murder, not accident’: Expert who flagged safety issuesThe Air India Express flight crash on Friday brings back the memories of the 2010 air crash that too occurred after the plane overshot the runway at the table-top airport in Mangalore.The report by Air marshal BN Gokhale had noted tabletop airports require extra skill and caution while carrying out flight operations. The hazard of ‘undershooting’ and ‘overshooting’, in particular, can lead to grave situations, as was the case in the Mangalore accident.The so-called tabletop airport has limited space at the ends of the runway, and several international airlines had stopped flying bigger aircraft into Kozhikode due to safety issues over the length of the runway.“While the length of the runway 24/06 is adequate for operations by aircraft such as Airbus A320 and Boeing 737-800, the downward slope at end of R/W 24 leading into hill slope is not recommended if one is to consider the hazards of overshooting the paved surface during takeoff or landing. There is a concrete structure at the end of R/W 24, which cannot be classified as obstruction as per ICAO Annexure-14, since it is below the approach and take off funnel,” the report had said.“There are three tabletop airports in India from where scheduled flights operate. These are Mangalore, Kozhikode and Lengpui. Because of the undulating terrain and constraints of space, these airfields require extra skill and caution while carrying out flight operations. The hazard of undershooting and overshooting, in particular, can lead to grave situations, as was the case in this accident. These table-top runways also have a problem of access roads around the airfield, which may need to be used in case of aircraft accidents,” it added.The narrow and winding roads can delay and hinder the rescue operations, the report had said. The Air India Express flight with 190 on board overshot and fell 50 metres off the end of the runway at the Kozhikode airport in treacherous conditions on Friday, breaking into two - making it one of the deadliest commercial aviation disasters in the country in nearly 10 years.The crash occurred around 7.40pm, when it was raining. It bears eerie similarity to the 2010 Mangalore airport crash when a plane, also an Air India Express Boeing 737, overshot a table-top runway and crashed nose-first into the ground. Aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said it was raining heavily when pilots of the Boeing 737 plane from Dubai tried to land. The regulator said after landing at Runway 10, the plane continued running till the end of the runway and fell into the valley and broke into two portions. “The visibility was 2,000 meters amid heavy rain, after landing at runway 10 and it overshot the runway and broke down in two pieces,” a DGCA official said.According to a playback on flight-tracking website FlightRadar24, the plane circled the airport twice before attempting to land. In its second instance, it aborted the attempt with 2,000 feet to go before the crash landing. The civil aviation ministry’s accident investigation division Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) will conduct a detailed investigation into the Air India Express flight crash at Kozhikode airport in Kerala. “An Air India Express flight took off around 0200 hours from Delhi to Kozhikode carrying investigating officers from DGCA and AAIB, CEO of Air India express and other officials of AI and AIE,” said AAIB.“A second aircraft took off from Mumbai to Kozhikode around 0600hrs in the morning carrying Angels of Air India and GO employees who will coordinate and liaise with various agencies and provide support and assist families of those affected in this incident,” the national transporter had said in a statement. The recovery of Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) and the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) will help piece together what happened during the last moments of the flight. Both have since been recovered, said aviation minister Hardeep Puri this morning. According to Robert A Clifford, lead counsel in the case against Boeing for the last major Boeing crash -- the 737 Max 8 crash in Ethiopia on March 10, 2019 -- and senior partner of Clifford Law Offices, Chicago, the investigation into what caused today’s Air India crash will likely focus on the plane itself and pilot error. “Early indications point to pilot error. The weather being involved probably speaks to pilot flight error, but the aircraft’s safety systems could have played a role. Investigators will need to evaluate the flight data recorder, cockpit voice recorder, and other devices, along with expert evaluation, to determine what happened,” he said. The 2010 report had cautioned of operations at such ‘critical airfields’.The DGCA has classified certain airfields as critical which need special qualification for the flight crew to undertake operations. The criteria for classifying airfields as critical are based on various factors such as terrain, length of runway, predominance of inclement weather etc.“There are 11 such airfields, which include the table-top runways of Mangalore, Kozhikode and Lengpui. In addition, airfields such as Patna, Jammu, Leh, Port Blair, etc also qualify as ‘critical airfields’. The operators can add some more airfields as critical, in case additional caution needs to be exercised during operations. As per SOP of Air India Express, three airfields at Mangalore, Kozhikode and Pune qualify as ‘critical airfields’. These airfields are, therefore, cleared for operations by experienced flight crew and take off and landings have to be carried out by the pilot in command (PIC) only,” said the report.Following the Mangalore crash, the court of Inquiry recommended setting up of an independent Indian Civil Aviation Safety Board (ICASB) urgently in view of rapid growth of aviation in the country. Such independent safety organisations have been set up in the USA, UK, Canada, France and Indonesia to name a few. The ICASB will focus on all flight safety related issues to suggest proactive measures, to minimise accidents and incidents, it had said. Civil Aviation Safety Advisory Council (CASAC) had also warned the authorities 10 years back that Kozhikode runway was very risky for landing during rains and harsh weather conditions.In a letter addressed to the chairman of Civil Aviation Safety Advisory Council (CASAC) and civil aviation secretary, CASAC member Captain Mohan Ranganathan had pointed that the Runway 10 of the Kozhikode airport could be risky for landing in tailwind conditions in rain.“I understand that Runway 10 ILS is being used on a trial basis at Calicut. Some of the crew are accepting even VOR approach on Runway 10. The reason is the lower minima than Runway 28. However, all the flights that land on Runway 10 in tailwind conditions in rain, are endangering the lives of all on board,” he had said.He also said that the airport does not have the minimum Runway End Safety Area (RESA)“The runway strip is just half the minimum width laid down in ICAO Annex 14. This fact was known to the DGCA team that has been conducting inspections and safety assessments during the past several years. Have they considered the danger involved? Has the DGCA or the airlines laid down any operational restrictions or special procedures?” he had written.He also added that the Air India Express accident in Mangalore should have alerted the Airport Authority to make the runway conditions safe. “It is a dangerous situation, especially in wet conditions. Runway 10 approaches should not be permitted in view of the lack of RESA and the terrain beyond the end of the runway. RATIO of 240m should be immediately introduced and the runway length has to be reduced to make the operations safe,” he had said.The Boeing 737 jet, on a Vande Bharat mission as flight AIX 1344 from Dubai, was bringing in Indians who were stranded abroad due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In all there were 174 adult passengers on board, 10 infants, two pilots, and four crew members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kozhikode-s-table-top-runway-risky-for-landing-officals-warned-10-years-ago/story-0Gxz1WNuL7wqYq44Rte71M.html

08-08-2020||India||2 policemen suspended in MP’s Barwani district for manhandling a Sikh||Two police personnel, including an assistant sub-inspector (ASI), was suspended in Madhya Pradesh’s (MP) Barwani district, located about 313 kilometres (km) south-west of the state capital Bhopal, by the superintendent of police (SP) on Friday evening after a video clip went viral on social media. The 50-second clip showed a policeman is dragging a Sikh by his hair in public amid pushing and jostling, while his companion, belonging to the same faith, is pleading with the law enforcers not to beat him, with folded hands. The incident, which reportedly occurred at Palsud, a town in Barwani district and located about 35 km from the district headquarters, on Thursday, sparked a nationwide outrage among the members of the Sikh community and its backlash echoed on social media. The MP unit of the Congress, which is the main opposition in the state, demanded stern action against the two police personnel responsible for the incident that reportedly occurred during a routine check on vehicles. The Sikh, identified as Prem Singh, is a resident of Palsud and a granthi at the local Gurdwara, even though the police claimed otherwise. The district police authorities, however, denied the charges of excesses. They claimed that Singh is facing three criminal charges and his turban fell off during an argument with the policemen, who had stopped him to check his vehicle. Barwani district police administration put out a press release to calm down the frayed nerves and the social media outrage over the purported manhandling of a member of the minority Sikh community. “Superintendent of Police (SP) Nimish Agrawal has suspended ASI Seetaram Bhatnagar and head constable Mohan Jamre for not initiating action, as per the laid-down procedure. A probe into the incident has been assigned to the sub-divisional officer of police (SDoP), Rajpur,” the release stated. “During a check on vehicles on Thursday evening, two Sikligars (members of Sikh community), who were travelling on a motorbike were stopped. One of them is Prem Singh, a resident of ward no. 15 of Palsud. Police record showed Prem Singh is facing theft charges under three police stations in Jabalpur district. He got into an altercation, when he was asked to show his two-wheeler’s papers. The on-duty police personnel suspected him of driving the vehicle under the influence of alcohol and wanted him to accompany them to a police station for a medical examination. The police personnel has been suspended and a probe has been initiated since they didn’t follow the laid-down procedure while conducting the check on the vehicle,” it added. Later, Singh alleged that the police personnel had demanded Rs 250 from him after he had failed to furnish his two-wheeler’s papers. He further alleged that they started thrashing him, when he pleaded his inability to pay up Rs 250 because he had earned only Rs 200 on that day. MP Congress president Kamal Nath has spoken in favour of Singh. “Prem Singh, who is a granthi, was beaten by the police personnel in an inhuman manner. Such atrocities are an insult to the Sikh religion and can’t be tolerated. The state government must take strict action against the guilty,” he said, Union minister for food processing, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, a Sikh herself, tweeted, “Beastly attack on Giani Prem Singh granthi and other Sikhs in MP is an outrage against humanity. Utterly reprehensible & unacceptable. Sikhs all over the world are deeply shocked. I urge CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan to take immediate and exemplary action against all those guilty of this brutality.” Several other Sikh leaders, including Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) President Sukhbir Singh Badal, president of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) and national spokesperson of SAD, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, condemned the incident and demanded immediate action against the guilty police personnel. MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who is under home quarantine after his recovery from coronavirus disease (Covid-19), also tweeted, “In Barwani district, ASI Seetaram Bhatnagar and head constable Mohan Jamre have been suspended immediately for inhuman treatment to our Sikh brothers. Such brutality with Sikhs will not be tolerated in any way. The matter will be probed by the DIG (deputy inspector-general), Indore, and strict action will be taken in this regard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-policemen-suspended-in-mp-s-barwani-district-for-manhandling-a-sikh/story-Hzhm2e8lPFBGVxP5KkEH6I.html
08-08-2020||India||DGCA issued notice to Kozhikode airport in July 2019 over safety lapses: Official||Aviation regulator DGCA had issued a show-cause notice to the director of the Kozhikode airport on July 11 last year after it found “various critical safety lapses”, officials said on Saturday. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation pointed to cracks on the runway, water stagnation and excessive rubber deposits among other lapses in its show-cause notice.Follow latest updates on Kerala plane crash here The DGCA conducted the inspection after an Air India Express flight coming from Dammam in Saudi Arabia had a “tail strike” while landing at the Calicut (Kozhikode) airport on July 2 last year, an official said. A little over a year later, on Friday evening, an Air India Express flight from Dubai with 190 people on board overshot “runway 10” at the Calicut airport in heavy rain and went down 35 feet into a gorge before breaking into two pieces, killing at least 18 people.“After the July 2 incident last year, the DGCA inspected the airport on July 4 and July 5 and found various critical safety lapses,” said a senior DGCA official.Also read: After AI Express crash in Kerala’s Kozhikode, Angels of Air India fly in to offer support On July 11, Kozhikode airport director K Srinivasa Rao was issued a show cause notice, added another DGCA official. However, it is not clear if any action was taken against Rao after the show-cause was issued. The show-cause notice, which PTI accessed, said “cracks are observed at runway 28 TDZ (touchdown zone) and along runway C/L (center/left) marking at runway 10 TDZ”. The touchdown zone (TDZ) is the part where the aircraft first contacts the surface while landing. The touchdown zone is ahead of the threshold area of the runway. The notice also said “excessive rubber deposit” was observed in the area from runway C/L marking to three metres on both the sides of touchdown zone of runway 28.Also read| He saved our lives: Air India Express plane crash survivors laud brave pilot Similar excessive rubber deposits were found by the DGCA along runway C/L marking of touchdown zone of runway 10, according to the notice. “Water stagnation of about 1.5 metre length was observed on the area between runway edge and intermediate turn pad on runway 28,” it said. Besides, the DGCA found several cracks in aircraft stand number 5. It also observed that a “portion of Apron surface” of about 111 metres was damaged, it said. Apron is the area of the airport where aircraft are parked, refuelled and where passengers board. “A steep downward slope of approximately five feet depth is observed immediately after the apron behind aircraft number 1, which needs to be levelled and graded,” the notice said. The DGCA observed a shortage of reserve stock of 6,630 litres of Aqueous Film Forming Foam concentrate (AFFF) and 140 kg of “DCP complementary agent” - both are used to put out fires - at the Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) station of the airport. Air India Express, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Air India, said on Saturday that three relief flights had been arranged to Kozhikode in Kerala to assist passengers and their family members affected by the plane crash a day ago. Officials said Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri will go to Kozhikode on Saturday. Officials of the AAIB (Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau), the DGCA and the flight safety department of the airline have reached the accident site to investigate the accident, said the airline on Saturday morning. Scheduled international passenger flights remain suspended in India since March 23 due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. However, special repatriation flights have been operated by Air India and Air India Express since May 6 under the Vande Bharat Mission to help stranded people reach their destinations. Private carriers have also operated a certain number of flights under this mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-issued-notice-to-kozhikode-airport-in-july-2019-over-safety-lapses-official/story-rBjEcofrP7Mrr3Qp7OpjcJ.html
08-08-2020||India||India, China to hold senior military-level talks, disengagement at friction areas on agenda||Senior military commanders from India and China are holding talks on Saturday to discuss the next stage of disengagement by the Chinese side along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh sector, people familiar with the development said.The major general level meeting, which comes after the fifth round of talks between corps commander ranked officers on August 2, began at 11am in the Daulat Beg Oldi area on the Chinese side of LAC. The situation in the Depsang plains will also be discussed.The last round of negotiations was held at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC as talks entered a critical phase due to serious differences between the two armies in the Finger Area near Pangong Tso. It also came amid the Chinese People’s Liberation Army reluctance to vacate positions held by it in what New Delhi claims to be Indian territory. Also Read: The PLA Aggressors: China’s eight top commanders who led Ladakh adventureThe Finger Area—a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range overlooking the Pangong Lake—has emerged as the hardest part of the disengagement process with little hope of immediate resolution, one of the officials in the know of the developments had said then. The August 2 military negotiations had come three days after Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong said his country’s traditional boundary line on the northern bank of the Pangong Lake was in accordance with the LAC and there was no case of Beijing expanding its territorial claim. The ambassador’s contention was a clear indication of the Chinese hard line on its claims in the Finger area, said a second official. Also Read: China offers a new normal to end Ladakh border standoff. India shoots it downThe Indian Army used to patrol right up to Finger Eight that New Delhi considers within Indian territory before the PLA grabbed positions on Finger Four overlooking Indian deployments. The new positions held by the PLA have curtailed the scope of Indian patrols. Fingers Four and Eight are 8km apart. The Indian claim line in this sector extends to Finger Eight, while the Chinese claim is up to Finger Four where the PLA has set up permanent bunkers, pillboxes, observation posts and tented camps over the last three months. Tensions between India and China have risen since May after India said it had detected multiple intrusions into its territory by Chinese troops. The ties strained further after a violent clash between soldiers of the two sides in June in which 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese troops were killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-to-hold-senior-military-level-talks-disengagement-at-friction-areas-on-agenda/story-A0oH1XwAGMz0qFkGgRkS5O.html
08-08-2020||India||Bihar Police probe into Sushant’s case made good progress until...: IPS officer||The Bihar Police’s investigation into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput had progressed well until it got stymied on August 2, said IPS officer Vinay Tiwari who visited Mumbai on that date to lead the probe but ended up being quarantined by municipal authorities. Upon his return to Patna late Friday night, Tiwari, who is posted here as the SP City (East), however, declined to spill the beans on the findings of the investigation carried out by his team asserting that doing so would be “inappropriate”.Also read: Rhea Chakraborty has ‘nothing to hide’, will return for questioning a second time if need be, says lawyer “I had duly informed my counterparts in Mumbai about my official tour. I had sought accommodation and requisitioned a vehicle. Since my visit and its purpose were well known, people from the media approached me with their questions at the airport itself to which I replied,” Tiwari told reporters upon his arrival at the airport here. The IPS officer, who was released from quarantine on Friday, remarked with disappointment that despite intimation about his tour “nobody came to the airport to receive me”. “Nonetheless, I checked into a guest house and then went out to meet members of my team, who had been in the city since July 27, and take stock of the investigation. At around 10 pm, I received a call from BMC authorities who spoke about the need to quarantine me. As a law abiding person, I returned to the guest house and extended my cooperation,” Tiwari said.Also read| Sushant Singh Rajput death case: Centre seeks to be party in Rhea’s SC petition “It is for all to see that a few visitors to Mumbai, where so many people reach every day, are quarantined in this fashion. Even my four subordinates were not placed in quarantine. Now, try to make sense of that,” he remarked wryly. The four junior rank officials had returned from Mumbai on Thursday. Tiwari, however, hastened to add that he did not wish to take personal affront for being quarantined and pointed out that “it was our constitutional right and obligation to carry out an investigation into the FIR lodged in Patna. Things moved fine till August 2 after which everything got derailed”. To prying queries whether his investigation sensed any connivance of the Mumbai Police with actress Rhea Chakraborty, accused by Rajput’s father of abetting his son’s suicide, Tiwari said, “I would not say anything on that. It would be inappropriate to do so.” “But I must add, our investigation had progressed at great speed in 10 days and had moved in the right direction,” he concluded. The case filed by the deceased actor’s father K K Singh at Rajiv Nagar police station has now been taken over by the CBI, upon a recommendation of the state government which acted on a request to the effect by the complainant to DGP Gupteshwar Pandey. Pandey, who had fumed at the forced quarantine of the young IPS officer, terming it a “house arrest”, was among those who were at the airport at the unearthly hour to receive Tiwari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-police-s-probe-into-sushant-singh-rajput-s-case-made-good-progress-until-ips-officer/story-NuRYCcshfxhOKQYwcXU8xM.html

Air India Express said “Angels of Air India”, the special assistance team, were flown into Kozhikode from Mumbai to coordinate relief and counsel the passengers, who have been injured, and their family members. They will also look after the relatives of the dead passengers.“The Go Teams and Angels of Air India have reached Calicut for being with the injured passengers as well as with the family members of the injured as well as dead passengers,” Air India Express said in a statement.The Air India Express flight from Dubai overshot the tabletop runway at Kozhikode airport on Friday night while landing in heavy rains, fell into a valley 35 feet below and broke into two, killing at least 19 people and injuring more than 100.

They said people rushed to the spot and retrieved them before help came in as they entered the plane ignoring the smoke and minor fire.Wing Commander Deepak Vasant Sathe was an ace Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter with a 22-year career. Sathe, 59, was awarded the coveted “sword of honour” (a recognition of his skills) when he graduated from the Air Force Academy at Dundigal near Hyderabad in June 1981. The former IAF fighter, an alumnus of the prestigious National Defence Academy, Khadakwasla, was also an accomplished test pilot.“It was raining heavily. The pilot had given a warning before landing saying the weather was really bad. He tried for safe landing twice but lost control. The aircraft shot off the runway and skidded off and it broke into two pieces. It was a miraculous escape for many,” V Ibrahim, one of the passengers who survived with minor injuries, said.Out of the 190 people on board, 123 people have been injured and 20 are in serious condition, said hospital sources adding some of them received spinal cord injuries in the impact.Officials said 38 passengers are in Kozhikode MIMS Hospital, 28 in Baby Memorial Hospital and 14 in Medical College Hospital.It was India’s worst passenger aircraft accident since 2010, when another Air India Express flight from Dubai overshot the table-top runway at Mangalore and slid down a hill, killing 158 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-express-plane-crash-survivors-laud-brave-pilot-say-he-saved-our-lives/story-4Mz1mkmkBJqyH58klsaT3O.html
08-08-2020||India||Govt sets up task force for vaccine distribution||India has formed an expert committee comprising representatives from all relevant ministries and institutions to oversee all aspects of its Covid-19 vaccine plan, from identification of the vaccine to buying to financing the purchase to distribution and administration — a move that comes even as six vaccines are in Phase 3 or combined Phase 2-3 trials and as countries around the world scramble to strike deals with multiple vaccine makers. According to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named, the panel will be led by Niti Aayog’s Dr VK Paul and co-chaired by health secretary Rajesh Bhushan. It will pick the vaccine or vaccines that India can use, plan the finances for what is sure to be an expensive purchase running into billions of dollars, and prioritise the sequence of administration. In the absence of a vaccine or a cure, the only way to slow the spread of Covid-19 has been wearing masks, social distancing, and restricting regular activities — things that have taken a toll on life and work. Till Friday night, the coronavirus disease had infected 19,385, 292 people around the world and killed 720, 053. In India, the corresponding numbers are 2,083, 835 and 42,566.  HT was the first to report on July 27 that Indian officials were already discussing a wide range of issues related to the vaccine, from logistics to prioritisation, to setting the stage for a smooth supply and effective use of the vaccine.Click here for Covid-19 live updates The high-level panel, formed by the cabinet secretary on Friday, includes AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, representatives of the ministries of external affairs, biotechnology, information technology, the Director General of Health services, India’s Aids Research Institute, the Indian Council of Medical Research, and also representatives from states. The panel’s task starts with identifying the vaccine, or vaccines. Countries such as the US and the UK are spreading their risks, striking deals with multiple vaccine makers who are ahead in the race to develop a vaccine.It will then decide how the vaccines should be procured—whether foreign agencies should be involved or whether state governments will be allowed to procure on their own or if there should be a central procuring system directly under the supervision of the central government. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicA government official familiar with the matter said that the panel would co-ordinate this with Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, and the World Health Organisation. India is already set to be a beneficiary of the Covax programme of GAVI and will get enough vaccine doses through the agency to administer to 20% of its population. The group will also draft a financial plan, plan a budget and discuss how many can be raised for the mammoth exercise of procurement, distribution, and administration. Also Read:South India accounts for over 40% of India’s active cases, Delhi’s count continues to improveFinally, the panel will prepare a strategy on inventory management, distribution, and administration. Many of these issues have been discussed over the past month across ministries and institutions, the officials cited in the first instance said. Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe authorities are carefully watching the development of at least nine vaccines, including at least two Chinese ones, and hoping that the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, being made in India by the Adar Poonawalla-led Serum Institute of India, works. “The internal discussions have started so that we are fully prepared, and to avoid any last-moment glitches. One of the key issues is distribution in remote areas such as North East India and how we have to set up large-scale cold storage facilities in such areas,” added the government official. Covid-19: SOP ready, no plan to open schools for nowThat, though is a second-generation problem. India first needs to identify a vaccine and procure enough doses of it. Dr. Sanjay Chatterjee of Calcutta Medical College said, “It’s good that centre has formed such a committee in advance to sort out logistical and related issues in a huge and populous country such as India. But as (with regard to) many things including the final status of the vaccines in the race, some key decisions can be only taken at a later stage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-sets-up-task-force-for-vaccine-distribution/story-I8btPlTYKv1wj4KClZfHlJ.html
08-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On Friday, Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, which was founded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), Serum Institute of India, and BGMF struck a $150 million deal to produce 100 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from AstraZeneca and Novavax for 57 and 92 countries that are part of Gavi Covax AMC, which aims to provide up to two billion doses of vaccines to eligible countries, including India, by the end of 2021.Also on Friday, the Indian government finally set in motion the process of identifying the vaccine or vaccines it wants to buy, and planning other aspects including financing and procurement by setting up a panel to oversee all these aspects. Also read: Govt sets up task force for vaccine distributionCovax is led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the World Health Organization (WHO), and it hopes to ensure “fair and equitable” access to Covid-19 vaccines to “every country in the world”. India, as a lower middle income country (its GDP per capita is about $2,100), is eligible for vaccines under Covax (one criteria is that the country should have a per capita GDP less than $4,000), and until it formed the committee on Friday, it seemed that it was pinning its hopes on this mechanism to access a vaccine or vaccines that provide immunity against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Covax stands for Covid-19 Vaccine Global Access. Some countries have struck direct deals with companies for vaccines in anticipation of their development, investing upfront in them and bearing some of the risks. The US, under Operation Warp Speed, a Covid-19 vaccine development programme, has pumped billions of dollars into vaccine makers (almost every major one). More than any country, the US appears to have a clear plan on how to build a vaccine stockpile – impressive for a country that has pretty much got every other part of its response to Covid-19 wrong. The UK has signed deals with AstraZeneca, the BioNTech-Pfizer combine, and Valneva, for a (total) of around 200 million doses of the three vaccines. The European Union has signed a deal with Sanofi for 300 million doses of a potential Covid-19 vaccine. WHO’s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus referred to the rush, among nations that can afford it, to throw money at vaccine makers and sign advance deals. “Vaccine nationalism is not good; it will not help us,” he said at an event on Thursday. “No country will be safe until we are all safe,” he added. Covax intends to ensure that the vaccines that work are distributed fairly around the world. It aims to make available two billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2021, for which it is raising $18 billion, but some of the money is coming from around 75 countries that have signed up as donors in return for a share of the vaccines. Like the 92 low and middle income countries, they too will get, through Covax, enough doses to vaccinate 20% of the population. Some health activists have criticised this part of the programme (giving donors vaccines), but in the absence of this sweetener, it is unlikely that Gavi will be able to raise as much money as it needs. The UK, Singapore, Switzerland, Japan and New Zealand are among the donor countries. In the first phase, Covax will make available vaccine doses to cover 3% of the population of countries that are part of the programme (this proportion is expected to cover essential workers). India has not signed deals with any of the vaccine makers yet. The Department of Biotechnology and the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council, DBT-BIRAC, have funded some Indian vaccine candidates (including those of Cadila Healthcare and Bharat Biotech), but this doesn’t come with any strings attached. To be sure, as a country with enough vaccine-making capacity (and huge expertise in this area), it can always play catch-up with countries that have already planned their Covid-19 vaccine stockpiles, but it wouldn’t hurt to do this now. The creation of a panel suggests that New Delhi has realised this. Serum Institute is the world’s largest vaccine maker and its CEO Adar Poonawalla has previously said to the New York Times that he would split his company’s production 50:50 between India and the rest of the world . With two-thirds of the year gone, there are six vaccine candidates in Phase-3 or Phase 2/3 trials, according to WHO. Three of these are Chinese – from Sinovac, Sinopharm and the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, and Sinopharm and the Beijing Institute of Biological Products. The other three are from Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, and BioNTech/Pfizer. There are other companies developing vaccines too – 20 candidates are in human trials (other than the six). At this stage, the probability of not having a vaccine (leaving aside details such as whether it will be single-shot, and how well it will work) for Covid-19 in 2021 is very low. That’s all the more reason why India has to start focusing on its vaccine acquisition plan now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-xGsA6ho4sT9NnoXXl2jy7L.html
08-08-2020||India||L-G: Need to start Kashmir dialogue for peace, stability||Authorities will initiate a dialogue in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) without any discrimination in order to usher in peace and development, Manoj Sinha, who was sworn in as the second lieutenant governor (LG) of the Union Territory, said on Friday, sending out a message of unity in his first speech after taking charge.Sinha, 61, a three-time Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) parliamentarian, stressed that “peace and stability” should prevail in J&K while “uncertainty and terrorism” should end. “Achieving all this along with accelerated development will be our aim, our mission,” he said after the oath ceremony at the Raj Bhavan in Srinagar.The appointment of Sinha, a former Union minister, is being seen as an indication of the Centre’s will to initiate the political process in J&K at a time when the region is grappling with multiple issues, from security concerns to a tumultuous social and political landscape. After years of isolation, J&K has joined the national mainstream, Sinha said, referring to the central government’s move to nullify Article 370, which conferred special status to the erstwhile state, and bifurcate it into two UTs — J&K with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one — on August 5, 2019.“I have been told that many works which could not be completed in years have been completed in the past one year. I want to accelerate that development,” Sinha said. “We need to establish a dialogue with the common people of Jammu and Kashmir. We don’t have any agenda in that; there will be no discrimination against anyone. Constitution will be Gita in that,” he added.Later in the day, Sinha chaired a high-level meeting of administrative secretaries of the government at the civil secretariat. He was briefed on development projects in the UT, among other issues.Sinha, who was administered the oath of office by J&K chief justice Gita Mittal, takes over from Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer Girish Chandra Murmu, who resigned on Wednesday night and was later appointed the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India.BJP leaders such as Jitendra Singh, minister of state in the Prime Minister’s Office; former deputy chief ministers Kavinder Gupta and Nirmal Singh; and BJP state president Ravindra Raina, among others, were present at the event. The newly launched Apni Party was represented by Ghulam Hassan Mir, Mohammad Ashraf Mir and former legislator Zaffar Manhas. The National Conference (NC) did not attend Sinha’s oath ceremony though both Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah were invited.Justice (retd) Hasnain Masoodi, a senior NC leader and a parliamentarian, said: “Nothing will happen unless there is a change in the approach towards the people. Changing faces have no meaning. As a matter of principle, nobody from the NC attended the oath ceremony.”J&K Congress president Ghulam Ahmad Mir said nobody from his party got an invite. “This is how the BJP intends to start the political process in J&K...” he said.Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) spokesperson Tahir Sayed, too, said his party did not attend the event. “Nazir Ahmad Laway (a Rajya Sabha member) attended the ceremony, but he was expelled from the PDP long back.’’Asem Bhat, a political commentator, underscored the challenges before Sinha in starting a political process. “...dozens of political leaders are under house arrest. One former CM (PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti) is detained under PSA (Public Safety Act)...”As protests erupted in the wake of the August 5 announcement last year, several political leaders and activists, including three former CMs — Farooq and Omar Abdullah, and Mufti — were detained as a preventive measure. While prominent politicians, including the Abdullahs, have been released, Mufti and several others are still in detention.Sinha’s political career began when he was elected the president of Banaras Hindu University students’ union in 1982. He became a Lok Sabha member for the first time in 1996 from Ghazipur, and won election from the seat in 1999 as well.He was elected to the Lower House for a third time in 2014, when the BJP came to power at the Centre with a landslide win, and Modi became the PM. Sinha held the portfolio of minister of state for railways between May 2014 and July 2016, and was later given the independent charge of the ministry of telecommunications.An alumnus of Indian Institute of Technology, Varanasi, formerly known as Banaras Engineering College, Sinha is not unfamiliar with a tricky turf. He overcame the caste faultiness in his constituency of Ghazipur, which was also once a Left bastion. J&K, however, is a challenge of a different magnitude.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/l-g-need-to-start-kashmir-dialogue-for-peace-stability/story-XbvZSVjkAjFmQ2JX6QENOP.html
08-08-2020||India||ED questions Rhea Chakraborty for 9 hours in Sushant Singh Rajput death case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) questioned actor Rhea Chakraborty for over eight hours on Friday in a money-laundering case it has registered in connection with Bollywood celebrity Sushant Singh Raput’s suspected suicide on June 14.The 28-year-old Chakraborty, Rajput’s girlfriend at the time of his death, arrived at the agency’s office in Balard Estate area around 11:50am after her request to defer the questioning was turned down. She left the ED office around 8:45pm. The agency, which investigates money laundering and foreign exchange violations, questioned Chakraborty’s brother, Showik, and her business manager, Shruti Modi, who also worked for Rajput. Their statements were recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Requesting anonymity, ED officials privy to the details said the agency was looking into Chakraborty’s income tax returns and investments. The officials said Chakraborty responded to most of the questions. ED is expected to focus on Chakraborty’s income, business deals and professional deals. A property located in the Khar area of Mumbai is also being probed by ED for the source of its purchase and ownership. Chakraborty told interrogators that she took around Rs 60 lakh home loan for the property worth Rs 84 lakh, according to the officials. When ED officials asked her about the remaining amount, she said she managed to arrange the rest on her own and made the payment through cheques, the officials said. Investigators also tried to get more information into the formation of four companies by Rajput, Chakraborty and her family. While two of these companies were registered, the rest of the two were under the process of getting registered. She said she did not siphon of anyone’s money, the officials said.“She has been examined and her statement... (has been) recorded... She’s always cooperated with investigations with police and ED. She’s nothing to hide. In the event she’s called again, she will appear at the appointed time,” Satish Maneshinde, her lawyer and senior counsel, said. ED filed a case on July 31 on the basis of a first information report (FIR) by the Bihar Police. The FIR was registered following a complaint by Rajput’s father KK Singh who accused Chakraborty and her family of abetting the Bollywood actor’s suicide and siphoning of his money. Singh accused that close to Rs 15 crore were transferred from Rajput’s account to unknown persons not linked to him. He said that his son’s credit cards were with Chakraborty. Alongside ED, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), too, has launched a probe on the request of the Bihar government and has named Chakraborty, her brother and four other family members, apart from unknown persons, as accused. The Bihar Police have handed over their case files to CBI in the midst of a jurisdictional dispute with the Maharashtra Police, who have filed an accidental death report (ADR). “Rhea Chakraborty is a law-abiding citizen. In view of the fact that ED has informed the media that the request to postpone the attendance is rejected, she appeared before the ED at the appointed time and date,” Maneshinde, said in a statement earlier in the day. Chakraborty initially refused to appear before the agency, citing her appeal pending before the Supreme Court. She has requested that the FIR filed in Patna be transferred to Mumbai, arguing that Bihar Police have no jurisdiction. Bihar rejected the claim. Rajput’s roommate, Siddharth Pithani, too has been called by ED to appear on Saturday, PTI reported. Pithani, an IT professional stated to be living with Rajput for about a year, is stated to be out of Mumbai and he has said in news channel interviews that he was present in the Bandra flat on June 14, when the 34-year-old actor hanged himself. The agency has already questioned Rajput’s chartered accountant (CA), Sandeep Shridhar, and his house manager and staffer, Samuel Miranda, twice in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-questions-rhea-for-9-hours-in-sushant-case/story-HR0IoZLWsPSwhYnBHt855L.html

The Boeing 737 jet, on a Vande Bharat mission as flight AIX 1344 from Dubai, was bringing in Indians who were stranded abroad due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The crash occurred around 7.40pm, when it was raining, and the incident bore striking similarity to the 2010 Mangalore airport crash when a plane, also an Air India Express Boeing 737, overshot a tabletop runway and crashed nose-first into the ground – the last time there were as many or more people killed in a plane crash. Also read| Kerala plane crash: All passengers evacuated from crash site, urgent meeting called in Delhi“It was a Dubai to Kozhikode Air India Express flight. It made an over-speeding landing, overshot the runway, and fell into a valley. The aircraft has broken into two parts but it is being reported that it has not caught fire, which increases chances of rescue. Rescue teams are on spot and we are yet to get final figures on casualties,” said Arun Kumar, chief of directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA).In all there were 174 adult passengers on board, 10 infants, two pilots, and four crew members. Flight records reviewed by HT showed that several of the passengers cited job loss as the reason for returning to the country. “It was raining heavily. The pilot had given a warning before landing saying the weather was really bad. He tried for safe landing twice but lost control. The aircraft shot off the runway and skidded off and it broke into two pieces. It was a miraculous escape for many,” said V Ibrahim, among the passengers who survived with minor injuries.Among the 20 casualties were four children, officials said.“We are in touch with local authorities... Relief teams from Air India and AAI are being immediately dispatched from Delhi and Mumbai. All efforts being made to help passengers. A formal enquiry will be conducted by Aircraft Accident Investigation Board (AAIB),” civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri. Also read: Govt orders probe into Air India crash, first team leaves for Kozhikode at 2 am“I have asked minister for local self government AC Moideen to rush to the airport and coordinate rescue efforts. It is another shocking incident,” said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on a day when the state was also hit by a landslide that killed 15 people.The fatalities include the flight’s commander Deepak V Sathe, a former Air Force Pilot, and co-pilot Akhilesh Kumar. Rescue personnel were on the scene and more than 150 people were taken to the hospital. “We regret that there has been an incident regarding our aircraft,” Air India Express said in a statement. Help centers were being set up in Sharjah and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.According to a playback on flight-tracking website FlightRadar24, the plane circled the airport twice before attempting to land. In its second instance, it aborted the attempt with 2,000 feet to go before the crash landing.The so-called tabletop airport has limited space at the ends of the runway, and several international airlines had stopped flying bigger aircraft into Kozhikode due to safety issues over the length of the runway.“Both Mangalore and Calicut airport do not have the required space on either side of the runway for safe landing. The Calicut runway does not have mandatory 155m side strip and there is a 70m drop at either end. We at the Civil Aviation Safety Advisory Council had warned the authorities ten years back that the runway is very risky for landing during rains,” said aviation safety consultant Mohan Ranganathan, a former instructor pilot of Boeing 737 who specialised in wet runway operations training. “The visibility was 2,000 metres (which is not considered to be bad) along with heavy rains. Calicut is a table top airport like Mangalore but at a lower height. The gorge at the end is not very deep and has a road going through it. Landing an aircraft is all about managing the energy of aircraft. The atmospherics play a major part,” said a senior air traffic controller in Mumbai, asking not to be named.Watch| Kozhikode crash: Pilots among 19 dead; PM Modi speaks to Kerala CM; NDRF rushed “Head winds and good runway friction conditions help a pilot in managing the energy so that the aircraft is brought to a stop from landing speeds of 250 km per hour. When atmospherics are not in favour then a mishap can happen, as it has in this case. But it means the pilot would sight the runway only about a minute before landing so it’s quite challenging as well,” this person added.President Ram Nath Kovind, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and several other opposition leaders offered their condolences over the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vande-flight-with-190-on-board-skids-off-runway-breaks-into-2/story-id2Sqz17JWy6bOHBOac0FL.html

The MPs said that it was not the appropriate time to discuss the draft.At Friday’s meeting, ministry officials in a detailed presentation, said that there have been 55 amendments and many court orders on the EIA since 2006, people familiar with the matter said. In the presentation, officials stressed that EIA 2020 is key to ease of doing business and the much needed systematization. The meeting was attended by just 14 out of 30 MPs. Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar and his predecessor, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, have exchanged a series of letters on the EIA. Ramesh is the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on environment, forests and climate change and science and technology. During the meeting, some members welcomed the notification, even as AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi raised 15 questions and some parties, including the DMK, opposed the clauses which seek to dilute public hearings and regularisation of violations.All MPs stressed on need for transparency, consistency and clarity in the draft rules, the people cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mps-divided-at-first-house-panel-meet-on-eia/story-UWeqA3jSFlGJuHP8OuXCrJ.html

In Kerala’s Idukki district, three days of heavy showers triggered landslides in the early hours of the morning that razed a tea plantation workers’ settlement. Fifteen were declared dead and 60 were missing – most of whom were sleeping. Idukki district collector H Dineshan said the downpour and mist hampered rescue even as the showers snapped communication lines. “I heard a deafening sound and came out of the two-room house. I saw a big portion of the mountain coming out with a heavy flow of water and slush. I ran outside but got into the swirl of waters,” said Deepan, who was admitted at a hospital in Munnar.In neighbouring Karnataka, two people died in the Malnad region and another five reported missing. Rescuers were also searching for five people missing at Talacauvery, the origin of Cauvery river, where massive landslides and floods inundated villages on Wednesday night. “Pained by the loss of lives due to a landslide in Rajamalai, Idukki. In this hour of grief, my thoughts are with the bereaved families. May the injured recover quickly,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted. Heavy rains would continue in the region till Sunday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Friday. This is the heaviest rainfall this monsoon in the two states, where massive floods have killed 803 people and displaced 12.8 million, according to home ministry data. “Our analysis of rainfall data over the last 70 years, show a three-fold rise in extreme rains along the west coast and central India. This is because the monsoon winds over the Arabian Sea are now exhibiting large fluctuations, thanks to a warmer environment,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. According to IMD, average rainfall in the coastal regions of Karnataka and Kerala in the past 24 hours was 20 cm with Idukki receiving 26 cm and Malnad receiving 23 cm. At the almost half-way mark of the monsoon this year, Karnataka received excess rainfall by 53% and Kerala by 102%, whereas states in northern and central India have rainfall deficiency of 56% to 95%. The eastern states have received heavy rainfall in the latter part of July and first week of August, causing massive floods. At least 239 deaths have been reported from West Bengal, the highest for any state. Rainfall has subsided in the worst-affected northern districts of Bihar, where close to 6.9 million people have been affected, according to the state disaster management department. Sixteen districts remain flood-hit. The situation may worsen in many districts if it rains heavily in the catchment areas of rivers such as Gandak, Bagmati and Kamla Balan, which are still flowing above the danger mark. In Assam, where close to 200 animals in Kaziranga National Park and 136 people have died, the flood situation has improved in the past few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/landslides-kill-17-bury-60-under-rubble-in-south-india/story-iNArm363bY5lie8mXxN10M.html

08-08-2020||India||Sushant Singh Rajput death case: Centre seeks to be party in Rhea’s SC petition||The Union government approached the Supreme Court on Friday, seeking to be a party in a petition by actor Rhea Chakraborty who has appealed that a first information report (FIR) filed against her over Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput’s death be transferred from Patna to Mumbai.The FIR, which is based on a complaint by Rajput’s father and accuses Chakraborty of abetting her 34-year-old boyfriend’s suicide, is now being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The Centre allowed the agency to take up the case on the basis of a request by Bihar, Rajput’s home state.The department of personnel and training (DoPT) plea in the Supreme Court said the Union of India is a “necessary and proper” party to the proceedings. The move came in the wake of Chakraborty’s legal team raising objections to the Centre’s intervention. Maharashtra, Bihar, and KK Singh — Rajput’s father — are parties in her petition in the top court.DoPT filed its impleadment plea through under secretary Satya Prakash Ram Tripathi. “The present impleadment application has been necessitated by virtue of the events that have taken place after filing of the present transfer petition,” it said.At the heart of the case is a question of who the case originally belongs to — Mumbai or Bihar. Chakraborty’s legal team says the Bihar government cannot recommend a CBI probe since the police from that state do not have any jurisdiction to even investigate the case. The Mumbai Police, too, have claimed that they have exclusive right to probe the case since the incident occurred under its jurisdiction.Rajput, who had a short but promising career, was found hanging at his Bandra residence in suburban Mumbai on June 14.On Friday, Bihar filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court, stressing that Section 179 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) allows an offence to be “tried either at the place where the offence has been committed or where the consequence ensues”. In this case, the consequence of the unnatural death was in Patna, where the late actor’s family resides, it argued.The Bihar government also sought the dismissal of Chakraborty’s transfer plea, and termed it “premature, misconceived and non-maintainable”.The affidavit, filed through advocate Keshav Mohan, said the Bihar Police have the jurisdiction in the case and accused Mumbai Police of non-cooperation. It said the Mumbai Police are “apparently siding with the petitioner (Chakraborty) for the reasons best known to them”.Hearing Chakraborty’s plea on Wednesday, the court asked Bihar, Maharashtra and Rajput’s father to reply to Chakraborty’s plea within three days, and asked about the status of investigation by the Mumbai Police. The Mumbai Police have found the cause of Rajput’s death as “asphyxia due to hanging”, filed an accidental death report (ADR) and began an investigation. While Bihar filed its affidavit on Friday, Maharashtra and Singh are yet to file their replies. The hearing is expected to resume next week.“The possibility of the Rhea Chakraborty case being argued out on the next date in the Supreme Court can only be possible if Maharashtra government defends its jurisdiction. The CBI cannot operate without express consent of Maharashtra. I also see the possibility of Mumbai Police completing its probe and putting it before the court on the next date and saying ‘we have nothing more to investigate’. Only a thin chance remains that Maharashtra will accept the situation as fait accompli and concede ground to CBI, which I doubt will happen,” senior advocate Sanjay Hegde told HT.Meanwhile, another petition before the Supreme Court on Friday said the entire case has not yet gone to CBI as the agency is only examining the FIR filed by Bihar Police on July 25.The petition by law student Dwivendra Dubey failed to impress a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde. “You are a total stranger who is unnecessarily interfering in the case. The victim’s father is pursuing the case,” the bench said through video-conferencing, while dismissing the petition.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appeared in the matter to inform that CBI has taken over the probe from Patna Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-death-case-centre-seeks-to-be-party-in-chakraborty-s-sc-petition/story-bhhVkpbAQSUkLZBxwRkpiN.html
08-08-2020||India||Kisan Rail ferrying perishables flagged off from Maharashtra for Bihar||The first ‘Kisan Rail’ train for transportation of perishable goods with refrigerated coaches to assist farmers by ensuring fast transportation of agriculture produce across the country was flagged off on Friday from Deolali in Maharashtra) to Danapur in Bihar.It is expected to reduce transportation costs by Rs 1,000 per tonne compared to roadways and also reduce travel time by around 15 hours, a railway ministry official said. The train will operate from Deolali to Danapur. This is a weekly service running every Friday form Deolali, and returning on Sunday from Danapur. The scheduled time of the journey is 31 hours and 45 mins (one-way).“Nasik and surrounding regions produce a huge quantity of fresh vegetables, fruits, flowers, other perishables, onions and other agro products,” the railway ministry said. In her Budget 2020 speech, Nirmala Sitharamam said the Indian Railways will set up a ‘Kisan Rail’ through public private partnership (PPP) with refrigerated coaches for transportation of perishable goods inclusive of milk, meat and fish. “The Nasik/Bhusawal region has a huge production of fruits as well as green vegetables, such as onions and green chilies. This produce was moving largely by road towards the eastern part of country, and Railways’ share in this transportation was miniscule. But with efforts of Railway officials, this traffic is now coming towards Railway – as the time to be taken by Rail is approximately 15 hours lesser than the road, and the freight charges are also cheaper by more than ₹1,000 per tonne,” the official said. Reefers, or refrigerated containers, facilitate the movement of cargo that requires a strict temperature-controlled environment. At present, the railways’ subsidiary CONCOR provides reefer services. Cold chains as a business area involves providing transportation to perishable products from source to end-user while maintaining a certain temperature along the route.“Out of nearly 2000 loaded freight trains running every day, around 10 trains are of perishables where onion is the main commodity. When loaded in wagons we are nearly 25%, when loaded in parcel we would be around 10 % cheaper approximately. As of now we are pretty insignificant in perishables but since there are volumes here we have targeted this for getting a larger share,” the official said. .“Indian Railways aims to help double farmers’ income with the launch of Kisan Rail. This train will help in bringing perishable agricultural products like vegetables, fruits to the market in a short period of time. The train with frozen containers is expected to build a seamless national cold supply chain for perishables, inclusive of fish, meat and milk, the ministry said in a statement. The train is presently planned with 10 parcel vans with a total capacity being 238 tonnes. ““Any farmer or any other interested party can directly book their consignments in this train, without any lower limit on the size of consignment. The consignment can be as small as 50-100 kgs, and can be booked from any stopping station to any other stopping station. Regarding loss/damage of products for any reason, Railways already has a well-established claim/compensation system – through which the party can get compensation for its losses,” the official added. The train was flagged off via video conferencing by union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and railway minister Piyush Goyal. Speaking on the occasion, Goyal said, “This train will serve as a milestone in doubling farmers’ income. Indian Railways and farmers had been forefront in battle against Covid challenges. Foodgrains freight was doubled during the period. Interest of Indian farmers is being looked after like never before. I am looking forward to see the day when apples of Kashmir reach Kanyakumari through Kisan Rail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kisan-rail-ferrying-perishables-flagged-off-from-maha-for-bihar/story-RUVnxiORYUv2PpS7WyuKRK.html
08-08-2020||India||Pilatus jet case: ED raids locations in multiple cities||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday conducted raids at 14 locations in Delhi, Surat and Gurgaon in connection with its money laundering probe in the purchase of 75 Pilatus basic trainer aircraft for the Indian Air Force (IAF) in 2009, officials familiar with the development said. The ED had filed a money laundering case against fugitive arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari in June 2019 on the basis of a CBI FIR the same month. In the deal worth Rs 2,895 crore, CBI had named unknown officials of the IAF, defence ministry and Switzerland-based Pilatus Aircraft Limited apart from Bhandari. It was alleged that Pilatus had entered into a criminal conspiracy with Bhandari and dishonestly and fraudulently signed a Service Provider Agreement with him in June 2010, which was in violation of the Defence Procurement Procedure, 2008. The agreement was signed to get the contract for supply of 75 basic Trainer Aircraft to the Indian Air Force, CBI said. It has further alleged that the company made a payment of Swiss Franc 1,000,000 in the account of Offset India Solution Private Limited, a company linked to Bhandari, with the Standard Chartered Bank, New Delhi in two tranches in August and October, 2010. In addition, Rs 350 crore was also transferred in Swiss Francs from 2011 to 2015 in the bank accounts of Dubai-based Offset India Solutions FZC, also belonging to Bhandari. CBI further said in its FIR that Pilatus dishonestly and fraudulently signed a Pre-contract Integrity Pact on November 12, 2010 with the defence ministry, deliberately concealing the facts about service provider agreement with Bhandari. It also concealed the payments made to Bhandari in India and Dubai. The agency had claimed that the commission was paid to influence the officials of the IAF, the MoD and other government departments associated with the procurement. Pilatus bagged the contract on May 24, 2012 for Rs 2895.63 crore. Bhandari is currently hiding in the UK. Both Bhandari and Pilatus’s spokesperson/lawyer could not be located by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilatus-jet-case-ed-raids-locations-in-multiple-cities/story-YgdzrAv5A5WzFaGumriTEM.html
08-08-2020||India||US global advisory: India continues to be on ‘do not travel’ list||The United States on Thursday lifted a “Do Not Travel” Global Health Advisory for Americans but retained it for India saying that not only does the risk of contracting Covid-19 remain high there but, most alarmingly, “if you get sick in India and need medical care, resources may be limited (and overwhelmed)”.The state department announced the lifting of the global travel advisory for Americans saying in a statement “with health and safety conditions improving in some countries and potentially deteriorating in others” it was switching back to “our previous system of country-specific levels of travel advice (with Levels from 1-4 depending on country-specific conditions).”For India, the country-specific advisory was “Level 4: Do Not Travel”. The state department said in the updated advisory, “Do not travel to India due to Covid-19.”The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which guided the state department revision, said on its own updated travel webpage Americans should avoid “all non-essential travel” to India as the risk of contracting Covid-19 is “high” and, it added, most significantly “if you get sick in India and need medical care, resources may be limited.” In an interactive cartographic representation of its assessment on the pandemic, the CDC framed its India warning a little differently: “If you get sick in India and need medical care, healthcare resources may be overwhelmed.”But this advisory can change. “CDC continues to monitor every country in the world, and as they identify that a country is either improving or that a country may be going in the other direction, they will let us know and we will, in turn, make the adjustment,” Karin King, deputy assistant secretary for overseas citizen services, told reporters at a news briefing.Of the more than 19 million Covid-19 infections worldwide, nearly a fifth — close to 4.9 million — are in the United States, followed by Brazil with 2.9 and India with 1.9 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Of the 713,406 global fatalities, nearly a fifth once again by the same count — over 160,000 — were in the US. Brazil was next with 98,000 deaths and India fifth with 40,699.Pakistan, by comparison, was safer at Level 3 — “reconsider travel” — in America’s estimation. Nepal and Sri Lanka were both at Level 3. Bangladesh was the same as India at Level 4, India is resuming limited international travel through bilateral arrangements with other countries under a new set of guidelines that go into effect Saturday, specifying a seven-day institutional isolation for all incoming travelers, followed by another sevens days of isolation at home.The Trump administratio issued a travel advisory on March 19 asking Americans to avoid all international travel. It had begun banning incoming travelers from certain countries in January starting with China, where the epidemic had started with first human-to-human transmission reported in December.Over succeeding weeks travelers were banned from Iran, European Union countries, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Brazil. These orders remain in force.Travelers from the United States were banned from EU countries subsequently and they remain on the unwelcome list because of the resurgence of infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-global-advisory-india-continues-to-be-on-do-not-travel-list/story-qRNHwjDErtrtbDX7Ng75pK.html
08-08-2020||India||Govt plea for closure on Italian marines’ case: SC to hear victims’ kin on compensation first||The Supreme Court on Friday asked the central government to ensure that families of the two Indian fishermen killed by Italian marines off the coast of Kerala in 2012 are adequately compensated if the government wants to close the proceedings before the top court and the criminal trial pending before the special court in Delhi. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI), SA Bobde said that it will dispose of the case only after the families of the victims are heard and given compensation.“We expect you to pay adequate compensation. You will have to bring the cheque here. We will then dispose of the case,” the CJI said.The central government moved the Supreme Court on July 3 stating that it has agreed to accept and abide by the award passed on May 21 by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) at Hague in Netherlands. It requested that the proceedings pending before top court in relation to the incident be closed.The Supreme Court, on Friday, noted that the victims’ families are not party to the case before the Supreme Court.“Victims’ families are not parties here. But they are appearing before the special court in Delhi (which is conducting the trial). We will not pass an order without hearing victims’ families,” the court said. It granted one week’s time to the central government to file an application making the families party to the case before Supreme Court. The matter will be now be heard after a month.The case pending before the Supreme Court is an appeal filed by the two marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, against a May 2012 judgment of the Kerala high court which held that Kerala had jurisdiction to try them. The high court ruled that the marines enjoyed no state immunity since their act of shooting at the fishermen was in defence of neither the vessel nor the state.The trial against the marines, which was initially proceeding in Kerala, was later shifted to Delhi in 2013 where it went on till the Supreme Court stayed it in 2015 after taking note of the proceedings pending before the tribunal.The two marines, accused of killing fishermen Ajesh Binki and Valentine Jalastine, crew members of the fishing boat St Anthony, were granted conditional bail by India’s Supreme Court and allowed to return to Italy in 2014 and 2016. The marines shot the fisherman under the mistaken impression that they were pirates. Their ship then tried to make a getaway but was intercepted by the Indian coast guard. The arbitral proceedings before PCA were instituted under United Nations Convention on Law of Seas (UNCLOS) on June 26, 2015 after Italy served notice on India under the UNCLOS. UNCLOS is an international agreement that defines the rights and responsibilities of nations with regard to their conduct and use of world seas and oceans and management of marine natural resources.The arbitral tribunal ruled on May 21 that the marines enjoyed immunity since they were exercising official functions in their capacity as Italian state officials when the incident occurred. It, therefore, ordered India to stop criminal proceedings against them.The tribunal, however, also ruled that Italy violated India’s right to navigation by firing at the fishing boat , and said that the country would have to compensate India for loss of life and damage to property.“The Republic of India has taken a decision to accept and abide by the award passed by the (arbitral) tribunal which would have the bearing on the continuance of present proceedings before the Supreme Court. The applicant (central government) is, therefore, placing the award on record with a prayer that the proceedings with regard to the incident dated February 15, 2012 be disposed of in conformity with the Award passed by the tribunal”, the application filed by centre before the Supreme Court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plea-for-closure-on-italian-marines-case-sc-to-hear-victims-kin-on-compensation-first/story-kMh8ezTHHKBoA0FKsQhYUJ.html
08-08-2020||India||New education policy free from any bias, says PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday emphasised the importance of the mother tongue as the medium of instruction until Class 5, and said the new National Education Policy (NEP) that the Union Cabinet cleared on July 29 -- it has a recommendation in this regard -- is free from any “bias or inclination”.The first such policy in at least 28 years recommends primary education in local languages, but does not make it mandatory. It also seeks to increase public spending on education to nearly 6% of GDP from around 4% now, change the structure of board exams, and shift the pedagogical structure from a 10+2 system to 5+3+3+4, as part of a series of reforms to make the education system more contemporary and skill oriented.“There is no debate that children when taught in school in the same language that is spoken at home; their pace of learning becomes faster. This is a major reason, wherever possible, permission has been granted to teach students till Class 5 in their mother tongue,” Modi said in his address to educationists at a conclave on reforms in higher education.The medium of instruction has been a contentious issue, and the Centre has tried to avoid controversies by repeatedly emphasising that no language would be imposed on any state or region. The Centre in June 2019 dropped a controversial clause in the draft NEP that mandated the compulsory teaching of Hindi in schools across the country after protests by southern states over the alleged imposition of the language.Modi said there has been no allegation from any region or segment of the society that NEP has any kind of bias or inclination. He called it an indicator that people have seen the changes they wanted for years in the education system. Modi added the route to good, quality education falls somewhere between autonomy and government control.However, Kerala education Minister Prof C Raveendranath said the new education policy will destroy the federal structure of education system and snatch the power granted to states to design their syllabus. “We have reservations over several proposals. We have suggested many recommendations but they were overlooked,” he said. Telangana Congress leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka said the Prime Minister’s talk on the new education policy was more of an emotional appeal, rather than logical thinking. “While Modi talks of the NEP laying foundation for new India of 21st century, in reality, it appears he is taking India into medieval periods,” Vikramarka said. Modi on Friday said the policy could even lead to changing the way the society thinks, rather than just effecting changes to the teaching and learning system. He added that he is totally committed to NEP and has the political will to see it through.Modi said every country aligns its education policy with its values and carries out reforms keeping in mind the national goals, and NEP will lay foundation of the 21st century India.“The aim is to ensure the education system can make coming generations future-ready... For a long time, there were no major changes in our education system. Rather than promoting curiosity and imagination, the emphasis was on a rat race whether it was to become doctor, engineer.”The PM said that a new world order is evolving, and India has to make its students global citizens who stay connected to their roots. “In the new policy, the focus is on how to think,” he said. “We are also moving towards an era where a person may not stick to a profession throughout life and re-skilling and up-skilling are important aspects,” he added.Welcoming the policy, Dr Inder Mohan Kapahy, a former University Grants Commission member said “It [NEP] aims at rebooting the entire education system from pre-primary to advance research stages. Emphasis upon teaching in the mother tongue or the local language, is one of the most potent step in this direction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-education-policy-free-from-any-bias-says-modi/story-RuCHzBjgcqHizEDTOUcSZJ.html

While the SOPs have been approved, the people added, asking not to be named, the final decision on reopening schools will be taken by the ministry of home affairs. The technical wing of the directorate general of health services in June drafted SOPs on reopening educational institutions in the lines of SoPs issued for reopening of malls, hotels, restaurants, gymnasiums, yoga classes, religious places, they said, but having the SOPs in place doesn’t mean schools will reopen as soon as the restrictions end. The issue is a contentious, controversial, and complex one -- everywhere in the world. The Australian state of Victoria, for instance, has just shut schools for six weeks after a resurgence of the pandemic, although this hasn’t been traced back to the schools. In May, Israel was forced to do the same after a so-called second wave of infections -- and in the country’s case, these were directly attributable to the schools. In the US, some states have reopened schools, but many have also shut down again following Covid-19 infections. The education ministry requested that the SOPs be created after other facilities were being opened in phases, the people said. They added that the health ministry drafted them. They recommend getting only senior school children in at first -- and in shifts -- and stringent social distancing norms with neither student nor staff strength exceeding a third of pre-pandemic strengths. Still, one of the officials familiar with the matter said, “the decision of reopening around September 1 seems remote as of now but since it is a dynamic situation, and decisions tend to change as per requirement. The SOPs will come into effect only when a decision is taken in this regard.” To be sure, the decision is also likely to be left to the states. Part of the desire to reopen schools in India also stems from the digital divide which affects many students from underprivileged backgrounds from attending online classes. A second official added that the issue of schools reopening came up for discussion ahead of the last set of guidelines issued on July 29, but that no decision was taken because” taken as it was believed that education ministry was still engaging with states, and more importantly with parents.” The first official said that several rounds of discussion with the states have been held and that “most states and almost all parents are not in favour of reopening.” The discussion on schools comes amidst a surge in Covid-19 cases. India crossed the 2 million mark in terms of number of cases on Thursday, becoming only the third country in the world to reach this number. It added its second million in exactly three weeks. There has been no let up in the number of daily cases too and the pandemic has clearly moved into the hinterland and the peninsula. The people said that the SoPs suggest reducing student strength in a class, maintaining physical distancing, wearing of masks, training teachers in picking up early signs of respiratory distress, and keeping gadgets such as pulse oximeters handy . Those students already suffering from any of the chronic respiratory illnesses should avoid attending, they added. According to paper published in JAMA Pediatrics by doctors from the infectious diseases and pediatrics departments of the Ann and Robert H Lurie Children’s Hospital, Chicago, and from the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, children younger than five have higher viral loads and could be “drivers” of the infection in “the general population.” The study was silent on the role of older children as potential super spreaders. Doctors say that the government should wait for some more time before going ahead with reopening of schools. “More time should be given before schools are reopened. Children will be moving in closed spaces and could get infected and be carriers. They will bring infection home, and many will have grandparents and other vulnerable people at home who will be at risk. It is a strict no-no not only for places where disease burden is high but also in places where we are seeing a steady decline, the government should wait and consolidate the gains. Ideally, I would say, open only next year,” said Dr Rahul Nagpal, senior paediatrician, Fortis Healthcare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sop-ready-no-plan-to-open-schools-for-now/story-YuTjqLxlBcRmJILxJ7EgfI.html

Other citizens of these countries can apply for Indian visas for business, medical and employment purposes while Indians can also travel there on any visa type.India has signed so-called air bubble arrangements with the US, UK, Germany, and France for bilateral air travel amid international travel restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic.A bilateral air bubble refers to a travel corridor between two countries that wish to reopen their borders and re-establish connections with each other.International flights to and from India were suspended since March 23 as the Covid-19 pandemic spread across the world. The notification said for Indians travelling to these four countries, it would be the responsibility of airlines concerned to ensure that there is no travel restriction on their travel with a particular visa category before the issue of tickets, and boarding passes. It added the existing restrictions on incoming passenger traffic into India through the immigration check posts will not apply to any movement of cargo or goods and supplies in any vehicle, aircraft, ship, train, etc along with their crew.The government in June allowed certain categories of foreign nationals, including OCI cardholders to enter India. They included foreign nationals married to Indian citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oci-card-holders-can-travel-to-india-now/story-ON9NryZ4Ol3ciNgXBMpoxO.html

You have to give an explanation to that,” justice R Subhash Reddy told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Jammu & Kashmir administration.Justice Reddy is a part of a three-judge bench hearing a petition of NGO Foundation for Media Professionals seeking contempt proceedings against the Centre and Jammu & Kashmir administration for their failure in complying with the Supreme Court’s May 11 directions for a review of restrictions on the mobile internet speed. Murmu, who was succeeded by Manoj Sinha as the lieutenant governor on Friday, said on July 24 the restoration of 4G services will not be a problem and Pakistan will continue with its propaganda even if the mobile internet speed is restricted to 2G. The Centre has cited Islamabad’s propaganda while justifying the restrictions.The petitioners highlighted Murmu’s statement to argue for the restoration of 4G services when the matter was heard on July 28.Mehta sought time to file a response to the petitioner’s rejoinder. The court allowed it and adjourned the case until August 11 even as it said no further adjournments will be allowed.“L-G is not part of the review committee. In your response, do not go strictly by whether or not contempt is there. You should also say whether 4G can be restored in areas [where there are no troubles,” justice Reddy said.The Centre on July 28 told the Supreme Court it will verify media reports that said Murmu has advocated the restoration of high-speed 4G internet services. This came days after the Centre filed an affidavit before the court on July 21, saying a special panel constituted as per the latter’s May 11 order has decided against any relaxations for now. The Centre said the restrictions would continue for two more months before they are reviewed again. It added the panel constituted for the review on June 10 considered all aspects of the matter, including terror strikes, before deciding to continue the restrictions on 4G services.The May 11 order was passed after the NGO in April challenged restrictions on mobile internet speed to 2G. The NGO sought restoration of 4G services saying patients, doctors, and the general public were unable to access the latest information, guidelines, advisories and restrictions about Covid-19 pandemic because of the restrictions. It pointed out that slow internet speeds make telemedicine, or online consultation, impossible.The Supreme Court on May 11 refrained from passing directions to restore 4G services and instead ordered a constitution of the panel comprising high-level government officers, including the Union home secretary, to take a call on the matter.The NGO in June filed the contempt petition saying there was no information available whether the constitution of the panel was notified and whether it has conducted any meetings or passed any orders.The Centre told the court the panel was constituted by virtue of the May 11 order and no separate notification was required. The panel met on May 15 and sought further inputs before taking any decision. It again met on June 10 and decided not to relax the restrictions, the Centre said.A communications blackout and a lockdown were imposed in Jammu & Kashmir in August last year as part of measures to prevent protests against the Centre’s move to divest the region of its special status. Most of the restrictions have since been eased even as mobile internet remains restricted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explore-restoring-j-k-s-4g-services-sc-tells-centre/story-wUCkEO0uEb1XCc2D7KeD6M.html

08-08-2020||India||Coronavirus: SII partners with vaccine developers for 100mn doses||Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) announced on Friday that it has partnered with Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) to manufacture and deliver 100 million doses of two Covid-19 vaccine candidates, the first deal yet to secure doses for India as well as 91 other low- and middle-income countries. The deal involves SII – the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer -- receiving $150 million to produce 100 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine by the first half of 2021 and offer it at $3 (roughly ₹225) for a shot. The Serum Institute has partnered with the developers of two potential vaccines – UK’s Oxford-AstraZeneca and United States’ Novavax. The UK vaccine is largely considered the front-runner, having proven to be effective and safe in large human trials. Under the partnership, BMGF will provide US$150 million to Gavi to support SII for manufacturing one or both of the vaccines to be distributed under a fair-access mechanism developed by the World Health Organization. The mechanism, called Covax, has till now seen 78 well-off countries expressing interest to fund acquisition and distribution of the vaccines among them as well as 92 low- and middle-income countries.Which vaccines will finally be produced depends on the results of the clinical trials underway, and the regulatory approvals that will need to be secured. Subsequently, GAVI will procure these for US$3 or less for 92 LMICs included in Gavi’s COVAX advance market commitment, with an option of obtaining additional doses, if needed. In all, there are six vaccine candidates in phase III trials with the frontrunners expected to show conclusive signs of viability by the end of 2020 or early 2021. Several of these developers have entered into separate deals with countries. The Union health ministry on July 30 said India is yet to enter into any such deals and will first wait for more clarity on an effective vaccine from among the candidates. “Making sure everyone has access to them (safe and effective vaccines for Covid-19), as soon as possible will require tremendous manufacturing capacity and a global distribution network. This collaboration gives the world some of both: the power of India’s manufacturing sector and Gavi’s supply chain,” said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, in a statement. “To ensure maximum immunisation coverage and contain the pandemic, it is important to make sure that the most remote and poorest countries of the world have access to affordable cure and preventive measures. Through this association, we seek to ramp up our constant efforts to save the lives of millions of people from this dreadful disease,” said Adar Poonawalla, CEO, Serum Institute of India, which is the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, in an email. “The vaccines will cost a maximum of $3 per dose, but the pricing will ultimately depend on which product is procured. We cannot guarantee a price until the regulatory and procurement processes are complete, according to the vaccine-manufacturer,” SII said. SII produces 60% of the world’s vaccines that are used across the world, and Gavi has been a key procurer, having bought vaccines against meningitis, severe diarrhoea, pneumonia and measles for LMICs. Apart from the 100 million doses being procured by GAVI, AstraZeneca reached a licensing agreement with SII to supply one billion doses for LMICs by the end of 2020. On July 30, SII also partnered with the US-based Novavax for exclusive rights for development, distribution, and commercialisation of its Covid-19 vaccine in India, and non-exclusive rights in LMICs during the ‘pandemic period,’ as defined by the WHO. “It’s encouraging to see an Indian vaccine manufacturer collaborate with global partners to provide affordable Covid-19 vaccines for India and the world. Normally, it would take more than a decade to develop such a vaccine but with the efforts of our researchers, academia and private sector, working closely with global collaborators, we are hopeful of accelerating the availability of a successful vaccine at reasonable cost and in sufficient quantities to fight the pandemic,” said K VijayRaghavan, principal scientific adviser to the Government of India. Friday’s collaboration supports the efforts of the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator’s vaccines pillar, also known as COVAX, co-led by Gavi, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and World Health Organization (WHO), to accelerate the development and ensure rapid, global access to of vaccines. If successful, AstraZeneca’s vaccine will be available to 57 Gavi-eligible countries, and Novavax’s candidate vaccine will be available to all 92 countries supported by the advanced marketing commitment. “It’s just a start. Organizations like Gavi and CEPI need much more support to facilitate development and delivery of hundreds of millions -- maybe billions -- of vaccine doses by next year,” said Gates. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said three experimental vaccines have entered stage 2/3 clinical trials in India this month. Bharat Biotech vaccine Covaxin is being developed in collaboration ICMR is readying for phase-2 trials, while the DST-supported Zydus Cadila DNA vaccine began phase 2 trial on August 6. SII will begin phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of AstraZeneca’s vaccine Covishield in 17 sites over the next few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-partners-with-vaccine-developers-for-100mn-doses/story-mbazDK6PIBhY3W6ttfvYKJ.html
08-08-2020||India||Half of annual job quota of MGNREGS over by July||The migrant workers, who were forced to return to their homes after losing their jobs because of the Covid-19 pandemic, continue to face an uncertain future as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) funds are quickly getting exhausted and the Union skill development ministry has been able to provide jobs to only a few thousand people.At a meeting of Parliamentary standing committee on labour on Friday, rural development secretary Nagendra Nath Sinha informed lawmakers that 1.55 billion person-days have been generated out of the targeted 3 billion person-days for the entire year. He said in July this year, the demand for jobs was three-fold than last year.On the other hand, the skill development ministry has been able to provide jobs to just 5,000 migrant workers so far out of 2.4 million skilled workers they mapped across 116 districts, underlining a slow pace of job generation for the daily wagers.At the meeting, skill development ministry secretary Praveen Kumar said they have been able to map 2.4 million workers under the PM’s Garib Kalyan Rozgar Yojna. They also found that 0.21 million job opportunities have been posted on a dedicated portal for migrant workers.Kumar said finally 48,000 jobs were offered and out of them, just 5,000 workers found placement.The panel, led by Biju Janata Dal’s Bhartruhari Mahtab, asked Sinha about MGNREGS and expressed concerns the Rs 1 lakh crore fund for it may soon get exhausted.But the ministry claimed the demand for MGNREGS jobs is expected to slide in the coming months as more and more people are going to be engaged with other works and return to cities.Sinha did not commit if the government has any plan to increase the ceiling of 100 days of work under MGNREGS amid job losses.Officials said increasing annual limit might be difficult as the ministry might not get so many resources to handle an expanded programme. Sinha told the panel that some funds such as state mineral funds and finance commission funds are stuck with some states.The flagship job scheme, once criticized by a section of the politicians for rampant corruption, has emerged as the main source of income for the rural poor in this distress. The government pumped in an unprecedented Rs 1.01 lakh crore in the programme to generate 3 billion person-days of work to help jobless migrant labourers in their villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fewer-nregs-jobs-for-migrant-workers/story-YCp7Zuf1iZDNsGRWwLHg8N.html

They were also involved in the screening of the migrant labourers, who were forced to return to their homes after they were left jobless by the Covid-19 pandemic.Many of Bihar’s nearly 90,000 ASHA workers have been on a strike since August 6. Sarita Roy, 37, who has been staging a sit-in protest along with 30 other ASHA workers in Bihar’s Begusarai, said they have also not been provided proper personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. “We go to areas where there are hundreds of cases but have not even been provided with personal protective equipment kits,” said Roy, who has been an ASHA worker since 2007.Roy said they have not been paid for the last four months. She added two of her fellow workers, Kiran and Sarita Devi, have tested Covid-19 positive and lost two others to the disease. “We are not provided with the equipment even as we carry out all immunization tasks and even document maternity rates.” She said they are paid just Rs 5,000 a month and that too they have not received for the last four months.Also read: Centre releases Rs 890 crore as 2nd tranche of package for Covid-19 health system preparednessThe ASHA workers have been credited with helping India eradicate polio and reducing the number of women dying during childbirth. They have been involved in ensuring maternal health and immunization in rural areas with limited medical facilities.Jyoti Sahare, a 45-year-old Aanganwadi worker in Maharashtra, said that the government must provide safety equipment to them. “We have families too. If we contract the virus, they will be at direct risk,” she said. “We need protective equipment.”HT reached out to the women and child development ministry, which oversees the Anganwadi programme, for comments but received no reply.Jeet Kaur, 48, who has been ASHA worker in Punjab for 12 years, said people are not forthcoming when they go for door-to-door surveys. She added they have also been attacked. “We have been slapped, chased and abused,” said Kaur, who visits nearly 50 houses daily.The Initiative of Health Equity and Society director Mira Shiva said the workers would not have needed to go on strike if they were given their due. “If ASHA workers, who are basically women, were given due remuneration for their work, measures for the protection and treated with dignity after their many appeals, they would not have needed to go on strike.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/600k-asha-anganwadi-staff-on-2-day-strike-over-payments/story-s02f8mYsC9kR8mGz6s74ZP.html

08-08-2020||India||India grants three important relaxations for international travellers, details here||The Indian government has announced three important relaxations for international travellers including allowing OCI card holders from US, UK, Germany and France to visit India, according to an official notification issued by the civil aviation ministry on Friday.India had earlier established air bubbles with the above four countries creating an air corridor for operation of limited flights between India and these countries. In the second important relaxation, the ministry has also given a nod to Indians holding any valid visa-- including for tourism-- issued by these four countries to travel to these destinations, provided there are no restrictions imposed on entry of Indian nationals holding a particular kind of visa, by authorities in these countries. The government has put the onus of checking, if such restrictions specific to each country exist, on the airlines operating to these destinations.“Any Indian national holding any type of valid visa of such countries may be permitted to travel to the country concerned provided there is no travel restriction for entry of Indian nationals in that country. It would be for the airlines concerned to ensure there is no travel restriction for Indian nationals to enter the country concerned with the particular visa category before issue of tickets/boarding pass to the Indian passenger,” the new order said.The third relaxation allows foreigners in the above four countries to travel to India for business, medical and employment purposes.The latest notification modifies the last guidelines issued on June 30 listing out conditions for international travel.International flights were suspended in March earlier this year after the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic. Government later allowed Air India and other careers to evacuate Indian citizens stuck abroad under the Vande Bharat mission. The relaxations were later expanded to include more categories of passengers, including from countries with which India signed agreements for creation of air bubbles. Regular international travel has not resumed yet. Earlier this month, the ministry of civil aviation extended restrictions on limited domestic flight operations and caps on air fares till November 24 in an order issued on July 24. Centre at present has allowed domestic flight operations to function at 45% of their total capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-grants-three-major-relaxations-for-international-travellers-details-here/story-er99Xju9F4hEoz6Wy6SAHM.html
08-08-2020||India||RBI allows one-time recast of retail loans to soften Covid blow||:The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept interest rates on hold on Thursday and gave lenders the power to restructure certain loans – including individual as well as corporate loans – as it sought to strike a balance between helping revive growth in pandemic-battered economy and keeping rising inflation in check.RBI governor Shaktikanta Das sounded a note of caution that a prolonged spread of Covid-19 poses “downside risk” for the domestic economy, but assured that the central bank will use the available monetary space “judiciously” to boost growth.“At the end of its deliberations, the monetary policy committee (MPC) voted unanimously to leave the policy repo rate unchanged at 4% and continue with the accommodative stance of monetary policy as long as necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of Covid-19, while ensuring inflation remains within the target going forward,” Das said after the rate-setting panel concluded its three-day meeting.Das warned India’s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is set to contract in 2020-21, but did not give a specific forecast. “An early containment of the Covid-19 pandemic may impart an upside to the outlook. A more protracted spread of the pandemic, deviations from the forecast of a normal monsoon and global financial market volatility are key downside risks,” he said.The repo rate was left at 4.0% and the reverse repo rate at 3.35%. To ease debt pressure on borrowers hit by a fall in earnings as well as lenders staring at bad debt, the RBI said it would allow restructuring of corporate and retail loans, a move that was widely awaited by the industry. Banks can strike rescheduling agreements with borrowers that were on track to repay their loans on March 1, in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. The move came ahead of the expiry of a blanket loan moratorium later this month. Industry estimates peg the total quantum of loans coming up for recast at ₹5-8 trillion, or 5-8% of the ₹101 trillion loan book.“A large number of firms that otherwise maintain a good track record under existing promoters face the challenge of their debt burden becoming disproportionate, relative to their cash flow generation abilities,” Das said.Borrowers will be eligible for resolution under this framework if they were classified as standard, but not in default for more than 30 days with any lending institution as on March 1, 2020. The central bank said the resolution plan may be invoked till December 31, 2020 and shall have to be implemented within 180 days (90 days for retail accounts) from the date of invocation.The central bank set up an expert committee under the chairmanship of veteran banker KV Kamath to make recommendations to RBI on the required financial parameters, along with the sector-specific benchmarks for the special window. The underlying theme of the plan “is the preservation of the soundness of the Indian banking sector,” Das added.Banks have been struggling with stagnating credit growth to revive the economy, which is set for its first annual contraction in more than four decades. The decision to slow forbearance differs from Australia -- where policy makers granted hard-pressed borrowers a further four months before they must repay their loans -- and China, which extended some relief through March 2021.“It is good that the RBI didn’t extend the moratorium because it was purely kicking the can down the road,” news agency PTI quoted Ananth Narayan, a professor of finance at SP Jain Institute of Management and Research and regional head of financial markets for South Asia at Standard Chartered Plc as saying. “With restructuring, disclosures from banks and financial institutions will improve dramatically. The RBI is trying to give relief, at the same time make sure the package is credible and is not seen as dilution of norms,” he added.While economic activity started to recover from the lows of April-May, a surge in fresh infections forced several states to return to lockdowns, the governor said during the RBI press briefing. The MPC sees upside risks to food prices and elevated headline inflation during July-September, which would ease in the second half of 2020-21 fiscal, and forecasts a contraction in real GDP growth for April 2020 to March 2021 fiscal, the central bank head added.Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, speaking at an event in Mumbai on Thursday, called on policymakers to focus on protecting the economy instead of being overly focused on what ratings agencies think.“It is also important to convince both domestic and international investors that after the crisis associated with the pandemic is over, we will return to fiscal responsibility over the medium term, and the government should do more to convince them of that,” Rajan told the Global Markets Forum.“The RBI and government have certainly been cooperating, but it seems like it is elsewhere, the ball is in the government’s court to do more,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rbi-allows-one-time-recast-of-retail-loans-to-soften-covid-blow/story-Uc3hSRPiSZNZ3VZqy6rmvJ.html

The 55-year-old, who joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2014 after spending three decades as a National Conference (NC) activist, says that political workers like him have been “empowered” by the BJP’s sidelining of old political faces and “dynasts” over the past year. People who see the BJP as a communal entity do question him for joining the party, he says, but calls it “fake propaganda.”“Villagers come to me with hope and I try to get their work done. For workers like me, the [effective] abrogation of special status was the biggest achievement, which opened the doors for us and development of panchayats,” Sofi says, taking notes from his visitors as four armed police guards keep watch on the road leading to his house.A year after Parliament pushed through constitutional changes that divested Jammu & Kashmir of its special status and bifurcated the state into two Union territories, J&K and Ladakh, people associated with the BJP have a new sense of empowerment. Other mainstream politicians have been sidelined, and many are still under house arrest.Even Syed Altaf Bukhari, the chief of the fledgling Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party, which was conceived as an alternative to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the NC, is complaining.“We were promised that abrogation of Article 370 would bring massive development, employment opportunities, industrialization, and an influx of tourists. One year down the line, nothing has happened,” said Bukhari, a former minister. “The economy has gone from bad to worse, the tourism sector is in shambles and there is nobody on the ground to hear the voices of people. Bureaucracy is unresponsive, indifferent, and insensitive.”Hasnain Masoodi, the NC MP from south Kashmir, who was the first to challenge the revocation of Article 370 that conferred special status on J&K, said the admission of the petition by the Supreme Court had sent a message that opponents of the move had a strong case.“One year has passed and from one lockdown to another lockdown which the people have faced... the Centre should read the writing on the wall and undo what has been done to J&K. The people are silent but they have not reconciled [with the decision],” Masoodi said.Negative PeaceMost PDP leaders, including party president and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, are under detention. Mufti, detained under the Public Safety Act, had her detention extended by three more months on July 31.“Last time when I spoke, I was detained for a year and continue to remain under house arrest. The situation is as fragile as it was always. People are sad. There is complete silence in Kashmir particularly in South Kashmir,” said PDP youth wing president, Waheed Ur Rehman Parra. Parra called the silence “negative peace which is enforced by fear.”“There is the absence of politics and dissent is criminalised...Cases against media, mainstream people, and sidelining of locals in the system have further gripped us with insecurity,” he said. “BJP deleted our 70 years of investment in peace, democracy, and changed definitions of democracy across India.”Sofi Yusuf of the BJP said the party had only fulfilled its years-old promise by revoking Article 370. “Due to restrictions and now Covid-19, development could not take place but now things have started moving up and many developmental projects are being completed,” Sofi said. “Leaders of other parties should come forward to accelerate the process.”Sense of alienationMuzaffar Shah, vice president of the Awami National Conference, said not only the Kashmir Valley, but even the Jammu region and Ladakh want the return of Article 370 and Article 35A, which allowed the erstwhile state assembly to define permanent residents of J&K. “Earlier, it was India, Pakistan, and the people of Kashmir that were party to the dispute, now there is China also. This is what BJP has done to J&K,” he said and vowed to fight the case in the Supreme Court. China has opposed the Indian moves in J&K.The business community also feels aggrieved. Chairman of the Kashmir Chamber of Industries, Sheikh Ashiq, said: ‘’Forget about development, our survival is at stake. We have lost ~40,000 crores. The employers here have turned unemployed,’’ he said. Even ordinary people nurse a sense of disenchantment. “People here are seething in anger and can erupt any time as they feel they have been pushed to the wall and robbed of everything ,” said lawyer Mudasir Naqashband.Opinion in the Ladakh region appears divided with many in Muslim-majority Kargil seeking to be a part of a J&K state. The sentiment appears to finds no traction in the predominantly Buddhist Leh. Both regions have common concerns about their rights to land and jobs.“We never demanded a UT [Union Territory]. We were and will remain against the abrogation of the special status and bifurcation of the state. Today people in Ladakh have no land and job security,” said Sajjad Kargili, a social activist in Kargil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-land-rights-lack-of-jobs-still-haunt-2-regions/story-kYa1xl2COoHgGPpkZFwkiN.html
