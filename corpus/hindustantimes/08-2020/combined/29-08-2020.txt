29-08-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Congress, BJP in war of words over filmmaker Sandeep Ssingh||The Maharashtra unit of Congress on Saturday levelled more allegations against film producer Sandeep Ssingh and raised questions about his proximity to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has rubbished the claims and said the truth will come out in the ongoing Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.When HT called Ssingh for a comment, his phone was switched off, and he had not responded to messages till the time of going to press.In a series of tweets, Maharashtra Congress general secretary and party spokesperson Sachin Sawant said Ssingh had called the office of BJP’s Maharashtra unit 53 times between September 1 and December 23 last year. Sawant alleged that Ssingh, producer of the biopic on PM Narendra Modi, was also the only filmmaker to have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) worth ₹177 crore with the Gujarat government for the Vibrant Gujarat Summit in 2019.The BJP, however, termed the allegations “baseless”. Party leader Madhu Chavan said Sawant’s allegations are out of his “perverse political mindset”. “He [Ssingh] was allowed to produce a film on Modiji because he was an able filmmaker. How is BJP linked with his wrongdoings in his personal life? We would not back him if he is guilty and would want CBI to probe all angles. Even the Congress and its state government are free to probe all these allegations. Sawant is known for false, baseless allegations against BJP and its leaders,” Chavan said.Sawant had on Friday, too, demanded a probe into the alleged nexus between the Ssingh and BJP in connection with Rajput’s death. Sawant had written to CM Uddhav Thackeray and home minister Anil Deshmukh seeking a probe into the drug dealing in Bollywood. He claimed Ssingh has links with BJP leaders from the state. Sawant had said it needs to be investigated if leaders had been shielding people involved in narcotics dealings. Responding to Sawant’s allegations, BJP leader and former CM Devendra Fadnavis had questioned why the state did not probe the Ssingh angle. “The state police kept maintaining it [Rajput’s death] was a suicide. They should have probed Ssingh too. Now a news has come about how Sssingh was co-producing a biopic on the life of honourable Bal Thackeray a few years ago. What will Congress now say about that link,” he said.Deshmukh on Saturday said they are sending complaints about Ssingh to CBI. “I have received many requests and complaints to investigate the relationship between Ssingh and BJP and also regarding his connection with Bollywood and drug dealing. We are sending them to CBI for investigation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-congress-bjp-in-war-of-words-over-filmmaker-sandeep-ssingh/story-BNMWWfy8H3LYgAu7h7EOmN.html

On August 24, a five-storey residential building collapsed in a residential area of Mahad in Raigad district, killing 16 people and injuring nine others.“Following the Mahad building collapse, the civic body has decided to make sure all the extremely-dangerous buildings in Bhiwandi limits are vacated, and no residents are occupying them. A review meeting was held to check on such unsafe buildings, and needful action will be taken,” said Pankaj Ashiya, commissioner, BNCMC. “It is our request to residents to not occupy extremely-dangerous structures and to move out quickly if they are living in one. Also, we have warned people not to buy properties in illegal constructions,” said Ashiya. In the C1 category, which comprises extremely dangerous buildings that the civic body has listed, 25 structures have been identified, of which six have been demolished. Work to vacate the remaining structures and raze them is underway. Water and power supply to these structures have already been cut off. The civic body has identified 82 structures in the C2 category (dangerous buildings), of which 77 have been vacated while three structures are under litigation. The remaining two will be reviewed soon, and residents will be vacated. “Some properties should be repaired immediately. Notices have been issued to around 222 structures in the municipal area,” said Ashiya. These 222 structures come under C2B and C3 categories, which means they can be repaired while residents occupy the structures. As per the civic body, it is necessary to submit a structural stability certificate which states that the property is suitable for use and fit for habitation by making structural joint changes and repairs as suggested by experts. The civic body has found that many property owners have not followed this procedure. “Therefore, the corporation will not be responsible if any property falls and there is a loss of life and property. Also, the corporation will take action against unauthorised buildings that are being erected in the city. Water and power supply to unauthorised buildings will not be provided. This must be noted by all citizens,” added Ashiya. “We have also put up banners at all extremely dangerous structures so that people are aware of it. We have managed to take action against all those structures that have been identified this year. In the coming days, buildings which are older than 30 years will also be identified. We will ask to check their structural stability through an architecture panel. The tender process for appointing the architecture panel will be carried out in September,” said Deepak Sawant, deputy commissioner, BNCMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhiwandi-civic-body-reviews-dangerous-structures-after-mahad-building-collapse/story-AkgaoXvGwjmjxdkVez2IzL.html

On Saturday morning, the Uran range forest officer and his team visited areas where mangrove hacking was reported. It was identified that the land belonged to the City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd (Cidco) – the planning agency for Navi Mumbai – which had leased it to a private company. “The RFO’s (range forest officer) inspection revealed 11-14 trees were damaged,” said Ashish Thakre, deputy conservator of forest (Alibag) adding, “Two separate letters have been issued. The first one is being sent to the Uran tehsildar (revenue officer) to initiate action in the matter as an offence under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, and the other to Cidco asking them to explain whether they are aware of the environmental violation.” The revenue department said they will conduct their own site visit on Monday after receiving details from the forest department. Destruction of mangroves or any activity including reclamation, debris dumping or construction within 50m was banned by the Bombay high court in September 2018. “Destruction of mangroves offended the fundamental rights of the citizens and hence it was a mandatory duty of the state and its agencies and instrumentalities to protect and preserve the mangroves. There shall be a total freeze on the destruction and cutting of mangroves in the entire state,” the order passed by the division bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Riyaz Chagla said. At Panje, local resident and birder Parag Gharat on Wednesday and Friday found mangrove trees chopped at the site. He had alleged at least 40 trees had been cut. This was followed by a series of complaints by environment groups Conservation Action Trust, NatConnect Foundation, Shree Ekvira Aai Pratishthan and Paramparik Machhimar Bachao Kruti Samiti, requesting action against culprits. Cidco officials said they were aware about the issue and had already drafted their response. “We have spoken to the private company and will be asking the Uran tahsildar to book unidentified persons for hacking mangroves at the site. Though a security guard has been appointed by the private company, there are multiple entry points to this area,” said Pramod Patil, nodal officer (environment), Cidco adding, “Similar cases have happened before too where mangroves were hacked by a group of people intending on using the tree barks for supporting nets for aquaculture purposes in this area. This seems to be the case here as well.” Located to the west of Dongri and Panje villages, this wetland is enclosed by an eight to 10-feet-high concrete wall and therefore, almost isolated from tidal influence. The western end of the site is bordered with a narrow patch of mangrove (300–500m wide and 1.5 km long), where destruction was reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-forest-department-confirms-mangroves-were-hacked-at-navi-mumbai-s-panje-owner-cidco-to-respond/story-tLkUs7GIIbHDc4zP1Rz7pN.html

The accused were arrested the following night after they were identified in the CCTV footage. The two allegedly stole seven silver idols and money from donation box to pay for their drug addiction. According to the NRI Coastal police, the accused have been identified as Vipul Jadhav, 20, and Salman Khan, 19, both residents of Karave village. The accused duo broke the lock of Laxmi Nayaran temple in Sector 36 at Karave village in Seawoods in the early hours of Tuesday. “Both the accused have criminal antecedents of committing thefts to pay for their drug usage. Taking advantage of shut temples, the men broke into the temple by breaking the lock at the gate,” said an officer from NRI Coastal police station. The men decamped with seven silver idols of several deities from the temple weighing about 1 kg collectively, along with puja instrument and donation box containing ₹10,000. They were captured in the CCTV camera near the temple, based on which they were identified. The police managed to trace the suspects in the same village while they were trying to sell the idols to a jeweller. Before the men could make the transaction, officials nabbed them. At the time of their arrest, police were only able to recover six idols from their possession. Officers said they suspect that the accused spent the cash, while an investigation is ongoing to recover the remaining idol and another puja instrument. Officers said Jadhav has five other cases of theft against him at NRI Coastal police station while Khan has only one case of theft against him at Sanpada police station. The duo planned to steal the idols from the temples as no devotees are frequenting temples during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-arrested-for-stealing-seven-silver-idols-from-temple-in-navi-mumbai/story-LUkbf4IBcYkUpMYZjoRNDO.html

Ravindra Lingayat, a member of the organisation said, “We started an awareness campaign against the floral waste being dumped into the river last year. We created awareness on social media and appealed to the people to bring only the idol to the water body and not the nirmalaya. Most people followed this, so we collected merely 15 tons as opposed to 50 tons the previous year.” A team of around 80 volunteers prevented people from throwing nirmalaya and plastic into the river. The nirmalaya was segregated from thermacol, food items, puja items or paper decorations and was dumped into pits to turn it into compost by the volunteers. The plastic found will be recycled while the food item and whole coconut were distributed to the tribals in nearby villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-group-collects-floral-waste-from-ulhas-river/story-3eA8HKrjIifwd4C3zttGpN.html
29-08-2020||Mumbai||MCOCA court starts process of recalling its bail order to 3 Ravi Pujari gang members||About a fortnight after granting bail to three alleged members of Ravi Pujari gang booked in two separate cases, the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court has started the process for recalling its order after realising that it had not taken into consideration the provisions of MCOCA. The special MCOCA judge RR Bhosale had granted bail to three alleged members of Ravi Pujari gang –Bipin Patil, Asif Abdul Sattar Khan and Sufiyan Dilshad Shaikh, who have been booked in separate cases.Khan and Shaikh are booked in connection with firing at filmmaker Karim Morani and were granted bail on August 3 and August 17 respectively. Patil, charged for conspiring to attack a Dombivli based builder, was granted bail on August 18. The three were granted bail primarily on the ground that they had already spent half of the maximum sentence prescribed for the offences for which they were booked. The court has now issued notices to defence and prosecution for recalling the order of granting bail to the trio and to take them in custody.“It was later brought to the notice of the court that the accused are also booked under the stringent provisions of MCOCA and if found guilty for the charges, they can be sentenced to life imprisonment,” said Pradeep Gharat, a special public prosecutor in case of firing at Karim Morani. The court had granted bail as per the provisions of section 436 –A of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). However, Gharat said as offences for which the accused are booked provides for punishment up to imprisonment of life, provisions of CrPC would not apply. “The court has now issued notice to all parties to initiate the process to take the accused in custody,” Gharat said. The court while issuing the notice to both prosecution and defence, observed that the accused were granted bail on the ground that they each have undergone detention for half of the maximum imprisonment specified for the offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code only. “However, while passing that order, the statutory provisions of imprisonment for offences punishable under MCOCA were not dealt with,” said the notice issued by the court on Thursday, asking all parties to appear before it on next date of hearing.The following day on Friday, the prosecution filed say in both the cases. Chief public prosecutor Jaisingh Desai, who appeared in Patil’s case and Gharat appeared in the second case. They argued that the court has the power to take accused in custody under CrPC. The defence, however, objected to this and said the court cannot cancel the bail granted by it and recall its own order. The defence, however, sought time to file a detailed reply. The court has now scheduled the matter for further hearing next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mcoca-court-starts-process-of-recalling-its-bail-order-to-3-ravi-pujari-gang-members/story-VD1LKpjlbMx3TOInFAwiFI.html

29-08-2020||Mumbai||Ride within Bandra Kurla Complex with new e-bike facility from August 31||At a time when public transport options are minimal in the city, commuters will be able to travel in and around Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) using a newly launched electric bike facility. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) along with app-based e-bike sharing platform Yulu, will start providing the service from today (August 31).Around 100 bikes will be available at nine different zones (like docking stations) at BKC, including two zones near the Bandra and Kurla suburban railway stations. Commuters will have to download the app, pay ₹5 to unlock the bike, post which they will be charged ₹1.5 per minute for the ride. Around nine additional zones will be added subsequently, with more bikes, officials said, adding that the bikes will be ideal for short-distance commutes. RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, said, “The chief minister had inaugurated the bikes in January, but there were some delays owing to the pandemic. The service will start on August 31.” Yulu was one among the top nine teams selected by MMRDA in November 2019, when the authority conducted a challenge for smart mobility solutions in the city.With the authority developing a 337-km Metro network in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), it has decided to also invest in last-mile mobility solutions. MMRDA recently invited bids for planning a transit system in BKC as it is cumbersome to reach the commercial hub from the two suburban railway stations. It also recently approved a plan to establish a multi-modal integration at 30 stations of Metro 2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro 7 (Dahisar East-Andheri East) corridors, expected to be operational by May 2021.Commuters can download the Yulu app from the Google Playstore and locate the nearest Yulu zone. They can then scan the QR code or enter the vehicle number to unlock the bike for ₹5. Users can later end the ride on the app and will be charged accordingly. Commuters have to also pay a refundable security deposit of ₹199 for the service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ride-within-bandra-kurla-complex-with-new-e-bike-facility-from-august-31/story-8QHErsor26yX14Q9WvOYQN.html

The accumulated rain water entered the shops near the Clock Tower with waves wafting into the shops due to movement of vehicles.One of the shopkeepers on railway station road, Chander Kant Chadda, said, “It has been a decade facing the problem of waterlogging, but the civic body has failed to find a solution. Water enters the shops. Many vehicles get damaged, but no one pays heed to the problem.” A transporter, Amandeep Singh, said, “Several requests have been submitted with the MC in the past to improve the condition of roads in Transport Nagar, but to no avail. Deep potholes damage the trucks. Waterlogged roads further add to our woes as it becomes difficult to move through a pothole.”Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “Water accumulation also results due to dumping of plastic carry bags by residents in the open. The drain lines get choked due to these. The MC is working to install a storm sewer line to deal with water accumulation on the railway station road. Also, the employees have been deputed to drain out accumulated water from low-lying areas. We are also working to construct roads in Transport Nagar but that will be done in phases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/8-6mm-rain-leaves-city-roads-inundated-commuters-harried-in-ludhiana/story-V9HK0ayhKJJiDCiMKVgUVM.html

The SDM asked them to produce documents regarding the construction and ordered them to stop the goings on.The Raikot police had started constructing a room beside the sentry post 10 days ago with funds raised by the local market associations. The local activists had clicked pictures and complained to the nagar council about the illegal nature of it.When council officials reached there for inquiry, the police sent them back stating that all construction work of the police fell under the Punjab Police Housing Corporation, adding that they didn’t need separate permission from the local council.After council officials reported the matter to the SDM, he himself reached the police station for investigation and found the construction going on in full swing.Station house officer, inspector Ajaib Singh, said that they had space constraints while trying to accommodate the staff, so they had started constructing rooms on their own and gathered funds themselves.When contacted, Ranjodh Singh, chief engineer, Punjab Police Housing Corporation, said that no amendment could be made without permission of the corporation and the Raikot police had not taken any for constructing extra rooms.The SDM said that he would be able to say something [on the matter] after the investigation was complete.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sdm-reaches-raikot-police-station-to-probe-illegal-construction/story-VLljTtVCsKYrwTwvtfQ4rO.html
29-08-2020||City||Shopkeepers in Mohali defy weekend lockdown guidelines, hold protest demanding exemption||Even though the government had ordered to close all shops on weekends, except those selling essential items, many shopkeepers in complete defiance of the city’s lockdown orders opened shops even after the police made a few unsuccessful attempts to shut them. Shops in Phase 7, 3b2 and 5, Sohana were open and police could be seen asking the shop owners to close them down. Loss of earnings has forced many shop owners to wind up businesses thus leading to laying off their staff. Shop owners held a protest in Phase 7, demanding exemption of weekend lockdown in Mohali on the lines of Chandigarh and Panchkula. The Punjab government had imposed a weekend lockdown in all cities and towns in the state, as part of a strict response to the worrying surge in Covid-19 cases. All shops except those dealing in essential commodities were asked to remain closed while eateries were allowed to open only for home delivery. The district authorities had shared the concern of the traders with the government but so far no exemption has been provided. The police department has been directed to ensure that the shops do not open on weekends. “Weekend lockdown is unacceptable and Mohali should be exempted as it is an integral part of the tricity. There is a drastic dip in the earnings of traders. With Chandigarh and Panchkula open on weekends, it is further going to kill businesses in Mohali,” said Sarbjeet Singh, general secretary Mohali Beopar Mandal. He added, “The government is forcing traders to come on streets to protest by taking decisions that are against the interest of the people.” Businesses shutting down as survival becoming difficult Three months of lockdown has led to a drastic decrease in the earnings of traders. “We had co-operated with the government but now it is a matter of survival. In Mohali, five showrooms each in Phase 5 and 7 have closed down owing to losses while seven more in Phase 7 are on the verge of closure,” said Sarbjeet. “People are losing jobs. If there is no business how are we going to give salaries to our staff? Already shops have reduced the staff strength and only working with 50% of staff,” said Rajpal Chaudhury, who runs a shop in Phase 5 Mohali. “Shopkeepers are struggling to meet monthly expenses. The government has failed to provide us any kind of relief. Though the decision was taken to combat the spread of the virus, this is also leading to loss of livelihood,” said Gurmeet Singh Walia, a shopkeeper in Phase 10, Mohali. “The government has failed the business community and by imposing the weekend curfew they are depriving shopkeepers of livelihood,” said Vineet Verma president Mohali Bepoar Mandal, “The market associations are asking for an exemption for Mohali but so far no relaxation has been announced. The weekend curfew would be imposed in Mohali as per the orders of the state government,” said Girish Dayalan, deputy commissioner, Mohali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shopkeepers-in-mohali-defy-weekend-lockdown-guidelines-hold-protest-demanding-exemption/story-tTnHuy5Ofs3ST5X2RvX9yN.html

The officials have been appointed at dedicated Covid care centre and dedicated Covid hospitals where prompt critical care is required. The administration in its order has also stated that the officers must be physically present or else face action under the Epidemic Diseases Management Act.Pune collector Rajesh Dekshmukh said, “We have issued these orders following complaints of lack of coordination and bed unavailability. Pune has enough beds now with jumbo facilities functioning and adding thousand beds for critical care. We are increasing our testing capacities in rural areas too. As of this week, testing has gone up two times of what it was in the second week of August. We have also increased contact tracing which was 11 as of July 30 and has gone up to 12.55 as of Saturday. So, we expect more cases to arise and we are preparing for the same.”The appointed officers will be responsible to ensure bed availability for patients as per their requirements for critical care. Often these hospitals are under various government agencies which can cause hindrance in communication and so these officials have been given the power and responsibility to ensure smooth communication. Each officer has been assigned a dedicated hospital and also dedicated time slots.The officers have to update the district administration’s Covid management dashboard centre about the availability of beds. Now, fines for not wearing masks or spitting: Pune collectorDeshmukh said that the Pune police is empowered to fine people who do not wear masks or spit on the road. He said, “During my rounds across various talukas we saw that 30-40% of the people do not wear masks and roam around the area freely. Earlier, there were designated people to penalise such miscreants, but now the Pune police will also be empowered to fine such people. A fine of Rs 500 will be imposed on people who violate the norms and endanger the lives of others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/following-complaints-of-bed-mismanagement-pmc-administration-appoints-officers-at-hospitals/story-KHx9H6wO8Yhiv3Lw8CyaHJ.html

29-08-2020||City||Capt asks chief secy to probe alleged scholarship scam||Chandigarh Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Saturday asked chief secretary Vini Mahajan to conduct a thorough probe into the alleged multi-crore post-matric scholarship scam. His statement comes amid the opposition’s demand for social welfare minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot’s resignation over his alleged role in the case. Amarinder said anyone found complicit to the alleged wrongdoings, irrespective of his position within or outside the government, will be punished in accordance with the legal provisions. The issue came to the fore on the basis of a report submitted by additional chief secretary Kirpa Shankar Saroj to the chief secretary, pointing out embezzlement of at least ₹63 crore in the distribution of post-matric scholarship meant for students belonging to Scheduled Castes. The report also questioned the role of Dharamsot in allegedly shielding those involved in the scam. The issue also rocked the assembly on Friday with opposition demanding resignation of Dharamsot. The chief minister said nobody could be put on the mat without a fair probe and proper inquiry. “There is rule of law, which needs to be followed,” said the CM, adding that he will not succumb to Opposition’s trial in the case. “However, there was no question of protecting or shielding anyone, and action will be taken against the guilty as per law,” he added. Amarinder also lashed out at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for behaving like a “rogue party” by baying for Dharamsot’s blood without a proper inquiry. “Are we living in a state of anarchy, with no rule of law?” Amarinder said, reacting strongly to the demand of AAP and Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) MLAs in the Vidhan Sabha on Friday. “Do you really expect me to take action without a proper inquiry against my own minister when I have not done so even against many Opposition leaders,” said the CM, pointing out that Dharamsot has already said he is ready to face any inquiry into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/capt-asks-chief-secy-to-probe-alleged-scholarship-scam/story-rSyrX8l7z5laVzXO8hbIUL.html

29-08-2020||Chandigarh||Divorce case: Punjab and Haryana HC dismisses plea seeking waiver of six-month ‘cooling-off’ period||The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that an estranged couple can apply for waiver of ‘cooling-off’ period in mutual consent divorce cases under the Hindu Marriage Act, where it has come on court record that they have been living separately for more than a year. The high court bench of justice SN Satyanarayana and justice Archna Puri refused to interfere with an order passed by a Mohali court in which a couple had asked for a divorce with mutual consent and also sought waiving off the six-month period. They got married in December 2017 at a gurdwara in Kharar and lived together till January 2019. But as certain issues cropped up between them, they decided to proceed independently and signed a settlement deed in the presence of elders from both sides on June 18, 2020. Following this, a joint petition for divorce was filed before a family court in July. The family court in Mohali dismissed the plea for waiving off the cooling-off period, observing that nothing was brought on record to show that there is a long litigation pending between the parties. There is nothing to suggest that the parties to the petition ever made any effort through court for getting their matter settled or through mediation/conciliation before the filing of the present petition, the family court had said. In high court, the appeal was filed by the woman, stating that she is proceeding to Malaysia by the end of this month and due to the pandemic situation, it would be difficult for her to come back after six months. The HC refused to waive off the cooling-off period and upheld family court decision, observing that she can submit her statement for divorce or withdrawal of petition through video conference or through any other media without personally coming to India after six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/divorce-case-punjab-and-haryana-hc-dismisses-plea-seeking-waiver-of-six-month-cooling-off-period/story-55XXMRdfcUIHYBvT33C7DI.html

Further, MC will get the site inspected again by experts from Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College and submit a final report with the high authorities.The show-cause notices have been issued to former superintending engineer (SE) Harpal Singh Bhullar, who has since been transferred, and current SE Rahul Gagneja, besides the SDO and junior engineer. They have been asked to explain why the design was changed, which led to increase in the project’s cost.A few weeks ago, the mayor had raised objections over alleged Rs 77-lakh discrepancies in the Jagraon Bridge’s retaining wall project, which is being carried out at a cost of around Rs 2.5 crore. Finding that the officials had sought permission to increase the project cost by Rs 44 lakh on the false pretext of design change, he had marked an inquiry.An MC official, requesting anonymity, claimed there was no discrepancy and the design was changed as there was a chance of a road cave-in during construction of the bridge, if the retaining wall and approach road would have been constructed with the old design, and “the mayor was aware of the problem.” Additional commissioner Rishipal Singh said, “The show-cause notices have been served. From preliminary observations, it seems there were deviations in design in comparison to what was proposed initially. However, we will get the site inspected from experts of an engineering college before submitting the report.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jagraon-bridge-revamp-two-ses-put-on-notice-over-rise-in-cost-after-design-change/story-BD9tkpFKy2WeuuO89Q0fjI.html

The trust, according to initial proposal, would have been mainly dominated by PMC office-bearers and municipal officials (mayor, standing committee chairman and leader of the house), however, opposition party leaders in the city raised objections to it. They demanded that leaders from all parties should be members of the trust. Congress leader Aba Bagul said, “They should appoint leaders from all major parties in the municipal corporation as it will help maintain balance. Today, the BJP is ruling PMC, but in the future other parties may run the PMC. Hence, looking at the long-term plans, the ruling party must accept the proposal.”Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “The state government had given its nod to start a medical college here. I instructed the administration to speed up the administrative process as the PMC can start the college and this will help us get more medical practitioners for PMC-run hospitals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/civic-chief-submits-proposal-to-appoint-members-from-all-parties-to-pmc-s-medical-college-trust/story-GhZCJ1KopRheprX5JiVRgK.html

29-08-2020||Chandigarh||Every 4th person admitted to PGI Covid-19 ICU succumbed to infection, comorbidities||Every fourth person who was admitted to the Covid-19 Intensive Care Unit at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has succumbed, majorly due to aggravation of a pre-existing disease.The dedicated hospital at Nehru Hospital Extension caters to moderate and severe cases from Chandigarh and the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana.Data accessed by Hindustan Times reveals that the hospital has admitted a total of 844 Covid-19 patients, of which 196 required intensive care support and during the course of treatment, 53 died. As per the figures, 113 have recovered and been discharged while 30 are under treatment.This suggests that the death rate in ICU is around 27% while the recovery rate stands at around 58%. PGIMER director Professor Jagat Ram said, “Doctors put in their best efforts to save the patients and 58% recovery in ICUs is nothing less than an achievement.” He explained, “Technically, it’s hard to revive a critical patient. Still the recovery rate of around 58% in the ICU is good. We are working hard to bring up the numbers and save more patients. Around 30 patients in ICU are still under treatment and we hope they recover soon.”“The message here is to practice hand hygiene, wear masks and maintain distance so that lives can be saved,” he added. Worryingly, 37% of those who died were in the age group of 31 to 50, while 45% were in the most vulnerable age group-- 50 years and above.Professor GD Puri, dean (academics) and head of the department of anesthesia and intensive care, said, “The Covid-19 centre at the institute receives very sick patients. Majority of the patients who are admitted for critical care in ICUs have other underlying conditions. All our patients in ICUs have severe comorbid conditions such as renal failure, hepatic failure, cardiac failure or terminal cancers in addition to diabetes or hypertension.”Dr Vipin Kaushal, additional medical superintendent of the Covid-19 hospital, said that many patients are initially admitted in the emergency ward for some other condition and after tests are performed here, they turn out to be positive. “In PGIMER emergencies, patients of accident cases, renal failure and other cases are reported from many states. Many of them are already in a serious condition. After the tests are performed, they turn out to be positive and are shifted to the Covid-19 block for treatment and management. They require round-the-clock care. So in most cases, patients’ survival chances are low despite best care,” said Dr Kaushal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/every-4th-person-admitted-to-pgi-covid-19-icu-succumbed-to-infection-comorbidities/story-b27icQ3lx9iKIaTu5YKt5N.html

The letter was followed by a performa under which they were asked to fill the details including name, father’s name, age, occupation, address and contact number of the addict.DEO Ravinder Chaudhary has refused to comment on the reasons for issuing such orders saying that he has been quarantined and is not well. Officiating DEO Sushil Kumar said the order was issued after a meeting in which it was decided that a list of 250 such people should be furnished for counselling. “However, there was some communication gap and the order will be withdrawn,” he added. Deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said the district education officer has been directed to withdraw the letter immediately.

The letter has received criticism on social media and by teachers. “How could a teacher get the details of drug addicts in his or her locality.

As many road samples collected in the past have failed the quality test, the superintending engineers (SE) have been directed to inspect the ongoing work and conduct videography of the project from its commencement to completion. “The protocol was not being followed by MC staff. With the help of contact numbers of the contractor and the official in charge, residents can contact them for concerns regarding the projects. The boards will also specify the project’s deadline and other specifications. SEs will personally move in the field and keep a check on the construction work. Regular sampling is also being conducted to maintain a check on the quality of work,” said Sabharwal. Earlier, seven samples collected from Amantran Colony, Guru Vihar, Chander Nagar, Bal Singh Nagar Road, Ashok Nagar, Daba Road and a road near GNE College (towards Dugri) had failed the quality test.

29-08-2020||City||Tricity buzz: HT Chandigarh reporters’ tracker on all those making, or faking, news||When it rains, it pours in Chandigarh After complaining that City Beautiful hasn’t seen much rain in July, residents stopped complaining about a deficit monsoon in August. Floodgates of Sukhna Lake had to be opened last weekend after heavy overnight rain. Now residents are heard complaining that there has been too much rain this season. With over 900mm of rainfall this monsoon, the city has crossed the average amount of rain it gets between June and September much before August ends. There’s more rain in the offing in the first two weeks of September! Dirty politics over cleanliness survey rankings The poor performance of Chandigarh in the recent Swachh Survekshan rankings yet again will see municipal corporation officials cornered at the general house meeting on August 31. The civic body will be under attack for submitting data with the Swachh Bharat Mission, claiming 100% waste segregation at source when door-to-door segregation in sectors hasn’t taken off. While ruling BJP councillors will zero in on officials, the Congress is expected to target the mayor and his party for the poor performance. Mohali MC’s enforcement team in relax mode The Covid-19 pandemic has given a good excuse to the enforcement team of the municipal corporation of Mohali to stay put in office. For the past few months, 12 officials of the enforcement team are relaxing in office. They have neither carried out any drive nor challaned any rehri or phariwallà. No wonder they are making their presence felt on roads across the town, obstructing traffic. The worst-affected areas are Phases 9, 10, 11, 3B1, 3B2 and Sector 68. SDMs not taking calls, complain UT councillors The Chandigarh administration asked the city’s councillors to share inputs on measures that could be taken to control the Covid-19 pandemic, but UT officials have not been as forthcoming. One of the councillors shared how sub divisional magistrates (SDMs) don’t even take their calls. “Residents turn to their councillors whenever they face an issue and it is our duty to help them. But it is unfortunate when the administration’s officials don’t even take our calls,” the councillor said, requesting anonymity. PGI comes out with flying colours on holding exams Politicians may be divided on holding medical and engineering entrance exams such as NEET and IIT-JEE but Chandigarh’s Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has successfully conducted entrance exams for nearly 24,000 candidates amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Dean, academics, GD Puri says: “It required extraordinary effort to complete the examination process. Due to the Covid-19 parameters, the number of centres was increased which involved higher expenses. Since air travel not available, staff from PGI could not be deputed to distant centres such as Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram and Mumbai. These centres were manned with the staff working at sister institutions in different cities.” Switch off lights to dodge the deadline With the Chandigarh administration strictly implementing night curfew to contain the spread of coronavirus, eatery owners have devised a novel way to dodge the timings. As the siren is sounded, declaring the time to shut shop, eatery owners in many areas switch off the lights but continue to prepare orders even till 10pm. According to the directive, eateries are allowed to operate till 9pm but switching off lights allows them an additional hour. Parking at a premium at civil hospital in Panchkula Parking a car at the Civil Hospital in Panchkula costs Rs 20, which is double the rate for parking a vehicle at most commercial places in the tricity. For instance, the car parking charge is Rs 10 in Sector 17, Chandigarh. The high rate of parking at a public institution, that too a hospital, seems unjust to many. However, who has the time to argue with the man issuing parking slips as all are in a rush to enter the hospital, either for their own check-up or for their loved ones.

29-08-2020||Chandigarh||BSF detects trans-border tunnel in J&K’s Samba sector||The Border Security Force (BSF) has detected a trans-border tunnel originating in Pakistan and entering India through Jammu and Kashmir’s Samba sector, said a senior police officer on Saturday. “A trans-border tunnel has been detected on the international border in Samba district. The tunnel extends 50 metres into the Indian territory. The BSF is investigating the matter. The spot will be dug up to ascertain the tunnel’s origin and direction but it appeared to be another attempt by Pakistan to push terrorists into India along the lines of Hamas fighters (Palestinian Sunni-Islamic fundamentalist militant organisation),” said the officer. Around 10 plastic sandbags that have ‘Karachi and Shakargarh’ written on them have been recovered from the opening of the tunnel. The bags have a manufacturing and expiry date printed on them.“On Friday, BSF troops detected an approximately 20-feet long and three-to-four-feet wide tunnel in the Indian territory near the International Border in the Basantar area. Pakistan-made sand bags with Shakargarh, Karachi, inscribed on them were used to hide the mouth of the tunnel . The tunnel’s opening is around 170m from the international border. It opens into a local farmers’ field,” the BSF posted on its Twitter handle.  The nearest Pakistani border post is about 400 meters from the tunnel. The BSF has launched a major search operation to trace if more such tunnels were being attempted by Pakistan. “Digging tunnels in a bid to push terrorists into J&K is an old tactic of Pakistan. It seems Pakistan has started imitating Hamas fighters, who dig underground tunnels to enter Israel,” said an officer in the counter-insurgency wing of the state police, who did not wish to be named. In September last year, the BSF had launched a massive operation along the International Border (IB) with Pakistan to detect underground cross-border tunnels The BSF also uses ground penetrating radars to detect tunnels. In the past, Infiltrators have attempted digging underground tunnels in Hiranagar, Samba, RS Pura, Pallanwala and Munawar Tawi .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bsf-detects-trans-border-tunnel-in-j-k-s-samba-sector/story-Gd3A0ZBFasWdNr3EcmBvaM.html

29-08-2020||Pune||Ajit Pawar demands ₹1,000 fine for not wearing masks||Pune Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has urged the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to increase the fine for not wearing masks. “Many people are still not wearing masks, which is a wrong practice. We will now increase the fine to Rs 1,000. I will have a meeting today in the afternoon and we will decide,” said Pawar who was in the city to inaugurate Covid care centres at Auto Cluster, Chinchwad (216 beds) and in Baner (314 beds). Pawar was unhappy over people not following the Covid norms of mandatory masks at public places. Currently, the PMC and PCMC have levied Rs 500 fine from people not wearing masks. “If people continue to not wear masks then cases will keep on increasing. All doctors, police, and politicians are trying their best to control the virus and currently what we need is support from people. All should wear a mask and maintain social distance, only then can we defeat the virus,” added Pawar. Earlier, the PCMC levied a Rs 200 fine, but later on, increased it to Rs 500. “A decision will be taken soon. As people are not following rules we need to take harsh decisions. If the public does not take it seriously then we all have to bear the consequences,” said Anna Bodade, assistant municipal commissioner, PCMC. In most areas of PCMC, people were seen not following norms especially vendors who are selling vegetables and fruits. “I have noticed, along with vendors, that even buyers are not wearing masks. This is completely wrong, one should avoid wrong practices for a safe future,” added Bodade. Casual approach An HT reporter observed on Friday that social distancing rules were completely flouted at tea stalls and snack shops. “Earlier people used to follow rules strictly, now they don’t stand in a queue while maintaining social distance even after telling them many times,” said Mai Wadewale, a shop owner at Dange chowk. “People have even continued spitting on roads. PCMC should take strict action for not wearing masks, and not maintaining social distance and spitting in public,” said Pratham Godbole, a customer at Mai Wadewale’s shop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/ajit-pawar-demands-1-000-fine-for-not-wearing-masks/story-GNP4qQYZSTTPlikVl2oeIL.html

The Chaibasa Muffasil police had recovered the body of a driver in another SUV—with the doors locked and the AC on—in west Singhbhum district on August 26.“Around 10.30 pm on Friday, some locals informed us about a stationary vehicle with its doors closed, engine and AC on. I immediately sent a patrol team to the spot which found an unconscious man inside the locked vehicle. We first took him to MGM Medical College and Hospital and then to Tata Main Hospital, where doctors declared him dead on arrival,” Rajesh Kumar Jha, Birsanagar PS officer-in-charge (OC), said Saturday morning.He said they recovered an inhaler from the vehicle and the preliminary investigation indicated that the deceased man Dipak Sinha was an asthma patient. “He appeared to have suffocated to death. Locals said the vehicle was parked around 4.30-5pm Friday and they spotted it at the same place at night, with its doors closed and the engine and AC on. The Covid-19 test autopsy reports of the deceased man will make the matter clearer,” added Jha.Experts said a faulty AC vent could have led to the release of carbon monoxide in the SUV. For a man to die within an hour, the concentration of carbon monoxide would have to be at least 3,200 ppm (parts per million).In another such incident just three days ago, the Chaibasa Muffasil police had recovered body of a driver Shyam Sirka from a parked SUV on Chaibasa-Chakradharpur road on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/two-jharkhand-men-die-inside-locked-air-contintioned-suvs-within-three-days/story-fCSlpiaZXD15jEEjgjBOPO.html

29-08-2020||Pune||Nirmalaya collection drive moves from ghats to doorsteps in Pune||The seventh day of 10-day Ganpati festival on Friday saw a lot of immersions on a rainy day. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) volunteers and waste pickers at several spots across the city collected nirmalaya (flowers, puja accompaniments and garlands) from devotees who immersed idols at the mobile tanks arranged by the civic administration. In the light of Covid situation and public appeal for performing immersions at homes and tanks, PMC has not placed collection pots near riversides. The civic authority made arrangements for home collection of nirmalaya by volunteers and waste pickers. “Last year, we had collected 900 metric tonnes of nirmalaya during the festival. Till the sixth day of festival this year, we have collected 18,635 kg of nirmalaya across 191 collection centres in the city,” said Dynaneshwar Molak, head, solid waste management (SWM) department, PMC. PMC has tied up with SWaCH and Cummins India to collect nirmalaya from doorsteps. SWaCH waste pickers will handle it and send for organic composting separately. The collection drive will be continued till September 2. “We have appealed to over 30 lakh devotees to handover nirmalaya separately as it will help in organic waste processing,” said Saru Waghmare, SWaCH waste picker and board member. Every year, waste pickers of SWaCH in partnership with PMC, Cummins India, Emcure and Sudarshan Chemicals divert more than 100 tonnes of nirmalaya from rivers towards composting. In keeping with the safety guidelines, Suchismita Pai, SWaCH representative said, “Over the years, we have been interacting with residents and have brought about a behavioural change whereby devotees handover nirmalaya to our waste pickers at the ghats, which is then composted and distributed to local farmers. This year, with support from PMC and Cummins India, we have distributed 11,000 special bags to our network of 3,500 waste pickers just for nirmalaya collection and we request citizens to hand over nirmalaya offerings to their doorstep SWaCH waste picker. The material will be transported in separate PMC vehicles and sent for organic composting.” Shobha Bansode, a waste picker who has been at the ghats every year during immersion, says, “We have adapted to working with PPE kits over the past four months and have been at work every day. This is yet another change that we must adapt to. We draw comfort from the fact that we are still facilitating the work of the Ganesh festival. We do it out of a sense of devotion and duty.” Some of the residents took to recycling puja offerings within their homes like Devendra Mali, resident of Ravet. “This year has been different and we immersed the idol in the bucket and used nirmalaya to create compost for our plants.” Another devotee Vrishasen Dabholkar used no flowers or any other decorations except for cotton necklace and beads which can be recycled on Ganpati made of mud. “We immersed the mud idol in a bucket and used the soil to plant new seeds in a plantation box. This year, we did not spend on buying or bringing flowers and garlands. Instead used glass beads and paper garlands as accessories for the lord,” said Dabholkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/nirmalaya-collection-drive-moves-from-ghats-to-doorsteps-in-pune/story-CDN7PCgonDhLnOtyiC4GvN.html
29-08-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana power minister Ranjit Singh Chautala tests positive for Covid-19||Haryana power and jails minister Ranjit Singh Chautala, 74, tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday. The minister took to Twitter to announce his health status and said: “On the doctor’s advice, I will remain in home quarantine. I urge all those who met me recently to undergo the Covid test. My health is fine.” Chautala had taken part in the one-day monsoon session of the Haryana assembly on Wednesday and met ministers and legislators. While the administration and police have been imposing fines on the common man roaming outside their houses without a face mask, politicians have not been adhering to safety guidelines and even campaigning in these Covid times. Besides Ranjit Chautala, state agriculture minister JP Dalal and Karnal BJP MP Sanjay Bhatia addressed gatherings in villages of poll-bound Baroda assembly constituency, defying social distancing norms before testing positive for coronavirus infection. Wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt of the BJP, Independent Dadri MLA Sombir Sangwan and Ellenabad INLD MLA Abhay Singh Chautala have also been campaigning in Baroda constituency by organising gatherings and not adhering to safety guidelines. Rajya Sabha member Deepender Singh Hooda and Haryana BJP chief Om Prakash Dhankar have also interacted with villagers in Baroda assembly, ignoring safety guidelines. Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala and his jailed father Ajay Singh Chautala were also seen interacting with people without masks. Dushyant did not wear a mask even while speaking in the assembly on August 26. The health department is yet to collect door-to-door samples in villages of Baroda. The assembly seat in Sonepat district fell vacant in April following the death of Congress legislator Sri Krishan Hooda. No date has been announced for the byelection yet but politicians are in campaign mode.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-power-minister-ranjit-singh-chautala-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-zwXHrscH7OFcveR1Si5jyN.html
29-08-2020||Delhi||In big haul, DRI recovers gold bars worth Rs 43 crore in Delhi; 8 held||The Directorate of Revenue and Intelligence (DRI) seized a consignment of 504 smuggled gold bars of foreign origin worth Rs 43 crore and arrested eight persons from New Delhi railway station on Friday. DRI officials, who didn’t wish to be named, described it as the largest consignment of gold the agency ever seized. The eight persons had arrived at New Delhi by the Dibrugarh-New Delhi Rajdhani Express on Friday. Officers said they had concealed the gold bars in specially tailored cloth vests and were using fake identity cards (Aadhaar cards) to travel to Delhi. Intelligence inputs indicate that the gold bars had foreign markings and had been smuggled into India from Myanmar through the international land border at Moreh in Manipur. A smuggling syndicate in Guwahati was attempting to dispose of the contraband in several cities—Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai—which have thriving markets for the yellow metal, said one of the officers cited above. “The smuggling syndicate sourced and recruited needy individuals from various parts of the country, to act as carriers of the smuggled gold, by luring them with the prospect of quick and easy money. The smugglers used air, land and rail routes to locally transport the smuggled gold,” he added. The seized gold bars are 99.9% pure and collectively weigh 83.621 kg. Their market value is close to Rs 43 crore, said another officer. The eight arrested persons are currently being questioned about the organised gang which sent them to Delhi. The DRI suspects that the gang has links to other countries as Myanmar does not produce gold at a large scale, said the officer. The arrested persons have been booked under the Customs Act, 1962, and have been remanded to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/in-largest-seizure-ever-dri-recovers-gold-bars-worth-rs-43-crore-in-delhi-arrests-eight-persons/story-cOQNJfX46FYKWT8FX4Fx0I.html
29-08-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC judge disagrees with CAA comments in judgment quashing FIR against Tablighi Jamaat members||A Bombay high court judge, who was a part of a two-member division bench that quashed cases registered against 28 foreign members of the Tablighi Jamaat and six trustees of local mosques in a strongly worded order, has said he disagrees with certain remarks in the August 21 judgment.The order said the foreigners were virtually persecuted and also added that a “political government tries to find scapegoat when there is pandemic or calamity”. The bench of Justices TV Nalawade and MG Sewlikar cited the material related to the case and added it shows “that the propaganda against the so-called religious activity [of the members of the Jamaat] was unwarranted”.Justice Sewlikar passed a separate order on Thursday, saying he especially disagreed with a paragraph regarding protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).In the August 21 order, the bench observed the action against the Jamaat members created fear among those Muslims, who protested against CAA and NRC. “This action (against Tablighi members) indirectly gave warning to Indian Muslims that action in any form and for anything can be taken against Muslims. It was indicated that even for keeping contact with Muslims of other countries action will be taken against them. Thus, there is the smell of malice to the action taken against these foreigners and Muslims for their alleged activities,” the division bench said.Justice Sewlikar said he finds it difficult to concur with these observations as allegations in this respect were not made in the petitions of the Jamaat members nor is there is any evidence in this regard. “Therefore, in my opinion, these observations are outside the scope of the petitions,” he said. Justice Sewlikar maintained the cases against the foreigners and their hosts in Ahmednagar were liable to be quashed for the want of evidentary material.The division bench struck down criminal proceedings against the 28 foreigners and six locals, observing that they were “virtually persecuted.” It cited the latest figures of Covid-19 infection and said they show the action against the foreigners should not have been taken.The Jamaat hit the headlines in March when authorities blamed a congregation at its headquarters in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin area for a jump in Covid-19 infections. The headquarters was sealed and hundreds of attendees, including foreigners from countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the US, were quarantined. Police initially filed a case against Jamaat chief Maulana Saad for violating a ban on big gatherings. He was later booked for culpable homicide, which carries a maximum punishment of 10-year imprisonment.The Jamaat, which has followers in over 80 countries, maintained many visitors at its headquarters were stranded after the government declared a lockdown to check the pandemic spread. The Centre blacklisted around 1,500 foreign Tablighi members for violating their visa norms and multiple cases were registered against them across the country, including in Maharashtra.The high court said foreigners having valid visas to enter India cannot be prevented from visiting mosques if they go there to observe religious practices.All the foreigners, who petitioned the high court, had participated in the Nizamuddin congregation and thereafter gave religious lectures at mosques in Ahmednagar district allegedly in violation of lockdown norms in the last week of March. Initially, cases were registered against the trustees of mosques where the foreigners had stayed.All the 34 accused, including the foreigners, moved the high court seeking quashing of the criminal cases registered against them. The foreigners contended they came to India on valid visas and argued they were here mainly to experience the Indian culture. They said on their arrival at airports, they were screened for Covid-19.The foreigners argued they were struck in Ahmednagar after the imposition of the nationwide lockdown because of the suspension of the transportation services. They said that is why they stayed at mosques.Ahmednagar police maintained the Jamaat members were found preaching and so cases were registered against them. They added the foreigners were arrested after institutional quarantine and subsequently five of them were found to be infected. The police insisted there was sufficient material to indicate the accused had breached lockdown norms and visa conditions.The court cited guidelines and added foreigners visiting India on tourist visas are prevented from engaging in preaching activity. But it noted under the recently updated visa manual, there is no restriction on foreigners for visiting religious places and attending normal religious activities like attending discourses although tourist visas limit the purposes of a visit to recreation and site seeing.“Social and religious tolerance is a practical necessity for unity and integrity in India and that is also made compulsory by our Constitution. By hard work over the past years after independence, we have reconciled religion and modernity to a great extent. This approach helps participation of most in a developing process. We have been respecting both religious and secular sensibilities since independence and by this approach, we have kept India as united,” said the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-judge-disagrees-with-caa-comments-in-judgment-quashing-fir-against-tablighi-jamaat-members/story-MwtvmiZPFook18CboiqDFM.html
29-08-2020||City||Football match dispute triggers caste violence in western Odisha||A dispute over a football match triggered caste violence in western Odisha’s Subarnapur district and left three people critically injured after members of a local Other Backward Class (OBC) community allegedly attacked a group of Dalit villagers. The clashes first began with disagreement over the football match on August 23 between the Dalit and OBC village teams and led to a social boycott of Dalits and violence four days later, alleged Sanjib Suna, a resident of Kharjura village where the incident took place. “After the dispute, whenever we would go to buy food, they would call us untouchable and ask us to not come to the village market. This happened because we protested that they changed the format of the tournament from round-robin to knockout when the Dalit team lost one match,” said Suna. On August 27, the simmering tension snowballed into violence and several members of the Dalit community were allegedly injured. “I had gone to buy some oil when I was attacked with sticks, rods and stones. I suffered a fracture in my hand and my head,” said Prasadi, a local villager. The police confirmed the clashes and said an FIR was registered. “The investigation is on and we are talking to all parties,” said Lokeshwar Sahoo, the inspector in-charge of Sonpur police station. Members of the OBC community rejected the charges and said they will file a police complaint. The village chief, Dilip Seth, said he organised a meeting of the two communities and hoped that peace would return to the area soon. “I have spoken to all leaders and hope to end the dispute soon,” he added. Asked how a football tournament was organised at a time coronavirus-induced restrictions are in place across the state, he said the sport was held as part of a local festival and it would be investigated. Experts said the caste divisions in western Odisha were old and deep. “There have been several cases of caste atrocities in the region and we can see assertion by Dalits has led to more violence,” said Jadumani Mahanand, a lecturer at OP Jindal Global University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/football-match-dispute-triggers-caste-violence-in-western-odisha/story-ToE7vfokcFAoyfn6liBaUL.html

29-08-2020||Lucknow||Introducing fleather: Kanpur startup turns floral waste to vegan leather||Floral waste has found new purpose, courtesy Phool.co, an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur-backed biomaterial startup which has developed ‘fleather’—bio-degradable vegan leather made from discarded temple flowers.“Fleather is a viable alternative to animal leather,” claimed Ankit Agarwal, the co-founder of Phool.co, who was among the 17 young leaders from across the globe selected by the United Nations for its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) initiative in 2018. In India, leather is used in several industries, from fashion apparels to saddlery. India produces 12.9% of the world’s hides, which is greater that 3 billion sq foot per year. “We convert floral waste into charcoal-free incense products. But last year, we decided to explore the development of animal-free leather. Intrigued by the formation of a leather-like white layer on unused piles of flowers, our R&D team discovered the growth of a micro-organism which used flower petals as a nutritional source,” he said. “Leather contains collagen which provides it strength and durability, whereas fleather has chitin, a kind of protein, that gives it the same properties. Collagen and chitin are natural analogues, making fleather a perfect substitute for leather,” he said. Professor Amitabha Bandyopadhyay of the biological sciences and bioengineering department in IIT Kanpur said, “Fleather will be a game changer. The fashion industry will surely use this vegan leather. I am happy that such a technology was developed at Startup Incubation and Innovation Centre, IIT Kanpur. Fleather was recently awarded by PETA.” Professor Abhay Karandikar, the director of IIT Kanpur said, “For a young entrepreneur, this is remarkable commitment towards nation-building.” IIT Kanpur has been Phool.co’s backbone for technical research. The R&D team comprises Sandeep Kumar, MTech (biotechnology) from IIT Kanpur and Saumya Srivastava, MTech (biotechnology) from IIT-Guwahati. The team is led by Nachiket Kuntla, BTech (chemical engineering) from IIT Bombay and MTech (chemical engineering) from IIT Kanpur. Talking about the research, Ankit said, “We identified the biological species and grew strains of similar species in the lab and isolated the best species in terms of strength and growth rate for further research. We developed a technique to extract the maximum nutritional content from the flowers and introduced certain additives to make a final medium that would trigger the growth of the micro-organism as well as enhance the properties of the fleather sheet.” “We adapted the micro-organism to increase the thickness and strength of the fleather and better its texture. The tensile strength, elasticity and sheer resistance of fleather is matching or is rather superior to that of traditional leather,” he said. Phool.co was founded by Ankit Agarwal and Prateek Kumar in July 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/introducing-fleather-kanpur-startup-turns-floral-waste-to-vegan-leather/story-z2gufpKO3KCy0kGnH3PRdM.html

One of the brothers told the police that he was feeling repentant and that is why they surrendered and confessed [to the crime]. A skeleton has been exhumed from the backyard of their house. Further investigation is on,” said a police officer.According to the preliminary police investigation, the three brothers lived in their ancestral house at Jagaddal in North 24 Parganas. Nipu, the eldest of them, was a civil engineer, the other two were unemployed.“Even though Nipu was the sole earning member in the family, the trio used to fight regularly over the ancestral property. One day we saw they had left the house. Apu had come once to clean the house and told the neighbours that they had all settled in Delhi, Pune and Goa,” said Manik Deb, a local resident.On Friday, Apu told police that he and Tapu killed Nipu in December 2014 and buried him in the backyard of their house.Neighbours said that initially, police thought that Apu was mentally deranged and why else would he confess to a crime he had committed six years ago. But when police inquired with the neighbours, they came to know that the neighbours have not seen Nipu for many years. It was then that police took Apu to the spot and exhumed the body.“We will get to know more after we take the brothers into our custody and interrogate them. They would be produced in the court today [Saturday],” said another officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/two-kolkata-brothers-murder-third-in-2014-surrender-six-years-later/story-4uXc76wtvOGe5lTzJgUItL.html

Anything less would be a miscarriage of justice,” he said in a statement. Dharamsot’s role in the disbursal of funds totalling Rs 248 crore has been questioned in a report submitted by additional chief secretary Kirpa Shankar Saroj to the chief secretary.The Congress MP said he will write to Congress president Sonia Gandhi apprising her of the sensitivity of this matter and requesting her to take suitable action. He said it was worrying that money meant to be spent for ensuring better access to education for Scheduled Caste students was being misused by the department. The scheme was launched in November 2006 by the UPA-1 government at the Centre as a signature policy of the Congress and seeing it ruined through embezzlement and fraud by the party’s government was unacceptable, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/post-matric-scholarship-scam-punjab-congress-mp-partap-singh-bajwa-seeks-minister-dharamsot-s-resignation/story-xxU3SFKWYduzavtwEKFe8I.html

29-08-2020||Chandigarh||After four days, traffic on Jammu-Srinagar highway restored partially||Jammu: After remaining blocked for four days, traffic on the 270-km Jammu-Srinagar national highway was partially restored from Ramban to Kashmir Valley on Saturday morning. Senior superintendent on police, national highway, JS Johar said, “Traffic has been partially restored to the valley. However, the stretch at Dalwas is yet to be cleared.” A portion of the road was washed away in a mudslide at Dalwas in Ramban district on Wednesday. A resident of Batote said, “Only Kashmir-bound vehicles stranded between Ramban and the valley are being allowed to proceed to their destinations. Traffic is moving slowly due to the slippery road.” Landslides have been cleared from Marog, Digdol, Monkey Morh, Cafeteria Morh, Mompassi and Panthial. The weather has also opened up in Ramban, which is situated at the highest altitude on the Kashmir highway. “It is bright and sunny today,” he said and added that daily commuters know that landslides are triggered when the weather turns dry soon after the rains as loose rocks and soil come off the hills. “The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has pressed its men and machinery to completely restore the highway. We are working to restore the stretch at Dalwas,” an NHAI official said. After moderate to heavy rainfall in Jammu and Kashmir since Tuesday, rains stopped on Friday afternoon. Since Tuesday, more than 2,000 vehicles were stranded at various places in Chenani, Udhampur and Nagrota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-four-days-traffic-on-jammu-srinagar-highway-restored-partially/story-JlWuY66Q5U0K1d9c3WuKyJ.html
29-08-2020||Delhi||Little to no rain in Delhi for the next few days||After receiving a good amount of rain on Friday, Delhi-NCR will be back to receiving little to no rain for the next few days, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast read Saturday.Scientists at IMD said that till Tuesday, only some parts of the national Capital are likely to receive “light to very light rain”.“Delhi received moderate rainfall on Friday, as the monsoon trough was passing over the city. Over the next two days, ‘light’ to ‘very light’ rain may take place, as the trough will be moving southwards. On September 1 and 2, another spell of moderate rain is expected in Delhi, as the trough is expected to move towards the north then,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.He added that there was a forecast of light rain over the past week, but the monsoon trough had moved towards the Himalayan foothills, because of which there was no rain in Delhi. On August 20 and 21, Delhi had received ‘heavy’ to ‘very heavy’ rainfall.IMD had issued an orange alert on Friday morning for Delhi-NCR, warning of ‘light to moderate’ rain accompanied by thundershowers. At several places across the city, there were reports of water logging. In places such as Greater Kailash 2 and Vikaspuri, the water logging led to massive traffic jams.

29-08-2020||Mumbai||Thane: Noise-free Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations this year||Thane city saw noise-free Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations this year amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.No musical instrument was played during the immersion; there were no elaborate processions and fire crackers either.The civic body authorities ensured crowd management with Thane Police.“I have been observing decibel levels in Thane since the last few years during festivals. This year was the quietest celebration, as compared to previous years. Small immersion processions during the fifth day of the annual festival were taken out. This was a welcome change. Though the key celebrations were low-key due to the pandemic, this trend will go a long way in the near future to curb the level of noise pollution,” said Dr Mahesh Bedekar, a Thane-based activist.Usually, Panchpakhadi and Ram Maruti Road get overcrowded, congested and contribute to noise pollution on the first five days of Ganesh Chaturthi and two days of immersion. But this year was an aberration from the norm.Last year, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) authorities had feted Ganesh pandals that had celebrated a noise-free festival, where no microphone and loudspeaker was used.The pandemic led to muted celebrations at immersion sites as well. “We had released a circular on social media that highlighted various ways of immersion at home. Arrangements were made for idol donation centres, online bookings and mobile immersion tanks. Many devotees availed these facilities. An explainer was also put out about how a devotee can conduct immersion at home for an idol made of clay, or plaster of Paris. Most people were confined indoors, which made crowd management easy at immersion sites,” said Manisha Pradhan, pollution officer, TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/thane-noise-free-ganesh-chaturthi-celebrations-this-year/story-1XfnMUjaNgc0VyHfPkJ6XI.html
29-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi traffic cop run over by car 11 days ago dies||A 51-year-old traffic policeman who was run over by the driver of an i20 car in west Delhi’s Raghubir Nagar 11 days ago, succumbed to his injuries on Friday night, the police said. This is the second death of a Delhi traffic police officer on duty in the last month.Deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit confirmed the death of assistant sub-inspector Mahavir Singh and said the police will add murder charges under Section 302 of Indian Penal Code against the errant driver, one Amandeep, who was arrested on Sunday, six days after the mishap. Earlier, the police had registered a case of attempt to murder, because the driver had run over ASI Singh twice in an attempt to flee when the officer signalled him to halt for vehicle checking on August 17. The ASI was admitted to a nearby hospital, where he had been in a coma since then. “We will now book Amandeep under the section for murder,” said DCP Purohit, adding that ASI Singh and three-four traffic police personnel were checking vehicles near the Raghubir Nagar police booth when the mishap took place around 5.30pm on August 17. Singh signalled a white i20 car to stop, but its driver tried to escape. When he tried to halt the car, the driver hit him with the vehicle. He rammed the policeman a second time, this time crushing him under the wheels. Singh’s colleagues could only note that it was an i20 car registered in Haryana and the last four digits were 1664, the DCP said. The police registered a case and the investigating team went to Haryana and collected details of all i20 cars whose numbers ended with 1664. The team identified the vehicles and went about tracing their owners; they found out that the car in question had been sold at least half a dozen times in the last couple of years. The police then traced Amandeep, the current owner, who was visiting his in-laws in Noida. They also found that his phone’s location details put him near the mishap spot around the time of the incident. He was finally nabbed along with the car, the DCP said after Amandeep’s arrest Monday. None of the car’s owners, except the original person, registered the car in their name, the DCP said, adding this was why Amandeep allegedly attempted to get away from the police and refused to halt when signalled. On July 26, a 54-year-old assistant commissioner of police (ACP) of the Delhi traffic police died after being hit and dragged for nearly 50 metres by a mini-truck near the Rajokri flyover, where he was clearing a traffic jam. ACP Sanket Kaushik was declared dead on arrival at the AIIMS Trauma Centre. The truck driver was caught in Mahipalpur, four days after the accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-traffic-cop-run-over-by-car-11-days-ago-dies/story-3UzMv5vaLL8ssffsoHGUeI.html
29-08-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 curve flattening in Dharavi, rising in neighbouring Dadar and Mahim||While the Covid-19 curve has started to flatten in Dharavi, India’s largest slum cluster, the number of Covid-19 cases have doubled in neighbouring Mahim and Dadar areas in the last 40 to 60 days. Out of the total 4,680 positive cases in Dadar and Mahim area, more than 70 per cent have been reported after relaxations in lockdown, starting June 03, 2020. Owing to this, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) says it is tracing and testing “maximum people behind every case from Dadar and Mahim area, on the lines of Dharavi.”For the past few days, Covid-19 cases in Dharavi are being reported in single digits daily, with a few exceptions. The BMC has maintained that while the cases are coming down, four most densely populated pockets inside Dharavi - the Matunga Labour Camp, Kumbharwada, Kala Killa, and Koliwada continue to be on the corporation’s watch-list. The BMC, starting September 01, is also going to scale down Covid-19 containment facilities in Dharavi owing to the flattening of the curve. However, its neighbouring areas like Dadar and Mahim, now, remain a concern for the BMC.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of BMC’s G North Ward said, “There are many factors behind cases increasing in Dadar and Mahim, and we are following the Dharavi model of testing and tracing maximum residents from Dadar and Mahim. We have also set up free testing camps, due to which we are detecting maximum cases. We have to understand that Dadar traditionally has been a commercial hub too, and post June 3, we have witnessed an increase in reporting of cases.”Dighavkar added, “After relaxations were given in lockdown measures, more and more cases are being reported. Maximum cases that we are detecting are of those who are asymptomatic and most are from high-rises. We have to wait and watch for now and continue testing and tracing the maximum number of people for the cases to come under control. At the same time, citizens have to be responsible.”Also Read: Treated 14,800 Covid-19 patients in home isolation since July 9, claims Mumbai civic corporation Dadar also came into focus last week when a large number of residents had gathered in the local market ahead of Ganeshotsav by flouting all social distancing norms.In terms of numbers, on June 3, 2020, the first day of relaxations given by the state government under Mission Begin Again, Dharavi had 1,889 cases that have increased to 2,745 as of Friday. In the case of Dadar, the cases went up from 374 to 2,489 in the same period and in Mahim, Covid cases have reached 2,192 from 606 on June 3.The number of cases have doubled in Dadar in the last around 45 days from 1,130 on July 11 to 2,489 now. Similarly, in Mahim, cases have reached 2,192 from 1,092 on June 28. The G North Ward, under which Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim fall, has a total of 7,426 cases as of Friday, of which, 6,208 cases have recovered and 787 cases are active. Maximum active cases are from Dadar (400) and Mahim (294) while Dharavi (93) has the lowest number of active cases. Also Read: Mumbai civic body asks private hospitals to refer critical patients to its Covid-19 facilitiesShiv Sena corporator from Dadar, Vishakha Raut said, “We controlled cases in slums and chawls by having stricter containment measures, but the same is not the case in Dadar. We have an educated and literate population here and it is expected that they will act more responsibly. However, it is a fact that after relaxations in the lockdown norms, the cases have increased due to an increase in mingling of residents socially, but the administration is also trying to trace maximum cases.”Raut claimed that mandatory testing for travel led to detection of several cases among those who wanted to go to their homes in Konkan during Ganeshotsav. He also put the onus on citizens for responsible behavior.“In the end, citizens have to be more responsible when they are out. I see people not following social distancing norms, not wearing masks even in areas like Shivaji Park. This all needs to stop, and we will need to act with more responsibility,” Raut added.Mortality rate for the GN Ward has gone down in the last 50 days. According to BMC’s data, there were 379 deaths in the ward on July 04, a mortality rate of 10.61%, which has gone down to 7.33% with 492 deaths, as of Friday. The GN Ward also has around 13 containment zones and 355 sealed buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-curve-flattening-in-dharavi-rising-in-neighbouring-dadar-and-mahim/story-bK8kPBQhjoQ6vvRfVSHiAL.html

29-08-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: A home away from ‘des’||A family of labourers, their true home, they say, is their village, which they call des (country). But while they are in the Capital, for practical reasons, they have to make it a home too in the form of a pavement shelter where they cook, rest, sleep and spend free hours together.The middle-aged Nand Ram lives with his wife, Beni, and teenage son, Bablu, in Green Park, a genteel neighbourhood in South Delhi. Mr Ram’s house is not far from the area’s market, full of elegant cafes and sophisticated gentry. His accommodation consists of one room. The roof and walls are made of yellow, blue, black and white plastic sheets. “We bought these at wholesale rates from Gautam Nagar market,” explains young Bablu. The plastic was originally used as packaging for consumer goods—the white plastic at the entrance, for instance, is printed with red letters saying, FRAGILE.The structure of the house rests on a scaffolding of twigs that the family gathered from the nearby Deer Park, a popular destination for the neighbourhood’s morning walkers.Owning no agricultural land in Begha, their village in the Tikamgarh district of Madhya Pradesh, Mr Ram and his family decided to try their luck in a place far from the “des” and arrived in Delhi a few years ago. They got work promptly. One of the first assignments they got, along with other labourers, was building the pavement between Aurobindo Market and Hauz Khas Village with brown-and-red bricks. “We got the kaam (work) through a thekedar (contractor),” says Mr Ram. During the brief chat, his son remains quiet, looking shy, but his wife, Benu, makes a remark about the steep food prices and their consequent difficulty in saving money. They often take brief breaks from work assignments to go back to their village, which they again insist is their real home.Once you step inside the house, you cannot stand upright. The roof is too low. The mattress is spread out on a stretcher-like thing made of wooden rods. A ply board is used as a table on which is resting a bowl of leftover curry, a jar of milk and a cake of soap. The family takes their bath outside, next to the kitchen, which consists of a mud stove on the pavement. A can of Diet Coke is used as mug.The man, woman and son wake up every morning at six. The wife prepares the meal, which they eat before eight — this is when they leave for work. At 6pm, they return and four hours later they fall asleep. But it is early morning and the three of them are ready to get out for work—the son is in grey pants and white long-sleeved shirt, as if heading to school.During the monsoon, Mr Ram says, the rain water drips through the gaps in the plastic sheets. When the rain comes at night, the family inevitably wakes up and waits for it to stop before going back to sleep. Sometimes the shower continues for hours, they say.One of the advantages of such a makeshift accommodation, the family feels, is that they can easily move from one location to another depending on their work site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/a-home-away-from-des/story-ZNQ78AnvhOYRx4dnay0G0H.html

As per a statement from the chief minister’ office (CMO), Thackeray said that the government is “positive” about allowing the reopening of gyms, but a final call would be taken based on the guidelines prepared. “For this [to prevent the Covid-19 spread], gym owners must come together and prepare guidelines for the safety of the citizens. Once these guidelines are prepared by owners from across the state, the state will take a call on it [the reopening] at the earliest,” a statement from CMO read. The demand to open up gyms has been growing from within the ruling coalition government as well as from the Opposition as well. Several leaders such as Nationalist Congress Party parliamentarian Supriya Sule and state health minister Rajesh Tope, leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray have also demanded has asked for the reopening of gyms. Earlier this month, the Centre allowed gyms and places of worship to reopen in the country. However, the state government was treading cautiously on this issue owing to the surge in Covid-19 in Maharashtra. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Thursday had indicated that a decision on the reopening of gyms and places of worship will likely be taken in the first week of September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/state-positive-on-reopening-gyms-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-tells-owners/story-tjAoOznm3T6WnYJGN5qmiJ.html
29-08-2020||City||Passengers’ body demands halts at stations beyond Maharashtra’s Kalyan city for essential workers to commute||The railway passengers’ association for commuters from Kalyan, Kasara and Karjat areas has raised objections over the levying of fines on 12 employees of the central post office in Kardi who travelled to Kalyan and Thane on Thursday on special trains meant for railway staff. In the complaint to the officials of Central Railway (CR) on Friday, the association raised concerns over the inadequate transportation for essential services employees travelling from Khardi, Vasind and stations beyond Titwala. As per the association, 12 employees who worked from the post office belong to essential services. They were caught by the ticket checker and stopped for two hours at Kalyan station before being fined ₹400 each for the journey. Shyam Ubale, general secretary, of the association, said, “The railways started the trains for those in the essential services from June 15. Some trains halt along the Kasara and Karjat routes. There are no halts at Khardi and Vasind stations. Many essential services employees from the rural parts, who work as Class 3 and 4 employees, are struggling each day to reach their workplaces. We had requested the authorities to start some trains before too, but the demand was not met.” The association expressed that it is unfair to impose a fine on these employees as they too are corona warriors. “They boarded the railway staff special train because they wanted to reach their workplace. But they were made to pay the fine, which is not acceptable,” said Ubale. The association has put forward the demand to halt the trains for essential services to all the stations between the Kalyan-Kasara-Karjat stations and also to increase the frequency of the trains. Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer of CR, said, “On the request of the state government, we operate sufficient suburban trains for essential services staff, as identified by the state. Boarding emergency railway vehicles, which are strictly for railway staffs is not permitted for others to travel and is also punishable under railway act.” As per the railway records, from June to August, 46 commuters were caught for ticketless travelling on the Kalyan- Kasara-Karjat route and fined Rs15,370 collectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/passengers-body-demands-for-additional-halts-at-stations-beyond-maharashtra-s-kalyan-city-for-essential-workers-to-commute/story-rCwu9z1QxmqrnPSzgWeLoM.html

According to Mumbai Police officers, constable Prasad Mahadik was advised to be in quarantine for 14 days from June 22 to July 6, after one of his neighbours at a chawl in Bhandup tested positive for Covid-19.However, Mahadik did not follow the quarantine norms, and on July 4, he and his friend Amol Devlekar went to Kharegaon toll plaza in Kalwa. They stopped a vehicle on the pretext of taking strict action against the motorist and took a bribe of ₹5,000 from the driver, identified as 41-year-old Raju Parte.Parte later registered a complaint with Kalwa police station and told officers that when he and his friend Vijay More were stopped near the toll plaza, they were scared of the consequences and had hence paid the bribe of ₹5,000. Parte said that Mahadik and Devlekar, who were dressed in police uniforms, seized the liquor bottles he had purchased. Parte told police that after he reached home, he remembered that the two were wearing sandals (not police attire), and so he decided to visit the toll plaza to check if the two accused were present. The complainant went back to the liquor shop where he had made his purchase and spotted Devlekar keeping an eye on anyone buying liquor. Once the person started his vehicle, Devlekar would follow them and then Mahadik would stop them near Kharegaon. Parte then approached Kalwa police station and a first information report was registered on July 5 under section 170 (personating a public servant), 171 (wearing garb or carrying token used by public servant with fraudulent intent), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 419 (punishment for cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). “A departmental enquiry was initiated against Mahadik and he was found guilty.

29-08-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 outbreak: Hospitals can’t be shut without following due process, says Bombay high court||Notwithstanding the Covid-19 pandemic, a hospital cannot be shut down without following due process of law, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) said on Thursday while striking down an order passed by local authorities abruptly shutting down a hospital in Jalna.“If a particular procedure is prescribed for initiating appropriate steps with regard to complaints against a hospital, such procedure has to be necessarily followed. A drastic order of closure of the hospital cannot be passed under the pretext of Covid-19 Pandemic,” said the bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice Shrikant Kulkarni.The bench struck down an order issued by the district administration on August 21 cancelling the registration of Arogyam Hospital of Dr Ritesh Agrawal, after finding out that no notice was issued to the doctor before issuing the order. The bench rejected submissions advanced by government pleader DR Kale that a number of complaints were received about malpractices in the hospital and there was a public uroar about the mismanagement at the hospital while Covid-19 pandemic was spreading. “It was in these peculiar circumstances that a show-cause notice of hearing before issuing the order of closure could not be given,” Kale said.The bench, however, refused to accept the reason in view of an order pronounced by HC in December 2018, holding that under provisions of the Bombay Nursing Homes Registration Act, 1949 a notice is required to be issued before cancelling registration of a hospital and that registration cancelled without giving hearing to the concerned is not legally sustainable.HC has now directed that the order dated August 21 be treated as a show-cause notice and that the competent authority under the Bombay Nursing Homes Registration Act, 1949 shall pass a fresh order on complaints received against Arogyam Hospital by September 19 after granting the hospital an opportunity to file reply to the notice and hearing.On the request of the government pleader the bench has restrained the hospital, where nine patients are admitted for treatment, from admitting any other patient to the hospital till fresh order is passed by the competent authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-outbreak-hospitals-can-t-be-shut-without-following-due-process-says-bombay-high-court/story-bcJYqCAwKA3pTraH4RabDL.html
29-08-2020||City||Supreme Court upheld our contention: Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray on final-year exams’ verdict||Maharashtra tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray said he welcomes the Supreme Court’s (SC) decision stating that universities cannot promote students without holding final-year examinations. Thackeray said that the SC order reiterated the state’s demand to let state governments decide on when to hold the exams, and not conduct them by the September 30 deadline set by the University Grants Commission (UGC).Thackeray also heads the Yuva Sena, the youth wing of the ruling Shiv Sena. Yuva Sena is one of the petitioners in the SC which had challenged the UGC directive to hold examinations amid the coronavirus outbreak.In a series of tweets, Thackeray wrote, “As Yuva Sena, we welcome the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court… The Hon’ble SC has reiterated that it is upto the respective State Governments to decide on when and how to hold examinations, not at the insistence of the 30th September deadline of the UGC. The Yuva Sena stands firmly for the well being and good health of the students, teachers, non teaching staff and their families (sic).” Thackeray said that the SC has upheld the state’s contention to uphold the decision taken by the state disaster management authority (SDMA). Earlier in the day, Yuva Sena secretary Varun Sardesai also welcomed the SC’s decision, but said that a day after India recorded over 75,000 new Covid-19 cases, the “SC in a video-conference judgment said final-year exams for lakhs of students are to be compulsorily held.” In a series of tweets, Sardesai said, “We thank SC for accepting our argument that SDMA overrides UGC guidelines and to allow postponing exams till the situation normalises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/supreme-court-upheld-our-contention-states-can-decide-when-to-hold-exams-maharashtra-minister-aaditya-thackeray-on-final-year-exams-verdict/story-NdVI2VVFUWHQl55OZObq6M.html
29-08-2020||Mumbai||Students, colleges in Mumbai seek clarity on details about holding final-year exams after Supreme Court verdict||Months of ambiguity over the end-of-term final-year exams were finally brought to an end on Friday, after the Supreme Court (SC) ruled that all the universities in the country will have to hold exams to promote students. Even as the Maharashtra government announced to follow the Apex court order, students and colleges are still confused, trying to figure out how and when the exams will be held in the upcoming weeks. The state education department has assured clarity over the exam schedule and other minute details soon. “Colleges are currently working on virtual classes and a majority have decided to conduct semester exams by November this year. Going by the state government’s announcement, the final-year exams might also take place around the same time, leaving teachers burdened again,” said a senior professor of a suburban college. She added that before announcing the exam dates, the state government will have to clarify the minutest of details such as how the exam will be conducted, how the papers will be set and assessed, among others. To give themselves enough time for clarity, several final-year students had decided to defer joining foreign universities for higher studies by one semester. Many are still worried that after missing the August-September session, they might miss joining universities abroad in the January-February session too. “Due to the Covid-19 scare and uncertainty over my exams, I had deferred my intake to the February semester. I’m worried that I might not even make it for that semester, if the university exams and eventual results are delayed further,” said Akruti Patel, a final year Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) student, who has already been accepted by a Canadian university for Master of Business Management course. Several student organisations have called the SC verdict unfair, and claimed that the decision will put the health of students in jeopardy. “The SC verdict is completely unfair to the student community. Not only will this cause additional mental stress to students, but also pose a serious health hazard for all those who will be involved in the exam process,” said Mohammad Salman for the Student Islamic Organisation (SIO). He added that imposing University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines on all universities is contrary to the federal nature of education in the country and infringes on the rights of state governments and autonomous institutes. Some colleges, however, are not complaining about the verdict. “Conducting exams will hinder the current academic session but I’m sure every college has been mentally preparing for this situation, and so everything will be managed well,” said Rajendra Shinde, principal, St Xavier’s College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/students-colleges-in-mumbai-seek-clarity-on-details-about-holding-final-year-exams-after-supreme-court-verdict/story-XUOYMQS6Fs9ehNsouEhqKM.html

29-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt doesn’t rule out review petition over Supreme Court’s decision on final-year exams||The Maharashtra government has not ruled out the possibility of filing a review petition on the Supreme Court’s (SC) decision over holding final-year exams for professional and non-professional courses. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray discussed the issue with higher and technical education minister Uday Samant late on Friday.Samant said the option to file the review petition is still under consideration. “We respect the court’s decision. We will have to study it and take the opinion of the advocate general and officials from law and judiciary department before reaching a decision,” the higher and technical education minister said in response to a query over filing a review petition against the Apex court’s ruling. Samant also said that the state will also be holding discussions with vice-chancellors of universities, parents and students on how exams can be conducted safely, as the “health of students is the top priority”. He further said that the students will be given sufficient time to prepare for the exams and also advised students to continue their studies. “I will visit every university in the state and hold interactions with the vice-chancellors concerned as well as parents and students on how exams can be conducted safely, as their [students’] health is our top priority. The state will take its decision as soon as possible,” Samant said. On Friday, SC ruled that students cannot be promoted without giving the final-year exams and upheld the July 6 directive of the University Grants Commission (UGC) asking varsities across the country to hold exams by September 30. However, the court gave states the liberty to approach UGC if they wished to postpone holding the exams beyond the September 30 deadline in view of the Covid-19 outbreak. “We will not be holding exams in haste and will give sufficient time to the students for preparations, as the apex court has allowed the states to decide exam dates. UGC will be informed on when we will be in a position to hold the exams,” he said responding to questions on conducting exams. The state government has been opposing the final-year exams for professional and non-professional courses, as Maharashtra has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the country. The state had also earlier said that those students who wish to take the exams will be given the option to do so, when the state finds it is feasible. Samant said that the state government has always maintained that it is not in a position to hold exams. “I would have decided to stand by the decision if the court had allowed the states to take a decision on this but now we will have to find out a solution around the court’s decision, as there are containment zones, red zones and lack of transportation facilities in parts of state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-doesn-t-rule-out-review-petition-over-supreme-court-s-decision-on-final-year-exams/story-JdmO1n8emZjLngLDyC8ItL.html

Some of these patients were discharged from hospitals after recovery and the BMC was providing them with post-Covid care treatment.The step was taken as a part of a project, ‘Mumbai Maitri’, in collaboration with non-governmental organisation (NGO) ‘Project Mumbai’ and healthcare company Portea Medical, to track the health status of Covid-19 patients.As a part of the initiative, a dedicated remote-monitoring setup, comprising trained healthcare workers call home quarantined patients and maintain the regular follow-up of their and their family’s health status. A dedicated number, 022-62676897, has also been started for patients as a part of the initiative. In case of mental or emotional stress, patients and their families can reach out to emotional wellness experts and mental health counsellors on 18001024040.“The remote monitoring has been working in close coordination with all the ward-level control room and informs them of need for hospitals beds/ambulances if required for the patients. There will be focus on high-risk patients who have co morbidities or are aged above 55. This setup will complement the work done by the ward-level control room, thereby reducing their work load and freeing up their capacity to focus more on bed management and patient contact-tracing, “ a statement issued by the BMC read.Civic commissioner IS Chahal said BMC plans to share the details of the initiative with other authorities. “BMC has been relentlessly ensuring that Covid-19 care reaches all patients, including those at medical centres as well as in home isolation.

29-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body asks private hospitals to refer critical patients to its Covid-19 facilities||To reduce the city’s high fatality rate, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has urged private hospitals to refer patients in critical condition to civic-run Covid health centres and major hospitals, in case of deteriorating health or no sign of recovery.The city’s fatality rate is 5.3%, higher than the state’s fatality rate of 3.2%. BMC aims to bring it below 3%. After the civic body noticed a surge in Covid deaths in private hospitals, they decided to monitor private hospitals with higher fatalities. The civic body has been conducting weekly meetings with top 10 hospitals registering higher death rate. As per BMC’s analysis, the share of fatalities in private hospitals has increased from 15-20% in June to over 40% in August.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of health, said, “Our suggestion to them is to refer critical patients to our major hospitals and Covid centres. We have also told them to not hesitate to take opinions of outside experts like deans of our hospitals or members from the state task force. All of this is being done under our ‘Mission Save Lives’, as part of which we want to bring down the fatalities.”Mission Save Lives is a nine-point strategy to reduce fatalities, which includes video surveillance of each patient, mandatory audit of every death and giving bedpans to serious patients. It was launched on June 30.Deepak Baid, president of Association of Medical Consultants, said, “The Covid fatality rate has increased due to two major reason – late admission and lack of regular check-ups of patients advised home quarantine. Patients still do not know where to get tested if they show symptoms and the bed allotment system of BMC is poor. There needs to be regular follow-up with patients who are home quarantined and their oxygen levels need to be checked twice a day. Apart from private hospitals, BMC needs to improve a lot in various areas to bring down the fatality rate.”On Friday, Mumbai reported 1,217 new Covid-19 cases. There were 30 deaths due to Covid-19 taking the toll to 7,565. Of the 142, 108 cases recorded in the city so far, 19,407 are active. The total number of discharged patients is 1.48 lakh. The recovery rate of the city stands at 81% and doubling rate has increased to 86 days. As per BMC’s data, of the 30 deaths, seven were aged between 40 and 60 years. 23 were above 60 years. As of Thursday, 7.43 lakh Covid tests have been conducted in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-asks-private-hospitals-to-refer-critical-patients-to-its-covid-19-facilities/story-rIpbkSjW0ppq0pkVhmvgrI.html

Haryana Congress’ chief spokesman Bajrang Das Garg led the protest march in Hisar while other key party leaders, including Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Deepender Hooda, Kiran Choudhry, Kuldeep Bishnoi and Kumari Selja, who is in home quarantine, remained away from this protest. Garg said the central government was adamant on conducting the NEET and JEE by putting the students’ lives at risk.“Why isn’t the government paying heed to various stakeholders’ requests to postpone the exams due to rise in Covid-19 cases across the state. We are only requesting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to postpone these tests until the situation improves,” he added.Similar protests were held in Haryana’s most-affected districts of Faridabad and Gurugram, where 40 examination centres have been set up for NEET which will be held on September 13.Former Tigaon MLA Lalit Nagar, who led the protest in Faridabad, said, “The state government suspended the assembly session in just one day, despite adhering to safety guidelines. But the central government has decided to conduct these examinations while ignoring the virus spread,” he added.A student from Rohtak, Naveen Sharma, said they tried hard to convey it to the central government to postpone the exams, but to no avail. “Who will be responsible if one infected student appears at the exam centre?” he asked.However, Anamika from Rohtak said the government should conduct their exams so that their worries can end.“We don’t want to lose an academic year. If a soldier can perform his duty on the border amid Covid-19, why can’t we appear in an exam for three hours,” she said.Preparing to hold exams of college, varsity studentsHaryana education minister Kanwar Pal has said that the higher education department is preparing to conduct online or offline examination of the students. He said necessary arrangements will be made for conducting examinations in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.

29-08-2020||City||Working with Dushyant to tackle corruption in Haryana: Vij||Haryana home minister Anil Vij on Friday said “deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala and I are fighting together against corruption in the state”. His statement came a day after he said that his recommendations for the special enquiry team’s (SET’s) report on the alleged liquor scam have been accepted by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, while deputy CM Dushyant Chautala said there was no scam in the excise department.“Dushyant is a part of the government and I don’t think he will say that he is not satisfied with the probe,” Vij, who also holds the health portfolio, said.Clearing the air on reports of him and Dushyant having a conflict on the ‘liquor scam’, Vij said, “We both want to stop the liquor smuggling that used to take place during previous regimes. Keeping this in our minds, we are doing everything in our power to plug the flow of illegal liquor.”On being asked about reports of Dushyant’s dissatisfaction with the probe, the home minister said, “The SET has submitted its findings and now, that will be further investigated by the vigilance department of the government. As I said that he (Dushyant) is a part of the government itself, I think he would be on board with this.” Vij had on Thursday informed that the state government has ordered a vigilance probe into the findings of the SET constituted to investigate the alleged smuggling of liquor during the lockdown. The inquiry findings had revealed glaring deficiencies in the functioning of the excise and taxation department and indicated collusion of officials in smuggling and illegal sale of liquor. It also mentioned names of present excise and taxation commissioner IAS officer Shekhar Vidyarthi and the then Sonepat SP, IPS officer Pratiksha Godara.However, Dushyant, who also holds the excise and taxation portfolio, had maintained that there was no scam in the department and cited higher revenue generated during the pandemic. The deputy CM had earlier too rebuffed the allegations of the SET that had blamed Vidyarthi for hampering the visit of the team to a distillery and on other issues as well.It’s pertinent to mention here that a committee comprising three IPS officers to be headed by ADGP Kala Ramachandran has been constituted to look into the remarks made about the police functioning in the SET report as well as irregularities committed by the cops. The committee will submit its report in two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/working-with-dushyant-to-tackle-corruption-in-haryana-vij/story-gMIuFicm7PHFRAmnBHpLwI.html

29-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray chairs meeting on Metro car shed at Aarey, decision likely soon||Close to nine months after stalling the Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) car shed project at Mumbai’s Aarey Colony, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray chaired a meeting with state officials on Friday to discuss possible solutions. Officials privy to the meeting said the state might take a decision soon. Earlier in January, a four-member committee appointed by the state to look into possible options had said the car shed should be built in Aarey Colony itself to avoid further cost escalation and delay in the 33.5-km underground metro project. “The committee had already said the car shed should be in Aarey Colony to avoid further delays. The state will take an appropriate decision soon,” a top official said. Another official said that options in Pahadi Goregaon are also being looked at. Apart from the car shed, the state has also proposed a 32-storey Metro Bhavan in Aarey Colony. The state-appointed committee had, in December 2019 and January 2020, visited various sites, including a plot in Kanjurmarg, as suggested by environment activists. In August 2019, the Bombay high court (HC) had dismissed a bunch of petitions challenging tree-felling at Aarey Colony. On the night of October 4, amid huge protests from citizens and environmentalists, the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC) which is constructing the metro began felling trees. Twenty nine activists are arrested and charged under sections of the Indian Penal Code after clashes with police when tree felling was underway. MMRC had then said that 2,141 of the 2,185 trees to be felled for construction of the car shed were cut, which is effectively 97% of the trees needed to be cleared for the project.In November, after assuming office, CM Thackeray stalled all work at the site. A committee was later set up to look into alternative options for shifting the car shed. Phase-1 of the ₹32,000-crore metro is expected to be operational by December 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-uddhav-thackeray-chairs-meeting-on-aarey-colony-car-shed-decision-likely-soon/story-lRLRCtzfA3vkrAEZZEDxqK.html

It is likely for this system to move west-northwest over south Uttar Pradesh over the next 48 hours allowing rain intensity to be similar to what is being observed over Mumbai on Friday. Additionally, convergence due to strong lower level southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea and easterly winds from Bay of Bengal during this period would enhance rain activity.”Rain intensity was more over the past 12 hours (8am to 8pm on Friday) and location-wise rain showed Chembur recorded highest rain at 104mm followed by Kalyan 83.5mm, Mumbra 82.5mm, Navi Mumbai 80.2mm, Dombivli 79mm, Bhayandar 75mm, Bandra 62mm, BKC 53.6mm, Dahisar 51mm, Worli 43.4mm, and Mazagaon 26 mm. “Satellite and radar images indicated intense cloud formation over the north Konkan coast. Dense cloud patches were observed towards the eastern suburbs, Chembur rain figure is indicative of that,” said Hosalikar.IMD updated its district-wise rain forecast at 1pm with a yellow alert (heavy rain at isolated areas) for the rest of Friday and for Saturday for Mumbai and Thane. An orange alert (heavy to very rain) has been issued for Palghar and Raigad for Saturday. Heavy rain warnings have also been issued for Pune, Kolhapur, and the entire Vidarbha sub division.Independent meteorologists had predicted that MMR would witness an increase in rain from August 28 in response to the low-pressure system over central India. “There isn’t any severe weather potential since only moderate rain will continue. September will begin on a drier note and there are indications of subdued rain continuing during the first week. In fact, below average rainfall activity is possible in the first fortnight of September,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom.FORECASTThe city and suburbs can expect cloudy conditions with moderate to heavy rain on Saturday. The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) issued a high wind alert for the west coast, especially along Gujarat, for winds gusting to 45-55kmph and fishing community were advised not venture out to sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-crosses-3-000-mm-mark-with-33-days-of-monsoon-left-yellow-alert-issued-for-saturday/story-zEZXJMdfWaANvq2rMjBkuK.html

Thane collector has issued an alert to the municipal corporations and councils in its jurisdiction to alert the people residing near water bodies as there is a chance of gates being opened if the level rises further. The notice stated that on Friday around 3.30pm the water level at the dam was 71.95 metres. The overflow level of Barvi dam is 72.6 metre and once water level reaches 72.2m to 72.6m, the automatic gate will start discharging water.“Since there is continuous rainfall in Barvi dam premises, the water level is likely to rise. In order to take precautionary measures, all the civic bodies, tehsil offices and industrial region authorities have been asked to alert the citizens and take precautionary steps,” said an official from the Thane collector’s office, who did not wish to be named. The Thane collector’s office has asked to take measures in Ansoli, Rahtoli, Chon, Sagaon, Patil Pada, Chandap, Padir Pada, Pimploli Karand and Chandap Pada which are closer to the dam. Authorities concerned have been asked to inform the citizens of these areas. Last year, opening of Barvi floodgates had led to flooding in Diva, Thane, Ulhasnagar, Ambernath, Badlapur and Kalyan areas. Sunil Pawar, additional commissioner of Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation, said, “Based on the notification from the Thane collector’s office, ward officers have been asked to visit these places and alert the residents regarding not entering water bodies and take precautionary measures. The disaster management team has also geared up.” Thane region reported 9.8mm of rainfall on Friday while Kalyan-Dombivli reported 12.4mm, Bhiwandi 11mm, Ulhasnagar 10.8mm and Ambernath 9.4mm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/water-level-at-barvi-dam-rises-thane-collector-issues-alert/story-HMInf7zRypHj54kIKxt17L.html
29-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s first bilateral hand transplant conducted on 24-year-old train accident survivor||A Parel-based hospital on Friday conducted the Mumbai’s first bilateral hand transplant surgery. A team of surgeons performed a bilateral hand transplant on a 24-year-old woman, who had lost both her arms in a train accident six years ago.The surgery was conducted by a 12-member team led by Dr Nilesh Satbhai at Global Hospital, Parel. The team included plastic, microvascular and reconstructive surgeons, orthopaedic surgeons, and anaesthetists. The surgery began on Thursday night and went on for almost 15 hours till Friday evening, according to a statement from the hospital.“The patient has now been shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) postoperatively for further management,” said the hospital. Monika More, a Kurla resident, had lost both her arms in 2014 when she fell onto the tracks while trying to board a moving train at Ghatkopar railway station. Four years later, she registered for hand transplant surgery at Global Hospital and had been on the waiting list for a donor.On Thursday, the family of a 30-year-old man, who was declared brain dead at the Chennai branch of Global Hospital, agreed to donate his arms. The limbs were immediately flown to Mumbai on a chartered plane. While the entire procedure of flying in the donor arms, as well as the surgery, cost around ₹25 lakh, More’s uncle Vishwas Jadhav said that the family has not been charged anything so far. “Monika is stable and is being observed in the ICU. She is likely to gain consciousness anytime in the next 48 hours,” said Jadhav.Hospital sources said that it is difficult to predict the recovery time, given the complicated nature of the surgery. “Since the surgery has just been conducted, and for the first time in the city, it is hard to say how long the recovery process will take,” said a source.“We would like to thank the donor family and the donor hospital for the support extended. The zonal transplant coordination centre of the Transplant Authority, government of Tamil Nadu, Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation and National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation helped in the timely coordination and allocation. It goes without saying that the support extended by traffic police and the airport authorities of Mumbai and Chennai ensured timely transport of the organs,” said an official spokesperson for Global Hospital, Parel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-first-bilateral-hand-transplant-conducted-on-24-year-old-train-accident-survivor/story-ZllpXGgYhRSeB3NT1znxNJ.html
29-08-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Bombay HC rejects Sudha Bharadwaj’s plea for bail||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday rejected the interim bail application of Elgar Parishad accused Professor Sudha Bharadwaj, after going through an affidavit filed by the state with her August 21 medical reports that showed her vital parameters to be normal. The court also noted the undertaking by the state that if need arose, Bharadwaj would be shifted to a superspecialty hospital, like another accused and poet P Varavara Rao. Bharadwaj is lodged in Byculla women’s jail. Bharadwaj had approached the HC on June 11 after a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court rejected her interim bail application on the grounds of health. Bharadwaj had submitted that she suffered from various comorbidities and due to overcrowding in the Byculla women’s prison, she was susceptible to contracting the Covid infection, hence she should be granted bail. A division bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice VG Bisht, while hearing the bail application, was informed by advocate Ragini Ahuja that there was a contradiction in the July 21 and August 21 medical reports of Bharadwaj. She pointed out the report from July said her vital parameters were on the higher side and she had heart ischemia, while the report in August stated her vital parameters were normal and the aspect of heart ischemia was left out. The state, however, said Bharadwaj’s health was being monitored round-the-clock and she was being provided proper medication for her comorbidities. The affidavit further submitted that it was bound to provide all necessary medical facilities to Bharadwaj and would shift her to Sir JJ Hospital or even a superspeciality hospital. The bench observed there was no contradiction in the two reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-bombay-hc-rejects-sudha-bharadwaj-s-plea-for-bail/story-fgGAXUZNZoZMEKUlMWyGZJ.html
29-08-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Bombay HC disposes of petitions for Covid-19 test by Gonsalves, Teltumbde||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday disposed of the petitions filed by Vernon Gonsalves and Dr Anand Teltumbde, both accused in the Elgar Parishad case, seeking directions for them to be tested for Covid-19, as the state submitted their reports showing they had tested negative for the virus. Gonsalves and Teltumbde are currently lodged in Taloja jail. The bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice VG Bisht, while hearing the petitions, was informed by advocate Devyani Kulkarni that the correct report of Dr Teltumbde was not prepared and hence the state should be directed to comply as soon as possible. She further submitted that the state had only handed over a cover letter to the lawyers, which stated that Covid-19 tests were conducted and the reports were negative. She said the detailed report was not received. Chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare sought time and submitted the report of Gonsalves and the corrected report of Dr Teltumbde would be handed over to the families and hence the matter be placed for hearing after the lunch hour, which the court allowed. When the petition came up for hearing, Kulkarni informed the bench that they had received both the reports, and were satisfied and hence the petitions could be disposed of. Gonsalves and Dr Teltumbde had moved the petition, as they had been in close contact with Telugu poet P Varavara Rao, who is a co-accused in the Elgar Parishad case, while he was being treated in the Taloja jail hospital. As Rao had tested positive, Gonsalves and Dr Teltumbde had sought to be tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-bombay-hc-disposes-of-petitions-for-covid-19-test-by-gonsalves-teltumbde/story-hPdcfR2w05Wg7kJS1HXRbO.html

Advocate Satish Talekar told a division bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice VG Bisht that the petition challenged the move as the transfer was done after the Pune Police had filed the charge sheet and additional charge sheet. NIA’s advocate Sandesh Patil informed the court that he was not in a position to argue as he did not have a copy of the petition and hence needed two weeks. However, Talekar opposed it and submitted that Gadling had lost his mother last week, but due to the pendency of the current petition, the special NIA court was not hearing his application for interim bail and hence NIA should not be allowed two weeks. The court directed Talekar to serve a copy of the petition to NIA and directed NIA to file a reply within a week and posted the matter for hearing on September 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-bombay-hc-asks-nia-to-respond-to-surendra-gadling-s-petition-against-probe-transfer/story-ldH23rKjea8zrMzWEAw1NO.html
29-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra state board rolls out bilingual textbooks; teachers say it will make learning easy||In a bid to make concepts in mathematics and science easier for children in Maharashtra to understand, state’s publishing bureau Balbharti has rolled out its pilot project of introducing bilingual textbooks for students from Class 1 to Class 7. As a part of the first phase of the pilot project, schools from 59 administrative blocks across the state have been given bilingual textbooks with key terms and concepts written in English and Marathi. For instance, ‘Sukshmajeev’, which means microorganisms, in both languages in diagrams that refer to it. Likewise, concepts in maths such as addition, subtraction and division are also explained in Marathi. These textbooks are also integrated — all subjects are clubbed into a single textbook, which is then divided into three parts. Teachers from the state have said that students from vernacular-medium schools will benefit from the initiative and thus it should be scaled up. “Students from vernacular-medium schools face a tough time after entering colleges, as many terms and concepts that they have learnt in Marathi are taught in English. Using bilingual textbooks from an early age would help them overcome this hurdle,” said Suman Thorat, a teacher from a civic-run school in Mumbai. In January, Balbharti had sought suggestions and objections from experts for better implementation of the pilot. “The feedback [of the experts] was taken into consideration, and now textbooks for Class 1-7 are being rolled out in selected schools. The idea was to take feedback from schools and students, but owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, schools are shut physically. So we will have to wait and see,” said Vivek Gosavi, director, Balbharti. With schools conducting classes online owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, teachers have said that integrated textbooks will help in simplifying the learning process as students would not have to shift between multiple books at a time. Pravin Walke, assistant professor at National Centre for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, University of Mumbai, said learning maths and science in one’s own language along with English helps in understanding the concepts well. “Students have a better grasping capacity when they learn in their own language. It’s easier to relate when technical terms in these subjects are explained in English and Marathi. The move will mainly benefit students while they pursue their higher education, which is mostly in English. Bilingual textbooks are thus a welcome step,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-state-board-rolls-out-bilingual-textbooks-teachers-say-it-will-make-learning-easy/story-nUk9ocMMjODsLYPvr7iWoO.html

29-08-2020||Mumbai||3 Mumbai colleges yet to refund ₹2.5 crore to students: RTI||A right to information (RTI) request filed by a Maharashtra-based student organisation has revealed that several city colleges are yet to reimburse refundable deposits to students who graduated between 2006 and 2017. According to information revealed by the RTI, three colleges are yet to refund almost Rs2.5 crore collectively to their students.The Ambedkar Students Association (ASA) released the RTI findings on Thursday, which show that Jai Hind, Mithibai and GN Khalsa colleges have reimbursed only a part of the refundable deposit.College heads, however, said that no student has ever been denied the refundable deposit. As per university rules, said principals, such deposits can be secured by students within a time limit, and beyond that, the money can be converted into a student welfare fund for the current students of the institute.“We are a charitable trust and have to show our ledger books to the charity commissioner every year; we can’t afford to not follow the rules. Not only have students not claimed the money within the stipulated time frame, but in many cases, our students have refused to claim the money and asked us to use the fund for the benefit of students in the college,” said Ashok Wadia, principal of Jai Hind College. He added that never has there been a case of a student seeking refund of deposits being denied the same.As per documents shared by ASA, Jai Hind College has collected over Rs53 lakh in refundable deposit and has reimbursed Rs12.50 lakh over the years. Similarly, Matunga’s GN Khalsa College has collected over Rs1.39 crore between 2006 and 2017, and reimbursed around Rs22.6 lakh, while Vile Parle’s Mithibai College has collected Rs1.32 crore and refunded around Rs22.8 lakh to students.“Crores of rupees have not been refunded over the years by these colleges, and we can only imagine what the status is of other affiliated colleges of the University of Mumbai. We have demanded that the state government look into this matter immediately,” said a spokesperson for ASA.Principals of GN Khalsa and Mithibai College were unreachable for comment, despite several messages and calls by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-mumbai-colleges-yet-to-refund-2-5-crore-to-students-rti/story-D06B5s8pHQdAZS0SQQ1dqI.html
29-08-2020||Mumbai||Convicts not entitled to benefit of section 436A of CrPC: Bombay high court||A three-judge bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has held that a convict is not entitled to the benefit of section 436A of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) under which undertrials are entitled to bail on undergoing detention of up to half of the maximum sentence prescribed for the offences charged against them.“Reading the section as a whole, we find that the benefit under the section has been intended to be given only to undertrial prisoners,” said the bench comprising chief justice Dipankar Datta, justice Ravi Deshpande and justice Sunil Shukre.The bench answered a question referred by a division bench led by justice AS Chandurkar on August 20, while hearing a plea filed by a convict from Chandrapur, Maksud Sheikh, who has been convicted by the Chandrapur sessions court in November 2016 for voluntarily causing grievous hurt and sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment.After failing to get bail twice during pendency of his appeal, the 46-year-old labourer filed a third application claiming he was entitled to bail under section 436A of CrPC. He said he was booked and arrested in November 2014 and as such he has undergone more than half the sentence handed down to him.In support of his contention, he relied on an order passed by a division bench of the HC holding a convict entitled to bail under section 436A. However, the bench headed by justice Chandurkar refused to accept the view and referred the question for consideration to a larger bench.The three-judge bench accordingly decided on the question on Friday, holding that a convict is not entitled to the benefit of section 436A of CrPC.The larger bench clarified that “the situation which went into the birth of section 436A was of undertrial prisoners, primary concern being their incarceration in jail for long period of time pending investigation, inquiry or trial, even though the presumption of innocence till found guilty was operating in their favour”.The three-judge bench said the section was introduced by 2005 amendment to the CrPC in an endeavour to remedy the condition of misery of undertrials relegated to dark corners within jails.It added that the words “during the period of investigation, inquiry or trial” and “maximum period of imprisonment specified for that offence” used in section 436A are significant and they clearly indicated that only the person who has undergone detention for a period of half or more of the maximum prescribed punishment during investigation, inquiry or trial is eligible for release on bail.It added that the section does not say that a person who has been detained for half the period of imprisonment imposed would be eligible. Instead, the larger bench added, use of the words like “maximum period of imprisonment” shows that the legislature was aware of the difference in the status of an undertrial and a convict, and, with it, of the consequences of detaining a person who enjoys presumption of innocence till found guilty for unduly long time.The three-judge bench rejected argument advanced on behalf of the convict that section 436A is a beneficial provision that requires to be interpreted liberally and applied to convicts as well on grounds that appeal is considered an extension of trial.The bench said adopting liberal interpretation is possible only where there are two possibilities caused by ambiguity in wording, but there is no scope of interpretation when the wording of a section is clear and unambiguous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/convicts-not-entitled-to-benefit-of-section-436a-of-crpc-bombay-high-court/story-Dwfr8tpZhoeMWBRxYPp6JM.html
29-08-2020||Mumbai||Even before Maharashtra forest department acts on complaints, more mangroves hacked at Panje, Uran||Within a span of three days, over 50 mangrove trees have been chopped at the ecologically sensitive Panje area in Uran by unknown persons, alleged environmentalists and locals.On Friday, local resident and birder Parag Gharat found that 40 mangrove trees were hacked towards the creek-end of Panje from where high-tide water flows into the area. “The mangroves are being hacked overnight or early morning and the branches are being left at the site itself,” he said.The Maharashtra forest department said the violation comes even before they could commence their investigation at the site. Gharat had spotted similar violations towards the central part of the 213-hectare (ha) migratory bird roosting area on Wednesday, leading to a series of complaints filed by environmentalists.“There are very few trees left at the site and we are losing them at a rapid pace,” said Gharat.Environmentalist Aishwarya Sridhar said, “These mangrove trees, around five- to six-foot-tall each, used to be the roosting point for cormorants, golden plovers, owlets and was home to a large biodiversity. It has all been lost.”Destruction of mangrove and construction within 50 metres of them was banned by the Bombay high court (HC) in September 2018. Based on Gharat’s information, environment group Conservation Action Trust (CAT) on Friday filed a complaint with various bodies of the Maharashtra government and a HC-appointed high-power committee consisting state secretaries. They had also filed a complaint on Wednesday. “Repeated offences are happening at the same location, and the forest department has not thought it necessary to deploy staff there on a permanent basis. Nor have they carried out a detailed investigation of these violations with the help of the police,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee, CAT.Neenu Somraj, deputy conservator of forest (mangrove cell), said, “We have sought comments from Raigad district collector on this issue. The range forest officer has been directed to submit a report immediately. In the meantime, the matter will be raised during our next HC-appointed committee meeting in September.”The west side of Panje wetland is bordered with a narrow patch of mangrove (300-500-metre wide and 1.5-km long) which has been declared as Coastal Regulation Zone-I (having highest ecological protection) by the state government. The mangrove destruction was reported from this patch. “Land mafia operating out of Uran is hacking the trees as long as rainwater and high tide ingress is there. The minute weather conditions turn dry, they show that the area is devoid of mangroves to allow construction on it. It is high time the chief minister takes cognisance of rampant ecological destruction and fishing community’s livelihood,” said Stalin D, member of the HC-appointed committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/even-before-maharashtra-forest-department-acts-on-complaints-more-mangroves-hacked-at-panje-uran/story-ZrbHXmharJSttKzV06b8BJ.html
29-08-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC allows one taziya in south Mumbai with five persons||In a relief to All India Idaara Tahfuz e Hussainiyat, an Anjuman (religious organisation) representing a section of Shia community in south Mumbai, the Bombay high court (HC) has permitted them to take out a taziya from Bhendi Bazar to the graveyard at Mazagaon on Sunday (August 30) which is commemorated as Aashura, the day when the Holy Prophet’s grandson Imam Hussain was martyred in Karbala, Iraq. The court while refusing permission for a procession directed the organisation to give an undertaking to adhere to the guidelines prepared by the state for the same, failing which action would be initiated against them. A division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Madhav Jamdar, while hearing the petition, had been informed by advocate Rajendra Shirodkar, representing the organisation, along with advocate Shahzad Naqvi that carrying of alam and taziya was part of Muharram rituals, and hence directions should be issued to the concerned authorities to permit the organisation to take out a procession consisting 20-50 people from Bhendi Bazar to the graveyard at Mazagaon. Shirodkar had also sought permission for other rituals to be held every day for two hours from August 27 to 30. The bench had, on Thursday, directed the principal secretary (home) and the secretary of disaster management department to hear the petitioners and submit their decision on whether the organisation could be allowed permission and to what extent. After perusing the report on Friday, the bench directed the state to prepare guidelines for the organisation to take out the taziya and alam. The state submitted that only five people, including a cameraman/photographer, would be allowed to take out the taziya. The taziya would be taken on a truck and would stop 100 metres away from the graveyard, following which four persons would carry the taziya on their shoulders and would enter the graveyard to complete the rituals. After Shirodkar gave an undertaking on behalf of the organisation to adhere to the limited reliefs, the state submitted that it would only be applicable for the said organisation and should not be treated as a precedent. After hearing the submissions and as the organisation consented, the court disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-allows-one-taziya-in-sobo-with-five-persons/story-5fpvyx3QeLH6YpDL8yXQnK.html

The accused wanted a bike from her family which the woman’s family could not afford. This led to constant fight between the couple, and Khan allegedly assaulted his wife on most occasions. On August 24 when the woman was at her parents’ place, the accused argued with her over phone, said talaq three times and he told her not to come back home,” said a police officer.

29-08-2020||City||Panvel police arrest three for credit, debit card fraud||Panvel police arrested three men for running a phishing scam since the past two years by conning debit card and credit card holders outside India and making online purchases from their accounts. The three accused, identified as Mudassir Shaikh, 38; Rafiq Ansari, 58; and Salman Ansari, 27, were arrested on Tuesday from Mumbai. Shaikh worked with Rafiq who is into selling used cars while Ansari is an electrician. Apart from buying goods, the accused also used the stolen cards to pay for food they ordered online as well as hotel stays, said police. The racket was unearthed when Panvel police was investigating a cybercrime wherein a Panvel welder lost ₹1 lakh in a debit card scam in June. Police sources said that during technical analysis and tracing IP addresses of suspects in the case, police found a lead in Mumbai. “During interrogation, we learnt of the involvement of three accused in other similar cyber frauds. The accused used stolen debit card and credit details to target people, mostly those residing outside India. They have been running the racket since March 2019. Using the cards, they would make purchases through online e-commerce websites,” said a police officer requesting anonymity. Based on preliminary investigation, police estimate they have duped scores of victims of ₹2.5 lakh and the figure is likely to rise as officials continue digging into previous purchases made by the accused. Panvel city police took assistance of the Mumbai Police’s crime branch and local police stations to trace Shaikh and his accomplices. It was ascertained that all three men were staying in Kurla, from where they were taken into custody on Tuesday. “We have arrested three persons but cannot reveal any further information at this stage as the case is still ongoing. We are on the lookout for more wanted accused,” said Ajaykumar Landge, senior inspector at Panvel city police station. Police said they are probing the involvement of the accused in the welder’s case, which the arrested accused have allegedly denied. Police are on the lookout for past accomplices of the arrested accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panvel-police-arrest-three-for-credit-debit-card-fraud/story-JZsWVSEt4S1JP8DSX1kZHJ.html
29-08-2020||Chandigarh||Lawrence Bishnoi can only be quizzed inside jail: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has said that gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, if needed by any agency, can only be quizzed at the Central Jail in Rajasthan’s Bharatpur, where he is lodged. The high court order came on the plea of the gangster, who had expressed fear that he might also face the same fate as UP’s dreaded gangster Vikas Dubey, who was killed in an encounter recently. He had sought security cover and his transfer on production warrant in handcuffs only.The gangster had alleged threat to his life from the police of Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan and even the superintendent of the Central Jail, Bharatpur. However, he had said that for now, he was seeking protection only in the case of Haryana. With several FIRs registered against him in Haryana and Rajasthan, the petitioner is now apprehensive that when he is taken for interrogation in the context of the FIR registered in July in Sirsa, he may be ‘eliminated altogether’, his lawyer had told the court. Bishnoi has nearly two dozen FIRs registered against him, including attempt to murder, extortion, snatching, carjacking and cases under the Arms Act in Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh. The high court bench of justice Amol Rattan Singh, while seeking response from Haryana by September 18, asked the state as to why, especially in the situation of current pandemic, he cannot be interrogated at Bharatpur. Till then, if needed to be quizzed, he be quizzed there only, the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lawrence-bishnoi-can-only-be-quizzed-inside-jail-hc/story-UALjGiGAiuFxWsY23Hxu7M.html
29-08-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death case: Congress, BJP trade barbs over drugs angle||The Congress has demanded an investigation into the alleged nexus between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and filmmaker Sandeep Ssingh in connection with Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. The BJP hit back questioning why the Maharashtra police overlooked “drug dealing angle” to the case and whether they were trying to shield some political leaders from the ruling Congress, Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) alliance in the state.When HT called Ssingh for a comment, his phone was switched off, and he had not responded to a message till the time of going to press.State Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant has written to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and home minister Anil Deshmukh seeking a probe into the drug dealing in Bollywood. He claimed the filmmaker has links with BJP leaders from the state. Sawant said it needs to be investigated if the leaders had been shielding people involved in narcotics dealings. He added it appears BJP’s top state leaders are very close to the Bollywood members and it needs to be probed if they are privy to the drug dealing.“I have tweeted the poster of biopic on the life of Prime Minister Narendra Modi produced by Sandeep Ssingh. The poster was released by then Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. We want to know if this was the reason why the drug nexus in Bollywood was not probed by the previous government. It needs to be clarified that Sandeep Ssingh’s involvement in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case was the reason why the case was hurriedly handed over to CBI and Enforcement Directorate, the agencies controlled by the Central government,” Sawant said.BJP leader and former CM Devendra Fadnavis questioned why the state did not probe the Ssingh angle. “The state police kept maintaining it was a suicide. They should have probed Ssingh too. Now a news has come about how Sssingh was co-producing a biopic on the life of honourable Bal Thackeray a few years ago. What will Congress now say about that link,” he said.BJP MLA Ram Kadam separately wrote to Thackeray demanding a debate in the Assembly over the matter and a through probe into the drugs dealing in Bollywood. In his letter to Thackeray on Wednesday, Kadam said, “The use of drugs in Bollywood is the latest angle which has come up in the SSR [Sushant Singh Rajput] death case and needs to be investigated. Bollywood has a long-lasting impact on the youths and such revelations related to the film personalities are harmful as many draw inspiration from them. The issue needs to be discussed during the forthcoming monsoon session beginning from September 7.”Kadam said they do not know why the Mumbai police did not check the drug angle related to the case during their probe that went on for 65 days. “Why didn’t Sandeep Ssingh’s chats not come to the fore? Was Mumbai police trying to shield some leader from the ruling parties. Congress is now raising doubts over Sandeep Ssingh’s links to our leaders, but it should have probed it when the investigation was with the state police. The state government is free to probe the Sandeep Ssingh episode to any extent.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-congress-bjp-trade-barbs-over-drugs-angle/story-Hu6p2h8QYa4lEil0nbnzVI.html
29-08-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: CBI questions Rhea, brother; ED issues summons to Goa hotelier||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) began questioning actor Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik Chakraborty on Friday in actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case. Rhea, who arrived for questioning at 10.30am at the DRDO guest house at Santacruz, left around 9pm. The CBI also questioned Rajput’s flatmate and creative manager Siddharth Pithani, cook Neeraj Singh and domestic help Keshav Bachner, too, for the fourth consecutive day on Friday. Meanwhile, Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials issued summons to a Goa-based hotelier, Gaurav Arya, and have called him for questioning on Monday in a parallel probe into allegations of money laundering related to the Rajput case. Arya runs Hotel Tamarind and Café Cotinga in Goa.ED officials visited Hotel Tamarind at Anjuna, a coastal village in north Goa, but found the property to be shut. They have stuck a notice on the door of the hotel, which according to officials has been shut since the lockdown restrictions were enforced in March to contain the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak. The notice stated that Arya must meet Rajiv Kumar, assistant director, ED, at 11am on Monday in connection with a case filed under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.Arya has also been booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, and is being investigated by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). The NCB had on Wednesday registered a first information report (FIR) against Rhea, Showik, talent manager Jaya Saha, Rajput’s former manager Shruti Modi and Arya under sections 20, 22, 27 and 29 of the NDPS Act.The NCB action came after the ED wrote to the agency, asking it to probe if drugs were supplied to Rajput and Rhea. Arya’s name cropped in Rhea’s WhatsApp conversations related to drugs. ED officials, however, refused to divulge details of whether there were any financial transactions between Arya and Rajput, or Chakraborty or others named in the Enforcement Case Information Report registered by ED. On Thursday, ED had questioned Saha and also summoned Rhea’s father, Indrajeet Chakraborty, to access his family’s bank lockers in the Vakola branch of Axis Bank. Earlier on August 10, ED had questioned Rhea, Indrajeet and Showik. Later, Modi and Pithani, too, were questioned. Investigators had extracted information into the formation of four companies by Rajput and Chakraborty, and her family. Two of these companies were registered, while the other two were under the process of being registered. Investigators wanted to understand the terms mentioned in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed during the formation of these companies to understand how the profit sharing was designed. ED sources said Rhea had responded to all questions, but could not divulge details of the exact sequence of events. ED has also questioned Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda, Chakraborty’s chartered accountant (CA) Ritesh Shah, and Rajput’s CA Sandeep Sridhar in the case.Rajput, 34, was found dead in his Bandra flat on June 14. The post-mortem report concluded he died by suicide. After a two-week quiet, a controversy erupted over the death, as a Bihar police team constituted to probe the case on a complaint by the actor’s family alleged it got no cooperation from its Mumbai counterparts. The probe was handed over to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) by the Supreme Court, after it upheld the validity of the Bihar Police’s first information report (FIR) filed on the basis of a complaint by Rajput’s father, KK Singh, who has accused actor Rhea Chakraborty and her family of abetting his son’s suicide and misappropriating his money.Rhea, who has been questioned multiple times by the agencies, has denied all allegations levelled against her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-cbi-questions-rhea-brother-ed-issues-summons-to-goa-hotelier/story-pV5R7SUU8lXPAgl2zIyZdK.html
29-08-2020||City||Road rage: Biker dragged under car for 150 metres in Delhi||New Delhi: A bike rider was critically injured after he was dragged under a car for about 150 metres at Pankha Road in west Delhi during the early hours on Friday following a road rage. Police arrested the car driver and his associate and charged them with attempt to murder.The arrested men were identified as Durgesh Tiwari, 31 and Karan Sethi, 44, both residents of Uttam Nagar.Deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said a PCR call was received around 2. 45 am on Friday reporting that a man has been injured in an accident. A police team that reached the spot, found that one Chetan Kumar, who also lives in Uttam Nagar, was riding his bullet motorcycle when a car rammed his two wheeler from behind, the DCP said.Purohit said, Kumar then confronted the car driver and stood in front of the car asking the two occupants to get down. “As told by witnesses, the car driver and co-passenger didn’t came out from the car and instead accelerated, hitting the bike rider. Kumar was thrown on the bonnet of the car. He held the wiper of the car and sat on the bonnet. He cried for help but the car driver didn’t stop the car and drove towards Pankha Road in Janakpuri,” the DCP said.The witnesses said when the car reached near Gold Gym at Pankha Road, Kumar lost grip and fell off the car. “They said because the car driver still didn’t stop the car, Kumar was dragged under it for about 100 to 150 metres. Passersby and locals saw Kumar stuck under the car and forced the driver to apply brakes,” he said.Seeing a crowd gathering at the spot, while the driver managed to flee, locals caught his co-passenger and reported the matter to the police, the DCP said. “Kumar was rushed to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital from where he was referred to Safdarjung Hospital. A case of attempt to murder was registered and with the information from the co-passenger, the driver was also arrested,” Purohit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/road-rage-biker-dragged-under-car-for-150-metres-in-delhi/story-2JH7mYbap8E6RoGNDWGcyM.html
29-08-2020||Mumbai||No water cuts in Mumbai from Saturday after level of seven lakes rises to 95.19%||There will be no water cuts in Mumbai from Saturday, the Brihamumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) announced on Friday, as the level of the seven lakes that supply water to the city has reached 95.19%. The seven lakes are Tansa, Bhatsa, Middle Vaitarna, Upper Vaitarna, Tulsi, Vehar and Modak Sagar.The civic body had imposed 20% water cut in the city on August 5 as the seven lakes had 37.36% useful water content, or 539.307 billion litres, as opposed to 89.96% at the same time in 2019. The cut was reduced to 10% on August 21 after levels in the seven lakes crossed the 85% mark. On Friday, BMC announced, “Due to heavy rain in the past few days, water storage has increased in the catchment area of seven lakes, which supply water to BMC area. As of 6am today [Friday], the total water storage in all seven lakes has reached 95.19 per cent. Taking this into consideration, the BMC administration has decided to withdraw the water cut that was implemented from August 5, 2020. Accordingly, regular water supply will be provided to BMC area from August 29, 2020.”BMC also decided to regularise water supply to villages and areas in Thane and Bhiwandi-Nizampur Municipal Corporation, which receive their supply from the Mumbai civic body’s lakes.As of Friday morning, there is 1,377.69 billion litres of water in the seven lakes. At the same time last year, the level of useful water content was 1,395.663 billion litres, or 96.43%.BMC supplies 3,850 million litres per day (MLD) as against a demand of 4,200 MLD. After the 20% water cut, BMC was supplying 3,080 MLD of water to Mumbai.The seven lakes are bifurcated into two systems – the Vaitarna system supplies water to the western suburbs and the island city, and the Bhatsa system supplies to the eastern suburbs. The lakes are situated in Mumbai, Thane and Palghar districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-water-cuts-in-mumbai-from-saturday-after-level-of-seven-lakes-rises-to-95-19/story-jOhW59bU1Izb2qVIeqvcxK.html
29-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra records over 14,000 Covid-19 cases for a third consecutive day||Maharashtra recorded more than 14,000 cases for the third consecutive day, as the state’s Covid-19 tally reached 747,995 with the addition of 14,361 infections on Friday. The state also reported 331 fatalities, although 248 of these deaths were from the past two days, 47 from the past week and 36 from the period before that. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said the state had decided to implement ‘Chase the Virus’ programme across Maharashtra to identify elderly and comorbid people and protect them to keep the fatalities in check. The announcement came after the Centre expressed concern over the state’s high fatality rate. Union cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba held a review meeting on Thursday with officials from nine states, including Maharashtra, and a union territory where the case fatality rate (CFR) is high.Maharashtra’s CFR stands at 3.18% against the national CFR of 1.83%.The state authorities are concerned over their failure to bring down CFR, despite setting a target of bringing it down to less than 1%. The government has now directed the district administrations with the high CFR to go for the aggressive tracing, surveillance of high- and low-risk patients and provide quick treatment to patients. “In the first week of July, we had asked the district and civic administrations to reduce the positivity rate to less than 10% and CFR to less than 1%. More than two-and-half-months later, our positivity rate is around 19% and CFR at 3.25%. This is because of the lacklustre approach in surveillance and weak infrastructure in certain parts of the state. We are now gearing up the district administrations for immediate improvement on these two fronts,” said a Mantralaya official, on condition of anonymity.Apart from the announcement of implementing ‘Chase The Virus’ drive across the state, Thackeray also announced ramping-up health infrastructure in rural areas. “The drive will tap citizens over 55 years and treat them for comorbidities. We have erected jumbo and field hospitals to treat Covid-19 and they are equipped with oxygen and ventilator facilities. Although these facilities are temporary, we could use the equipment while setting up permanent health facilities. We want to make available health facilities to the rural population on the lines of facilities available in Mumbai,” he said. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said Maharashtra has seen a drop in CFR over the past two months, although the cumulative rate is still high. “It will rapidly come down over the next few weeks and we expect the infection curve to touch baseline by Diwali, in the second week of November. It is true that the infrastructure in some districts still needs to be ramped up. In some districts, the turnaround time for test reports is more than two days, even though testing facilities in rural areas, too, have been augmented. This has resulted in reporting of more cases in rural areas,” he said. Mumbai (5.3%), Solapur (4.1%) and Akola (4.1%) are among the districts with highest CFR in the state. Solapur has brought it down from 10% in the past three months by taking adequate measures. “We have been focussing on comorbid patients in the rural areas, where the spread has penetrated. We have been providing better facilities at Covid centres so that the patients are not scared of revealing their symptoms. We trace at least 20 high- and low-risk patients and it has helped us in reducing the daily cases to 350-400 from more than 700 a few days ago. In urban parts, we have reached the peak and in rural areas it’s expected to reach plateau in the next six weeks,” said Dr Pradeep Dhele, civil surgeon of Solapur district.Dr Rajkumar Chauhan, civil surgeon of Akola district, said aggressive tracing and testing has helped them reduce fatality rate too. “Akola district is known for the high salinity water leading to chronic kidney ailments among people, especially the elderly. We have been focusing on comorbid patients, with the help of general practitioners and local corporators. We have been tracking at least 18 people against every positive patient and it has helped us in containing the spread to daily 40-45 patients. We expect our CFR to drop to 3% in one month or so,” he said. Meanwhile, the number of active patients across the state on Friday crossed 1.80 lakh and 11,607 recoveries pushed up the total number of recovered patients to 543,170. The recovery rate of the state stands at 72.62% against the national rate of 76.24%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-over-14-000-covid-19-cases-for-a-third-consecutive-day/story-JhdkvEV8kd6VHYAnLirlaN.html
29-08-2020||Delhi||Cop probing Delhi riots case shifted||Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal transferred several senior officers within the Delhi Police on Friday afternoon, including Rajesh Deo, who was deputy commissioner of police (crime) and had recently won the union home minister’s medal for excellence in investigation. Deo was also probing some of the Delhi 2020 riots cases. Deo, who held additional charge of the legal cell, will continue to head the unit. Indian Administrative Service officials Renu Sharma and Rajeev Verma were reinstated four months after they were suspended. While Sharma (1988 batch) has been posted in the urban development department, Verma (1992 batch) has been posted in vigilance. Both were suspended on March 29, with the Union government citing lapses in duty in implementation of the nationwide lockdown imposed from March 25. The orders were issued soon after huge crowds of migrants had gathered in Anand Vihar and other areas in the city borders. In the list of transfers within the Delhi Police, Ram Gopal Naik, another DCP of the crime branch, was transferred to the traffic unit. Naik was among the officers who brought fugitive cricket bookie Sanjeev Chawla back to the country in February this year after winning an extradition case in a United Kingdom court. Chawla is an accused in the 2000 match fixing scandal that rocked Indian cricket. North district DCP Monika Bhardwaj has been posted in crime branch. Dwarka district DCP Anto Alphonse has been given the charge of north district and DCP Santosh Kumar Meena who was posted in Delhi police’s security division has been appointed DCP of Dwarka district. IPS officer, Jaspal Singh who was Goa’s Inspector General of Police, has been appointed the joint commissioner of the New Delhi range in place of officer Anand Mohan, who has been promoted as the special commissioner of training.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/senior-officers-transferred-in-delhi-police/story-0eKxDkMaYye4vyhGgHAvnM.html
29-08-2020||Delhi||Two inebriated men kill man looking for his missing son in Pul Prahladpur||A 40-year-old man, who was searching for his missing son in southeast Delhi’s Pul Prahladpur, was beaten to death on Thursday night allegedly by two men who were infuriated at being “persistently” asked if they knew of the boy’s whereabouts. Police said the two men — Dheeraj Arora (29) and Rakesh Arora (31) — have been arrested and charged with murder. They both drive gramin-sewa vehicles and live in Pul Prahladpur area, officers said.Southeast deputy commissioner of police RP Meena said a team from the Okhla Industrial Area station was patrolling the area on Thursday night when the incident came to light. “The team was at Maa Anand Mai Marg when they saw a pregnant woman crying for help, with an injured man lying unconscious beside her. Our personnel took the man to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival,” Meena said.Police said the woman, Pappi Devi, and her husband, Krishan Kumar Meena, hail from Jaipur. They were searching for their seven-year-old son, who they said had gone missing a few minutes ago, in the area.“She said that when her husband asked the men about his son, they got irritated and assaulted him, and hit him on the head with a metal rod,” Meena said.Multiple teams were deployed to nab the murder suspects and find the couple’s missing son, he said. The boy was located a few hours later, and reunited with his mother.“A raid was carried out after we received a tip-off that one of the two drivers sleeps in mini-trucks nearby, which led to Rakesh Arora’s arrest,” the officer said.The officer said Rakesh confessed to have attacked the man and also revealed the whereabouts of his brother Dheeraj, who was then arrested from the area. “The brothers said they were both drinking alcohol in their tempo when Meena asked about his missing son. They said they got irritated because Meena was repeatedly asking about his child. Dheeraj caught hold of him and Rakesh hit his head with a metal rod. When his wife started shouting for help, both of them fled,” Meena said.Police said they have recovered the rod used in the crime. The two arrested men do not have any previous criminal involvement, Meena said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-beaten-to-death-in-delhi-s-pul-prahladpur/story-yp6coroXZCNuJvEMqEmH1I.html
29-08-2020||Delhi||Anna Hazare turns down BJP request for anti-AAP protest||Social activist Anna Hazare on Friday turned down Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta’s request to join the party in a “mass movement” against the Aam Aadmi Party government. Gupta, on August 24, wrote to Hazare asking him to join a BJP-led agitation alleging the AAP government in Delhi has become the “new name of social, political and economic corruption”.In his letter, posted on his Facebook profile on Friday, the 83-year-old criticised the BJP for doing little to deliver on its promise of “corruption-free India”.Hazare said he felt “sorry” reading Gupta’s letter, writing that there “can’t be anything more unfortunate” that a party [BJP] which claims to be the largest political party in the world is calling an “83-year-old man, living in a 10x12 feet room in a temple, with no money or (political) power” to join their movement.Hazare, who along with Arvind Kejriwal (now Delhi chief minister) and others started the India Against Corruption (IAC) movement in 2011, wrote, “It is your government at the Centre. A lot of Delhi issues are under the central government. CBI, Economic Offence (Wing), vigilance, Delhi police are under the Centre’s control. The Prime Minister has always said that his government has taken tough action to eradicate corruption. If the Delhi government is corrupt, then why is it that your government is not taking any action against them? Or is it that the Centre’s claims to eradicate corruption are hollow claims?”Gupta issued a statement, in which he said, “Anna Hazare ji had organised a mass movement against corruption in Delhi in 2011 and the AAP, born from the same movement, is steeped in corruption today. In this context, the BJP had requested him to give his support. He himself has admitted that he has always been protesting against corruption and will take part in the fight against corruption in future. The BJP is committed and capable to fight every battle against corruption. We request those who have been fighting against corruption to join this movement.”When contacted, AAP refused to comment.Sanjay Kumar, director at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), said the BJP tried to use Hazare to give legitimacy to its anti-corruption campaign. “But the move backfired. Hazare had distanced himself from AAP after the latter’s victory in assembly elections in 2015. The BJP, I think, tried to use him as a symbol to start their anti-corruption campaign. It would have given legitimacy to their campaign given that Hazare is an anti-corruption crusader. But BJP needs to understand that unlike 2015, AAP won the recent assembly elections because of the work it has done in its first tenure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/anna-hazare-refuses-to-join-bjp-leaders-call-for-protest-against-aap/story-oyv3sWwBS5GX18d631CBaL.html
29-08-2020||Delhi||No change in power tariff, marginal hike in pension surcharge||Power bills of all consumers will see a marginal hike of 1.2 percentage points from September 1 as the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) on Friday announced the new tariff order for 2020-21, keeping the per unit and fixed rates constant but slightly increasing a surcharge. The DERC kept all rates such as per unit energy cost and fixed charges on the sanctioned load of every household same as before. But power bills will still see a minor increase as the regulator raised the ‘pension trust surcharge’ from 3.8% to 5%. Chief minister and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal tweeted soon after the regulator announced the power tariff changes, saying this is the sixth consecutive year that people had been spared of a tariff hike. “Congratulations to the people of Delhi. At a time when power tariffs are increasing year on year everywhere, tariffs in Delhi have not been increased for the sixth consecutive year. In some sectors, we have reduced tariffs. This is historic. This is happening because you elected an honest government in Delhi,” Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi.The chief minister, however, did not account for the increase in fixed charges that happened in 2018. After facing criticism for hiking the fixed charges back then, the Delhi government revised its subsidy structure last year, wherein electricity is now completely free for residents who consume up 200 units of power every month. Those who consume up to 400 units, get a discount of up to Rs 800 every month. Explaining the bit about “reduced tariffs” in Kejriwal’s tweet, DERC chairperson Justice (retired) SS Chauhan said the commission waived off the surcharge of 20% on the ‘time of day’ (ToD) tariff levied primarily on industrial and commercial connections. This waiver will be applicable only for a month though, he said. Under the TOD scheme, non-domestic consumers, mostly factories, shops, industries, etc., who consume electricity during peak hours -- 2pm-5pm and 10pm-1am -- had to pay a 20% surcharge. This has been waived off for a month starting September 1. The rebate of 20% on consuming more electricity during the off peak hour of 4am-10am will continue. Apart from the goods and services taxes, two surcharges are levied on every electricity bill in Delhi. These are the pension surcharge, which goes towards paying pension to former employees of power utilities before the sector was decentralised, and the regulatory asset surcharge, which goes to discoms to make up for their revenue deficits. Under the new order, the regulatory asset surcharge will remain unchanged at 8%.The DERC chief said the increase in the pension surcharge was done on a proposal sent by the Delhi government. “Due to outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, no tariff hike has been considered by the commission for the financial year 2020-21. Only the pension surcharge has been marginally increased because the number of pensioners under the erstwhile Delhi Vidyut Board increased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-power-tariff-hike-in-delhi-but-bills-will-see-an-increase-as-surcharge-up/story-GR3HuPgWarTVaDEdwarGYO.html
29-08-2020||Delhi||After hot and humid week, skies open up, cause snarls||After a hot and humid week, overcast skies gave way to a downpour across the national capital on Friday. The spell of rain that lasted almost three hours resulted in several arterial roads being waterlogged, causing snarls at many places. The Delhi traffic police said severe congestion was reported from Ashram intersection, Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway (DND), Noida Link Road, Vikas Marg, India Gate roundabout, and Connaught Place Outer Circle, among others.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had issued an ‘Orange’ alert on Friday morning for Delhi-NCR warning of ‘light to moderate’ rain and thundershowers. The Safdarjung observatory, considered representative of Delhi’s weather, recorded 23.2mm of rain in the ‘moderate’ category. Delhi Ridge weather station recorded 44mm rain while Palam and Lodhi Road stations got 35.8 mm and 23.6 mm rainfall, respectively. Aya Nagar station, however, recorded only ‘traces’ of rainfall. “Delhi received moderate rainfall, as the monsoon trough is passing over the city. Over the next two days, ‘light’ to ‘very light’ rain may occur, as the trough will be moving southwards. On September 1 and 2, another spell of moderate rain is expected in Delhi, as the trough is expected to move towards the north by then,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, said. He added that there was a forecast of light rain over the past week, but the monsoon trough had moved towards the Himalayan foothills because of which there was no rain in Delhi. On August 20 and 21, Delhi had received ‘heavy’ to ‘very heavy’ rainfall. Residential areas like GK-II, Green Park and Saket saw massive water logging with vehicles struggling to wade through knee-deep water on several stretches. Residents dialed the local municipal offices to pump out the water. Sanjay Rana, president, GK-II Welfare Association, said there was literally a river flowing outside Savitri Cinema while it was raining. “This is the scenario every time there’s good rainfall.The sewerage system is too old and overflows even with little rain. The sewer lines had to be re-laid, but the process has not started so far,” said Rana. Malvika Gupta, a resident of Saket D-block, said there was almost knee-deep water in the colony. “It happens every monsoon. It is such a nightmare for residents,” said Gupta. Commuters were stuck on the road for hours as traffic crawled on waterlogged roads. Aarti Arora, a commuter, said it took her more than an hour and a half to reach Ashram Chowk from DND Flyway. “There was a long queue on the DND and they were moving at a snail’s pace. It was the same at Ashram Chowk too,” she said.The rain, coupled with Haryana releasing extra water into the Hathinikund barrage led to a surge in the Yamuna river’s level. By 4pm Friday, the water level in the Yamuna at Delhi’s Old Railway Bridge was at 204.41 metres, close to the warning level of 204.50 metres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/after-hot-and-humid-week-skies-open-up-cause-snarls/story-mvWZ3g9WRiNlK0B1vO9LIP.html
29-08-2020||Delhi||New master plan puts spotlight on illegal colonies||Nine months after the Centre initiated the process of giving ownership rights to four million residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies in the national Capital, efforts are now being made to bring these colonies under the planning ambit.The Master Plan of Delhi-2041, a vision document for the city’s development, will focus on development in all unauthorised colonies, said a DDA official. Officials of the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), roped in by the DDA to prepare Delhi’s 2041 Master Plan, said efforts will be made to provide essential services and social infrastructure in these soon-to-be authorised colonies. Unauthorised colonies — that house nearly four million people — are an integral part of the city and can’t be ignored, urban planning experts said.Hitesh Vaidya, director NIUA, said, “The new master plan will focus on providing opportunities of regeneration in all typologies of development, especially unplanned residential areas, such as unauthorised colonies, where it is imperative to improve the residents’ quality of life.”For this, the NIUA and the DDA will hold a meeting with resident welfare associations of these colonies on September 2 to discuss their concerns and identify issues to be addressed.A senior DDA official said, “We are holding consultation with all stakeholders. This is to understand their problems faced by people in these localities, what they want and how those issues can be addressed better.”Though the contours of the new plan are yet to be finalised, Vaidya said, efforts will be made to create provision of social infrastructure in such illegal colonies. “We are looking at aspects such as provision of social infrastructure — like schools, parks etc — wherever possible. NIUA is supporting DDA with public engagement and we look forward to all stakeholders and residents using this platform to provide constructive suggestions for the next master plan,” Vaidya saidThe Centre handed ownership rights documents to 20 property owners under the Pradhan Mantri Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana (PM-UDAY) last year, days before the model code of conduct for the February 2020 Delhi assembly polls came into force.Ownership rights to residents of unauthorised colonies was one of the main poll planks of the BJP in the assembly elections held earlier this year. The DDA, the nodal agency for implementation of PM-UDAY, recently resumed the process to give ownership rights. Urban planner Shamsher Singh, the former chief town planner of the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi, said while ownership rights are being given, they can’t get building plans sanctioned as per the existing MPD-2021 norms. “In some of these unauthorised colonies, the lanes are not wide enough because of which the building plans can’t be sanctioned. They need a different set of development control norms,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/master-plan-2041-to-focus-on-development-of-unauthorised-colonies/story-M2wZLAGxJBjLtGpaNDgxyO.html
29-08-2020||City||SC order: Exams already over or are being conducted in Delhi’s varsities||New Delhi: The Supreme Court’s order on Friday, saying students cannot be promoted without writing final-year exams, has little significance for state-run universities in Delhi or the three central universities , which have already conducted their exams or are in the process of doing so. Though the Delhi government had in July cancelled exams of final-year students in state-run universities, keeping the Covid-19 crisis in mind, several of them had already conducted their evaluation by then.“States cannot promote students based on internal assessment or past performance. If states want to hold exams after September 30, they can approach the University Grants Commission for the same,” a three-judge bench, headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, said.Delhi has eight state universities -- Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi Technological University (GGSIPU), Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research University (DPSRU), Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW), Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIIT-D), Ambedkar University, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology (NSIT), and National Law University Delhi. Delhi University, Jamia Millia Islamia and Jawaharlal Nehru University are central universities. DU is already conducting online open-book exams for its final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students, while offline exams are slated to begin September 14. Jamia has already evaluated its final- year students based on multiple internal assessments. At JNU, some schools have finished their online exams while papers are pending for others.In July, the Delhi government had announced cancellation of all end-semester examinations in eight state-run universities across the capital, calling for an evaluation based on internal assessments and previous examinations.“We had already conducted online examinations and results were also declared. Students have also joined their placements. So we won’t really be affected by this order,” said Anup Lather, Public Relations Officer at DTU.NSUT too had conducted its final-year exams orally. “We have not read the verdict yet but our students have been evaluated orally. Their results are in the final stage and will be declared within a week,” said Sujata Sengar, Dean Academics, NSUT.IGDTUW also conducted online exams for its final-year students in May. Ambedkar University, which focuses more on a continuous assessment process during the entire semester instead of putting more weightage on a single end-semester examination, evaluated its students based on the online assessments.Asked if the order would affect them, the university said they had already conducted their exams. “In AUD, assessment for courses is spread over the duration of the semester (Continuous Assessment). University has completed Assessment and results have been declared for all the programmes,” the university’s public relations office said, in a statement.However, GGSIPU, which has around 170 courses and over one lakh students under its wing, is yet to conduct written exams for some of its courses. For others, evaluation has been done on the basis of viva and dissertation. “We are awaiting formal directions from higher education. In case exams are to be done, we shall work out modalities and the mode,” said vice-chancellor Mahesh Verma.. Despite repeated attempts, the Delhi government too did not respond in the matter on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sc-order-exams-already-over-or-are-being-conducted-in-delhi-s-varsities/story-an199CdfjIdn9iVMP146TK.html
29-08-2020||Noida||Gautam Budh Nagar records an average 104 Covid-19 cases a day between Aug 21 and 27||Gautam Budh Nagar recorded an average of 104 new Covid-19 cases a day and discharged an average of 77 per day in the week from August 21 to 27.The health department said the increase in number of cases is due to higher testing rates. On Thursday, the district administration and teams of Noida and Greater Noida Authorities conducted sanitization drive at 48 locations. The teams are conducting surveillance, door-to-door survey and sampling, and running a dedicated call centre to monitor people in home isolation 24X7. Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the health department is conducting 3500-4000 testing per day. “These days we are conducting real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for Covid - 19. The test is able to detect slightest presence of virus in the body. The RT-PCR’s result rate is 8-10% while the Antigen test’s positive rate is only 2%,” he said. The Gautam Budh Nagar district has so far successfully treated and discharged 6483 patients while 959 other patients are undergoing medical treatment in different hospitals. A total of 45 persons have succumbed to the Coronavirus, including one on Thursday. The district has recorded so far 7497 Covid positive cases till now. On August 21, Gautam Budh Nagar recorded 127 coronavirus cases and discharged 126 patients. On August 22 and August 23, the number of patients admitted to different hospitals were 98 and 79; and the number of patients discharged were 79 and 51 respectively. However, on August 24, the district recorded 138 patients – highest in August – and discharged 51 patients. The situation slightly improved on August 25 when 90 patients were admitted against 98 discharged. On August 26, again the number of patients increased to 89 and the patients discharged stood at 62. On Thursday, the district health department recorded 112 positive cases while 77 patients were discharged and one person died. The recovery rate of covid patients in the district stands at 86.6%, death 0.6% while 12.8% people are undergoing treatment. It is suspected that due to unlock phase, people’s movement has increased which leads to rise in the cases. However, the district health department terms the rise in cases to the rise in testing. On Friday, Gautam Budh Nagar recorded 93 positive cases while 112 patients were discharged after treatment. There was no Covid-related death on Friday and the total number of Covid positive cases stands at 971 in the district. Rakesh Chauhan, district information officer, said that the Noida’s integrated Covid – 19 call centre 18004192211 gets around 400 calls per day, where Coronavirus related issues are addressed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gautam-budh-nagar-records-an-average-104-covid-19-cases-a-day-between-aug-21-and-27/story-G7e6briIJdrTzQdHhyjBeI.html

29-08-2020||Noida||Heavy rain in Noida lead to water-logging, traffic snarls; more rain likely Monday night||Noida, Ghaziabad and their adjoining regions saw heavy rainfall on Friday leading to drop in mercury while leaving several areas waterlogged.A number of places in Noida saw water logging and heavy traffic around the afternoon hours. As the rain started in the morning hours, around 9.30am, lasting at some areas till as late as 4pm, a number of roads in areas including sectors 63, 43, 16, and Bhangel, including parts and patches of road along Vishwakarma road near sector 76, were water logged.“I had to go to my office in Sector 16. Though not all areas were waterlogged, a number of patches along the road, including the Vishwakarma road, were full of water causing traffic jams as people drove slowly. A patch of road near Sector 50 metro station is also broken and there are some potholes, due to which it’s unsafe to drive over when the road is waterlogged as you never know when your vehicle might get stuck,” said Kartik Sharma, a resident of Sector 76, Noida. “The problem is that the road towards Sector 50 on the Vishwakarma Marg is low while the drains are at a certain height. So they always get waterlogged during heavy rains. There are also some craters and potholes on the road, making it unsafe to ride along such roads,” said Ankit Mishra, a resident of Sector 77.The expressway along Delhi also experienced traffic congestion due to rains towards morning hours near Sector 15-A to a few kilometres around 11am, and lasted for a few hours.“There were a few snarls in the morning but we were prepared so they did not extend much. However, we can’t help the waterlogging. Even so, there was no requirement of making special diversions on Friday and traffic was comparatively smoother than previous heavy rain days,” said Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police, traffic, Gautam Budh Nagar.EXPECT ANOTHER SPELL NEXT WEEKAccording to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), areas around Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad received the maximum amount of rainfall on Friday that could be around 60 to 70mm. Weather analysts have said that while the region will continue to get light, patchy rains over the next few days, a similar spell of moderate to heavy rainfall is however expected towards the intervening night of August 31 and September 1. “The maximum and most intense rainfall had been reported from areas around Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida. Though the actual figures would be available only by Saturday, it seems the rainfall would have been around or above 60 to 70 mm. The mercury has dropped, however, and will stay low for a few days. A similar spell of rain is expected in the region between August 31 and September 1,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. According to the analyst, the reasons behind the deluge was favourable weather conditions that formed as a monsoon line of trough – the low-pressure line that oscillates around Delhi and causes rains as it passes over the region – met at the convergence of moist winds from Arabian sea and Bay of Bengal.“The cumulative effect of this led to heavy rains,” said Srivastava.Rainfall below 15mm is considered light, between 15 and 64.5 mm is moderate and above 64.5mm is heavy. So far, Noida has seen an average rainfall of 65mm (since June 1), which is still 85% deficit. The mercury fell Friday to a maximum of 32.8 degrees Celsius, two notches below the season’s average, against 34.2 a day earlier. The minimum temperature, meanwhile, was recorded at 26.8 degrees, against 26.2 degrees Celsius a day earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/heavy-rain-in-noida-lead-to-water-logging-traffic-snarls-more-rain-likely-monday-night/story-tdnvHFK0jBnv9Yu7IFsb9N.html

In addition, the Mahad municipal council issued orders for structural audit and subsequent repairs to 18 dilapidated building structures in the area. The audit order has been issued in the backdrop of the death of 16 persons in the building collapse incident on August 24, 2020. The Mahad police have booked five persons as accused in the case along with the developer on charges of using substandard construction material and negligence. Besides, the district administration has issued directions to all chief executive officers (CEOs) of its 15 municipal councils to take necessary action in connection with old and dilapidated buildings in their jurisdiction by way of structural audit and visual inspection. Raigad district collector Nidhi Chaudhari said, “We have ordered a structural audit and visual inspection of all the old and dilapidated buildings numbering 500 and more in the entire district. It will be done by external auditors and notices of evacuation will be sent in case there is an imminent danger of collapse.” According to Chaudhari, if there is no danger then structural audit reports of the respective buildings have to be submitted by the CEOs to the government. “Through visual inspection and safety audits, it becomes easy to go deep into the study of the building columns for safety analysis. For old and dilapidated buildings, as a practice, we do evacuation in monsoon and even demolition is carried out if there is a threat to the lives of the people,” she said. Based on the order, the Panvel Municipal Corporation (PMC) has written a letter to the town planning and City Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) to conduct an audit of all projects by Kohinoor Developers with special focus on the structural stability of the buildings. In addition, if any violations are found, the PMC will take strict and necessary action at the earliest and file a compliance report to the administration.

The body, bearing multiple stab injuries, was tied up with his Royal Enfield Bullet motorcycle.Apart from Manpreet and Baljinder, their accomplices, Kuldip Singh and Sumit Kumar, have also been arrested. Another accomplice is at large.“The accused have confessed to the murder. Baljinder is the woman’s distant cousin. Therefore, her father was against their relationship. Finding him a hurdle, they decided to kill Kulwant,” said Ludhiana Rural senior superintendent of police (SSP) Vivek Sheel Soni.After Kulwant’s body was found by his two brothers, police had initiated an investigation suspecting it to be the fallout of old rivalry. “During the probe, we found a cap on the spot, which led us to the accused,” said inspector Rajesh Thakur, SHO at Sidhwan Bet police station.On August 25, as Manpreet’s father left for the fields on his motorcycle, she called Baljinder, who intercepted her father with his accomplices and hacked him to death with sharp-edged weapons.“All accused have been booked under Sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.

29-08-2020||World||Trump calls Harris ‘not competent’ in escalating exchange of attacks||President Donald Trump is ratcheting up his attacks on Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for vice-president. He said on Friday she was “not competent” to be president.Trump has been attacking Harris, the first Indian American and Black woman ever to run for president, from the day she was picked by Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, as his running mate. The president had been far more indulgent before, saying, in July; she would be a “fine choice”.Attacking Biden at a rally in New Hampshire on Friday, Trump cross-haired Harris. “Joe Biden is running on the most extreme far-left platform of any nominee in American history. And if our foreign adversaries were devising a plan to destroy the United States from within, all they have to look is at Biden-Harris-- how bout her? Is she a beauty? What a beauty that is,” he said.Trump picked on Harris’s own failed run for the Democratic presidential nomination. “She was terrible. And this would be your president? Possibly? I don’t think so. You know, I want to see the first woman president also, but I don’t want to see a woman president get into that position the way she’d do it. And she’s not competent. She’s not competent,” he said.Harris, a former prosecutor and US senator, has not shied away from giving it back, without the kind of personal attacks and insults used by the president some times. “At its most basic level, Donald Trump doesn’t understand the presidency,” Harris said in her prebuttal to Trump’s acceptance speech at the Republican convention. She was referring to the Trump administration’s handling of the Covid-19 epidemic that has killed nearly 180,000 American and infected around 6 million. The Biden-Harris campaign has cited the president’s handling of the worst public health crisis in 100 years as its argument against him, seeking to tap into widespread disaffection among Americans with his response to the epidemic — 68% of those polled disapprove of his performance in an AP-NORC poll released Monday, the first day of the Republican convention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-calls-harris-not-competent-in-escalating-exchange-of-attacks/story-9HM3IspsBuSC08igYZtJbN.html
29-08-2020||World||Pakistani court convicts 3 LeT and JuD leaders, including Hafiz Saeed’s brother-in-law||A Pakistani court has convicted three leaders of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), including LeT founder Hafiz Saeed’s brother-in-law Abdul Rahman Makki, in a case of terror financing and given them prison terms ranging from 18 months to more than 16 years. Makki, a top JuD leader for whom the US state department has announced a reward of $2 million, Malik Zafar Iqbal and Hafiz Abdul Salam Bhuttavi were convicted by judge Ejaz Ahmad Buttar of an anti-terrorism court in Lahore on Friday. The court gave a collective prison term of 16-and-a-half years to Iqbal and Bhuttavi while Makki received a jail term of one-and-a-half years, according to reports in the Pakistani media. Iqbal and Salam were also fined Rs170,000 while Makki was directed to pay a fine of Rs 20,000. Iqbal and Bhuttavi were named in one of the two statutory regulatory orders issued by Pakistan’s foreign ministry on August 18 to enforce UN Security Council sanctions against hundreds of terrorists and 93 terror entities. Iqbal was described in the notification as a senior leader and co-founder of LeT who has held various senior positions in LeT and JUD. “As of 2010, in-charge of LeT/JUD finance department, director of its education department and president of its medical wing,” the notification said. Bhuttavi was described as a founding member of LeT and deputy to Hafiz Saeed. Makki, designated a terrorist by the US treasury department in 2010, has not yet been sanctioned by the UN. He has headed LeT’s political affairs and foreign relations departments and played a key role in raising funds for the group. The case against the three men was filed by the Counter-Terrorism Department of Pakistan’s Punjab province. They were charged under several provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997. In February, Hafiz Saeed and an aide were both given a five-and-a-half year jail term in two cases of terror financing by an anti-terrorism court in Lahore. The case against Saeed too was filed by the Counter-Terrorism Department. In the latest case, the prosecution said the three men had been using a property in Vehari district that was in the name of Al-Hamad Trust, a banned organisation, to achieve their objectives in terrorism. By using this property, the trust also raised funds for terrorism. The court ruled this property should be taken over by the state. The Counter-Terrorism Department had registered 23 FIRs against JuD leaders in different cities of Pakistan’s Punjab province. There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials to the conviction of the three men. Indian remains sceptical of action so far by Pakistan against LeT, JuD and other groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed, with officials saying such steps were being taken with an eye on an upcoming assessment of the country’s counter-terror financing regime by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-court-convicts-3-let-and-jud-leaders-including-hafiz-saeed-s-brother-in-law/story-LcZeKW6g2WaVigsPh3YOHO.html

Xi in 2015 spoke about sinicising the five major religions practised in China: Catholicism, Protestantism, Islam, Buddhism and Daoism.In 2019, Chinese state media announced that China had drawn up an outline to sinicise Islam by 2022 in an effort to redefine the practise of the religion and align the beliefs of Muslims with the CPC.China’s policies towards Tibet have come under the spotlight again this year amid Beijing’s deteriorating ties with Washington.In July, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US would restrict visas for some Chinese officials involved in blocking diplomatic access to Tibet and engaging in “human rights abuses”, adding that Washington supported “meaningful autonomy” for Tibet.In a retaliatory move, China said it would impose visa restrictions on US citizens who have engaged in what it called “egregious” behaviour over Tibet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinicise-tibetan-buddhism-build-fortress-around-tibet-says-xi-jinping/story-TwJo3hRZzX3X4ynStymgYK.html
29-08-2020||World||With the conventions now over, what’s next in campaign 2020?||President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden have emerged from their presidential nominating conventions with each candidate believing he has a head of steam. Trump’s job approval ratings and standing in polls are perilously low for an incumbent, but Biden and other Democrats vividly remember 2016, when Trump made an against-all-odds October comeback and defeated Hillary Clinton.Five key questions as the 2020 campaign moves toward the fall home stretch:WHAT WILL A COVID-19 CAMPAIGN LOOK LIKE?Expect a flurry of travel and speeches as the candidates spend the next nine weeks desperately trying to move the needle and win new votes against the backdrop of a global pandemic.Trump is set to launch an aggressive travel schedule with multiple events a week, according to advisers. After an arena rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, early this summer drew a paltry crowd, his campaign has settled on a new format in the age of the coronavirus: packing smaller crowds into open-air airport hangars. The campaign has also been handing out masks at its events and, on Friday, told attendees they would be mandatory, per local regulations. He’s also planning a series of policy speeches and is expected to continue to use the powers of his office — including signing executive orders and issuing pardons — to help his prospects.Biden is planning to ramp up travel to battleground states after Labor Day after spending most of the spring and summer at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, holding mostly virtual events, with only occasional travel to tightly controlled gatherings. Campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond said the former vice president will be active but emphasized that Biden’s events still will follow public health guidelines. That means no indoor, crowded rallies and lots of mask-wearing. Expect plenty of roundtables, meet-and-greets and question-and-answer sessions. If there are larger gatherings, the drive-in watch party outside Biden’s nomination acceptance address could be the blueprint.___WHOSE VERSION OF THE OTHER CONVINCES MORE VOTERS?Trump will continue trying to win back suburban, female and older voters, and win over independents and people who didn’t vote four years ago, by painting the election as a stark choice between law and order and anarchy and between a radical, socialist takeover and economic prosperity. Never mind that Biden has spent decades in the political establishment and California Sen. Kamala Harris, his running mate, is a former prosecutor. Trump will use every scare tactic he can muster.If his 2016 race is any indication, expect Trump to launch a scorched-earth strategy if he feels he’s losing come October. Realizing his only shot then was to drive up Clinton’s unfavorable ratings to match his own, Trump’s campaign used every trick they could think of, including inviting women who accused Bill Clinton of rape and unwanted sexual advances to appear at one of the debates.Attacks on Biden’s family? Accusations he’s drugged up or senile? There is no line Trump won’t cross to win.Biden will continue to hammer Trump as a fundamental threat to democracy and try to make the case that the president is a selfish, corrupt figure incapable of empathy. Biden will sell himself as a steady, experienced hand with a progressive policy agenda on issues including climate action and criminal justice -- just not as progressive as Trump tries to make him when he blasts Biden as the front man for a “radical” takeover.Biden’s campaign believes that he is enough of a known quantity that voters beyond Trump’s base simply won’t buy the president’s descriptions of the former vice president. If they are right, they see Trump’s base-driven campaign as one that opens up a wide coalition -- from progressives who aren’t in love with Biden to anti-Trump moderates Republicans -- for the Democratic ticket.___CORONAVIRUS AND AN OCTOBER SURPRISE?Biden has defined his White House bid from the start as a moral and competency case against Trump. The COVID-19 pandemic has only intensified the approach. Biden’s campaign believes there’s no cover for Trump with the coronavirus death toll surpassing 180,000 and climbing, cases nearing the 6 million mark, unemployment hovering in double digits and Congress at an impasse on further economic aid.In remarks Thursday before Trump’s nomination acceptance speech, Harris summarized the campaign’s thinking: “Trump’s incompetence is nothing new,” she said, “but in January of this year, it became deadly.” She said the incumbent “failed at the most basic and important job of a president ... to protect us.”Trump is hoping for a late development that could be a campaign game-changer: The release of a vaccine that would mark the beginning of the end of the pandemic on his watch, before Americans vote. His administration has been doing everything it can to accelerate the process, along with hyping new therapeutics, even when it’s not clear they work. “We’ll produce a vaccine before the end of the year, or maybe even sooner,” he said in his convention keynote. It’s unclear, however, whether science can deliver on his timetable.___HOW IMPORTANT ARE THE DEBATES?They’re crucial.The conventions largely succeeded in fulfilling both campaigns’ objectives, so the debates -- scheduled for Sept. 29, Oct. 15 and Oct. 22 -- will be the most high-profile opportunities for the candidates to highlight contrasts, animate core supporters and cajole the small but critical slice of persuadable voters.Biden and his team say they relish the idea of confronting Trump face to face. “The debates will give the V.P. the chance to call Trump on all of his B.S.,” Richmond said.It also will be another chance for the 77-year-old Democrat to work to dismantle Trump’s framing that Biden is too old for the job. Richmond said that narrative could backfire on Trump, himself a 74-year-old who regularly mangles syntax and offers meandering answers.Some in Trump’s camp seem to agree. After months of trying to cast Biden as feeble and mentally diminished, they’re now talking up Biden’s abilities as a way to try to lower expectations on Trump’s side.“Joe Biden is really good at debates,” Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller has been saying, portraying Biden as much more skilled than Hillary Clinton.___HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO HAVE A WINNER?It might not be on election night.The campaigns and national parties are engaged in lawsuits across many states, arguing over rules for absentee voting amid the pandemic, and that litigation could continue if results are close on Nov. 3.Republicans and Democrats alike are pushing their supporters to ask for absentee mail ballots, even as Trump continues to question the integrity of the election before a single vote is cast.Don’t expect that landscape to change between now and Election Day -- or even for several weeks afterward. Trump has refused to say whether he’ll accept the results if he loses, and Clinton has warned Biden not to concede if the election is remotely close.One thing is clear, though: The Constitution sets Inauguration Day as Jan. 20, and barring catastrophic developments, either Trump or Biden will take the oath of office that day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-the-conventions-now-over-what-s-next-in-campaign-2020/story-vay5pY2PMZdh6fMNM8zrEK.html
29-08-2020||World||UN expresses concern over ‘dramatic turn’ in Libya crisis||The United Nations on Saturday voiced alarm over what it called “a dramatic turn of events” in Libya’s civil war, after a power struggle between leaders of the Tripoli-based government surfaced in the wake of anti-corruption protests.“Libya is witnessing a dramatic turn of events that underlines the urgent need to return to a full and inclusive political process,” the UN support mission in Libya said.Protests over deteriorating economic conditions erupted earlier this week in the capital and elsewhere in western Libya, which is controlled by forces loyal to the UN-supported government.In Tripoli, local militia allied with the government opened fire on the demonstrators using rifles and truck-mounted guns, and abducted some of the protesters.Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj and his interior minister, Fathi Bashaga, initially accused “outlawed infiltrators” over the violence. The prime minister also said the protesters “did not obtain necessary permits” for their rally and described their demonstrations as “riots.”However on Friday, Sarraj suspended Bashaga and referred him to an administrative investigation after the interior minister accused a government-allied militia of attacking the peaceful protesters in Tripoli this week.Bashaga, who was excluded from two high-profile military and security meetings in the capital over the past few days, quickly responded. He said in a statement he accepted the premier’s decision but demanded a public and live questioning “to expose the facts” of the incident.The UN mission in Libya said it was still concerned about “the excessive use of force against demonstrators as well as the arbitrary arrest of a number of civilians.” It did not say how many people were detained.Over the past two days, militias sealed off main streets and roads to prevent the demonstrators from reaching Tripoli’s Martyrs Square, the epicenter of the protests, according to two residents who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear reprisals.A group of women however protested in the city center before being dispersed. Two women were wounded and four others were arrested, according to the protest movement, known as “Hirak August 23.”The movement called for civil disobedience until achieving their demands that include handing over power to the Supreme Judicial Council to work towards presidential and parliamentary elections.Protests also spread to the southern town of Sabah and the eastern town of Quba, both under the control of rival east-based Libyan forces led by Khalifa Hifter.The UN also said it is concerned about “on-going human rights violations and abuses” in the coastal city of Sirte, which is controlled by Hifter’s forces since January. It said at least one civilian was killed and several others were arrested.“The prolific use of hate speech and incitement to violence appears designed to further divide Libyans, increase polarization and tear at the country’s social fabric,” the UN mission said.Oil-rich Libya was plunged into chaos when a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was later killed. The country is now split between rival east- and west-based administrations, each backed by different armed groups and foreign governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-expresses-concern-over-dramatic-turn-in-libya-crisis/story-nU11ITBd0qagKlnJSySCoL.html

At a virtual fundraiser on Friday, she was asked how a Biden-Harris administration would restore the “trust and support of our European and Asian allies.” In response, Harris slammed President Donald Trump and pledged to “rejoin” the Paris agreement on Climate Change and “strengthen and re-enter” the Iran nuclear deal.“Joe Biden and our administration is gonna have a massive job to repair the damage done by Donald Trump and his administration, and to restore our place in the world,” she said.In 2017, Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris deal, saying the accord would have cost America trillions of dollars, killed jobs, and hindered the oil, gas, coal and manufacturing industries.Also read| Ivanka would be better candidate, Kamala Harris ‘not competent’ to be US President: TrumpIn 2018, Trump pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.“Part of our strength when, when we as a country, historically, walk into that room around the globe. Part of the strength of our standing it’s not just about our military it’s not just about our economic strength. It’s about the fact that folks believe that when we say something we mean it,” the Senator from California said.“We are loyal to our friends that we keep our word, including when we make commitments, be it to NATO or to the Paris agreement that we will follow through. And Donald Trump, he just doesn’t get it. I mean it’s such an extension of his character as a human being I believe that he doesn’t understand the importance of integrity and consistency in one’s word,” Harris said.In her remarks, Harris touted Biden’s role in the auto industry bailouts. “What gives me great hope is what we have seen again and again that the American people, when given the opportunity can rise to any challenge,” she said.“In 2009, when the global economy was on the verge of collapse, President Obama turned to Joe Biden to fortify the American auto industry and help the people of Michigan to do what you do best, drive our nation’s economy forward. And I don’t need to tell any of the leaders on this call. We’re in a crisis again. And thankfully Joe is back,” she said.Also read: Donald Trump’s administration allows deferral of Social Security tax“Joe, of course championed the Obama-Biden rescue of the American auto industry, along with the people of Michigan, and supported the resurgence of the great city of Detroit,” she said and alleged that under the Trump administration, American manufacturing is in recession.“Together, Joe and I will rebuild the middle class and ensure that this time everyone comes along.

29-08-2020||World||Ivanka would be better candidate, Kamala Harris ‘not competent’ to be US President: Donald Trump||Kamala Harris is “not competent” to be president, US President Donald Trump has said as he launched an attack on the Indian-origin senator’s credentials for the top post. Addressing his supporters at a Republican campaign rally in New Hampshire on Friday, Trump said he would support seeing a female president in the US but suggested that his daughter and senior White House adviser Ivanka Trump would be a better candidate for such a role. Harris, 55, was a presidential aspirant until last year before she dropped out of the race because of lack of popular support. Harris returned to political limelight after Joe Biden, the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate, picked her as his running mate in the November 3 election. Born to a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, Harris is the first Indian-American and first Black woman to be picked by a major American political party for the top post. “You know I want to see the first woman president also, but I don’t want to see a woman president get into that position the way she’d do it, and she’s not competent,” Trump said. “She’s not competent,” he said amidst applause from his supporters, a few of whom screamed Ivanka Trump, at an election rally on Friday. “They’re all saying, ‘we want Ivanka’. I don’t blame you,” he said responding to his supporters. This was Trump’s first election rally after he formally accepted the nomination of the Republican Party on Thursday for the presidential election. Trump said Harris withdrew from the Democratic Party’s presidential race before primary season kicked off as her popularity dropped down to single digit. “How about her? Sheer beauty? What a beauty though. They pick a woman who starts off...She (Harris) starts off (her presidential campaign) sort of strong. She’s one of the favourites. Within a period of a few months, she goes down, down 15, 12, 11, nine, eight, five, three, two,” he said, underlining the popularity downslide of Harris in the few months after her highly impressive campaign launch.“Then she goes, I’m going to leave because I’ve decided that I want to leave. I want to leave. She left (the race of presidency) because she wouldn’t have gotten any votes. She was terrible. And this would be your president possibly. I don’t think so. I don’t think so,” Trump said, speculating on the possibility that Harris could emerge as a Democratic presidential candidate in 2024. Attacking Biden, Trump said he is running on the most extreme, far left platform of any nominee in American history.“And of our foreign adversaries who are devising a plan to destroy the United States from within all they have to look, is that the Biden-Harris (ticket),” he said. Hours before Trump delivered his acceptance speech from the South Lawn at the White House, Harris alleged that the president’s policies have been “a reckless disregard” for the danger a pandemic would pose to American lives. She said Trump has “failed at the most basic and important job of a President of the United States. He failed to protect the American people”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ivanka-would-be-better-candidate-kamala-harris-not-competent-to-be-us-president-trump/story-hVhI3NP0oFOTKo5efbmvOL.html
29-08-2020||World||Health experts decry Donald Trump’s shunning of coronavirus rules||Public health experts expressed concern Friday about President Donald Trump’s largely mask-free, socially un-distanced Republican convention event on the White House lawn, saying some of his 1,500 guests may have inadvertently brought and spread the coronavirus to others.“There almost certainly were individuals there who were infected with Covid-19 but don’t know it,” said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University.Also read: Donald Trump’s administration allows deferral of Social Security tax“I worry about these individuals infecting one another and most certainly going back to their home,” said Wen, who previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.Trump delivered his speech accepting the GOP presidential nomination at the Thursday night event, which continued a pattern of flouting coronavirus safety guidelines.Few in the audience wore masks when virtually all leading public health professionals, including the administration’s, say face coverings play a big part in slowing virus transmission.Chairs were placed inches apart instead of the recommended 6 feet, leaving attendees little room to practice social distancing.Only those guests the White House expected to be in “close proximity” to Trump and Vice President Mike Pence were to be tested for Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.Also read: Donald Trump says India 2nd largest country to conduct Covid-19 tests after USThough public health officials have said outdoors is safer than indoors, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also puts the risk of Covid-19 spreading at its highest at large outdoor events and in-person gatherings where people cannot stay 6 feet apart and attendees come from out of town.Trump’s campaign issued a statement from Dr. Robert Darling, chief medical officer of Patronus Medical Corp., who said the Republican National Committee’s protocols are in “full compliance” with multiple guidelines issued by the CDC, the District of Columbia health department and other leading health authorities. He provided no details.The campaign said Darling, a former White House physician to President Bill Clinton, has been working with the RNC to make sure the proper protocols are in place at convention sites.In Charlotte, North Carolina, where delegates met Monday to nominate Trump for reelection, the city required a process to be put in place to trace people’s contacts in the event of an outbreak, including requiring attendees to wear trackers on their lanyards.Masks and social distancing requirements were also in place, and attendees were required to complete a daily temperature screening and wellness questionnaire. They were tested before departing for Charlotte and retested upon arrival.Out of nearly 800 coronavirus tests administered, two attendees and two people supporting the Charlotte event tested positive after they arrived, the county health department said. The four individuals were instructed to isolate, and any known close contacts were notified and given instructions on quarantining, the department said.Public health officials also expressed concern over a march in Washington on Friday to commemorate the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The size of the event had been scaled back because of coronavirus concerns.Participants underwent temperature checks as part of coronavirus protocols. Organizers also reminded the marchers to practice social distancing and wear masks, though many were bare-faced and packed together.Before a Trump rally Friday night in New Hampshire, a campaign advisory said masks for attendees were “required” in accordance with Republican Gov. Chris Sununu’s executive orders, and would be provided.Before Trump arrived, many in the crowd did not put their masks back on after singing the national anthem. They later booed when a campaign staffer called on them to do so.Also read: ‘He doesn’t understand presidency’: Biden, Harris hit back at TrumpWen, the former Baltimore health official, said the White House event gives the public the false impression that precautions are no longer necessary.“We, in public health, have been trying to share, to put out guidance on what to do, and when we have the president of the country and top leaders doing exactly what we are asking people not to do, how can we be seen as credible?” she asked.On Friday, North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said he “fell short of my own standard” and apologized for not keeping his face mask on at the White House.Tillis, who is in a tough reelection bid against Democrat Cal Cunningham, has been consistent about talking up face coverings as a key method to slow the spread of Covid-19.Tillis’ campaign tweeted a picture of the first-term senator wearing a mask on the White House lawn on Thursday before Trump’s speech. But other media outlets later showed images of the crowd during the speech and Tillis was seen not wearing his mask.“I thought it was very hard not to recoil at those images,” said Dr. Howard Koh, a public health professor at Harvard and a former assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services under President Barack Obama.Koh said one mitigating factor was that Trump held the event outdoors.He said wearing facial coverings during outbreaks is expected behavior in some Asian societies and social distancing, wearing masks and avoiding large crowds are new social norms that can save lives in the United States as well.Koh said the same guidance applies to protests, but that moving around during demonstrations might help curb the spread of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/health-experts-decry-donald-trump-s-shunning-of-coronavirus-rules/story-xvKKYhXZ6vZPu4TaAUoO6M.html

29-08-2020||World||Trump knocks protesters against racial injustice during New Hampshire rally||Fresh from accepting the Republican nomination, US President Donald Trump had harsh words for anti-racism protesters on Friday during a campaign stop in the politically important state of New Hampshire.Addressing a crowd in an airport hangar, Trump called the demonstrators who sought to disrupt his White House speech on Thursday night “thugs” and said Senator Rand Paul could have died when he was swarmed by protesters afterwards.Paul said on Friday he was attacked by an “angry mob” of more than 100 people near the White House and had to be rescued by the police.“He’d either be in very bad shape, or dead, and that would include his wife, if those policemen didn’t happen to be there,” Trump said of the Republican senator.The president has emphasized a “law and order” theme to motivate his political base and attract more voters as he trails former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, in national polls ahead of the Nov. 3 election.Also read| ‘He doesn’t understand presidency’: Biden, Harris hit back at Trump“You know what I say? Protesters, your ass. I don’t talk about my ass,” he said. “They’re not protesters. Those aren’t protesters. Those are anarchists, they’re agitators, they’re rioters, they’re looters.”Trump has been criticized for not showing empathy in the wake of shootings and killings of Black men by police, including George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis in May, sparking anti-racism demonstrations worldwide.New protests erupted in Kenosha, Wisconsin, this week after police officers shot Jacob Blake, another African-American man, multiple times in front of his children. He survived. Thousands of people took part in a march in Washington on Friday to denounce racism.Trump has not commented extensively about Blake, but he spoke extensively about protesters on Friday without specifying which demonstration he was talking about.“They’re just looking for trouble. This has nothing to do with George Floyd, has nothing to do with anything. They don’t even know who George Floyd is,” he said.Also read: ‘He acted in self-defense’, says Kenosha protest gunman’s attorneyBiden and his running mate, vice presidential nominee Senator Kamala Harris, said Trump was making America less safe with his rhetoric and his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.“The President incites violence, inspires white-supremacist shooters, and his failed Covid response is costing thousands of lives per day. When you look at the world right now, ask yourself: Do you feel safe in Trump’s America?” Biden tweeted.“He (Trump) has been obsessed, I think, with spreading fear and using division to protect his own ego, and more fundamentally to erode the foundations of the democracy that he swore to defend,” Harris said at a fundraiser on Friday.CLOSE NEW HAMPSHIRE RACETrump, whose speech to the Republican National Convention was low key compared to his rally appearances, seemed to find his footing in New Hampshire, a state he lost narrowly to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 and where he is trailing Biden this year.He went over some of his favourite themes, including his insistence that Mexico would pay for a wall along the US border and that Democrats would try to slash funding for law enforcement.Biden has rejected calls from the left to “defund” the police, but Trump has erroneously suggested that is a policy Biden would embrace.Trump, who has criticized Biden for campaigning mostly from his Delaware home because of the pandemic, intends to travel extensively in the coming months to boost his momentum.He has not been able to hold his signature large rallies for most of the virus outbreak. A June rally at an indoor arena in Tulsa, Oklahoma, attracted a crowd that was well below capacity. The area experienced an uptick in coronavirus cases for weeks after the event.Trump had to cancel a July rally in New Hampshire over concerns about a tropical storm off the East Coast.Biden expects his in-person campaign travel to pick up after Labor Day on Sept. 7, telling lawyers at an online fundraising event on Thursday he was considering traveling to battleground states including Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Arizona.“We’re going to get out and meet people where it matters, not at irresponsible rallies or staged for TV to boost egos, but real people’s communities, in real local businesses, in their lives,” Biden said. “I’m going to keep everyone safe.”Some 21.6 million Americans watched Trump’s keynote speech on Thursday night, according to preliminary ratings data on Friday that suggested a lower TV audience for Trump than Biden. Trump, a former reality television star, cares deeply about ratings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-knocks-protesters-against-racial-injustice-during-new-hampshire-rally/story-DyqoIdxkzX3qT6jbO1dv9I.html
29-08-2020||World||Why California’s wildfire year could be the worst in decades||California may experience its worst year for wildfires in decades, climate experts say, pointing out that it has already battled two of the three largest blazes in its recorded history during an intense heatwave this month - even before the peak season begins.Record temperatures have exacerbated the state’s ongoing drought and triggered dry-lightning that started more than 700 fires, some in redwood rainforests and Joshua trees that do not normally burn.Firefighters had a grip on the three largest blazes on Friday in the San Francisco Bay Area but warned residents to prepare for fall winds that typically drive the state’s largest fires.With more than 1.6 million acres blackened this year, climatologist Zach Zobel said California was on track to overtake the nearly 2 million acres burned in 2018, when the state suffered its deadliest wildfire and the most acreage burned in records going back to at least 1987.“I would be very surprised if we didn’t overtake that given the conditions in place,” said Zobel an atmospheric scientist who tracks extreme weather for the Woodwell Climate Research Center. What worries climatologists is not so much the size of California’s wildfires, which have long rejuvenated forests and chaparral, but their ferocity.“It’s Mother Nature injected with steroids” Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said of events like the 14,000 lightning strikes to hit California since Aug. 15 due to what he believes is human impact on climate.CLIMATE AND COLONIALISMHigher temperatures in Northern California have created drier-than-normal vegetation and above-normal risk of rapid, extreme fires once offshore “diablo” winds begin mid September, the National Interagency Fire Center reported.In the North Bay wine country, extreme wet and dry cycles allowed vegetation to grow back after 2017 fires and dry out enough to burn again this month rather than act as a natural fire break, according to firefighters.“There’s definitely a climate change signal here, the weather temperatures are drying out the fuels,” said Tim Brown, a professor at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, Nevada.Human factors are also to blame.A century of fire suppression to protect timber resources caused build up of the kind of fuel Native Americans long burned to rejuvenate forests, according to professor Dustin Mulvaney. Clear-cutting and regrowth created crowded, unhealthy forests with a lack of older trees that can survive fire, he said.“That’s not related to climate, that’s about colonialism and kicking people off the land that managed that grove for 10,000 years before,” said Mulvaney, a professor of environmental studies at San Jose State University. Species such as redwoods, which may have experienced fires four or five times over a 1,000-year life, may not withstand more intense blazes or recover during drought conditions, he said.Extreme fires also burn more homes and infrastructure. A blaze in the redwoods of the Santa Cruz mountains destroyed nearly 800 structures as of Friday and may jeopardize reservoir water sources for the city of Santa Cruz.Communities in Napa and Solano counties hit by 2017 fires have suffered the state’s second-largest blaze in history that destroyed 1,080 homes as of Friday, making it the tenth-most destructive on record.“People who lost their houses last time are suddenly faced with losing them again after they rebuilt,” said Sandy Chute, 76, a retiree as she evacuated her two horses to the Sonoma County Fairgrounds in Santa Rosa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-california-s-wildfire-year-could-be-the-worst-in-decades/story-zgJsNZTnZSFasOXR4wE82H.html
29-08-2020||World||Louisiana avoided Laura’s ‘wall of water’? Not so, says forecaster||The 20-foot high “unsurvivable” wall of water Hurricane Laura was forecast to send onto the Louisiana coast showed up despite widespread reports of a lower peak, authorities said on Friday, rejecting criticism that they had raised too much alarm.The highest surge hit about 15 miles east of where Laura was forecast to make landfall but it “wobbled” at the last moment. That slight change likely saved the city of Lake Charles, said Jamie Rhome, head of the storm surge team at the National Hurricane Center (NHC).Most US media played up a nine-foot surge recorded by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration observation station near Cameron, Louisiana, and the NHC was criticized for perhaps raising too much alarm.There is just one problem, Rhome said. “It’s wrong. That reporting is based off a single observation station in Cameron Parish that didn’t come close to measuring the peak storm surge which occurred at 10 or 15 miles east of there,” he said.Fresh data on Friday from an Army Corps of Engineer gauge 15 miles east indicates that the storm surge was right at the 15- to 20-feet forecast that was Rhome’s highest in his 20-year career, he said.An exact reading would soon be released after the data and gauge are fully analyzed, Rhome said.“We’re finding out the storm surge was really 15 to 20 feet,” Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards confirmed to reporters on Friday after flying over the hardest-hit areas.Rhome said it would be unfair to accuse NHC forecasters - who warned of an “unsurvivable storm surge” the day before Laura made landfall - or local and state leaders for raising alarm about storm surges. A decade ago, 50% of deaths from hurricanes were because of storm surges, he noted.Today, that figure is closer to 4%, Rhome said, largely because the NHC started including storm surge warnings in its bulletins following the devastation brought by Hurricane Ike and its 15-foot storm surge in 2008.TRUMP TO VISITThe remnants of Hurricane Laura doused Arkansas on Friday before forecasters said it would head to the East Coast, bringing heavy rains and possible flash floods.The storm killed at least 10 people in Louisiana, including four who were killed when trees fell into homes, damaged buildings in Louisiana and Texas and knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents.US President Donald Trump is expected to head to the Gulf Coast over the weekend to survey the damage.The storm was forecast to drop heavy rain over Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Missouri and Kentucky as it headed out to the East Coast, the National Weather Service said.At its peak upon making landfall on Thursday morning, Laura had maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (241 km per hour), faster than even Hurricane Katrina, which sparked deadly levee breaches in New Orleans in 2005 after arriving with wind speeds of 125 mph.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/louisiana-avoided-laura-s-wall-of-water-not-so-says-forecaster/story-3UBt8LAgkxK2zGCVGMtLFJ.html

The lawsuit went to allege that commission staff should have unlocked the building’s doors at 4:30 to accommodate late-arriving filers.The commission’s building has been locked since the coronavirus pandemic took hold; West’s campaign workers had to call the commission shortly before 5 p.m. to get them to unlock the doors.Commission spokesman Reid Magney declined comment.West announced a presidential bid in July, saying he’s seeking the nation’s highest office on a ticket he calls the “Birthday Party.”Democrats claim Republicans are pushing West’s candidacy in swing states to siphon Black votes from Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kanye-west-sues-to-get-on-wisconsin-presidential-ballot-in-november/story-LeglOtbC1dGJ2sphAtx66N.html
29-08-2020||World||‘He acted in self-defense’, says Kenosha protest gunman’s attorney||A high-profile lawyer representing the 17-year-old shooter charged with killing two protesters and wounding another during demonstrations on the streets of Kenosha, Wisconsin said on Friday that his client had acted in self-defense.Atlanta-based attorney Lin Wood said video footage of the altercation would vindicate Kyle Rittenhouse despite what he described as misinformation being spread by the media.“Kyle Rittenhouse acted in self-defense. Murder charges are factually unsupportable. An egregious miscarriage of justice is occurring with respect to this 17-year old boy,” Wood said on Twitter.Rittenhouse, who prosecutors say traveled 30 miles to Kenosha from his home in Antioch, Illinois before the shooting at about 11:45 p.m. on Tuesday, is charged with six criminal counts, including homicide and attempted homicide.The criminal complaint accuses Rittenhouse of firing an assault-style rifle at three protesters who tried to subdue him, killing 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, 26.It references several videos recorded by witnesses, including one in which Rittenhouse is seen calling a friend from the scene and telling them: “I just killed somebody.” A Lake County, Illinois county judge on Friday postponed his extradition to Wisconsin while the teenaged defendant arranged a private legal team. Rittenhouse, a former YMCA lifeguard who is being held without bond, did not appear at the livestreamed hearing.SUMMER OF PROTESTSThe shooting of Blake in front of three of his children has turned Kenosha, a predominantly white city of about 100,000 people on Lake Michigan, into the latest flashpoint in ongoing nationwide protests over police brutality and racism.It also galvanized protesters who gathered in Washington on Friday to commemorate the 1963 march where Martin Luther King Jr made his historic “I Have a Dream” speech.The summer of protests ignited after video footage showed a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on the neck of a Black man, George Floyd. Floyd later died and the since-fired officer has been charged with murder.Blake, who was left paralyzed by the shooting, had been handcuffed to a hospital bed because of an outstanding arrest warrant. The handcuffs were removed on Friday and officers guarding Blake stood down after the warrant was vacated, his attorney, Pat Cafferty, told Reuters.The warrant was based on a criminal complaint filed against Blake in July by his ex-girlfriend, the mother of three of his children, that was released to Reuters on Friday. In the complaint, the woman told police Blake broke into her home on May 3 and sexually assaulted her before stealing her truck and debit card.Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said earlier this week that police had been seeking Blake in connection with his former girlfriend’s complaint at the time of the shooting and that investigators recovered a knife from the floor of the car that Blake was leaning into when he was shot.Blake’s lead attorney, Ben Crump, has said his client had no knife in his possession and did not provoke or threaten police.‘WE LOVE KENOSHA’In Kenosha, volunteers helped business owners clean up after days of rioting and arson that followed the shooting in the back of a Black man, 29-year-old Jacob Blake, by a white police officer, some painting “Black Lives Matter” or “We Love Kenosha” on boarded up storefronts.“I’m angry,” said factory worker John Hall, as he helped paint messages on a storefront. “Some people who did this don’t even live here. This is the only stores that we have.” Hall, a father of three who moved to Kenosha from Chicago eight years ago to raise his children in a safer community, said the painted messages were meant to signal hope, adding: “Slowly but surely we will get this back and rebuild.” More than 1,000 National Guard members were on the ground in Kenosha on Friday in case of further violence, Major General Paul Knapp told a news conference. Demonstrators have demanded that criminal charges be filed against three police officers involved in Blake’s arrest and shooting. Authorities say officer Rusten Sheskey fired all seven shots at Blake’s back. Sheskey has been placed on leave.The Wisconsin Justice Department, which is handling the investigation, said on Friday that Sheskey and another officer, Vincent Arenas, attempted to stop Blake with Tasers before Sheskey discharged his gun. It was the first time the identity of Arenas, a Kenosha police officer since February 2019, was disclosed. The department identified the third officer as Brittany Meronek, who joined the force last January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/he-acted-in-self-defense-says-kenosha-protest-gunman-s-attorney/story-1TPCB003FbROCH0S1WfiCI.html
29-08-2020||World||House panel to hold Pompeo in contempt over Ukraine documents||The House Foreign Affairs Committee plans to hold Secretary of State Michael Pompeo in contempt for refusing to comply with subpoena requests related to the Trump administration’s policy toward Ukraine, the central event in the president’s impeachment this year.Eliot Engel, the committee’s Democratic chairman, said Friday that Pompeo failed to comply with a September 2019 subpoena seeking documents related to the Trump administration’s efforts to withhold security assistance to Ukraine in order to extract damaging information about Democrat Joe Biden.Pompeo “has demonstrated alarming disregard for the laws and rules governing his own conduct and for the tools the Constitution provides to prevent government corruption,” Engel said in a statement.Engel issued a second subpoena in July, demanding records dealing with the Biden, his son Hunter, and Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings that Pompeo separately gave to the Republican-controlled Senate.“I gave Mr. Pompeo ample opportunity to fulfill my request for documents, which I first made more than three months ago,” Engel said. “These documents were already produced to the Senate, and his refusal to provide them to the Foreign Affairs Committee required that I issue a subpoena on July 31.”An Aug. 27 letter to Engel from Ryan Kaldahl, acting assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Legislative Affairs, says State “categorically rejects your baseless assertion that the Department may have acted inappropriately or violated any law by producing documents to two Senate Committees, in your words, in ‘what appears to be partisan misuse of resources.’ We welcome the opportunity to share the facts on this matter.”Kaldahl, a former aide to President Donald Trump, said State furnished records to the Senate as part of an investigation into undue influence on Ukraine policies during the Obama administration. He said the department will give those same documents to the House Foreign Affairs Committee if the panel conducts a similar probe.“If you can confirm by letter that the Committee is, in fact, substantively investigating identical or very similar corruption issues involving Ukraine and corrupt influence related to U.S. foreign policy, the Department is ready to commence production of documents responsive to such a request,” Kaldahl said.Engel rejected that demand, saying it would amount to agreeing to probe a “conspiracy theory” meant to do little more than “smear” Trump’s competitor, months before the Nov. 3 election.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/house-panel-to-hold-pompeo-in-contempt-over-ukraine-documents/story-NtsZ5ZHY2uTMTycmJAe2xH.html

Three weeks after talks on Capitol Hill broke down without a deal on legislation to help Americans suffering from the coronavirus pandemic, Meadows said the Republican president was “right now willing to sign something at $1.3 trillion.”Hours later, Pelosi in a statement repeated her call for a $2.2 trillion bill and said Meadows’ offer would not meet the needs of American workers and families.Pelosi said, among other things, the Republicans “are rejecting the funding needed for testing and tracing to crush the virus and safely reopen schools and the economy.”She said she hoped the Republicans would accept the Democratic offer and resume negotiations.Asked about talks between Pelosi and Meadows about another stimulus package, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on a flight to Washington from New Hampshire: “My impression is she wants to give no stimulus, all she wants is bailout for badly run Democrat states.”Also read: US Postal Service suspends USPS change until after 2020 electionHe said another stimulus package would be good.

He also reiterated that the MPs will have to ensure not only the victory of the BJP candidates but of those of the allies as well. According to party functionaries aware of the details, September has been designated as the month for outreach and MPs have been instructed to visit at least two panchayats everyday and organise meetings in small groups to avoid violating the protocol for social distancing to stem the possible spread of the Covid-19 virus. The Panchayats that the MPs have to visit are those which do not fall in their own constituencies. “All leaders including the MPs will have to hold meetings at the Shakti Kendra level (a cluster of booths) apart from holding at least one virtual rally every day,” said a person privy to the meeting. “Each MP will have to cover at least 60 panchayats through September. All senior leaders, including state cabinet ministers have been asked to convey the achievements of the NDA government in the state and at the Centre. They will also have to reach out to prominent people across sections for canvassing purposes,” said a second person aware of the details. MPs have also been instructed to ensure that they are present in their constituencies on four days, September 17 for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday, September 25 for Deen Dayal Upadhayay’s birth anniversary and October 2, for Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary and ensure there is participation from the party cadre as well. Nadda has already held two rounds of meetings with Central ministers from the state and with the state cabinet ministers to chalk out the electioneering plan and work on the poll planks that will be pivoted around the achievements of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and the Nitish Kumar government at the state level. Though the Election Commission, mandated to decide the schedule of the general elections and the assembly elections, is yet to announce a date for the Bihar assembly polls, it is likely that the election will be held in October–November. The term of the current assembly expires on November 26. The election comes in the midst of a global pandemic and at a time when the state is also reeling under floods. The BJP has also refuted rumours of differences between allies; after LJP president Chirag Paswan attacked JDU leader and CM Nitish Kumar for failing to deliver on the promises made to the people of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-chief-nadda-preps-for-bihar-assembly-polls-asks-mps-to-reach-out-to-voters/story-FvwAM45jrYgtA6TAmszvJP.html

29-08-2020||India||Defence ministry sets up panel for better functioning of service headquarters||Defence minister Rajnath Singh has approved the setting up of a three-man committee to identify posts in the service headquarters that are currently held by civilian officers but need to be manned by military officers with necessary domain expertise for effective functioning, people familiar with the developments said on Saturday. The new committee has been constituted as a follow-up to the recommendations made by the Lieutenant General DB Shekatkar committee in its report on enhancing the military’s combat potential and rebalancing defence expenditure. A key recommendation in that comprehensive report dealt with aspects related to the effective utilisation of the armed forces headquarters civil service (AFHQ-CS). Shekatkar will chair the new three-man panel consisting of R Chandrashekhar who retired from the AFHQ-CS and AN Das who is from the defence ministry’s finance wing. While identifying posts that need to be manned by military officers due to their expertise is a key task assigned to the panel, it will also conduct a study and identify appointments in service headquarters that may fall within the domain of AFHQ-CS officers due to their longer tenures and expertise, according to the terms of reference in the government order reviewed by Hindustan Times. Shekatkar told HT that the setting up of the panel was a step in the right direction as it would improve the overall functioning of the service headquarters and inter-services organisations. He said the committee was likely to submit its report in November. Military and civilian officers hold posts in different wings of the service headquarters and inter-services organisations including administration, finance, policy formulation and coordination, personnel management, training, vigilance and legal matters.The Shekatkar panel made 188 suggestions in its report submitted in December 2016 of which around 100 have been accepted by the ministry and others are under consideration. The defence ministry is working towards implementing more recommendations made by the panel. In May, the ministry announced that more than 9,300 posts in the Military Engineer Services (MES) would be abolished as a follow-up to the recommendations made by the Shekatkar committee. The MES is a construction and maintenance agency of the armed forces and has an annual budget of around Rs 13,000 crore. The ministry said the recommendation to cut the posts (9,304 out of total 13,157 vacancies) was aimed at making the MES an effective organisation, with a leaner workforce well equipped to handle complex issues in an efficient and cost-effective manner. The recommendations made by the Shekatkar committee relate to several organisations including the MES, Defence Research and Development Organisation, Directorate General of Quality Assurance, Directorate General of Defence Estates, the Ordnance Factory Board and defence accounts.The panel’s recommendations also covered optimisation of signals establishments, restructuring of the army’s base workshops, revamp of ordnance depots, better utilisation of supply and transport units, closure of military farms and army postal establishments in peace locations and improving the efficiency of the National Cadet Corps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-ministry-sets-up-panel-for-better-functioning-of-service-headquarters/story-170p2AdsGJErLzKGba4lKI.html

The MP from Uttar Pradesh had come to Giridih, over 200 km from Ranchi, to take part in a programme from Unnao via Dhanbad. Maharaj, who was returning to Dhanbad by road to take a train to Delhi, was intercepted by the district administration near Pirtand police station and sent on quarantine at Shanti Bhawan ashram, where he had gone to take part in a programme, Deputy Commissioner Rahul Kumar Sinha said. The action been taken in accordance with a state government order of 14 days quarantine for people coming from outside to the state, the DC said. “He had not informed the state government about his visit and therefore we have put him in quarantine for 14 days,” Sinha said. The DC, however. said if he wanted he can apply for the exemption. On getting information about visit and return of the Uttar Pradesh politician without advance information, the administration sealed borders of the district and put barricades. A team headed by Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Prerna Dixit which was following him stopped the MP at a barricade under Pirtand police station and sent him on 14 days quarantine at Shanti Bhawan, the DC said. Maharaj told reporters that he had come to see his ailing mother in Giridih after giving prior information. He, however, said had he been told about the mandatory 14-day quarantine condition for visiting Jharkhand, he would not have come. The BJP MP talked to Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary from the place he was intercepted in the presence of media and also put the DC over phone to the chief secretary. But, it did not help him and he was taken by the police to Shanti Bhawan for putting him in home quarantine. He took exception to th adminstration “forcibly” putting him in quarantine, saying “I am Member of Parliament and Jharkhand is part of India. Can’t I meet my ailing mother? “I have to take part in a meeting of the standing committee of Parliament on Sunday and I have been forcibly quarantined here...its really disgusting,” he said. He said, RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s son Tej Pratap Yadav had on Wednesday visited Ranchi to meet his father in RIMS and returned to Patna by road, but the administration did not take any similar action. “This appears to be inspired by political jealously,” he alleged. Jharkhand has a coalition government of JMM, Congress and the RJD headed by Hemant Soren.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mp-sakshi-maharaj-violates-covid-19-norms-put-in-14-day-home-quarantine/story-PYh7IGNpVnwyFPTnoSwUiP.html
29-08-2020||India||Congress writes to Zuckerberg on probe details, alleges nexus between WhatsApp and BJP||The Congress on Saturday reiterated its demand for a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe into the alleged links of Facebook employees and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and once again wrote to the global social media giant’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg asking him to specify the steps being taken to investigate the charges against its India unit. The opposition party also threatened to pursue legislative and judicial actions to ensure that a foreign company does not create social disharmony in India. This is for the second time in a month that Congress general secretary in-charge of organisation KC Venugopal has written to Zuckerberg on the allegations of Facebook being biased towards the ruling party. ALSO READ | Launch criminal enquiry into BJP-Facebook nexus, says CPI(M)Venugopal’s letter to Zuckerberg came in the wake of an article in Time magazine, which Congress said “revealed more information and evidence of biases and a quid pro quo relationship” of Facebook India with the BJP. A report in the Wall Street Journal earlier this month had mentioned similar allegations, which were strongly rejected by both Facebook and the BJP. Tagging the Time magazine report, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi tweeted that it exposes the “WhatsApp-BJP nexus”. WhatsApp is also owned by Facebook. ALSO READ | Report on Facebook’s leniency to BJP members’ communal posts causes row“Used by 40 Cr Indians, WhatsApp also wants to be used for making payments for which Modi Government’s approval is needed. Thus, BJP has a hold over WhatsApp,” he alleged. In his letter, Venugopal, referred to his earlier letter dated August 17, in which the party had requested the US-based company to investigate the allegations made in the Wall Street Journal article that the social media platform refused to apply hate speech rules to certain BJP politicians. “We draw your attention to the article in Time magazine dated August 27 that reveals more information and evidence of biases and a quid-pro-quo relationship of Facebook India with the ruling BJP,” he wrote in the fresh letter. “We will also be pursuing legislative and judicial actions in India to ensure that a foreign company cannot continue to cause social disharmony in our nation for their pursuit of private profits,” Venugopal warned. At the party’s press conference, spokesperson Pawan Khera and data analytics department chief Praveen Chakravarty called for an “exhaustive and unbiased investigation by a JPC between the unending links” of Facebook employees and the ruling establishment. “The investigation must include how Facebook manipulated voter opinion, allowed hate speech and was oblivious to fake news, even when they were in clear violation of their own regulations,” they said. “In the last 10 days, BJP and Facebook’s close relationship have been disclosed. In a new revelation, an international magazine has disclosed a relationship between WhatsApp and the BJP,” Khera told reporters. “Beyond just Ankhi Das, what has now been revealed exposes that another senior executive, Shivnath Thukral of WhatsApp is an unabashed devotee of the ruling establishment and was partisan in his professional conduct,” he alleged. “The expose’ reveals Thukral was hired by Facebook in 2017 only because he was ‘extremely close’ to the ruling establishment. It elaborates that Mr Thukral’s relationship with the ruling party goes as far back as 2013 when he operated websites and Facebook pages for the 2014 election campaign in conjunction with other BJP affiliates who continue to hold senior positions in the current government,” Khera further alleged. “Can 40 crore (400 million) Indians trust WhatsApp, which is indirectly controlled by one political party? What is the assurance that bank details, transaction details and private data of Indian users using WhatsApp is not being shared with the BJP and misused?” asked Khera. “WhatsApp cannot be granted approvals for its payment operations until the inquiry is complete and the recommended actions are taken by the company,” the Congress leaders said. They also demanded that the report of the investigation ordered by Facebook into the conduct of its Indian unit be made public. “The investigation must include how Facebook manipulated voter opinion, allowed hate speech and was oblivious to fake news, even when they were in clear violation of their regulations,” Khera said. Earlier on August 16, Gandhi had alleged that the BJP and the RSS control Facebook and WhatsApp in the country. He also alleged that they spread fake news and hatred through these social media platforms to influence the electorate. “BJP & RSS control Facebook & Whatsapp in India. They spread fake news and hatred through it and use it to influence the electorate. Finally, the American media has come out with the truth about Facebook,” he had tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-writes-to-zuckerberg-on-probe-details-alleges-nexus-between-whatsapp-and-bjp/story-jG2lqwtRE8UGtH31Y5NRsI.html
29-08-2020||India||India not to take part in multinational exercise with China, Pakistan on Russian soil||In a big step in the backdrop of an ongoing conflict with China in eastern Ladakh, India is likely to convey to Russia that its troops would not be participating in the multinational military exercise Kavkaz-2020 where Chinese and Pakistani troops are also going to be there.The Indian authorities have also taken into account the worsening global Covid-19 situation where India alone is witnessing over 70,000 positive cases daily to take a decision regarding participation in the wargames being held in the Astrakhan area of Southern Russia.“A high-level meeting was held in South Block in which External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat were present. After the meeting, it was discussed that it would not be right to take part in the multilateral exercise where Chinese and Pakistani military personnel would also be present,” defence sources told ANI here.Sources said while India is locked in a military conflict with the Chinese in eastern Ladakh and on high alert all along the 4,000 kilometre Line of Actual Control (LAC), it cannot be business as usual for us to be participating in multilateral military exercises with them.India and China had clashed in the Galwan valley on June 15 in which 20 Indian troops had lost their lives while the Chinese also suffered a number of casualties with scores of Chinese soldiers killed and injured there.Sources said Indian defence minister would be visiting Russia on September 4-6 for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation defence ministers’ meeting but it is unlikely that the Indian representative would be holding any talks with his Chinese counterpart.During the meeting, India may raise the point of expansionist policies of the Chinese along the Indian border but a final decision in this regard would be taken closer to the event, sources said.India was invited by Russia to participate in the tri-services exercise with a contingent of around 200 personnel to Southern Russia in September for the multi-lateral Kavkaz-2020.The exercise is being held in the Astrakhan province of Southern Russia where member countries of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and Central Asian countries would be participating.Exercise Tsentr last year had the participation of India, Pakistan and all SCO member-nations.India and China have been engaged in a territorial conflict in Eastern Ladakh and Sub Sector North (Ladakh) where Chinese troops have transgressed into multiple areas and are refusing to completely disengage in areas such as Finger, Depsang Plains and Gogra heights. Both sides have amassed over 40,000 troops on their respective side of the LAC with the induction of heavy weaponry including long-range artillery and tanks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-not-to-take-part-in-multinational-exercise-with-china-pakistan-on-russian-soil/story-TqwzYkBGhOvVAH4Lx0VwfJ.html
29-08-2020||India||Supreme Court order on Prashant Bhushan contempt case sentencing on Monday||The Supreme Court will, on Monday, pronounce its verdict on the sentence to be awarded to advocate Prashant Bhushan after it had held him guilty of criminal contempt of court on August 14 for his two tweets against the apex court and Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde.The bench, headed by justice Arun Mishra, will pronounce the judgment at 10.30 am.According to the Contempt of Courts Act, the offence of criminal contempt carries a punishment of up to six months in prison or a fine up to Rs 2,000 or both. The court has also, in previous instances, barred lawyers found guilty of contempt from practising before the court for a limited period while refraining from imposing any jail sentence.Bhushan had an opportunity to apologise for his tweets and express regret, but the activist lawyer stood his ground and stated that his tweets were based on his bonafide beliefs and an apology for his views, which be believed to be true, would be insincere.The court had reserved its judgment on August 25. The activist lawyer had posted two tweets, one against the Supreme Court on June 27 and another against CJI Bobde on June 29.Bhushan’s first tweet said: “When historians in the future look back at the last six years to see how democracy has been destroyed in India even without a formal Emergency, they will particularly mark the role of the SC in this destruction, and more particularly the role of the last four CJIs.”The second tweet referred to CJI Bobde and said: “The CJI rides a Rs 50-lakh motorcycle belonging to a BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader at Raj Bhavan, Nagpur, without wearing a mask or helmet, at a time when he keeps the SC on lockdown mode denying citizens their fundamental right to access justice!”The top court took note of the tweets after Mehek Maheshwari, an advocate, filed a petition before it on July 9 seeking initiation of contempt of court proceedings against Bhushan for the tweets. Maheswhari’s petition did not have the consent of Attorney General, a prerequisite under the Contempt of Courts Act for the apex court to entertain criminal contempt petitions filed by private individuals. The court, however, registered a suo motu (on its own) case based on Maheshwari’s petition and issued notice to Bhushan on July 22.The court then heard the matter on August 5 and held Bhushan to be guilty of a contempt of court in a judgment delivered on August 14. It then posted the case for hearing on August 20 to decide the sentence to be given to Bhushan.During the hearing on August 20, Bhushan maintained that he was standing by his tweets and also read out a statement prepared by him in which he expressed dismay at the judgment of August 14 which he said arrived at a conclusion against him without providing any evidence of his motives. He invoked Mahatma Gandhi’s stance in a case slapped against the father of the nation by the British government.“I can only humbly paraphrase what the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi had said in his trial: I do not ask for mercy. I do not appeal to magnanimity. I am here, therefore, to cheerfully submit to any penalty that can lawfully be inflicted upon me for what the court has determined to be an offence, and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen,” Bhushan read out from his statement.The court had then asked Bhushan to think over his stance and get back to it.Later, Bhushan submitted another supplementary statement before the court on August 24 in which he continued to stick to his tweets saying they were in good faith and not intended to malign the court or the CJI but only offered constructive criticism so that the court can arrest any drift away from its long-standing role as a guardian of the Constitution.Interestingly, Attorney General KK Venugopal, who had appeared in the case in his personal capacity at the court’s request, asked the court not to punish Bhushan and instead let him off with a warning.“Your Lordships should reprimand him and tell him not to repeat it in future. But do not punish him. It will be greatly appreciated at the Bar. That will be a fitting end to this case,” he said.The bench, however, pointed out that Bhushan has declined to apologise and has also filed statements sticking to his stance. “We have given him time to think it over. He says he is not ready to apologise. “Tells us what is wrong in using the word ‘apology’? Is it a reflection of guilt? It is a magical word which can heal. If you have hurt someone, you should apologise. There is no need to feel belittled by that,” justice Mishra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-pronounce-verdict-on-prashant-bhushan-s-contempt-case-on-monday/story-1BYDTJ3vQfx3HJWOnscSsM.html

Dr Anil Mishra, member of the Trust, handed over the documents to Neeraj Shukla, vice chairman of the development authority. “The layout of Ram temple is submitted to Ayodhya Development Authority for approval, along with all necessary documents and no objection certificates (NOCs) from other departments,” said Champat Rai, general secretary of the Trust. The Trust has procured mandatory NOCs from around six departments of the government, including fire department. “The Trust will follow all procedures and complete all formalities for approval of Ram Mandir’s layout. It will not seek any concession from the development authority in fee of the layout or in development charges,” Rai added. The layout fee will be paid only for the portion of the land on which the sanctum sanctorum of the temple will come up - that is for 2.77 acre of the land - he said. While development charges will be paid for the entire 70 acre campus, which is expected to be around Rs 1.5 crore to Rs 2 crore, he said. “Construction of Ram Mandir will start after the development authority approves layout,” added Rai. The development authority is expected to approve the layout plan in one week’s time after the trust submits the requisite fee. The proposed Ram Mandir will be 360 feet long, 235 feet wide and 161 feet high. Larsen and Toubro, the country’s leading construction company, is carrying out construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. According to the Trust, the temple’s foundation will be laid by using modern techniques so that it could be preserved for more than 1500 years and its structure for 1,000 years. Experts from the Central Building Research Institute (CBRI), Roorke and IIT Madras have been roped in to make the temple’s foundation strong so that it can withstand earthquakes and storms. The sanctum sanctorum of the temple will stand on around 1200 pillars. These pillars of one -metre diameter each will be laid 30 metres below the ground. Above these pillars there will be a two feet high concrete platform on which the temple’s base will be laid. On November 9 last, the Supreme Court had ruled in favour of Ram Mandir ending decades old Ayodhya title dispute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trust-submits-ayodhya-ram-temple-complex-layout-plan-for-approval/story-bgUownuVytD1XbDBzBuoII.html

New challenges have come before our democracy. Today, the country stands at a crossroads. Anti- poor and anti-nation forces and those who rule by making people fight against each other have been spreading hatred and venom of violence,” she said.“Bad thinking is dominating good thinking, freedom of expression is in danger and democratic institutions are being ruined. The influence of ‘tanashahi’ has been increasing on ‘lokshahi’,” she added.Without naming anyone, Gandhi further said, they want to suppress the voice of the people of the country.“What do they want? They want people of the country, our youth, our tribal people, our women, our farmers, shopkeepers and small traders, jawans to keep their mouths shut,” she said.Two years later, the country will complete 75 years of Independence, Gandhi added.“Father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi, former prime minister Pt Jawaharlal Nehru, G V Mavalankar (Speaker of Constituent Assembly of India), Dr B R Ambedkar and our other ancestors would have never imagined that after 75 years of Independence, the country will face such a difficult situation and our Constitution and democracy will be in danger,” she said.Extending wishes on the foundation stone laying ceremony, she said, “Today is an important day and we all should take a pledge to protect the foundation of democracy.We should also take a pledge that till the time we are in power, we should take a decision keeping in view the interest of people standing at the end of a queue.” “It should be remembered that the Constitution will not be saved by buildings rather it will be protected by emotions,” she asserted.Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi also attended the programme via video-conferencing from Delhi, officials said.Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, Chhattisgarh Assembly Speaker Charan Das Mahant and state ministers were present at the venue of the function in Nava Raipur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/influence-of-dictatorship-on-country-s-democracy-rising-sonia/story-niq8c3i3jrE8AltTzfJH4K.html
29-08-2020||India||‘No workable solution came up’: UP top court refuses Muharram procession plea||Spotlighting that the coronavirus pandemic is spreading like wildfire, the Allahabad high court on Saturday dismissed a bunch of petitions seeking permission for Tazia procession during Muharram, adding the decision is very much in proportion to “unprecedented situation”. The petitioners’ plea was that any restriction on the carrying out of procession during Muharram is in violation of their fundamental right of freedom to practise religion. They also cited the Supreme Court order allowing Jagganath Rath Yatra in Puri, Odisha. On passing some direction to allow procession and burial of Tazia, the court observed, “We have also given serious thought to working out some mechanism in order to permit the processions for Taziya burials, while imposing certain restrictions. However, no such workable mechanism could be suggested even by the counsels for the petitioners.“There is no mechanism fathomable, by the means of which it can be ensured that all such persons be permitted to take the Taziyas to the burial ground in a single day, while avoiding the risk of transmission of the contagion or following basic rules of social distancing, which are an absolute necessity in these unprecedented times.” The petitioners cited the Supreme Court order allowing Jagganath Rath Yatra in Puri, Odisha. “Also other religious festivals were allowed by state government during the same period but only procession of Muharram is not allowed which is discriminatory action on the part of the state government,” said the petitioner’s counsel.Additional chief standing counsel(ACSC), Ramanand Pandey, appearing for the state government, contended that the freedom to practise religion is not an absolute right and the same is subject to public order, morality and health. He added the state government can restrict religious activities keeping in mind the issue of public health.“State action is not discriminatory rather during the month of August, procession was not allowed during the festivals of Ganesh Chaturthi and Krishna Janamasthmi also. Public is allowed to practice religion inside their house but no public gathering is permitted surfing such events”, said Ramanandey Pandey.The court rejected the discriminatory charge against the state government. “This argument has no legs to stand on and appears to be patently misconceived. Same yardstick has been adopted for all religious communities and they have been restricted from carrying on any processions or Jhankis or activities that have the danger of large congregations,” said the court.On permission to carry out the Jagannath Rath Yatra, the court said, “Apex Court had not passed any general directions, but the permission to carry out the Annual Chariot Procession (Rath Yatra) pertained to a specific place, Puri, and only from one point to another.”On restricting certain religious rituals like procession, the court observed, “Prohibition of practices which are essential to our religions is an extraordinary measure, it is very much in proportion to the unprecedented situation we are faced with, owing to the pandemic. The right to practise and propagate religion has been made subject to public order, morality and health, even under the Constitution of India.“Pandemic is spreading like wildfire, despite harsh lockdowns. We are standing naked at the shore and don’t know when the huge wave of Corona may sweep us into the deep sea. We really don’t know what tomorrow holds. Adoption of safe practices are needed to win over the health crisis,” observed the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-workable-solution-came-up-up-top-court-refuses-muharram-procession-plea/story-HQZkIL5N7jxovXfVhaQseO.html

In a letter to Singh on Friday night, Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar said that enhanced security had been provided to the MLA due to a threat perception. “Security personnel are being alerted and checked from time to time. Special training has been organized for all your PSOs periodically,” he said in the letter. Raja Singh, who represents the Goshamahal assembly constituency in Hyderabad, is the lone BJP MLA in the Telangana assembly. The commissioner advised Singh against moving around on two-wheelers in view of the grave security threat. He suggested that the MLA should use the bulletproof car provided by the government whenever he goes out. Security was enhanced at his residence, after an additional deputy police commissioner rank officer reviewed his threat perception. Stating that providing proper security to him was the top priority of the police, Anjani Kumar said the MLA’s practice to often move on a motorcycle posed a security threat to him. “Therefore, your kind cooperation is solicited to ensure proper security that you kindly completely avoid moving on a motorcycle and travel by the bulletproof car allotted. The government has provided this BP car only for your security,” it added. Singh is known for making controversial statements on communal lines. Recently, he made headlines after his name figured in a ‘Wall Street Journal’ story that Facebook’s content policies favoured the BJP. Singh, on the other, claimed that his official Facebook account was hacked and blocked in 2018. Expressing surprise over the letter written by the police commissioner, the BJP MLA wanted to know if the threat was from terrorists or local groups or someone else. The letter from the police had no clarity. He said he would write to Union home minister Amit Shah and state home minister Mohd Mahmud Ali seeking more information about the changed threat perception.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-beefed-up-for-telangana-bjp-mla-after-police-review-threat-perception/story-95nk0lWIrcLgexHDKO0Y2I.html

The Marathi speaking group called the installation “surreptitious” and claimed that the T-junction had already been named in the honor of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.There have been tensions between a section of the Kannada and Marathi speaking population in the district with the latter wanting the district to be merged with Maharashtra.The Kuruba community (traditional shepherds) in Karnataka, who are the third largest caste group in the state after Veerashiva-Lingayats and Vokkaligas, see Rayanna as their community icon.Even as the local administration said that no permission had been taken for the installation of the statue, the issue became politicised. Former chief minister and JDS leader HD Kumaraswamy tweeted that there was no need to take permission from anybody to install a statue of the unassuming freedom fighter in Kannada land and condemned the acts of some, who he described as, “Marathi-speaking miscreants”.He issued a warning saying whether it was Shiv Sena or the Maharashtra Ekikarana Samithi (MES) or any other party, insult of a son of the soil like Rayanna will not be tolerated by Kannadigas and they “would be taught a suitable lesson.”Also Read: Karnataka govt briefs governor about the action taken to implement NEP 2020Leader of opposition in assembly, Siddaramiah, too, said that there would be no compromise in protecting the state’s interests when it came to “land, water, language or the honor of great leaders of the state.”Home minister Basavarj Bommai said that he had spoken to the district police commissioner and the IGP.“The police have been asked to take strict action so that the situation remains under control,” said Bommai, who also consulted the deputy CM, Lakshman Savadi, who hails from Belgavi district. Also Read: Karnataka in talks to acquire Bharat Gold Mine land for industrial parkCM Yediyurappa also said that he had spoken to the district administration to ensure that the issue was resolved peacefully.Several Kannada organizations across the state have threatened to take to streets if Rayanna’s statue is removed from the installed place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clashes-in-belgavi-over-a-statue-escalate-into-big-political-row-in-karnataka/story-dbUAb2fEor4ozH4nkJom0H.html

29-08-2020||India||President Kovind writes to Neelakanta Bhanu Prakash for winning ‘World’s Fastest Human Calculator’ title||President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday congratulated Neelakanta Bhanu Prakash of Hyderabad for winning a gold medal for India by becoming the fastest human calculator in the world.“I wish you all success in your future endeavour and hope you will bring in more laurels for the country,” the president wrote in a letter.The 20-year-old Neelakanta Bhanu Prakash bagged the first-ever gold for India in Mental Calculation World Championship at Mind Sports Olympiad (MSO) 2020 held in London recently. The event, held annually in London, saw virtual participation from 30 geniuses across 13 countries.Bhanu, a student of Mathematics (Hons) at Delhi University’s St Stephen College, has four world records and 50 Limca records to his name.“Breaking these records, once held by Math maestros like Scott Flansburg and Shakuntala Devi, is a matter of national pride. I have done my bit to place India on the global level of mathematics,” Bhanu told ANI.Bhanu was five years old when his tryst with maths began after an accident. Doctors had said that he would be cognitively impaired if he did not continue to work on his skills. “So my mom brought me puzzles and that’s how I knew my inclination was there. I realised that calculations are something that I loved doing,” he had told Hindustan Times in an interview.While growing up, Bhanu would practice for about 4-6 hours a day. He later diverted his focus on other skills too. “If I was just a mathematics calculator and didn’t know how business worked or how policy worked, I wouldn’t be able to contribute anything at all,” he said.Bhanu wants to spread the love of maths to millions of kids and his ‘VISION Math’ labs is an initiative towards fulfilling that dream.“Three out of every four students who study in the government schools of India have trouble in understanding basic Mathematics,” Bhanu told ANI. “Under the government’s listed goals, there are a lot of programs which emphasize on increasing the literacy, but as of now, there is no significant program or vision in increasing the mathematical abilities and numeracy which can put us ahead in the global race.”“Our visionary Prime Minister Narendra Modi should take the lead as I want to initiate and take ‘VISION MATH’ of India ahead. A robust plan like this will put India on the global map of excellence and bring back the old Indian Math Glory,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-kovind-writes-to-neelakanta-bhanu-prakash-for-winning-world-s-fastest-human-calculator-title/story-5nKNqIiP5GTorwPiKJPzeO.html
29-08-2020||India||Chennai doctors perform Asia’s first lung transplant on Covid-19 patient||A brain dead man has breathed new life into a Covid-19 patient with severe lung infection and given new hope to a young Mumbai woman after his lungs and hands were transplanted to the respective donors. The 34-year-old deceased man’s wife also agreed to donate his heart, liver and skin for various recipients in city hospitals. Incidentally, the hands were airlifted to Mumbai with the hope of giving the woman a real pair of limbs after she lost her hands in a train accident in Ghatkopar on January 12,2014. The transplant that benefited more than one recipient was made possible due to the donation from the deceased, who was declared brain dead by doctors at Gleneagles Global Hospital in Chennai after intracerebral hemorrhage on Thursday, hospital sources said. After his wife’s consent, the departed man’s organs were allotted to various hospitals. While Global Hospital Chennai retained the liver, the heart, lungs, kidneys and skin were donated to different hospitals in the city. His hands went to Monika More, a young woman from Mumbai’s suburban area, who was using artificial hands and is now set to get a real pair, if the bilateral surgery succeeds. The heart and lung transplant surgeries were performed at MGM Healthcare here. Incidentally, the 48 year-old recipient of lungs from Delhi turned out to be the first case of “successful completion of a critical bilateral lung transplant” on a Covid-19 positive patient, MGM Healthcare, where he is undergoing treatment, said. It claimed this was Asia’s “first known lung transplant” on a Covid-19 positive patient and the second in the hospital since the lockdown began. The transplant was performed on August 27 and post the transplant, the patient is doing fine in the Transplant ICU at MGM Healthcare, the hospital said in a statement. The patient’s lungs were severely damaged due to Covid-19 related fibrosis after he contracted the infection on June 8 and only a small portion of the lungs was still functioning then. As he became breathless and oxygen saturation came down, he was put on ventilator support on June 20. His condition continued to worsen in spite of it and he was airlifted to MGM Healthcare from Ghaziabad on July 20, the hospital said. As his lung condition continued to worsen, he was put on ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) support on July 25 for more than one month. Such patients are difficult to manage even in well-equipped ICUs. “Initially we were in a dilemma when his case was referred to us. But we prioritised the patient’s overall health over anything else. We decided to proceed with the surgery. Our team of doctors and the other support staff took up the challenge and boldly stood by the decision to go ahead with the transplant without thinking about the risk to their own health and safety.” “We are happy for the patient as the transplanted lungs are working well,” said Dr K R Balakrishnan, Chairman and Director of Cardiac Sciences and Director of the Heart and Lung Transplant Program at MGM Healthcare here, who led the team.According to Dr Suresh Rao, Co-Director, Institute of Heart and Lung Transplant and Mechanical Circulatory Support, the hospital accepted the heart from the same donor to another patient who was waiting for a heart transplant, “thereby giving a new lease of life to two people.” More, studying in a junior college in Mumbai, lost her hands at a local railway station Ghatkopar in a train accident in 2014. BJP leader Kirit Somaiya supported her with getting electronic artificial hands from his social outfit ‘Yuvak Pratisthan’ in July the same year. While More completed her graduation and started working at a local hospital at Kurla as a social worker, she subsequently registered herself for bilateral hands transplant at Global Hospital, located at Parel in that city. Somaiya claimed that the cost of her transplant is borne by Yuvak Pratisthan and Global hospital. “The surgery was proposed in summer itself, but had to be postponed after the coronavirus crisis. Finally, the hospital and More family decided to perform the surgery on August 27,” Somaiya said. “The hands were retrieved from a deceased donor at a private hospital in Chennai and airlifted to Mumbai on Thursday. The surgery conducted by a 12 member team led by Dr Nilesh Satbhai included Plastic, microvascular and reconstructive surgeons, Orthopaedic surgeons and Anaesthetists started on Thursday late night and was completed on Friday evening,” a statement from Global Hospital said. The patient has been shifted to the ICU post operatively for further management, it said. A hospital spokesperson thanked the donor family, donor hospital, Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre, Transtan, Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation and National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation for the timely coordination and allocation. “It goes without saying that the support extended by Traffic Police and Airport Authorities of Mumbai and Chennai ensured timely transport of the organ,” the spokesperson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brain-dead-man-breathes-new-life-into-covid-19-patient-with-severe-lung-infection/story-UUVnm1GL1Aqv4b1j9MILWN.html

The FIR against Tej Pratap was lodged at Ranchi’s Chutia police station on Friday. “Tej Pratap was booked under sections-269 and 270 of the Indian Panel Code (IPC),” said Ravi Thakur, officer-in-charge, Chutia police station. However, the FIR copy mentions two sections-188 and 34 of the IPC.The case was lodged on a written complaint of circle officer (CO), Ranchi, Prakash Kumar. In his complaint, Kumar said that when he, along with officer-in-charge Chutia, visited room no-507 of the hotel around 9 pm on Thursday, Tej Pratap and other persons were found staying there without any prior information or permission.According to the complaint, “He (Tej Pratap) had no permission letter of any competent authority for his stay. Besides, he returned to Bihar without completing the mandatory 14-day home quarantine which is a violation of government order during the Covid-19 pandemic.” A day before on Thursday evening, the owner and the manager of hotel Capitol Residency at Ranchi’s station road were booked for allegedly offering room to Tej Pratap. The FIR was lodged against them at Ranchi’s Chutia police station on a written complaint of circle officer (CO), Ranchi, Prakash Kumar.The officer-in-charge of Chutia police station, said, “Hotel manager Dushyant Kumar and the owner have been booked under sections 188 and 34 of the Indian Penal code (IPC).” Also read: Bihar assembly elections - Take voter base into account, avoid faulty tickets, says Rashtriya Janata Dal to alliesHe said hotels have not been permitted to operate in Jharkhand yet amid the pandemic. “In such a case, they cannot offer rooms to anyone. It is a violation of lockdown rules,” he added. Pratap was in Ranchi on Thursday and met former Bihar chief minister and his father Lalu Prasad Yadav at Kelly’s bungalow located in the premises of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS). Yadav is undergoing medical treatment there. An accused in the fodder scam, the RJD president was serving jail terms and was been admitted to RIMS in December 2018 for the treatment of his critical illness. Pratap told media persons that he met his father to enquire about his health and discussed political issues as well. Before meeting Lalu, Pratap underwent rapid antigen test and was allowed to meet his father after testing negative for SARS-Cov-2. When Jharkhand RJD president Abhay Singh was contacted for his comment over the FIR, he said, “I have no official information of any such development. As far as I know, Tej Pratap had left the city on Thursday night.” State BJP spokesperson, Pratul Shahdeo said the FIR was lodged against Tej Pratap after constant pressure from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “We have been putting pressure as over 60 vehicles entered the city with the RJD leader. A large contingent of party workers from Bihar and Jharkhand accompanied the leader in an open violation of social distancing and other Covid-19 norms in the hospital and around the city,” Shahdeo said. Reacting to the development, the office-bearers of the Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI) said the FIR was uncalled for. “Hotel owners know that offering rooms to anyone during the lockdown is a violation of Covid-19 protocol. But, the situation for them turns tough when leaders like Tej Pratap seek a room. The administration should take care when such leaders visit Ranchi,” said Dheeraj Taneja, FJCCI general secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rjd-chief-lalu-prasad-yadav-s-son-tej-pratap-ranchi-hotelier-booked-for-lockdown-violation/story-Pi8sRPKDIF67wt1RX3jGJM.html

This comes after the state’s premier administrative block witnessed a surge in coronavirus cases among its staff. “On account of the increase in Covid-19 cases in the Secretariat, Departments/Offices it is directed that not more than 50% strength of the secretariat employees shall attend the office on a particular day and the remaining employees shall work from home on an alternate day basis,” an order issued by the joint secretary of general administration said. The orders which come into effect from August 31 will remain in force at least until September 11, the order stated. The comes over ten days after a staff of the secretariat protested against the government’s inaction in introducing social distancing measures for employees. Back then, the number of cases was only around a dozen. It has now crossed 50. Also read: Unlock 4.0 - What to expect from September 1On August 18, around 150 employees, alarmed by the rising Covid-19 cases in the administrative complex, had gathered in the foyer while a few called on the chief secretary to urge him to introduce either a 50 percent workforce or staggered a mode of working for the employees. “If this continues like this then we will all become positive and the administration will totally collapse. So before it collapses, the government should do something and send out some guidelines. We cannot work from home because we don’t have amenities. At least we can work at 50 percent strength, but there should be some clarity on how we are supposed to work,” Sukarna Pai, an employee of the revenue department, said. Besides the secretariat, several other government departments have been plagued by Covid-19 with cases being detected in the electricity department, rural development agency, the Goa State AIDS Control Society and some district court complexes. The Goa government also resisted making it optional for teachers to work and conduct online classes from home. Instead, the government insisted that they report to school on all working days which led to some cases of infection among teachers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-cases-surge-at-state-secretariat-goa-orders-50-staff-to-report-to-work/story-NBurucsuIg3rmwvjgdIUuJ.html

A decision to this effect was taken at the TTD trust board meeting held in Tirumala in the morning. Hitherto, the TTD had been making cash deposits in the banks quarterly, half-yearly and yearly and getting interest only at the end of the maturity of deposits. “Now, we have decided to convert all these deposits into monthly mode with immediate effect. As the deposits are renewed every month, we can get monthly interest which can be used for paying salaries, bearing the overhead expenses and conducting regular rituals for the Lord,” TTD trust board chairman Y V Subba Reddy told reporters after the board meeting. As per the last year’s estimates, TTD has cash deposits in the banks to the extent of more than Rs 12,000 crore. In the 2020-21 annual budget for the TTD, adopted in February this year, the board projected an income of Rs 706 crore in the form of interest on deposits for the entire year. Interest on deposits is the second highest source of income after the Hundi (cash chest adjacent to the temple where devotees make offering) collections, which are projected at around Rs 1,313 crore in the TTD’s annual budget, which has a total outlay of Rs 3,309 crore. Also Read: With BJP, AIMIM, VBA on same page, Sena hints at reopening places of worshipThe decision to shift to the monthly mode of deposits was taken apparently in view of serious cash crunch because of the sharp fall in the income from pilgrim offerings on the account of Covid-19 pandemic and the prolonged lockdown that forced the temple to remain shut for 80 days. Even after the lockdown was lifted, the footfall of pilgrims has come down drastically. Also Read: After 11-day prayers, 40 priests in Uttar Pradesh paid with coupon notesThe TTD trust board also decided that the Lord’s gold deposits should be converted to long-term deposits from the current short-term, so as to get more interest. Presently, the gold deposits are yielding 2.5 percent income. Longer durations ranging up to 12 years will fetch a greater rate of interest. TTD deposits surplus gold-- donated by devotees but never used for decoration of the Lord-- in nationalised banks as per an order from the state government in 2,000. When the RBI brought in gold monetisation scheme in 2015, the TTD deposited 5,387 kgs of gold in State Bank of India, 1,938 kgs in Indian Overseas Bank and 1,381 kgs in PNB. The gold in PNB was withdrawn last year upon maturity and shifted to the SBI. Also Read: Nanda Devi festival begins sans devotees due to Covid; rituals live on social mediaThe board also decided that the Brahmotsavams in September would be held in Ekantam (without allowing devotees). Brahmotsavams are one of the biggest celebrations at Tirumala. This is the first time that Brahmotsavams will be celebrated in a simple way for a formality because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The chairman said there would be another Brahmotsavams in October. If the situation improves, devotees may be allowed. TTD board member Sudha Narayana Murthy offered Rs 1 crore as donation to the TTD for adopting the sophisticated technology for conversion of garbage on the Tirumala hill into compost. A consultant would be engaged for viable solutions, Reddy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tirupati-temple-to-draw-monthly-interest-on-rs-12-000-crore-deposits-due-to-cash-crunch/story-tHcLzmtk768yfbM2sU3RPP.html

29-08-2020||India||Bihar assembly elections: Take voter base into account, avoid faulty tickets, says Rashtriya Janata Dal to allies||The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD ) has asked the smaller allies in the Grand Alliance it leads in Bihar to choose their nominees for seats allotted to them by taking into account their base voters and avoid the mistake of faulty ticket distribution that led to their debacle in the 2019 national polls, people aware of the matter said.“The smaller parties--be it RLSP [Rashtriya Lok Samata Party] and VIP [Vikashsheel Insaan Party]--have been asked this time to ensure the transfer of their base votes and allot tickets based on their party’s support base. We want all GA [Grand Alliance] candidates to get base votes of different allies and mistakes of the 2019 [national polls] polls are not repeated,” said an RJD leader involved in seat-sharing talks, requesting anonymity.The RJD’s suggestion is based on the party’s internal assessment after the 2019 debacle that smaller allies did not allot tickets based on their support among different caste groups and thus failed to get the support of various groups among Other Backward Classes mainly Kushwahas.A second RJD leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said RLSP’s chief Upendra Kushwaha’s contested two seats and allotted another to Congress’s Akash Kumar Singh. He called it an unwise move as it prevented them from attracting base voters of the party as the cadres got disillusioned.The second RJD leader said the VIP’s ticket selection in 2019 was also faulty as it did not accommodate even a single candidate from the Nonia community, which has a sizeable presence in north Bihar.In 2019 polls, the RJD-led alliance won only one seat of Bihar’s 40. RJD could not even win a single seat even as it secured 15.68% of votes. Congress got 7.85%, RLSP 3.66%, and VIP 1.65% of votes.RJD state president Jagdanand Singh refused to comment on the RJD’s suggestion to smaller parties on the candidate selection. “Social combination is a factor in deciding the outcomes of polls. We want all parties to work together.”Kushwaha is believed to be unhappy with the development even as he denied the RJD had laid any such condition on distributing tickets. He recently said he will stay with the alliance “even if I have to consume poison”.Kushwaha is said to be annoyed with the RJD and the Congress for not getting any assurance of the number of seats his party would get to contest. He has said he expects to get at least 30 seats.“ Yes, I have said so. The seat-sharing talks getting delayed is quite worrying and my statement is in that context. But it should not be construed that I am angry with the partners. I am also not aware of any conditions laid down by RJD on ticket distribution,” he said.VIP chief Mukesh Sahni said they have spoken about ticket distribution based on a party’s base voters. “I have announced that 33% of seats allotted to VIP would be distributed to EBCs [extremely backward classes] from different caste groups. Maybe the number would be higher. The RJD’s proposal is quite logical as candidates should be picked up based on the support base of each GA partner. Even Congress should follow the same.”The alliance suffered a setback as Hindustani Awaam Morcha left it this month over delay in seat adjustments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-assembly-elections-take-voter-base-into-account-avoid-faulty-tickets-says-rashtriya-janata-dal-to-allies/story-5zVo4YgL0GlN0mkoYgzMUK.html

The exams NEET and JEE are for undergraduate medical and engineering aspirants respectively. An order stated that safety norms such as physical distancing, personal hygiene, mask wearing etc have to be followed inside the examination centres in view of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic adding that the district authority will ensure the implementation of these norms outside the premises. Earlier chief minister Naveen Patnaik spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi advocating the postponement of the exams in view of the Covid-19 crisis and floods which has gripped several districts in the state.

Sitharaman on Thursday said the economy has been hit by the pandemic, which is an “Act of God”, and it will see a contraction in the current fiscal. Taking a swipe at Sitharaman over the remark, Chidambaram said, “If the pandemic is an ‘Act of God’, how do we describe the mismanagement of the economy during 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20. Before the pandemic struck India?” “Will the FM as the Messenger of God please answer?” the former finance minister asked on Twitter. In a series of tweets, the senior Congress leader also slammed the Centre for asking states to borrow more to make up for revenue losses due to pending GST dues. He asserted that the two options given by the Modi government to the states to bridge the GST compensation gap are unacceptable. “Under the first option the states are asked to borrow by pledging their future receivables under Compensation cess. The financial burden falls entirely on the states,” Chidambaram said. “Under the second option, states are asked to borrow from the RBI window. It is more market borrowing, only by a different name. Again, the entire financial burden falls on the states,” he said. Chidambaram claimed the Central government is absolving itself of any financial responsibility. This is “gross betrayal” as well as a “direct violation of the law”, he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-the-messenger-of-god-answer-chidambaram-s-jibe-at-nirmala-sitharaman/story-ZdpnWhzJmsGCDaXFyCq18N.html

The woman was arrested on Thursday after a local ward councillor Gajendra Sajwan lodged a complaint against the woman on August 25, said police. RK Saini, senior sub-inspector at Rishikesh’s Muni Ki Reti police station, where the foreign national was booked said, “Sajwan had lodged a complaint that the woman had done a nude video shoot and a photo shoot and put them on social media platforms through which he came to know about it.”“Based on the complaint, a case was registered against her under the relevant sections of Information Technology Act. During the probe, it was confirmed that the act was done on Lakshmanjhula, which is a public place. Later, some locals said that the woman is living in a hotel in Rishikesh,” said Siani. After verifying her address, police then went to her hotel and questioned her over the incident.

29-08-2020||India||TMC alleges political vendetta as Central agencies speed up probe in poll-bound Bengal||With over six months left for West Bengal elections, heightened activity by the Central probe agencies since Monday has prompted the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) to allege “political vendetta by the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.” On August 24, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) sent notices to five TMC leaders in connection with the 2014 Narada News sting operation, the videos of which were made public before the 2016 Bengal assembly polls, seeking details of their family property. The videos purportedly showed high-profile TMC leaders receiving money to help a fictitious company. On August 26 and 27, the Kolkata office of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is probing the Narada case as well as the Saradha, Rose Valley and MPS Group Ponzi fund scams involving thousands of crores of rupees, revamped its economic offence wing. Two officers of the rank of superintendent of police flew down from Delhi to join duty, a CBI officer said on condition of anonymity. On August 28, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) questioned Chhatradhar Mahato, the tribal leader from Jhargram district who headed the People’s Committee Against Police Atrocities (PCAPA), an alleged Maoists-backed outfit launched during the Left government, in connection with the 11-year-old case of hijacking of the Bhubaneswar-Delhi Rajdhani Express. Also read: Bengal government requests railway board to resume local train, metro servicesChief minister Mamata Banerjee inducted Mahato into her party’s state committee in July. The Bengal government released him in February after his life term was commuted by the Calcutta high court. The back-to-back developments have not gone down well with the TMC leadership. In all her public statements this week, including virtual meeting with the chief ministers of opposition ruled states, Banerjee alleged that the BJP is using Central agencies to crush the opposition. “The chief minister cannot blame the BJP for everything. It is the judiciary that asked Central agencies to probe the Narada and Ponzi fund cases. On the other hand, it is the state government that is using the state police to file criminal cases against BJP leaders. This exposes the difference in mindsets,” said Bengal BJP vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar. Saugata Roy, one of the TMC MPs, who received ED notice on August 24, said, “The ED served me a notice after several years. There are clear indications of a political vendetta.” Other TMC leaders to have received ED notices are Kakali Ghosh Dastidar, former Lok Sabha member Aparupa Poddar, minister Suvendu Adhikari, and TMC leader Ratna Chatterjee. Chhatradhar Mahato who was grilled at the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) camp in West Midnapore district on Friday, said, “I am a target because I represent the tribal community. The NIA said I will be grilled again.”The Central agency probes in these cases are going on. In the Narada case, the CBI filed the FIR in March 2017, acting on a Calcutta high court order that was upheld by the Supreme Court. The CBI also registered an FIR against then TMC Rajya Sabha MP Mukul Roy, who later joined the BJP and became the opposition party’s election strategist in Bengal. The trial in this case has not started yet.CBI officials said the agency is also trying to wrap up the probe in the Saradha Ponzi fund case involving an estimated Rs 2,460 crore that was raised from around 1.8 million depositors from West Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh. Sudipta Sen, who owned the group, is in jail. Some TMC leaders named in the Saradha case files have tried to come clean. In 2019, Satabdi Roy, TMC’s three-time Lok Sabha member from Birbhum, returned to the ED a sum of Rs 30.64 lakh that she received from the Saradha group for being its brand ambassador, four years after actor Mithun Chakraborty, a former TMC Rajya Sabha member, returned Rs 1.16 crore to the ED. TMC’s former Rajya Sabha member Kunal Ghosh spent over two years in jail custody in the case. The Rose Valley scam, estimated at Rs 17,000 core, is, however, the biggest Ponzi scam in Bengal in terms of money involved. In 2014, the Supreme Court asked the CBI to investigate the scams and the role of ‘influentials’ in money laundering. The ED is running a parallel probe. “The Calcutta high court, which is overseeing the probes into the Ponzi scams as well as refund of money to investors, around 200 of whom have died by suicide, has taken a strong stand,” said lawyer Arimdam Das who represents the cheated investors of Saradha, Rose Valley and MPS groups. On August 26, while hearing a bail petition filed by MPS Group owner Pramathanath Manna, who is in jail custody for six years, the division bench of Justice Joymalya Bagchi and Justice Suvra Ghosh expressed displeasure and asked the CBI why the trial has not started yet, he said. Additional solicitor general YJ Dastoor, who is representing the CBI, informed the court that Manna had been delaying the trial by filing multiple cases.The elections to 294-member West Bengal assembly is scheduled for May 2021, in which BJP is expected to be the main challenger to TMC, which has been ruling the state for the past 10 years. In 2016 assembly polls, the TMC has romped home with 211 seats while the BJP could secure only six. The Left parties got 32 seats and the Congress 44.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-alleges-political-vendetta-as-central-agencies-speed-up-probe-in-poll-bound-bengal/story-XSW8iCZ0zsgsC7R2nHcqXM.html

This survey covered over 4,500 samples and 16 varieties of edible oil, including mustard, coconut, palm, olive and blended oil. Various hilly as well as difficult terrains, including Ladakh, Arunachal Pradesh, Daman & Diu as well as Andaman (UT), were included in this exercise so as to ensure a holistic sample size across the country.The samples were drawn from hypermarkets and supermarkets as well as retail and grocery stores and included national and local brands.“The survey was conducted by the State Food Safety department officials. At least 50 samples were collected from the metro cities—Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai and Kolkata and 6-8 samples each in cities and districts, other than the metros. FSSAI had shared the detailed guidelines and SOPs for conducting the survey as well as procedure of sample collection with the Commissioners of Food Safety in all States/ UTs…” a health ministry statement read.The final survey results will help identify the key hot spots for the adulteration of edible oil in different parts of the country and will strengthen efforts at the state/UT level to devise targeted enforcement drives in the next few months. The whole exercise is aimed at ensuring the availability of pure and safe mustard and other varieties of edible oil in the country.“A comprehensive strategy for testing of these samples through the State Food Testing Laboratories or FSSAI notified food testing labs (including private NABL accredited) to analyze various parameters including Fatty Acid composition as well as adulteration of any other oils or harmful or extraneous substance/ chemical has been developed. The test results are expected in a month’s time,” an FSSAI statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/food-safety-regulator-cracks-down-on-adulterated-edible-oil/story-T6l7NJwVCLCDdJcnpvys3O.html

Each waste product is disinfected and kept aside to be sent to private recyclers. However, with hardly any recycling units functioning and less number of vehicles with us, we have completely run out of space to store any additional quantity,” said Amit Nilawar, director, SMS Envoclean.Also read: Good ventilation lowered viral load, Covid deaths in Asian nations - StudyThe rise in waste restricts the movement of people within the plant as well, said Nilawar. In June, HT had reported that 20 sanitation workers had quit the waste treatment centre in fear of being infected by the Sars-Cov-2 virus.According to SMS, the quantity of Covid-19 and biomedical waste increased from an average of 12,200 kilograms per day in June to 24,880 kilograms per day average in August being brought in yellow bags from across 12,000 healthcare facilities in Mumbai. Every Monday, the quantity of Covid-19 waste reduces to 18,000-19,000 kilograms.Additionally, 6,000 kilograms of recyclable waste is being presently brought to the plant. While SMS has 60 vehicles catering to only hospitals, another 35 vehicles from the BMC are bringing waste from quarantine camps and homes, containment zones in yellow bags. “The entire load of 24,880 kilograms is being incinerated daily but we are managing to send only 4,000 kilograms of the plastic waste to functional waste recyclers. The pile of treated waste stock has increased so much that we don’t have any space to park our vehicles,” said Nilawar. Each vehicle can carry an average of 250 kilograms of waste (ranging between 100 to 400 kilograms depending on the size of the vehicle). The National Green Tribunal (NGT) in April appointed a committee that directed all states to look into the expansion of waste treatment facilities apprehending additional Covid-19 waste. Then state chief secretary Ajoy Mehta had asked all municipal corporations to audit their respective facilities. “The BMC had asked us whether we would like to increase our capacity. We asked for 3-acres but they agreed and approved the handover of a one-acre plot adjacent to our facility in June,” said Nilawar adding, “Once we have the land, we will procure 10 vehicles immediately and build a storage shed for additional waste.”The BMC confirmed that the approval to hand over the land had been issued. “It will take some time to complete all formalities but will be done soon,” said a senior civic official.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner said, “We are meeting with the contractor soon. We will try to come up with a way out of the matter. At the moment, we have asked all solid waste management staff to focus only on Covid-19 waste. We are getting very few complaints about the non-lifting of waste, and I am personally monitoring the progress on a weekly basis.”He added that antigen testing camps had been organised for all sanitation workers. “Only one or two persons handling and transporting waste have been infected so far since March, and as restrictions have eased in the city, the workforce has increased,” said Kakani.How the waste plant controls air pollution from excessive waste burning With almost 25,000 kilograms of Covid-19 and associated biomedical waste being incinerated daily at the private waste treatment centre in Deonar, air pollution is a concern for the operator and residents. However, they have built a mechanism to ensure minimal emission. The waste treatment centre follows a process of second combustion followed by scrubbing and water sprinkling to remove hazardous pollutants. First, the waste is incinerated in a chamber and resultant hazardous smoke is transferred to another chamber where it is burnt for the second time ridding the air of harmful pollutants. Then it is sent to a third chamber where the air is filtered using a scrubber, and finally to a fourth chamber where a water sprinkler using chemicals further purifies the air before residual steam is released from the chimney.“The chimney is located at a height much above the peripheral residential area and the steam (almost colourless) disperses quickly into the air, and no black soot or smoke is visible,” said Nilawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/city-s-covid-19-waste-doubles-in-3-months-treatment-facility-runs-out-of-storage-space/story-RB9z2efys8dlctlXXUxL0H.html

SSP national highway J S Johar said that while Kashmir highway has been temporarily and partially restored from Jammu to Srinagar, only stranded vehicles are being cleared and no fresh traffic is allowed from Jammu till Dalwas stretch in Ramban, till the highway is restored completely.The official, however, hoped that the stretch in Dalwas will be fully restored by Saturday evening. A portion of road had been washed away in a mudslide at Dalwas on Wednesday in Ramban district.A local from Batote said, “This morning only Kashmir-bound vehicles stranded between Ramban and Valley were being allowed to proceed to their destinations in Kashmir but in the afternoon Dalwas was partially restored. Light motor vehicles are being allowed to pass Dalwas stretch where mud and slush are causing great inconvenience to the vehicles.”The up-traffic is moving cautiously due to slippery road conditions, he added. Landslides have been cleared from Marog, Digdol, Monkey Morh, Cafeteria Morh, Mompassi and Panthial, he said.The weather has also opened up in Ramban, situated at the highest altitude on Kashmir highway. “It is bright and sunny today,” said the local, adding that daily commuters know that landslides are triggered when weather turns dry soon after rains as loose rocks and soil come off the hills.

29-08-2020||India||‘Good ventilation lowered indoor viral load, Covid-19 deaths in developing Asian countries’: Study||Indoor spaces with good ventilation and fewer closed air-conditioned spaces are the reason for fewer deaths due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in developing Asian countries including India, said an analysis published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Public Health.The virus remains airborne in enclosed spaces, leading to repeated exposure and a build-up of high viral load in the upper respiratory tract, increasing the severity of the disease and mortality, said authors from Delhi and Mangalore.“People in the developing countries tend to spend less time in air-conditioned enclosed places, where the viral load is higher due to lack of ventilation. This could be the reason for fewer deaths reported from several Asian countries. In fact, the initial surge in cases was reported from European countries, where people might have stayed indoors longer in the winter months of January and February,” said Dr Shyam Aggarwal, the first author of the study and chairman of the oncology department at Sir Ganga Ram hospital, which collaborated with Max Smart Superspeciality hospital in Delhi and Kasturba Medical College in Mangalore for the article.Also read: Flouting Covid-19 norms in metro may attract heavy fines once it reopensIn India, the overcrowded homes is leading to the spread. “Even though not many people spend time in air-conditioned offices in India, the problem here is that of several people living in close proximity in small houses leading to transmission within families,” he said.While examining whether airborne transmission of the viral infection is possible, the World Health Organization in July said that “short-range aerosol transmission, particularly in specific indoor locations, such as crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces over a prolonged period of time with infected persons cannot be ruled out.”Clusters of Covid-19 infections have been reported across the world in such inadequately ventilated spaces such as a cluster of 10 cases reported in people who had eaten at an air-conditioned restaurant in January end in Guangzhou, China.Also read: Covid-19 Unlock 4.0 - What to expect from September 1Another cluster of 52 people was reported from a choir practice in Washington, US in March. Over 100 cases of Covid-19 were traced back to a dance fitness class in South Korea in February. One of the more recent clusters of 27 cases was linked to a coffee shop in South Korea in August.The doctor says there is a need to increase air exchange in such enclosed air-conditioned spaces. “To make places that do not have enough ventilation and are completely air-conditioned, the number of air exchange – circulation of outdoor air in the air-conditioning system – every hour has to be increased. In some places, there were just five air exchanges each hour once summer started as it puts more strain on the system and leads to more electricity consumption. This has to be about 12 to 15 exchanges an hour,” said Dr Aggarwal.Experts say that the existing evidence suggests that ill-ventilated, completely air-conditioned buildings must be avoided, but whether it leads to higher mortality is not known.“In a healthcare setting, some procedures lead to aerosolization of the bronchial fluids that have a high viral load and it has been seen that it puts people in the areas at a higher risk of infection. In other building, if adequate outdoor air infusion is not ensured and some way of killing the viral particles – such as plasma ionisation or UV ray treatment – then there may be a higher risk of infection,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, a professor in the department of pulmonology at Safdarjung hospital.“But I do not think it can explain the disparity in the number of deaths in various countries. Scientists are still trying to figure out the causes of fewer deaths in some places – whether it is demography, an unconducive environment for transmission, the virus mutating to become milder, genetic factors, use of certain medicines or vaccines like HCQ and BCG,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/good-ventilation-lowered-indoor-viral-load-covid-19-deaths-in-developing-asian-countries-study/story-v6yLU7U9WrYh5hK6gr8oHI.html

The incident took place at Patai village under Devari police station, about 120 km away from Raisen district headquarters, the neighbouring district of Bhopal, at about 9 am, according to police. Sub-divisional officer of police (SDoP) Ashok Ghanghoria said, “The well is situated in the agriculture field of a Kushwah family. When the irrigation motor pump installed inside the well stopped functioning on Friday morning, Brijesh Kushwaha, 20, got down in the well to see what had gone wrong. The moment he touched the motor pump he was electrocuted. On seeing the condition of his younger brother, Jagdish Kushwah, 25, entered the well to rescue him and the moment he made an attempt to pull his brother out, he too was electrocuted. Their cousin brother Preetam Kushwah met the same fate when he entered the well.” Also Read: 7 injured in acid attack over dairy dispute in Madhya Pradesh The officer said though the villagers informed the police immediately, it could reach only around 2 pm since the main road was submerged due to heavy rains.

29-08-2020||India||RSS sets up study centres for rural students, includes patriotism lessons||More than 1000 volunteers of RSS are reaching out to young minds through study centres-- Balgokulam—set up in more than 31 districts of Madhya Pradesh, as per RSS functionaries. RSS’ Madhya Bharat arm is helping students in their studies,--affected by Covid 19--while also introducing them to Sangh’s ideology, thoughts on patriotism and also moral and cultural values by introducing at least 600 study centres in villages of Madhya Pradesh in August, as per functionaries of the organisation. “The schools are closed and students are being educated through online classes due to Covid 19. There are many students in MP who are lagging behind in online classes as they don’t have smart mobile phones. To help such students up to class 8, more than 1000 volunteers have started teaching at Balgokulam centres for three hours daily with the help of books and community radio, in which special educational programmes are being run to teach students,” said Satish Pimplikar, a leader of the RSS and in-charge of the programme. “In this initiative, women volunteers of Rashtra Sevika Samiti are also participating in good numbers. The volunteers pay extra attention to weak students and if required, they teach them for extra hours,” he added. “While covering the syllabus, we are also instilling a feeling of patriotism in the students by telling them stories of our freedom fighters and also trying to educate them on our country’s rich culture,” said a volunteer from Guna, who didn’t wish to be named. The classes are being conducted to ensure that students maintain social distancing to avoid contracting the disease.Also Read: Former RSS ideologue Govindacharya wants parliamentary probe in workings of social media platforms“The class starts with Saraswati vandana (worship of Goddess Saraswati) and ends with Vande Matram. In the class, students maintain social distancing. The students come with their books, which have been distributed by school teachers during a door to door campaign. We explain one topic each of two subjects daily to students and also give them homework to see if they understood the topic,” said the volunteer quoted above. Most of the centres have been started in backward areas. In all, 1000 centres will be started in the next two weeks in the most backward areas of the state, said another leader, who didn’t wish to be named. Also Read: BJP used social media to spread religious hatred: Shiv SenaPimplekar said “The decision was taken after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat guided us to help students in their studies amid the Covid-19 situation, during a meeting held in Bhopal in July last week.” However, opposition Congress alleged that the real motive of RSS is not to teach students but to spread their saffron ideology. Congress spokesperson JP Dhanopia said, “This is more an expansion plan of the RSS to spread their saffron ideology in MP. They chose school students because they could be brainwashed easily.” BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal, however, praised the initiative.“This is a very good initiative to help the students. The volunteers of RSS are doing welfare work across the nation. Congress leaders have made it their habit to get involved in criticism as they are pessimistic people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-sets-up-study-centres-for-rural-students-includes-patriotism-lessons/story-ZVigJhM5edu15eFCqSlUzK.html

29-08-2020||India||India’s growth to pick-up from second quarter of FY-21: EY report||India’s growth in the first quarter of current financial year is likely to be “the worst” amongst the four quarters of FY-21 because of economic disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, an EY India’s report said indicating improved economic performance from the second quarter.“High frequency indicators for India are giving positive signals after the first two months of the pandemic,” the consultancy firm said in its latest edition of Economy Watch before the scheduled release of official gross domestic product (GDP) data on Monday.The optimism of the report is based on indicators such as the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), sales of passenger vehicles, power consumption and the rise in the foreign exchange reserve. “In June and July 2020, PMI manufacturing was close to the benchmark level of 50 at 47.2 and 46.0 respectively. Although IIP has continued to contract in June 2020, its rate of contraction has come down to -16.6% from its May 2020 level of -33.9%. In June 2020, passenger vehicle sales picked up sharply with sales of 1,20,188 units as compared to sales of 33,546 units in April and May 2020 considered together,” it said.Although power consumption shows a continued contraction, the rate of contraction has been coming down over successive months since April 2020 when it was at -25%. This fell to -0.4% in the first 20 days of August 2020, it added. It also pointed at the foreign exchange reserves continued to rise steadily reaching a level of $538 billion by August 7, 2020 as a positive indicator.DK Srivastava, chief policy advisor of EY India, however, said one adverse development is the slowing down of bank credit growth to 5.8% in the fortnight ending 17 July 2020. “Due to subdued demand, average credit growth fell to 6.4% in the first quarter of FY21 as compared to 7.1% in fourth quarter of FY20,” he said.Also Read: World Bank pauses Ease of Doing Business rankingsHe said the center’s capital expenditure grew by 40.1% in the first quarter of FY-21 as compared to a contraction of -27.6% in the corresponding period previous year, indicating frontloading of capital expenditure by the Union government, which is “welcomed as it signals investment in infrastructure” in line with the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) objectives.In his Independence Day address on August 15, Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled over Rs 110 lakh crore infrastructure projects to boost the economy and create jobs. “In order to rapidly modernise India, there is a need to give a new direction to overall infrastructure development,” he said, adding that over 7,000 projects under NIP have been already identified.Also Read: World Bank’s ‘Doing Business Report’ on hold over data fudging concernsThe report, however, pointed at rising fiscal deficit. The Controller General of Accounts (CGA) data released for the month of June 2020 shows that center’s fiscal deficit in 1Q FY21 is already 83.2% of the annual budgeted target. “In terms of magnitude, the fiscal deficit in 1Q FY21 is 53.3% larger than the corresponding magnitude in 1Q FY20. Center’s revenue deficit during 1Q FY21 stood at 94.8% of the annual budgeted target as compared to 77.1% in the corresponding period of FY20,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-growth-to-pick-up-from-second-quarter-of-fy-21-ey-report/story-7UrlrbDS2as0FCB1qwaE6L.html

29-08-2020||India||Govt may ask BSNL to test domestic network for 4G||The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is considering advising state-run Bharat Sanchar NIgam Ltd. (BSNL) to test a domestically consolidated end-to-end network for 4G services before selecting a telecom company to upgrade its network, HT has learnt.Such a decision could have far-reaching ramifications because the new setup, if found feasible, can be replicated by other network providers and to upgrade to 5G services, the tendering process for which is yet to begin.HT reported on June 22 that the DoT had set up a six- member panel to look into the 4G upgrade tender after which it was scrapped on July 1. The decision came in the aftermath of heightened tensions with China, particularly since the death of 20 Indian soldiers on June 15 in Eastern Ladakh Sector’s Galwan Valley in a skirmish with Chinese soldiers.The decision was also taken in the context of the telecom department’s preference for a Make in India option and to reduce reliance on Chinese companies such as Huawei Technologies Company Ltd. and ZTE Corporation. The six-member panel, which has representatives from DoT, BSNL, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited and industry experts, has already met five times and is in the final stage of outlining requirements for the fresh tender. The tender requirements are likely to be finalised by the end of the week. The Rs 7,000- Rs 8,000 crore tender is part of the BSNL revival package that will allow it to expand its telecom presence. “Indian manufacturers at present do not have a turnkey setup in place,” said a DoT official who did not wish to be named. “A turnkey setup offers end-to-end network, including both radio and core requirements that are consolidated at a central level by a single operator.”The official said while seven companies manufacture radio equipment, used to set up telecom towers, only two companies at present are capable of making core equipment, which translates the signals to provide telecom services. “The core equipment is responsible for translating the signals that are carried by the radio equipment,” the official said. “The new approach is likely incorporate multiple vendors to set up an end-to-end network.”A member of the panel told HT on condition of anonymity that reservations had been expressed by some members of the panel about the ability of Indian tech companies to set up such a network. “We are discussing telling BSNL...to set up at least 10-20 towers using local equipment and connect it to the core,” said the member. “They can test if the equipment is giving the appropriate results.”According to experts, nearly 75% of the telecom equipment India needs is sourced from companies outside the country. ZTE and Huawei, Nokia, Ericsson AB and Samsung Electronics Company Ltd are among the biggest suppliers. “We are not saying that Nokia or Airtel will not be able to provide services, but the idea is that the local manufacturers get a greater stake,” said the first official. “Nokia has an India-based office that employs many Indian engineers.”Those doing over 50% value addition to products and networks by using equipment that is made in India and not just assembled in the country would be given preference, according to DoT. “Say Tech Mahindra gives a bid for 112 and Nokia for 100, Tech Mahindra will be asked to match the bid,” said former DoT technical advisor RK Bhatnagar. “Ericsson’s value addition, for example, would be around 25%, making them ineligible to be in preference category.” Bhatnagar added that a version of the DoT’s proposal was discussed at a meeting convened by NITI Aayog, the government’s policy think tank, in early July. “Private players such as Tech Mahindra made a presentation that they have the capability,” said Bhatnagar. “They had asked for a chance, and NITI Aayog had suggested the same to DoT.”“The players can be asked to set up a consolidated network, which will then be tested over four months to see if it’s a workable solution and then can be replicated in other places,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-may-ask-bsnl-to-test-domestic-network-for-4g/story-Tum2HjqkGAuuuP3DDewZDM.html

29-08-2020||India||Putting off the university exams could jeopardise academic session | Opinion||There is a clamour to postpone all exams including the JEE and NEET exams which are essential to ensure merit-based admissions in engineering and medical institutions across the country. For several days, various newspapers, TV channels and the digital media have been reporting arguments to postpone these exams. A few days back, chief ministers of several opposition-ruled states joined hands to demand the postponement of the JEE and NEET examinations and decided that they will jointly approach the Supreme Court in this regard. Those who want the exams postponed argue that in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, holding the exams will adversely affect the health of students and will increase the spread of the virus. They also argue that the restrictions on public transport due to coronavirus would make it difficult for many aspirants to reach the examination centers. Their demand is to defer the exams till at least November by when the virus situation is hoped to improve.The issue of postponement of exams was agitated before the Supreme Court also, which after hearing all the interested parties, declined to intervene in the matter and ordered that these exams be conducted as per schedule. The government was also directed to take all necessary precautions for the safe conduct of these exams. The Supreme Court, in another matter on Friday, decided that universities must go through with the examinations of final-year students and gave the freedom to universities to devise the schedule as per their convenience. Now, various opposition-ruled states have filed review petitions before the Supreme Court for postponement of the JEE and NEET exams.There is no doubt that these are extraordinary times and fear of coronavirus is looming large everywhere. At present, India is reporting the highest numbers of daily coronavirus infections in the world and the number of deaths occurring every day due to the virus is also the highest. So the arguments advanced by groups pushing for postponement of the exams have some merits. But if we look from the other side, the arguments advanced by the government also look weighty. These exams have been postponed twice earlier due to the same reasons. Time has now come to take a final call on holding these exams as any further delay may result in completely disrupting the current academic session for lakhs of students.The biggest fallacy of the arguments advanced by those demanding the postponement of the exams is that by November, things are likely to improve on the coronavirus front. We may recall that many experts had opined that virus infection numbers would peak sometime in July or August. We are nearing the end of August and so far, we do not seem to have succeeded in reversing the corona curve. Who can predict that our country will become safe to conduct these exams in November? And if we fail to conduct these exams, then? Surely then the whole academic session will be jeopardised as there will hardly be sufficient time left to complete the academic session.The government of the day has the responsibility to weigh the pros and cons of the issue, see the problem in a holistic manner and take a call in the wider interest of the students and the country. The government has the primary responsibility to not only ensure the conduct of these exams but also the smooth running of educational institutions as well as the health and safety of all those who are going to appear in these exams and to further see that these exams do not in any way result in the further spread of the virus. There is no doubt that only the students are going to be the losers in case of curtailment or zero academic session. Keeping in mind all these factors , the government has to ensure that the exams are conducted in a fully-secure environment with no danger to the health of students and others. Almost six months into the pandemic, the country has learned to live with the virus.During the past few months, most economic activities barring the tourism industry, cinema halls etc. have been opened with some restrictions. Similarly, trains, buses, taxis, and other modes of travel have been allowed. Factories , shops , industrial units, offices have started functioning after following standard operating procedures. It is now confirmed by experts that wearing masks in public places is the surest way of avoiding getting infected, in addition to using sanitizers and maintaining physical distancing. The government has to ensure that all the students and organizers observe these precautions scrupulously.Let us remember that across the world, people have devised their own indigenous solutions for carrying on their activities in all walks of life, so we should also. As our Supreme court has rightly opined that the country has to carry on despite the pandemic and hence these exams. The time has come to move forward, in the larger interest of our nation, rising above narrow political gimmicks. “Jaan hai to jahan hai “ is an old saying , we have to ensure “Jaan bhi jahaan bhi”(VS Pandey is a former IAS officer.

29-08-2020||India||Blend of age, experience, merit could revive Congress||Only an organisational makeover that accommodates age, merit and experience can bridge the divide that has come to spook the Congress. Much of the media has shown the dissenting group as delivering a “letter bomb”. In reality, it was a distress flare gun meant to flag issues dogging the party. The intraparty fissures run deeper than can possibly be measured by outsiders. Their genesis is in myriad conflicts: egotistical, generational, temperamental, and ambition-driven. One side is in a hurry to arrive, the other disinclined to be cast aside. Nothing except a fine balance of competing interests will quell the discord. For the resentment the dissidents voiced has wider acceptance, including of those who made per forma statements of loyalty but with an eye on self-promotion. For that reason, the first appointments the party made after the heated August 24 Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting have been less than salutary. They’ve failed to dispel the notion of some in the party being more equal than others. Also Read: In poll-bound Bihar, Rahul Gandhi to address virtual rally; 100 online events plannedA low-profile MP saw a “shadow of the coming events” in the rejig in the Congress’s legislature parties in the two Houses of Parliament. A majority of the new inductees are either aligned with or are acceptable to what’s known as Team Rahul Gandhi. That’s true more of the Lok Sabha. In the Rajya Sabha, leading dissenters Ghulam Nabi Azad and Anand Sharma continue as leader and deputy leader of the Opposition. The equation there could change when Azad’s term in the Upper House ends early next year. One reason for the party’s state of suspended animation since the 2019 electoral debacle has been the emergence of a de facto power group. Claiming allegiance to Rahul Gandhi, this faction has sought an upper hand against rival claimants to positions in the party and in states where the Congress has governments. Also Read: Congress at its historic low, needs 24x7 leader, says Kapil SibalThe internecine tussle gave rise to a party-within-the-party; a parallel power structure that limited the space of the old guard and their set of young supporters. The result: a largely dysfunctional Congress under an ailing Sonia Gandhi who enjoyed wide respect but lacked the energy that helped her navigate it to power in 2004 and 2009. In the short run, the haemorrhage can be plugged through a representative advisory council the CWC decided to constitute to help Sonia Gandhi in the remaining period of her interim presidency. The envisioned panel’s inclusive character could keep the chasms from widening. That’s needed because the most unsettling fallout from the feud has been the Congress’s obsolescence, in terms of public perception, as an alternative to the Bharatiya Janata Party. It won elections in the interregnum, but not the popular trust to project itself as a viable democratic option. The authors of the much-debated letter seeking an organisational overhaul under an elected leader with a tangible presence could read the message -- and decided to alert the incumbent dispensation. They had their little nests to feather. They saw, nevertheless, the withering of the tree -- which is the Congress -- on which they were perched with the arriving sparrows of generational change. Be it as it may, several party functionaries consider the built-up friction more complex than a battle between the old and the young. They decode it as a pushback against relative beginners who have -- or pretend to hold – Rahul Ganshi’s power of attorney. Holding junior positions in the AICC set up, or as members of his inner circle, many among them have sought to “enhance their value without proving their worth”. These upcoming apparatchiks have for long been a subject of debate and criticism within the party. They’re often in disagreement with the seasoned players who, too, have been short on giving them room to groom. The dichotomy caused the party problems in Karnataka and Rajasthan at tremendous political cost. As much attributed to their inclination to play favourites are the nascent rebellions in Punjab and Chattisgarh. Till DK Shivakumar took over as the state party chief, it was difficult to discern as to who was the real PCC president, said a Bengaluru-based leader. Many veterans and their protégés have found themselves marked, marginalised or unwanted in the prevailing flux. The process has worked as much in the reverse. Can the hiatus be bridged within the span of the six months for which Sonia Gandhi has agreed to continue? The jury’s still out on that. The purpose with which she joined active politics in 1997-98 was to prevent the Congress’s disintegration under Sitaram Kesri. She cannot possibly let that objective unravel at this stage of her innings. A template that can help her address the diarchy was set by her husband Rajiv Gandhi, who forged a working relationship with leaders who owed their rise to his brother Sanjay. “It’s one piece of history from which all can learn,” said a CWC member. The letter-writers perhaps clumsily phrased a paragraph that came across as a farewell to the Gandhi family while mooting the idea of a collective leadership. The truth is that one cannot be at the expense of the other. There has to be opportunity for merit and regard for experience. In fact, many Congress men who dissociated themselves from the letter aren’t supportive of the work style of the “second line” aligned with Rahul. “Their behaviour leaves a lot to be desired,” bemoaned a senior leader. He was hopeful nevertheless of the ongoing debate having a sobering influence on those pushing boundaries and punching above their weight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/blend-of-age-experience-merit-could-revive-congress/story-V1oEC2Hx6WIbkZkrRFFjSK.html
29-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||This isn’t a plug for Abbott Laboratories as much as it is recognition of what the company’s new antigen test — $5, 15 minutes, simple, and highly accurate — represents at a generic level, for it is certain to be the first of many similar tests that all promise the same things. Low cost. High accuracy. Fast results. The very fact that I am celebrating these reflects what we have had to live with for the past eight months of the coronavirus disease. Tests that are complex (either in terms of testing requirements or expertise). Tests that are slow. And tests that are inaccurate. Those are the kind of trade-offs even people who understand testing have had to make. As for those that don’t, one test is as good as another — a behaviour exemplified by the Union health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), both of whom should know better, not bothering to enforce, or even issue guidelines on when which kind of test should be used.Antigen tests have been around for some time. They have always been relatively inexpensive. And they have always been quick. But they were also inaccurate when it came to so-called false negatives, or showing infected people as uninfected. This low specificity (the technical term for what are called true negatives, which means someone identified as uninfected in the test is actually uninfected) made them unreliable. Around the world, researchers, health care workers, and policymakers insisted that the right way to use them (if they had to be used) was to follow up a negative test with another antigen test or, preferably, a molecular test such as the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction, or RT-PCR, one.Where time is a constraint, the use of antigen tests makes sense. For instance, they can help isolate infected people quickly in containment zones, or hot spots of the virus. Where it isn’t, molecular tests must be used.The fact that most early antigen tests for Covid-19 were unreliable was worrying, but expected. Most people (including this writer) were convinced that the problem was a temporary one.Science (and Big Pharma) were sure to find an answer to this — testing is an area where we have made huge progress over the years. Ergo, it was only a matter of time before companies started launching accurate antigen tests. We now have one. And there is a very high likelihood that there will be many more. We may even have molecular tests that provide results within the hour.According to clinical studies, the specificity and sensitivity (ability to identify true positives, or an infected person as infected) of the Abbott antigen test is on par with that of molecular tests such as RT-PCR. For those interested in details, the Abbott test’s sensitivity is 97.1% and specificity 98.5%. That’s a big jump over the previous generation of antigen tests.There is a caveat, though: field performance of any test, even the RT-PCR one, rarely matches its clinical performance. There have been some high-profile instances of RT-PCR tests going wrong (and that is only to be expected; that some of these will go wrong is a mathematical possibility).Still, the new antigen test (currently launched only for the US), and those that will invariably follow, provide a near-perfect solution to testing. And by providing accurate results soon (the antigen tests being used in India provide results within the hour, but are not very accurate) they can help isolate infected people, regulate entry into offices, schools and colleges, public places, and public events – basically play a key role in the return to normalcy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-LWqQqSlP6PLVmTByuw08VI.html
29-08-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi says demonetisation, ‘flawed GST’, ‘failed’ lockdown hurt Indian economy||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday hit out at Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s remarks that the economy has been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic which is an ‘Act of God’, saying the Indian economy has been “destroyed” by three actions -- demonetisation, “flawed” GST and a “failed” lockdown. Sitharaman on Thursday said the economy has been hit by the pandemic, which is an ‘Act of God’, and it will see a contraction in the current fiscal. Tagging a news report on her remarks, Gandhi tweeted, “India’s economy has been destroyed by three actions: 1. Demonetisation 2. Flawed GST 3. Failed lockdown. Anything else is a lie.” The former Congress president has been critical of the Modi government in the handling of the economy over the past few years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-says-demonetisation-flawed-gst-failed-lockdown-hurt-indian-economy/story-TEG1NIJvLkZwJ4NzFztNxH.html
29-08-2020||India||To reach 40k Covid-19 tests target, Delhi govt clinics to stay open longer||The Delhi government will increase the working hours of its dispensaries and clinics by two hours so that more Covid-19 tests can be carried out, state health minister Satyendar Jain said on Friday, giving details about how the administration plans to ramp up a process that the chief minister has described as crucial for the city’s fight against the outbreak.The move was triggered by a consistent rise in the number of cases. The city added the most cases — 1,840 – in 48 days on Thursday. On Friday, this number was slightly lower at 1,808. Also Read: Maharashtra records over 14,000 Covid-19 cases for a third consecutive dayAfter becoming the first major region to register a sustained fall in cases, the national capital has seen an uptick this month, prompting chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday where it was decided that the rate of testing will be doubled from current levels to nearly 40,000 a day in the next week.“We have asked all our dispensaries and seed PUHC (Primary Urban Health Centre) to start testing patients between 9 am and 2 pm – for five hours instead of three hours it was being done before. This is where the numbers would be scaled up mainly,” Jain said on Friday. The administration has 265 dispensaries and clinics, in addition to major hospitals it runs.“All Delhi government hospitals are also testing people for Covid-19 between 9 am and 2 pm. And, it will be free of cost. Anyone can get tested, even if they just suspect that they might have it. Apart from that, testing within the community through mobile vans, camps and in containment zones is happening in addition to this. We have said 40,000 – if each of the fixed centres test 100 people a day, hospitals 200 people a day, and additional tests are done in the community – the numbers are not difficult to achieve,” said Jain. Also Read: Flouting Covid-19 norms in Metro may attract heavy fines once it reopensShortly after Wednesday’s announcement, government officials said the plan was to increase rapid antigen on-site tests and RT-PCR lab tests proportionally. The lab tests are considered more reliable, but take longer and cost more than the antigen tests. Antigen tests show results within 15-30 minutes, while the lab ones can take up to a day depending on the number of samples and machine capacity. The minister said the government had enough rapid antigen test kits and the approved laboratories have adequate RT-PCR kits to increase daily testing. On average, 18,361 samples were tested for Covid-19 in Delhi during the last seven days. The positivity rate – the proportion of people who tests positive among those tested – has also gone up through the month from an average of 5.7% during the last week of July to 8% during the last seven days. The plan to increase testing was briefly the subject of confrontation between the Delhi government and the Union home ministry (MHA). The health minister on Thursday wrote to MHA urging it not to interfere with the Kejriwal government’s decision to double testing. The MHA later tweeted that the allegation was “false and baseless”, prompting Jain to reply in a tweet: “I hope that the officers will comply with this msg from MHA. I am sure that the officers, who were reluctant to increase testing today, citing pressure from MHA, will immediately increase testing in Delhi.” In a statement, the MHA said that only technical guidance was sought from an expert committee in the note by principal health secretary Vikram Dev Dutt, which was cited by senior government officials to allege pressure from MHA. A copy of the note accessed by HT says, “Guidance may kindly be sought from the expert committee/ MHA on the following aspects: In light of the current Covid-19 situation and trajectory of cases in Delhi whether scaling up of testing numbers is to be done and if so, to what extent.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-reach-40k-tests-target-delhi-govt-clinics-to-stay-open-longer/story-X2dRhAkHjSN8zB975CSXnK.html
29-08-2020||India||Karnataka in talks to acquire Bharat Gold Mine land for industrial park||Karnataka is in talks with the Centre to explore the possibility of obtaining 3,200 acres of land from Bharat Gold Mines Ltd, in Kolar Gold Fields, to set up an industrial park in Kolar, said state’s large and medium scale industries minister Jagadish Shettar.BGML is a government of India enterprise and at one time was the largest gold producer in the famed Kolar Gold Fields but has been inoperational as the gold deposits in Kolar had become unremunerative to extract after nearly a century of operations.Shettar said he had held talks with Union minister for mines Pralhad Joshi in this regard. “We held talks with Union Minister Pralhad Joshi to obtain 3,200 acres of unused land at Bharat Gold Mines Ltd to set up an Industrial park in Kolar.”The availability of the land will be known in six months after a survey is undertaken by the mines and geology department to assess the presence of any natural resources. After the survey, if the land parcel does not possess any natural resources, then Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB) shall obtain the land from the ministry with necessary approvals to set up an Industrial park. The land, he said, is strategically located at 90kms from the Bengaluru airport, 260 km from Chennai Port, 314 km from Krishnapatnam port.The state minister further said that the New Industrial Policy 2020-2025 launched recently would help to build a prosperous Karnataka and create large-scale employment opportunities. “This industrial policy is very forward-looking and brings with it several incentives and regulatory reforms such as land access and labour market regulation,” he said.Promoting economic and industrial development of the state, he said, has always been a top priority for the government.Amid Covid-19 pandemic and months of stringent lockdown, Karnataka has attracted investments worth Rs 31,676 crore in the last five months which is expected to generate 65,459 direct employment opportunities, said Shettar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-in-talks-to-acquire-bharat-gold-mine-land-for-industrial-park/story-vggbzXtb5jg3W23w3Ghm9J.html
29-08-2020||India||Delhi riots: ED granted custody of Tahir Hussain for six days||A Delhi court on Friday sent suspended Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain to six days Enforcement Directorate (ED) custody in connection with an alleged case of money laundering related to the Delhi riots. Police have accused Hussain of hatching a conspiracy to orchestrate the riots, and of arranging funds for the same.The six-day custody order came after the agency moved the court seeking 14 days remand. In its remand application, the ED alleged Hussain had laundered money and also accused him of cheating, falsification of documents and criminal conspiracy.The ED told the court they had conducted searches at various premises and seized several incriminating documents. It said it had recorded statements of various persons under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and WhatsApp chats, bogus invoices and other incriminating documents have been recovered.“Accused has entered into a criminal conspiracy by fraudulently transferring money from the accounts of many company. The money so obtained are proceeds of crime which were then used for committing other various scheduled offences,” the ED said while also contending that the accused has not co-operated in the investigation and has been evasive in his replies.The agency is probing Hussain’s role in allegedly mobilising funds during the riots in February. Police and ED have accused Hussain of laundering around Rs 1.10 crore using shell companies to fuel protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the riots. Police have said Hussain mobilised funds to buy ammunition and get more rioters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suspended-aap-councillor-tahir-hussain-sent-to-6-days-ed-custody/story-2XAG7ydDQ9fX7vFGGe202O.html
29-08-2020||India||Delhi HC stays broadcast of Sudarshan News programme after plea by Jamia students||The Delhi high court on Friday stayed the proposed broadcast of a show titled “Bindas Bol” by Sudarshan News after former and current students of Jamia Milia Islamia, filed a plea seeking a ban on the telecast. This came even as the Supreme Court on Friday declined to impose a pre-broadcast ban on the channel from airing the programme. The show concerned Muslims entering civil services, which the channel allegedly likened to “infiltration” and “Jihad”.The plea alleged the show was an attempt to “defame, attack and incite hatred” against Jamia Milia Islamia, its alumni and the Muslim community at large. The HC stayed the broadcast until September 7.Justice Navin Chawla also issued a notice to the ministry of information and broadcasting (I&B) on the plea filed through advocate Shadan Farasat contending that the trailer of the show has “openly engaged” in hate speech.Appearing for the I&B ministry, advocate Anurag Alhuwalia, the central government’s standing counsel, accepted the notice, following which the matter was posted for hearing on September 7.The petition said the proposed broadcast along with the trailer violates the programme code set out under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, read with the Cable Television Networks Rules 1994.“The proposed broadcast and trailer also constitute hate speech and criminal defamation and is an offence under Sections 153A (1), 153B(1), 295A and 499 of the Indian Penal Code,” the plea read. After the order was passed, the show that was supposed to be telecast was not aired. Instead, Suresh Chavanke, Suresh Chavanke, editor and CMD, Sudarshan News, conducted another show where he accused Jamia Milia Islamia students and alumni of using the court to get the show stopped. He said the order was passed when he was not present, and will urge the court to allow him to broadcast the show on the next date. “I am doing the show but I will not discuss the issues the court has restrained me from talking about. I ask the people of Jamia to face me directly rather than going to the court,” he said on Friday’s show.SC declines stay An apex court bench headed by justice DY Chandrachud said the court has to be cautious in imposing a prior restraint on publication or the airing of views and cannot prevent airing of a programme based on an unverified transcript of a 49-second clip.“At this stage, we have desisted from imposing a pre-broadcast interlocutory injunction on the basis of an unverified transcript of a forty nine second clip. The court has to be circumspect in imposing a prior restraint on publication or the airing of views. We note that under statutory provisions, competent authorities are vested with powers to ensure compliance with law, including provisions of the criminal law intended to ensure social harmony and the peaceful coexistence of all communities,” the bench which also comprised justice KM Joseph said.The top court issued notice to central government, Press Council of India, Sudarshan News and News Broadcasters Association and posted the case for further consideration in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-stays-broadcast-of-sudarshan-news-programme-after-plea-by-jamia-students/story-8oXMI5Kweu5iy84cHrRfjN.html
29-08-2020||India||SC upholds UGC order, backs final-year exams||Colleges and universities cannot award degrees to students without conducting final-year or final-term examinations, the Supreme Court said on Friday, upholding a decision by the University Grants Commission (UGC) that called for completing the evaluation process across the country by September 30. At the same time, the court made it clear that states were empowered to take decisions under the Disaster Management (DM) Act, 2005, to postpone final-year or final-semester exams beyond the September-end deadline. It allowed states to approach UGC for new dates that have to be communicated to them “at the earliest”. The ruling by a three-judge bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan is significant because it appears to have established finality as far as holding exams for final-year and final-term students are concerned. A large section of students protested UGC’s July 6 order mandating the exams — online, offline or by using a combination of both — and states such as Delhi and Maharashtra announced scrapping them in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and the health risks it poses. The court was hearing seven petitions against the UGC’s decision to hold exams and three pleas seeking compliance by states with the UGC move. “The guidelines dated July 6, 2020, as well as Standard Operating Procedures for conduct of examinations circulated by UGC vide letter dated July 8, 2020, clearly shows deep concern with the health of all stakeholders, i.e., students as well as the exam functionaries. Challenge to the guidelines on the ground of it being violative of (right to life under) Article 21 is repelled,” the court said, referring to safety guidelines advocating social distancing during the conduct of physical exams. The bench, also comprising justices R Subash Reddy and MR Shah, said decisions by some states under the Disaster Management Act will prevail over the deadline set by UGC since the legislation “empowers states to take measures for prevention and mitigation of disaster”. The Disaster Management Act has been enforced across the country in the wake of the pandemic. It empowers the Union government and states governments to frames policies, formulate plans, and take measures for prevention and mitigation of disasters, including relaxations and restrictions on businesses and activities. “No state shall permit health of its subject to be compromised that is why overriding power has been given to the State Disaster Management Authority and the State Government (under the Disaster Management Act) with regard to any inconsistency with any other law for the time being in force,” the court said. But that did not mean states could go to the extent of promoting final-year students on the basis of previous performances and internal assessment while not holding final year exams, the three-judge bench said. “The prayer to quash the guidelines dated July 6, 2020, issued by UGC is refused,” the judgment read. Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ welcomed the order. “Let’s us keep politics away from education but make politics more educated,” he tweeted.Alakh Alok Srivastava, the counsel for one of the petitioners who argued against holding examinations, said the court left it to the states to decide the course of action. “The Supreme Court has recorded most of my legal submissions... States have also been authorised to postpone the exams. I will sincerely request state governments to go for online and home-based final year exams,” he told HT. Supreme Court lawyer Haris Beeran said the ruling acknowledged that the power of states under the Disaster Management Act will prevail over UGC guidelines as far as the date of holding examinations was concerned. “The court has balanced it with the UGC’s powers by saying that states cannot go beyond their jurisdiction and do away with exams altogether and replace it with internal assessment,” Beeran told HT. The Delhi government did not comment on the matter.Maharashtra higher and technical education minister Uday Samant said his government respected the verdict and will decide about holding examinations after consultations with vice-chancellors of universities. “We will study the verdict in detail and then take appropriate actions,” he said. “We need to give priority to students’ health as well. In the current situation, students should not catch any infection if exams are conducted,” he added. UGC’s order on holding final-term exams across about 900 universities in the country triggered a storm with a section of students demanding the scrapping of examinations in view of the pandemic. In the top court, multiple petitioners also argued that online exams will not be feasible for many who do not have access to high-speed internet. Petitioners urged the court to declare results based on students’ past performance or internal assessment. But UGC argued that degrees cannot be conferred without examinations; that it alone was empowered to take a call on whether or not the exams can take place or should be cancelled; that the decision to conduct exams was in the interest of a large number of students; and that not holding the exams will badly impact the academic future of students. The higher education regulator first published guidelines on April 29 for holding exams in the time of Covid-19. The guidelines — based on a report by an expert committee headed by RC Kuhad, the chairperson of the Central University of Haryana —mandated the exams be held by July. In June, UGC requested the expert committee to revisit the guidelines in view of the evolving pandemic situation. Finally, the fresh guidelines were issued on July 6. While schools and colleges have been closed since March-end, the Union government has allowed colleges and universities to open for the conduct of final-year examinations. “A degree which is obtained after passing the required exam is acceptable globally. The Supreme Court order has also made this aspect clear,” Kuhad said on the Supreme Court order.In the court, students were represented by senior lawyers such as Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Shyam Divan and Jaideep Gupta as well as advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta represented UGC while additional solicitor general SV Raju put forth the case of the Centre. Senior advocate PS Narasimha supported the Centre by representing a bunch of students in favour of holding the examinations. “It is a fair decision of the Supreme Court because it is concerned about the credibility of assessment done by the universities for the award of degrees. In the absence of this credibility, the degree loses its value,” said educationist and former UGC member Inder Mohan Kapahy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-upholds-ugc-order-backs-final-year-exams/story-2JrxQIvFIdTnndX6zZb4qL.html
29-08-2020||India||World Bank’s ‘Doing Business Report’ on hold over data fudging concerns||The World Bank has put on hold the publication of its ‘Doing Business Report’, which carries the Ease of Doing Business (EODB) Rankings, over alleged irregularities in the underlying data., the Bank said in a statement.The effective suspension of the publication of the rankings has been announced in the wake of a number of reported irregularities regarding changes to data in the 2018 and 2020 reports published in October 2017 and October 2019. In a statement on Thursday, the Bank said it was conducting a “systematic review and assessment of data changes that occurred subsequent to the institutional data review process for the last five Doing Business reports”. “We have asked the World Bank Group’s independent Internal Audit function to perform an audit of the processes for data collection and review for Doing Business and the controls to safeguard data integrity,” it added.The culmination of this process will be followed by a retrospective correction in the rankings, the statement said. “The Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank has been briefed on the situation as have the authorities of the countries that were most affected by the data irregularities.”The Union ministries of finance and commerce did not respond to email queries on the effective suspension of the rankings.But officials from the two ministries, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the Bank may have briefly paused the publication but not ended it, and a review would make it more robust and credible. They added this would neither halt nor deter India’s commitment towards Ease of Doing Business. In fact, India has gone a step further in striving to achieve Ease of Living, the officials said.“For example, just see reforms in tax administration. The Prime Minister recently unveiled faceless assessment system in the income-tax matters to curb corruption and released, for the first time, a taxpayers’ charter. Next month, faceless appeal system will be introduced. All these are part of ongoing reform aimed at Ease of Living for the common man, which will also benefit businesses,” said one of the officials on condition of anonymity.A second official said wide-ranging reforms have been introduced for the Ease of Business keeping both agriculture and industry in mind. “Farmers have been unshackled now so that they can sell their produce to lucrative markets. The commerce and industry ministry is considering introducing a technology-based single-window system soon that would ensure expeditious multiple regulatory approvals at both the Central and state levels from one point. Reforms are ongoing and not dependent on the ranking of the Ease of Doing Business.”The policy regime in India places a lot of importance on the rankings. After assuming power in 2014, the Narendra Modi government set a target for India to be among top 50 countries in the rankings. In 2014, India was ranked 142nd. It jumped to the 63rd position among 190 countries in May 2019.The rankings are based on a country’s performance on 10 indicators: starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency.This is not the first time the rankings are courting controversy. In 2018, Paul Romer, the then chief economist of the World Bank, quit after criticising the rankings in an interview with The Wall Street Journal for having “conveyed the wrong information” about the business environment in Chile. According to a Reuters story, Romer told the newspaper the decline resulted from methodological changes, rather than a deterioration of Chile’s business environment, and may have been the result of the World Bank staff’s political motivations.In his book, “The Rise and Fall of Nations: The Rules of Change in Post-Crisis World”, Ruchir Sharma, the chief global strategist and head of the emerging markets equity team at Morgan Stanley, criticised these rankings, saying they were “vulnerable to political manipulation and marketing”.”More than a few countries have started hiring consultants to help them raise their rankings... In 2012, President Vladimir Putin set a goal of raising Russia’s rank for ‘ease of doing business’ from 120 to top 20 within six years, and he soon saw results. By 2015, Russia was ranked at 51, more than thirty places ahead of China, and sixty places ahead of Brazil and India. That raised a question: If it was so easy to do business in Russia, why wasn’t anyone doing business there?” he wroteOther scholars have also criticised these rankings. A 2016 Indian Institute of Management Bangalore working paper by Vivek Moorthy and A Arul Jason argued the rankings cannot capture the true cost of doing business in countries with a large unorganised sector. Another 2019 paper by Sabyasachi Kar and others argued the fundamental premise of the rankings, that rules are the be all and end all of Ease of Doing Business in a country, might not be true.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-bank-report-on-hold-over-data-fudging-concerns/story-rAGvwoTLx922fhag2MgH8K.html
29-08-2020||India||Centre notifies distribution of power between L-G, govt in Jammu and Kashmir||The police, civil services and the anti-corruption bureau of Jammu and Kashmir will be under the Lieutenant Governor, the Union government said in a notification that now delineates roles and responsibilities between the Centre-appointed functionary and future legislators in a region that was turned from a full-fledged state into a Union Territory last year. The rules of “transaction of business” were notified by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla under the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 and stated that if the L-G and the council of ministers (whenever a government is formed in the UT) differ on any issue, the former is required to refer the matter to the President. The L-G is then required to act according to the decision taken by the President. The arrangement is similar to the set-up in Delhi, also a Union Territory, in terms of who controls police, IAS and IPS postings and the ACB. The national capital has been the ground for multiple confrontations between the elected government and the administrative structure headed by the L-G.The gazette notification said that the J&K L-G, on the advice of the chief minister (when elected), shall allot portfolios among the ministers by assigning one or more departments. The council of ministers shall be collectively responsible for all executive orders issued by any department in the name of the L-G and contracts made in the name of the President in connection with the administration of the UT, it added.The notification said there will be 39 departments in the Union territory, including agriculture, school education, higher education, horticulture, floriculture, election, general administration, home, mining, power, PWD, transport and tribal affairs.The erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir had a special status in the Union of India under Article 370 of the Constitution. The piece of the law was abrogated on August 5, 2019 and subsequently, the state was bifurcated into Union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. The Union territories came into existence on October 31 last year.Thursday’s notification said all communications received from the Centre, including those from the Prime Minister and Union ministers, other than those of a routine or unimportant character, shall, as soon as possible after their receipt, be submitted by the secretary to the chief secretary, the minister in-charge, the chief minister and the L-G.Any matter, which is likely to bring the government of the UT into a controversy with the Centre or a state government, shall, as soon as possible, be brought to the notice of the L-G and the chief minister by the secretary concerned through the chief secretary, the notification said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-notifies-distribution-of-power-between-l-g-govt-in-j-k/story-JXIKiy5nUqewrRjut6TaLO.html
29-08-2020||India||Don’t conduct parallel trial, PCI tells media outlets||The Press Council of India (PCI) expressed displeasure at the manner in which several media organisations have covered the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput and advised them to follow the norms.In a statement issued on Friday, the PCI said that it had noted with “distress that coverage of the alleged suicide by a film actor by many media outlets is in violation of the Norms of Journalistic Conduct and, therefore, advises the Media to adhere to the Norms framed by the Press Council of India”.The media, the council said, should not narrate the story in a manner so as to induce the general public to believe in the complicity of the person indicted.“Publishing information based on gossip about the line of investigation by the official agencies on the crime committed is not desirable. It is not advisable to vigorously report crime related issues on a day to day basis and comment on the evidence without ascertaining the factual matrix. Such reporting brings undue pressure in the course of fair investigation and trial,” the PCI said.The death of the actor, who starred in films like Kai Po Che and the MS Dhoni biopic, has received wide coverage, especially in the electronic media. “The media is advised to refrain from giving excessive publicity to the victim, witnesses, suspects and accused as it will amount to invasion of their privacy rights. Identification of witnesses by the Media needs to be avoided as it endangers them to come under pressure from the accused or his associates as well as investigating agencies,” the PCI said.The media is advised not to conduct its own parallel trial or foretell the decision to avoid pressure during investigation and trial, it added.“Further, the reporting of the alleged suicide by the actor by some of the newspapers is also in violation of the norms formulated by the Council for reporting on suicide. The norm prohibits publishing stories about suicide prominently and advises the media not to unduly repeat such stories. The media is expected not to use language which sensationalise or normalises suicides or presents it as a constructive solution to the problems,” the council said in the statement.The media is advised not to use sensational headlines or use photographs, video-footage or social media links while reporting on suicide cases, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-conduct-parallel-trial-pci-tells-media-outlets/story-nAjTzaeF55KtoBdXrs227J.html
29-08-2020||India||Sushant case: Rhea, brother quizzed for first time by CBI||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) began questioning actor Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik Chakraborty on Friday in the case of Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. Rajput’s flatmate and creative manager Siddharth Pithani, cook Neeraj Singh and domestic help Keshav Bachner, too, were questioned for the fourth consecutive day at the DRDO guest house in Santacruz (East) on Friday. Meanwhile, Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials issued summons to a Goa-based hotelier, Gaurav Arya, and have called him for questioning on Monday in a parallel probe into allegations of money laundering related to the Rajput case. Arya runs Hotel Tamarind and Café Cotinga in Goa.ED officials visited Hotel Tamarind at Anjuna, a coastal village in north Goa, but found the property shut. They stuck a notice on the door of the hotel, which, according to officials, has been shut since lockdown restrictions were enforced in March to contain the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak.The notice stated that Arya must meet Rajiv Kumar, assistant director, ED, at 11am on Monday in connection with a case filed under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.Arya has also been booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, and is being investigated by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). The NCB had on Wednesday registered a first information report (FIR) against Rhea, Showik, talent manager Jaya Saha, Rajput’s former manager Shruti Modi and Arya under sections 20, 22, 27 and 29 of the NDPS Act. Arya’s name cropped up in Rhea’s WhatsApp conversations related to drugs. ED officials, however, refused to divulge details of whether there were any financial transactions between Arya and Rajput, or Chakraborty. On Thursday, the ED questioned Saha and also summoned Rhea’s father, Indrajeet Chakraborty, to access his family’s bank lockers in the Vakola branch of Axis Bank.Rajput, 34, was found dead in his Bandra flat on June 14. The post-mortem report concluded he died by suicide. After a two-week quiet, a controversy erupted over the death, as a Bihar police team constituted to probe the case on a complaint by the actor’s family alleged it got no cooperation from its Mumbai counterparts. The probe was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) by the Supreme Court.Chakraborty, who has been questioned multiple times by the agencies, has denied all allegations levelled against her.Meanwhile, the Maharashtra unit of the Congress demanded an investigation into an alleged nexus between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and filmmaker Sandeep Ssingh in connection with Rajput’s death. The BJP hit back questioning why the Maharashtra police overlooked the “drug dealing angle” to the case and whether they were trying to shield some political leaders from the ruling Congress, Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) alliance.When HT called Singh for a comment, his phone was switched off, and he had not responded to a message till the time of going to press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-case-rhea-brother-quizzed-for-first-time-by-cbi/story-zMqpbT3ZOiYWa7KjITr8cJ.html
29-08-2020||India||Rainiest August in 44 yrs, 25% excess over the usual||India this year has recorded the rainiest August in 44 years, data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) shows, filling up agricultural reservoirs and recharging groundwater across large parts of the country in what could help the prospects of farmers for the next cropping season. According to the data, there was an overall 25% excess rain in August across India, a level not seen since 1976 when the country received 28.4% more rain than is usual for this time of the year. Districts in central India, the southern peninsula and in the west are now in severely or extremely wet categories, as measured by the standard precipitation index (SPI) for the cumulative monsoon period since June 1.“More wet districts are a sign that it’s a good year for agriculture and groundwater recharge. The rainwater harvesting potential is also huge for these districts and this will also ensure more water availability until next year,” said Pulak Guhathakurta, head, climate application and user interface, climate research and services at IMD Pune.SPI is an index used for drought monitoring. Many parts of northwest India and east India remain in dry and moderately dry categories. Also Read: Water level at Barvi dam rises; Thane collector issues alertThe largest excess rain recorded in the month of August till now has been in 1926 at 33%. Overall monsoon rain this year is 8% excess so far, with 23% excess rain over south peninsula; 16% excess over central India; 12% deficient over north-west India, and 4% excess over east and north-east India. The monsoon season runs from beginning of June to September end.The Central Water Commission’s (CWC) storage position of dams now shows that 34 of 49 reservoirs are at 90% capacity.“For most districts, except a few in Gujarat which are inundated, rain has been good for agriculture. This will give a boost to agriculture in the coming Rabi season also. Except Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and west Uttar Pradesh where rains are deficient, rest are in excess or normal category,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology, Skymet Weather.IMD in its weekly update on Friday said there will be above average rains at least for the week till September 3 but rains are likely to reduce thereafter.Also Read: Heavy rain in Noida lead to water-logging, traffic snarls; more rain likely Monday nightAs on Friday, there is a well-marked low-pressure area over north Chhattisgarh adjoining East Madhya Pradesh. It is very likely to move west-north-west across north Madhya Pradesh and south Uttar Pradesh during next 2 days and weaken gradually, the IMD said in its Friday morning bulletin.The western end of the monsoon trough – a band of low pressure -- is at its near normal position that stretches from Ganganagar to Bay of Bengal, while the eastern end is a south of its normal position. The western end is likely to remain along its normal position during next 2 days and shift northwards to the foothills of Himalayas for the subsequent 4-5 days. Due to favourable conditions, widespread rain with very heavy rain is likely over Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh on August 28; over West Madhya Pradesh on 28 and 29; over Gujarat state and Konkan and Goa on August 29. Widespread and extremely heavy rain is very likely over east Madhya Pradesh on August 28, while heavy rain is also likely over northwest India including Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi on August 28 and 29. IMD scientists have warned of mudslides and flooding in parts of central India since the soil is already saturated in the regions.“After a peculiar July when no low pressure system developed over Bay of Bengal, five low pressure systems developed over Bay of Bengal in August. Two of them moved upto south Rajasthan bringing heavy rain continuously in its way,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at national weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rainiest-august-in-44-yrs-25-excess-over-the-usual/story-PGrxUOoF2QUPNz1p1DNpEI.html
29-08-2020||India||Jaishankar attacks Pak for sheltering terrorists||New Delhi External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Friday criticised Pakistan for portraying itself as a victim of terror while grudgingly acknowledging the presence of wanted terrorists and crime leaders on its territory due to sustained international pressure. Jaishankar did not name Pakistan in his remarks while presiding over the Darbari Seth memorial lecture, but there was no doubt as to which country he was referring to. He described the 9/11 terror attacks in the US and the Covid-19 pandemic as “stand-out moments that disrupted the trajectory of human society”. Nineteen years after the 9/11 attacks and 12 years since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the world has a range of mechanisms to counter terrorism, including the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), several UN sanctions committees and the Counter Terrorism Executive Directorate, he said. However, it lacks a comprehensive convention on international terrorism as members of the UN are still “wrestling with certain foundational principles”, he added. “All the while states that have turned the production of terrorists into a primary export have attempted, by dint of bland denials, to paint themselves also as victims of terror,” Jaishankar said, a clear reference to Pakistan’s use of terrorism as an instrument of state policy. “But as we have seen last week, sustained pressure through international mechanisms to prevent the movement of funds for terror groups and their front agencies can work. It has eventually compelled a state complicit in aiding, abetting, training and directing terror groups and associated criminal syndicates to grudgingly acknowledge the presence of wanted terrorists and organised crime leaders on its territory,” he said. Weeks ahead of an expected assessment of Pakistan’s counterterror financing regime, Islamabad issued two notifications on August 18 to enforce UN Security Council sanctions on hundreds of terrorist individuals and entities, including Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Saeed, Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar and Dawood Ibrahim. One of the documents listed three addresses in Karachi for Ibrahim, wanted by India for his role in the 1993 Mumbai bombings. After the issue was widely reported in the Indian media, Pakistan’s foreign ministry said in a statement the notifications didn’t amount to “Pakistan admitting to the presence of certain listed individuals on its territory”. Jaishankar acknowledged the “struggle against terror and those who aid and abet it is a work in progress”. He said, “It remains for the international system to create the necessary mechanisms to shut down the structures that support and enable terrorism, whether in South Asia or across the globe.” The world, he said, also faces a structural challenge in improving the global architecture used to fight pandemics. In similar crises over the past century, the outbreaks occurred in remote sites or the monitoring systems managed to head off a crisis. “This time, however, the international warning systems, reporting protocols and response mechanisms were unable to prevent the spread beyond ground zero,” he said. This has highlighted the need for a more enlightened and responsive multilateral system, and a “new, inclusive and non-transactional approach to multilateralism”, he said. “The reform of international organisations is not merely desirable but imperative. We need to modernise the international system, step by step, to make it fit for purpose, beginning by making each entity relevant to the age in which we live, not when it was created,” he added. This will require revisiting membership and structures of control, reorienting operational principles and rules, and rebuilding resourcing channels of key pillars of multilateralism, Jaishankar said. Strengthening skill sets and creating a better enabling environment are the goals of the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” campaign since India can make a difference at the global level only by scaling up its capacities, he said. The spirit of local action for global outcomes is reflected in India’s work with France to create the International Solar Alliance, whose framework agreement has so far been ratified by 67 countries, and the launch of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, Jaishankar said. The memorial lecture was delivered by UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutteres, who said India has all the ingredients for exerting leadership at home and abroad. He added the drivers are poverty alleviation and universal energy access – two of India’s top priorities. “Scaling up clean energy, particularly solar, is the recipe for solving both. Investments in renewable energy, clean transport and energy efficiency during the recovery from the pandemic could extend electricity access to 270 million people worldwide – fully a third of people that currently lack it,” he said. He added, “These same investments could help create nine million jobs annually over the next three years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-attacks-pak-for-sheltering-terrorists/story-L6Jol8Vmr1yRawObFzzTCN.html
29-08-2020||India||IAF to formally induct Rafale jets on Sept 10||The Indian Air Force (IAF) will formally induct Rafale fighters at the Ambala air base on September 10 in presence of defence minister Rajnath Singh, officials familiar with the matter said on Friday. India has also invited Singh’s French counterpart, Florence Parly, to attend the ceremony, they added.Five Rafale fighters of the 36 ordered arrived at the airbase on July 29, ending IAF’s wait for new fighter jets to sharpen its combat potential. IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria and other senior air force officers were present when the jets arrived, but a formal induction ceremony was reserved for another day.The arrival of the jets coincided with the ongoing India-China border tensions in Ladakh.Shortly after they landed last month, the defence minister said the fighters would enhance the IAF’s capabilities and deter any threat to the country. He said those who want to threaten India’s territorial integrity should be worried about the new capability.Singh, who had travelled to France last year to formally receive the first fighter jet, showered praises on the multi-role aircraft for its capabilities, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the decision to buy 36 fighter jets.The Rafale fighters will significantly enhance IAF’s offensive capabilities and be a game changer with their advanced weaponry, high-tech sensors, superior radar for detection and tracking of targets and ability to carry an impressive payload, experts say.The jet is capable of carrying out a variety of missions — ground and sea attack, air defence and air superiority, reconnaissance and nuclear strike deterrence.“I would like to add, if it is anyone who should be worried about or critical about this new capability of the Indian Air Force, it should be those who want to threaten our territorial integrity,” Rajnath had tweeted and posted in a video of the Rafale jets landing at the Ambala base.They are part of the IAF’s 17 Squadron also known as the Golden Arrows. The aircrew that brought them to India was headed by Group Captain Harkirat Singh, a decorated fighter pilot, who is the commanding officer of the squadron.The aircraft covered a distance of nearly 8,500 km from France to India. The first stage of the flight covered a distance of 5,800 km from Merignac to Al Dhafra (UAE). The second covered over 2,700 km from Al Dhafra to Ambala.The new fighters are the first imported jets to be inducted into the IAF in 23 years after the Russian Sukhoi-30 jets entered service in June 1997.The IAF ordered 36 Rafale jets from France as part of a government-to-government deal worth ~59,000 crore in September 2016. They have been specially tailored for IAF.The Rafale weaponry includes Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, Mica multi-mission air-to-air missiles and Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles. The weapons allow fighter pilots to attack air and ground targets from standoff ranges and fill a significant capability gap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-will-induct-rafale-jets-at-ambala-base-on-sept-10/story-pPcemNoAKgsxKVQbfGCt3I.html
29-08-2020||India||IT panel drops J-K internet restrictions from its agenda||Parliament’s panel on information technology dropped on Friday the issue of internet shutdowns in Jammu and Kashmir after Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla sent a letter to chairpersons of all House panels to not take up issues pending before courts. Panel members told Hindustan Times that a message with a “partially” modified agenda was circulated among those in the committee that mentioned Bihar and Delhi internet shutdowns, but left out Jammu and Kashmir. Hindustan Times has viewed the message. The panel was scheduled to hear from home ministry and telecommunications officials as well as representatives from Bihar, Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir on September 1. However, on Friday, the message made no mention of Jammu and Kashmir.Hindustan Times on August 25 reported that Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla had written to the chairpersons of all parliamentary panels to select subjects following parliamentary rules and conventions, including not taking up subjects that are pending examination by courts. “The Committees should give due consideration to rule 270 and other necessary rules and directions while selecting subjects for examination,” Birla said in a letter, accessed by the Hindustan Times. “In addition, I would like to point out that as per convention, the Committees do not take those subjects for examination where the issue is pending in the Courts.”Also Read: Pakistani court sentences 3 aides of Hafiz SaeedAccording to rule 270, “A Committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records, provided that if any question arises whether the evidence of a person or the production of a document is relevant for the purposes of the Committee, the question shall be referred to the Speaker whose decision shall be final”.Moreover, the rule adds that the government may decline to produce a document on the grounds that its disclosure would be prejudicial to the safety or interest of the state.The Supreme Court is still considering the matter of internet shutdowns in Jammu and Kashmir. While the next hearing has not been notified, on August 11 the Centre had told the court that it will be restore 4G internet services in the newly formed Union territory in a staggered manner after August 15.A day after the speaker’s letter, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey had written to panel chairperson Shashi Tharoor to cancel the meeting since the agenda was in contravention of the rules. Hindustan Times reached out to Tharoor for a comment but did not get a response till press time. The panel, however, is still slated to hear from Facebook about reports that its India policy head Ankhi Das allegedly acted in a manner favourable to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party by not censoring hate speech by some of its members. “We were never against calling Facebook for an explanation,” said BJP MP and IT panel member Nishikant Dubey. “We just said that the proper procedure should be followed. Now permission from the speaker has been obtained.”According to former Lok Sabha secretary general PDT Achary, the committee can take a decision to drop a subject any time.“If the committee feels that a the subject need not be considered, they can drop it from the agenda,” said Achary. “We should still like to hear the facts from the government, even if we don’t have a discussion on Jammu and Kashmir,” said an IT panel member on the condition of anonymity. “A statement has been allowed in the past. It should not be against the rules.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-panel-drops-j-k-internet-restrictions-from-its-agenda/story-9dK6JXpx9i3QIUY7h4OFiI.html
29-08-2020||India||New moth species found, another rediscovered after 100 years in Arunachal||A group of five butterfly and moth researchers have found a new moth species and rediscovered another not seen in India in over a century at the Tale Wildlife Sanctuary (TWS) in Arunachal Pradesh. The researchers, two from Dehradun-based Titli Trust, two from Bengaluru-based National Centre for Biological Sciences and one from Pune found the two species in August last year. The findings were published this week in Zootaxa, a peer-reviewed scientific journal for animal taxonomists in Auckland, New Zealand. “The new moth species that we discovered belongs to the rare genus ‘Metallolophia’, of which only 16 species are known globally and three in India. We have named it ‘Metallolophia taleensis’ after the Tale wildlife sanctuary where it was discovered,” said Sanjay Sondhi of Titli Trust. According to the article published in Zootaxa, ‘Metallolophia taleensis’ can be distinguished from other species in the same genus by the presence of prominent oval black-edged oval green spot on upperside forewing and smaller spot on hindwing. The new species, of which the researchers collected two specimens, has been recorded at the Tale wildlife sanctuary only in the month of August so far. It has not been seen at any other location in any other month. Nothing is known about its life history yet. The researchers also collected three specimens of ‘Metallolophia opalina’, another species of the same genus, from the Tale wildlife sanctuary in August last year. Two specimens of the species were last seen in Sikkim in 1886 and 1889. The species was also seen in Nepal in 1893. “The three species of ‘Metallolophia opalina’, collected from the Tale wildlife sanctuary in Lower Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh, represent the first published record of this species from India since its original description and extend its known range eastwards by over 900 km,” said the Zootaxa article.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-moth-species-found-another-rediscovered-after-100-years-in-arunachal/story-RlAAWa6qhWWYUxgGDaamnJ.html
29-08-2020||India||Birla requests MPs to get tested before Parl session||New Delhi: Taking no chances against the coronavirus disease that has infected around 3.5 million people across India, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla announced on Friday all MPs would be requested to undergo an RT-PCR ( Reverse transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction) test for Covid-19 as part of a raft of health and safety measures to conduct the monsoon session of Parliament amid the pandemic. The session will start on September 14 and run till October 1. Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha are all set to operate in daily shifts with the Lower House starting at 9 am and the Upper House at 3pm. A senior official added that the proceedings may even continue on the weekends if the agenda requires additional time. The RT-PCR test, considered the gold-standard for coronavirus testing, will not be made mandatory for now, said a second senior official on condition of anonymity.On Friday, Birla held a meeting with officials from the Union health ministry, Indian Council of Medical Research, Defence Research and Development Organisation and Delhi government to decide health safety protocols for the session that was shifted from its usual July schedule to a later date. This is the first time since 1952 that a Parliament session will meet amid a health emergency of such magnitude requiring massive preparation and several restrictive measures. “Parliament must function and infection must not spread”, Birla announced, as he laid down several key steps including a ban on the entry of visitors and a reduction in the number of officials during the session. “Along with this, there is a proposal to restrict the number of media persons, both from Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. Covid [RT-PCR] test will be mandatory for all media persons,” a communique said. While the Houses will have ultraviolet germicidal irradiation of the air-conditioning system, 10 display screens for live proceedings, placards to indicate names of parties, earmarked seats for top leaders and special cables linking the two Houses, thermal guns and thermal scanner cameras will be used for measurement of temperature at entry points in Parliament complex. For the first time, MPs of two Houses would be seated in both Houses, occupying the chambers as well as the galleries to ensure strict social distancing. Measures for sanitisation include touchless sanitizers at 40 places, an emergency medical teams and ambulances . All guidelines related to Covid-19 prevention will be strictly followed, said the secretariat. The Parliament complex will also have health check-up facilities and the session will be conducted with all necessary health safety arrangements. Birla said testing facility for officers and staff of Parliament will also be in place. “The staff may be reduced, if required. The facilities for testing of officials of ministries and personal staff of members will also be in place,” said a press release. Members will be allowed to address the Chair while seated, so that the risk of infection is minimised. A number of state assemblies have already conducted truncated sessions. Uttar Pradesh and Punjab made RT-PCR tests mandatory while Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh did not. Bihar conducted rapid antigen tests while Haryana asked MLAs to produce Covid -19 negative report not older than three days.The Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh has recommended a total of 18 sittings, which would be primarily used to clear 11 ordinances. The government is also bracing for a demand from Opposition parties to debate the India-China standoff at the Line of Actual Control, the spread of the virus, the state of the economy, the problems of migrant workers and the recent allegations against social media company Facebook. On Friday, Congress floor leader in Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, wrote to Birla, asking him not to curtail Question Hour and Zero Hour. Question Hour is usually the first hour of business in the House, when members can ask questions after having given notice 10 days earlier. Zero Hour follows Question Hour and is a more informal session where members can raise questions of public importance. “You will kindly appreciate the fact that raising questions in Parliament, and issues of public importance during the Zero Hour are foremost of the procedural methods available to Members to vent issues of national and public interest,” Chowdhury wrote. “Curtailing the Question Hour and the Zero Hour by way of restricting the number of issues that could be raised and time earmarked would, therefore, not be in the interest of elected representatives,” Chowdhury added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/birla-requests-mps-to-get-tested-before-parl-session/story-BVHtUcIz4Egfs4NVmS3sxK.html
29-08-2020||India||People with diabetes at risk of severe infection: Study||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has resulted in blood glucose levels shooting through the roof for diabetics who are struggling because of factors ranging from inability to contact their physicians and visit hospitals due to the fear of the infection, non-compliance with medication regimens because of reduced income and shortages of insulin and glucose strips, and weight gain, according to experts. A new paper from a consortium of leading Indian diabetologists and endocrinologists outlines five possible scenarios that have been leading to high sugar levels in people with Covid-19 and recommends actions to prevent complications and death. “Diabetes does not raise the risk of getting coronavirus disease (Covid-19), but people with diabetes who get infected are at a higher risk of severe disease, complications and death. Previous studies have shown that 70% patients with diabetes in India have poor glycaemic control, and many have diabetes-related complications. The paper has outlined five scenarios with implications on disease progression and severity that have been observed in patients since March, of which two are new,” said Anoop Misra, who led the consortium of experts from across India who published the study in the journal, Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews. The key factors that increase fatality among Covid-19 patients with diabetes are defects in T-cell immunity, baseline high levels of cytokines and comorbidities such as obesity, coronary heart disease, hypertension and chronic kidney disease, among others. High blood glucose levels at the time of hospitalisation may be due to undetected diabetes or recent weight. “What has also been observed is people with undiagnosed diabetes converting to full-blown diabetes after Covid-19 infection due to multiple factors, such as unhealthy diet, low or no exercise, use of steroids, and mental stress. Our study from Delhi found 40% people gained weight during the lockdown, with 16% gaining 2-5 kg during 49 days of lockdown,” said Misra, who is the chairman of Fortis Center of Excellence for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology in New Delhi. Nikhil Tandon, professor of endocrinology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, said: “Unmasking of an undiagnosed disease on hospitalisation is not uncommon, which could be stress-response hyperglycaemia or due the use of steroids.” The paper said unwarranted use of dexamethasone in mild Covid-19 infection and other seasonal flu increases the risk of hyperglycemia. “High fasting blood glucose at the time of hospitalization in people not known to have diabetes puts them at higher risk for mortality than those who have normoglycaemia (normal blood sugar),” it said. Another scenario is hyperglycemia in pregnancy, which is a grey area in the absence of studies on pregnant women with diabetes and Covid-19. “We recommend pregnant antenatal checks, nutritionist, and diabetes educators through teleconsultations, avoid labs and intensively control their diabetes...,” Misra said. The fourth scenario that affects 90% of diabetics is controlling diabetes on hospitalisation because of pre-existing diabetes and its complications, an infection attacking the pancreas, use of steroids to treat Covid, and stress. “Posing challenges are triggers for hyperglycemia is cytokine storm, use of corticosteroids, ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar states, inability to monitor blood glucose levels because of reduced contact between healthcare worker and patients, and non-inclusion of diabetes expert...,” the paper noted. The fifth scenario is new onset of diabetes, which is now being reported during Covid -19 infection because Ace-2 (angiotensin converting enzyme-2) receptors, which the new coronavirus binds to enter human cells. This can lead to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Studies show 17% Covid-19 patients have some disruption of pancreatic cells, among them insulin producing cells, which leads to rapid deterioration of condition. “People with established disease deferring clinical visits is feasible and not a problem if they get their investigations, including blood work done regularly and consult through text or phone...” said Tandon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-with-diabetes-at-risk-of-severe-infection-study/story-jw8pOcBoEdztS5O6YPIw8L.html
29-08-2020||India||Govt asks states to focus on elderly to reduce fatalities||In an attempt to bring down the number of Covid-19-related deaths in the country, the Union health ministry has asked states to focus on vulnerable population, such as patients with underlying health conditions and those with above 60 years of age.In a review meeting with states reporting higher number of deaths on Thursday, the ministry directed them to particularly pay attention to the vulnerable population. “There are about 10 such states that account for almost 90% of the Covid-19 deaths over the past couple of weeks. If we manage to control deaths in these states, then the national case fatality rate will automatically come down. These intensified measures will particularly be for implementation in these states. In some states, it is certain districts that are reporting high case load. So, the focus is being broken further down to the district level,” said a health ministry official, requesting anonymity.The states that are reporting higher deaths are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Gujarat, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir.“Since a majority of those we are losing to Covid-19 belong to a particular population group, like those with underlying medical conditions or the aged population with less reserves in body to fight off the disease, more focus needs to be put on this population group and states have been directed accordingly,” the official added.The states have been asked to maintain a weekly database of Covid-19 deaths for each health facility managing patients, with particular focus on the vulnerable population. “They will have to document all information related to deaths in each of their Covid hospitals, especially the cause of death, to examine what could have been done to avoid these deaths,” the official said.The age-wise Covid-19 mortality data released by the health ministry earlier this week shows that more than half (51%) of the 61,690 Covid-19 patients who succumbed to the viral infection in India are 60 years and above.The findings about the age-wise distribution of deaths in India appear to be in line with what scientists have observed about global trends of the disease — it disproportionally infects younger people, while it severely affects those who are older.Doctors treating Covid-19 patients agreed.“Normally we see patients are recovering well. Comorbidities and old age both are contributing factors in patients turning serious. This category needs special care,” said Dr Sandeep Nayar, director, respiratory medicine department, BLK super speciality hospital.Clinical management is one of the key components of disease containment strategy.“How we treat our sick patients is what is crucial in saving their lives. We will be able to save more lives if we have a sense of what is killing them. There is a need to systematically and scientifically not just collect data but to also analyse it. We have managed quite well so far, and the gains need to be consolidated further for us to win this battle,” the official quoted above added.While national CFR (case fatality ratio) has dropped to under 2% and is currently at 1.83%, the health ministry has set a target of bringing it down to 1% or below.“The surveillance system will also put special focus on vulnerable population as they are currently most susceptible to contracting infection because they have had been largely indoors so far,” said another senior official from the integrated disease surveillance programme who did not wish to be identified.Other focus areas that states will have to work on include making available to masses real-time information on availability of beds and ambulances across Covid-19 facilities, while significantly reducing ambulance response time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-asks-states-to-focus-on-elderly-to-reduce-fatalities/story-j61DuueHg7jmkXZL3MzhnL.html
29-08-2020||India||India’s case trajectory tops US Covid-19 peak||New Delhi ’s trajectory of daily cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Friday became the highest ever recorded by any country, which means that the outbreak in the country currently is worse than it was at the peak in the United States (US) – the worst-hit nation in the world.At an average, 69,558 new cases were reported in India every day over the past week, placing it above the seven-day daily case peak recorded in the US when the number touched 69,330 for the week ending July 25. The US’s trajectory was the worst in the world in the eight months since the coronavirus disease surfaced in December 2019.On Friday, India reported 76,139 new cases of Covid-19, taking the total number of cases in the country to 3,458,186. To be sure, the US has over six million confirmed infections, more than 1.8 times those in India, which is unlikely to overtake America any time soon.Brazil, which is the country with the second-highest number of total cases, has around 350,000 more cases than India. The South American nation, however, has been adding around 30,000 fewer cases than India every day recently, so the latter has been closing the gap fast.New cases in India have been rising at an alarming rate and have shown no signs of a let-up. India’s doubling rate — the rate at which the total cases in the country would double — was 32 days on Friday against 96 days in the US and 68 in Brazil. For doubling rates, a higher number mean rising at an alarming rate and have shown no signs of a let-up. India’s doubling rate — the rate at which the total cases in the country would double — was 32 days on Friday against 96 days in the US and 68 in Brazil. For doubling rates, a higher number means cases are growing at a slower (thus better) rate. In fact, India has the worst doubling rate among the world’s 10 worst-hit nations.However, with 62,703 total deaths as of Friday, India’s case fatality rate (CFR) – the proportion of deaths among the confirmed cases — is 1.8%, which is not only much better than the global average of 3.4%, but also better than the US (3.1%) and Brazil (3.2%).The US became the worst-hit nation in the world on the back of two separate and massive case spikes. The first spike, which was milder, peaked towards early April and was centred in the country’s north-east with states such as New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania reporting high cases.Towards the end of June, a second spike started with new epicentres such as California, Texas and Florida, pushing new cases to record highs again. In this phase, the US set the global record for the highest cases in a single day on July 24 when it reported 78,586 infections. The country’s seven-day average peaked a day later on July 25. Since then, this wave of infections has also waned and the country is currently reporting around 42,000 new cases every day. In Brazil, the trajectory has been the most erratic of these three. It has seen smaller waves of infections that have dropped thrice — in mid-June, mid-July and mid-August. However, cases appear to have hit a plateau in the past two weeks, averaging around 37,000 new cases every day, against over 46,000 in the last week of July.Unlike the other two nations where the new case trend lines are uneven, the caseload in India has grown gradually and has not had any abrupt spike. But this does not necessarily translate to good news because it also means that the trajectory in India has never hit a plateau. With almost all states (except Delhi) reporting record high cases over the past few weeks, this trajectory has not yet exhibited any signs of slowing down.To be sure, the three countries are rather similar demographically, which may explain the extended trajectory of the pandemic. The US is the world’s third largest country by geographical area, Brazil fifth, and India seventh. As the infection wanes in one part of the country, it waxes in another. In terms of population, India is the second most populous country in the world, the US third, and Brazil sixth. Expectedly, per capita infection and death numbers are low for all three countries compared to smaller and less populous nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-case-trajectory-tops-us-covid-19-peak/story-nYxoxQ8jd1NJX5xBxKhhxK.html
29-08-2020||India||Six non-BJP states move SC seeking deferment of exams||Ministers of six states ruled by non-BJP parties approached the Supreme Court on Friday, seeking review of a top court order that allowed the National Testing Agency (NTA) and central government to hold the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) in September in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. “If the order of August 17, 2020 is not reviewed, then grave and irreparable harm and injury will befall the student community of our country...,” the petition filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes said. It added that not only health, welfare and safety of students appearing for NEET and JEE will be at risk but also the “public health at large would be in severe jeopardy”. The petition was filed by ministers Moloy Ghatak (West Bengal), Rameshwar Oraon (Jharkhand), Raghu Sharma (Rajasthan), Amarjeet Bhagat (Chhattisgarh), Balbir Singh Sidhu (Punjab) and Uday Ravindra Samant (Maharashtra) in their individual capacity. On July 3, NTA, the central government body tasked with conducting JEE and NEET, came out with public notices to hold the exams in September. NEET, for students seeking admission to medical and dental courses, is slated for September 13. JEE, for those aspiring to join top engineering schools, is scheduled to be conducted from September 1 to 6.A three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra, on August 17, rejected a plea by 11 NEET/JEE candidates seeking postponement of the exams until after the Covid-19 crisis.Justice Mishra, while hearing that case, said “life has to go on” despite the outbreak of the viral disease and the court cannot put the career of students in jeopardy by interfering with NTA’s decision of to hold the examinations in September.In response to this remark, the petitioners submitted on Friday that the “advice of ‘Life Must Go On’ may have very sound philosophical underpinnings but cannot be a substitute for valid legal reasoning and logical analysis of the various aspects involved in the conduct of the NEET UG and JEE exams.” The chorus against the medical and engineering entrance tests has been growing with opposition leaders, including Congress’s Rahul Gandhi and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, backing a section of students in seeking postponement of the exams. On Wednesday, chief ministers of several Opposition-ruled states discussed the matter. In a recent interview to HT, Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal “Nishank” requested his “colleagues across the political spectrum to abide by the orders of the honourable Supreme Court” and leave politics aside. “I feel that this government is very empathetic and considerate to the cause of the students. Academic career is very important, and a zero academic year will cause tremendous loss to the students,” he said. He added that he every day he receives “innumerable mails from the silent majority” seeking the exams.“Only two reasons that can be discerned from the (August 17) order for dismissal of the petition — life must go on and students should not lose an academic year. With utmost respect, both the reasons, even if cumulatively taken, do not constitute an authoritative and comprehensive judicial scrutiny of the issue,” the review petition said. A review petition is a legal remedy available after the Supreme Court has pronounced its judgment in a case. The grounds for filing a review petition are limited and the petitioners seeking review should show that a new fact or evidence has come to light or that the court committed an obvious or apparent error while delivering its judgment. It is not necessary that a review petition should be filed only by those who were parties to the original case. However, the court is cautious while entertaining review petition filed by non-parties.In this case, none of the ministers, who have filed the review petition, were parties before the Supreme Court in the plea filed by the 11 students.“The petitioners are all eminent citizens with impeccable record of public service and have the necessary standing to make some pertinent submissions before the Supreme Court on this subject. Though they weren’t formal parties in the (main) petition filed by 11 students, we would seek Supreme Court’s permission to allow them to file the review petition, as per Supreme Court practice,” Sunil Fernandes told HT.The petitioners highlighted that students from rural areas and semi-urban areas might be forced to use unsafe modes of transportation to reach examination centres and would thereby expose themselves and everyone else to Covid -19. Besides, students residing in distant placed will find it difficult to reach examination centres due to limited availability of transportation services during Covid -19.They also pointed out that certain states have inadequate examinations centres which will make implementation of social distancing norms impossible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-non-bjp-states-move-sc-seeking-deferment-of-exams/story-UoNCMFHIA4aNSmJn8Htj2L.html
29-08-2020||India||UGC right to make exams compulsory but states can postpone schedule: SC||The Supreme Court ruled on Friday students cannot be promoted without writing the final year or terminal semester examinations, upholding a July 6 directive of the University Grants Commission (UG).However, states will have the liberty to defer such exams beyond the September 30 deadline in view of the coronavirus pandemic, the three-judge bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan said. “States cannot promote students based on internal assessment or past performance. If states want to hold exams after September 30, they can approach UGC for the same,” the bench said.Also Watch | JEE, NEET 2020: Should exams be postponed? Education minister answersYuva Sena, the youth wing of the Shiv Sena, is among several petitioners in the top court who questioned UGC’s directive to hold examinations amid the coronavirus pandemic. The bench had reserved its verdict on the issue on August 18.UGC had earlier told the top court that its July 6 directive, asking universities and colleges to conduct final year exams by September 30 amid the Covid-19 pandemic, is “not a diktat” but states cannot take the decision to confer degrees without holding the exams.The “benefit of students” as the universities have to start admissions to postgraduate courses and state authorities cannot override the UGC’s guideline, it had added.On August 10, UGC had questioned the decisions of Delhi and Maharashtra governments to cancel final year exams of state universities amid the Covid-19 pandemic, saying they were against the rules. The Solicitor General had earlier informed the bench that out of over 800 universities in the country, 209 have completed the examinations while around 390 universities are in the process of conducting exams.UGC had said that in June this year, considering the evolving situation of the pandemic, it requested an expert committee to revisit the guidelines in which it had asked the universities to hold final year examinations in July 2020.The committee submitted a report recommending that terminal semester and final year examinations should be conducted by universities by the end of September, 2020 in offline or pen and paper or online or offline mode, UGC had said. UGC had said, while assailing the decisions of some states like Maharashtra and Delhi of cancelling the final year exams, that such decisions directly affect the standards of higher education. It will be an encroachment on the legislative field of coordinating and determining the standards of higher education that is exclusively reserved for Parliament under Schedule VII of the Constitution, it had said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-verdict-on-final-year-university-exams/story-D2OrJNPE83HGyw4m4tWexJ.html
