Arguing that while the Rajapaksa government has adopted a posture of neutrality in its dealings with major regional and global powers, he was categorical in underlining that “the president [Gotabaya Rajapaksa] has stated that we have a strategic security-wise ‘India first’ policy because we cannot be, we should not be, we can’t afford to be a strategic security threat for India, period.” These are powerful words indeed, and along with Colombage’s acknowledgement that the decision to give Hambantota port on a 99- year lease to China was a “mistake”, it underscored the pitfalls of a rather infantile debate in this country about India’s neighbourhood policy in recent months. There has been a barrage of criticism that India is “losing” its neighbourhood as border tensions with Nepal have grown and China has continued to spread its tentacles in India’s vicinity. That Indian and Chinese forces are squaring off at the border has reinforced this plaintive cry that New Delhi is getting marginalised in the neighbourhood. Even foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla’s visit to Bangladesh, his first outside India since the Covid-19 lockdown, got mired in needless debates about rising Chinese clout in Dhaka. By all accounts, Shringla’s visit to Dhaka was a successful one and it managed to convey Bangladesh’s privileged position in Indian foreign policy matrix. Against the backdrop of the two nations celebrating “Mujib Borsho”, and the 50th year of the liberation of Bangladesh as well as the establishment of diplomatic relations next year, this visit was key to setting the tone for a busy calendar of events ahead and a number of high-level bilateral visits. From expediting and conceptualising major connectivity projects to diversifying bilateral engagement, the two nations are getting serious about their priorities. What is key here is the role played by top leadership in both nations. Both Narendra Modi and Sheikh Hasina, despite some domestic scepticism, understand the importance of cultivating strong bilateral relations. For Modi, the development of India’s East and Northeast is a top priority and a strategic imperative for New Delhi. And that region can only achieve its full potential if it’s better integrated with Bangladesh, thereby ensuring that India-Bangladesh connectivity projects will continue to be at the top of the agenda. It is important to recognise that this connectivity push is being shaped by a politician like Narendra Modi who has been forthright about the challenges posed by illegal immigration. The fact that by next year India and Bangladesh are likely to have nine rail links is an indicator of how fast priorities in New Delhi are evolving. There is also a growing desire on the part of the two nations to look beyond the Bengali-Bengali narrative and shape the engagement by bringing in new stakeholders more in sync with 21st century realities. There is a sizeable Tamil and Telugu population in Bangladesh in the textile industry and tech space, and a growing number of Bangladeshi students and medical tourists are now visiting South India, thereby changing the very complexion of this engagement. It is, therefore, quite curious to suggest that India might be losing ground in Bangladesh. Of course, the all-pervasive China factor has to be reckoned with. In most of India’s neighbours, China has a seeming advantage that, unlike India, it is not part of the domestic political calculus. But, unlike India, it also does not have a long-term stake in the South Asian region. It can afford to ignore the region, which it does, when its interests are not served. New Delhi doesn’t have that luxury. For good or bad, India’s future and that of its neighbours remain intertwined. So while China’s financial commitments to various countries in the region are much talked about, given their size, they are largely declaratory. Even in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, China’s actual spending has been quite limited, compared to the $62 billion amount which is often advertised. India’s declared loan commitments might be small, but when it comes to actual delivery, India is not far behind. Its loan terms and payment conditionalities are much better too. For all the hue and cry about India “losing” the neighbourhood, the ground reality is quite different. With Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Maldives, New Delhi’s relations are robust and progressing well. Bhutan remains as close as ever and even in the case of Nepal, it was Prime Minister KP Oli who recently reached out to his Indian counterpart. Afghanistan is passing through a difficult phase, but both the Afghan government and the Taliban leadership recognise India’s critical role in shaping their nation’s future trajectory. And all this has happened when India has been able to successfully marginalise Pakistan, regionally and globally.To view India’s neighbourhood policy through the lens of “wins” and “losses” is to miss the structural imperatives that shape the outcome. A region shaped by two major powers will never have a linear trajectory. And such a narrative also does a great disservice to smaller nations in the region, which have their own agency in shaping their engagements with these powers. Finally, there has never been a golden period of foreign policy when New Delhi’s ties with its neighbours were seamless. Going by India’s historical record, Delhi’s regional outreach today is quite promising. Indian discourse today seems more driven by domestic political imperatives than by the empirical realities on the ground.

27-08-2020||News||Can NEP be Indian education’s 1991 moment?||The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has laid out an ambitious vision of making India an education powerhouse in the years to come. It has the right thrust: Liberalising regulation (light but tight), inviting truly philanthropic contributions, and increasing government spending. It is the education sector equivalent of the 1991 liberalisation of industry which rapidly improved its performance. For the same to happen in education, particularly for Indian universities to become research powerhouses, which determine reputation and prestige worldwide, however, it will take efforts of a kind that were not necessary for industry. This is because education is different in some crucial respects, quite apart from its non-profit nature.After liberalisation, the advent of new financial institutions such as HDFC Bank improved the quality of services for customers. Older institutions also shaped up, for instance, State Bank of India and Life Insurance Corporation (whose claim settlement ratio is better than that of private insurance companies). In other sectors, companies that could not shape up, such as Premier Automobiles, shut down. Such changes do not take place so quickly in education because of its special characteristics. First, there are strong network effects. You, as a good student, want to go to a university which attracts other good students and has successful alumni. But it takes a long time to establish alumni success, and it is hard for you to coordinate your actions with other good applicants. So you end up going to the same established universities which end up also getting other good students who thought exactly like you, which fulfils your expectations. It is a cycle that is hard to break. Only 12% of the Fortune 500 companies in 1955 are still on it; most of the universities on the top 500 list are still on it, and that too, in roughly the same order. Second, good research universities are hard to scale up because of their human-capital-intensive nature, and because they compete on quality, not market share. That is why the best universities in the world each have a very small market share in terms of the total number of students. It is a fragmented industry. Suzuki or Honda can easily scale up and edge out incumbents to grab a large market share if there is demand. A top university cannot. So even if new universities, homegrown or foreign, come in, they will not be able to create sufficient capacity to affect the intake of existing prestigious universities. For both these reasons, student exit does not create enough pressure for existing universities to transform themselves. Instead, pressure has to come from other sources, namely from the funding mechanism, and the quality of governance by the board of governors (BoG) and the vice-chancellor (V-C). These are the areas where policies and guidance are needed from the government.The government should reward high-research performance with disproportionately higher funding, consistent with the greater costs of running such universities, as well as the higher value derived thereof. Making funding conditional on research performance will result in more efficient use of government’s spending, and also help overcome any institutional resistance to change.The quality of governance is critical. NEP has the right idea that BoG should consist of highly qualified, competent, and dedicated individuals. It does well to refrain from specifying that these individuals be elected by the faculty (as at Cambridge and Oxford) or consist primarily of academics. However, getting competent independent directors, which is hard enough for industry, is even harder for academic institutions. BoG members must not interfere in academic matters, but neither should they leave everything to the VC and his or her team. They must insist on rigorous academic processes and monitor their implementation, but refrain from themselves running those processes. This is a difficult balance to strike. Therefore, not everyone who is a competent director of companies is a competent member of an academic institution’s BoG. High-quality training is needed, even more so than for company directors.Other steps such as teacher training will be needed too, but the most crucial ones are getting the funding mechanism right and populating BoG and top management with the right individuals. I am hopeful that if we do these well, Indian educational institutions will fulfil NEP’s vision by regaining the prominence they held in ancient times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/can-nep-be-indian-education-s-1991-moment/story-PBx3FHsdE2doaide3kL3gK.html
27-08-2020||News||NDHM will radically transform health care||With the launch of the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) on August 15, India has ushered in a new era of technology-enabled health care delivery. The prime minister’s vision of an Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) can only be realised by a “Swasth Bharat”, which, in turn, requires data integration and standardisation as critical health ecosystem enablers. NDHM is built on the principles of ensuring greater inclusivity, efficiency and transparency in the health sector. For patients, the mission aims to simplify access to their records and enables them to share digitally-stored comprehensive health profiles with providers for treatment and follow-up purposes. Currently, people find it difficult to maintain long trails of paper-based records for health interventions like immunisation, especially over long periods of time, or when they move from one part of the country to another. Yet, these records are critical for monitoring an individual’s health status and ensuring continuity in treatment. Undoubtedly, the availability of health care infrastructure and service delivery needs to be strengthened across the country. However, technological empowerment and digitisation can most certainly enable more effective and efficient utilisation of existing facilities. The days of people standing in long queues at health facilities carrying multiple medical reports will become a thing of the past in this digital- and patient-friendly ecosystem, empowered by world-class technologies. Access to patient records will now be just a click away for doctors.Of course, participation and sharing of data are voluntary and all efforts have been made to keep the rights of citizens at the core of the mission’s design and objectives. It is understood that maintaining security, confidentiality and privacy of health-related information is vital. The mission’s health and data policies have, therefore, been formulated to ensure privacy and data security. The digital identity of patients will be shared with certified doctors only after they provide their informed consent. The NDHM architecture, by default, ensures that health data is encrypted, and that there is no opportunity for anyone to access the records or modify them without the explicit consent of the concerned individual. Patients can determine the time period for which they grant consent and can also revoke consent anytime they wish to.Under NDHM, all Indians can get access to a unique and easy-to-remember health ID carrying details of their health and treatment history. Through this ID, individuals will not only be able to search for verified hospitals and laboratories, but can also evaluate the quality of services, on the basis of feedback shared by others. This feature can greatly enhance the accountability of health service providers as well as promote the delivery of high-quality services to patients.In addition to individuals, all doctors, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories, and pharmacies will also be given a digital identity. This, in turn, will enable a single and standardised process for completing their identification, certification and audit formalities, allowing providers to focus on the actual delivery of health services, instead of expending time and resources on undertaking administrative procedures on multiple occasions through different channels. Of course, similar to the mechanism for patients, participation in NDHM will be voluntary for providers as well; however, needless to say, the more participation there is, the stronger and more integrated the health ecosystem will become. Participation for health care providers and establishments under NDHM will also be completely free of cost and the use of Aadhaar for health ID will not be mandated. Apart from the multiple benefits for patients and health care providers, NDHM will offer services such as telemedicine as part of its digital suite. The utilisation of telemedicine has gone up significantly in India following the Covid-19 outbreak; however, there are opportunities to provide services for a range of health conditions by connecting doctors with citizens even in the most rural and remote parts of the country, beyond the Covid-19 era as well. By being able to access quality health care advice remotely, travel costs will be saved for patients in several parts of the country and ultimately help to reduce out-of-pocket expenditures, which currently account for nearly two-thirds of the total health expenditure in India.NDHM is initially being rolled out in six Union territories — Chandigarh, Pondicherry, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Ladakh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep. The rest of the country will follow soon. Technology is a powerful disruptor that has revolutionised and accelerated the growth of a large number of sectors such as banking. Through the adoption of digital technologies, NDHM will empower the health sector to cater to the country’s large population in a far more efficient manner, through the standardisation of health records, the creation of a unique health identity, doorstep delivery of quality medicines at affordable prices as well as tele-consultations with verified medical professionals. It would not be an exaggeration to say that with the launch of NDHM, we are witnessing a new beginning for India’s health sector. It is a visionary reform that has the potential to radically transform health care delivery in the country.

The deputy commissioner will file a combined report as per the directions of Haryana chief secretary who took a review meeting in this regard on Thursday. Earlier on Thursday, a joint team of MCG Gurugram and DTCP had demolished nine farmhouses, boundary walls and internal roads that had been constructed without permission from the authorities. Vinay Pratap Singh, municipal commissioner, said that a joint team demolished the illegal structures and process has been initiated as per rules to register an FIR against those who developed farmhouses without authorisation. “A review meeting in this matter was taken by the chief secretary on Thursday in which it was decided that the deputy commissioner will file an action taken report in the supreme Court. The action taken report will be collected from the forest, mining, MCG, DTCP and other departments. A criminal complaint against the accused will be lodged by the department of town and country planning,” said Singh. He further said that action was initiated by MCG against violations under its rules for construction without permission while DTCP also took action as applicable under controlled areas. “A criminal complaint against the accused would also be lodged in this regard for violations pertaining to mining department, pollution department and others,” he said. Singh said that based on the recommendations of forest department, work will be carried out to restore the natural character of the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nine-more-aravalli-farmhouse-face-bulldozer-action-gurugram-dc-to-submit-report-in-sc/story-dfUFIT9Xrpn4poRETFxLiL.html
27-08-2020||Gurugram||Parivar Pehchan Patra enrolment: Teachers struggle with technical snags, lack of training||Government school teachers in Gurugram, who have been roped in to create unique state identity cards— ‘Parivar Pehchan Patra (PPP)’—for students and their parents, have been facing various hurdles ranging from technical snags to lack of training since the exercise commenced on Monday.Schools across the state have been directed to help in the creation of PPP cards— which will enable people to get benefits under various state welfare schemes at their doorsteps— from August 25 till September 5.Suman Sharma, principal of government model senior secondary school in Sector 4/7, said there were technical issues due to which the process of uploading details of families was getting disrupted and was taking place slowly. “The PPP portal is not able to handle the load due to which the data doesn’t get updated. While teachers are working, the output depends on sheer chance. Our operators have been facing these challenges for the last three days. Most of them are staying at work till late evening to ensure that work gets done,” said Sharma.Under the initiative, which was launched on August 4 this year, it is mandatory for each family to register themselves on the PPP portal to avail welfare benefits. School teachers collect, verify and upload data of students’ families on the portal for the generation of the identity cards.An English teacher at a government school, who did not wish to be named, said besides struggling with a lack of technological know-how, teachers were also facing the wrath of irked parents. “Most of us are of the view that some training should have been imparted before the initiation of a crucial exercise. All of a sudden, without any training, teachers were assigned various tasks under the initiative. Parents are getting irked due to the delay and hold us accountable thinking that we are not working. No identity cards could be made in the first two days and only some were made today (Wednesday),” she said.The Haryana School Teachers Union has also opposed the move of involvement of teachers in the entire process. Satyanarayan Yadav, deputy vice-president of the union, said that they were opposed to the move of enrolling the services of teachers without any training. “Teachers did not receive any demonstration or training that would have helped them in familiarising themselves with the process. All schools are not fully equipped with computers and other requisite devices. Due to these constraints, many teachers have been struggling with the execution of the exercise,” said Yadav.Sangeeta Chaudhary, district elementary education officer (DEEEO) who is also the district project coordinator , said teachers were facing issues since the online database for registering details was under stress because of high traffic. “School heads have flagged issues pertaining to the exercise. Most of them have informed us that the website is not working. In all likelihood, this is due to the increased traffic on the website. Snags are arising since this is a state-wide exercise where multiple people have logged in together at the same time,” said Chaudhary.On the subject of training teachers, Chaudhary said a training session through video conferencing would take place on Friday. “A training session for a set of teachers will be taking place tomorrow (Friday). They’ll further train the rest of the teachers. The issues that have been raised so far will be discussed and resolved,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/parivar-pehchan-patra-enrolment-teachers-struggle-with-technical-snags-lack-of-training/story-9pdPeDKrZk0sjvqPMX4jsK.html
27-08-2020||Gurugram||1.25 lakh tonnes of C&D waste collected in 2020, fines worth Rs 40 lakh levied for violation||The Municipal Corporation of Gururgam (MCG) has collected close to 1.25 lakh tonnes of construction and demolition (C&D) waste from across the city so far this year, to be processed at its treatment plant in Basai. The corporation has also collected Rs 40 lakh in fines for violations of the Centre’s Construction & Demolition Waste Management Rules this year, up from Rs 20 lakh collected in 2019. The MCG has also been purchasing recycled aggregates from its Basai plant and plans to start manufacturing its own paver blocks, for use in pavements and bicycle tracks, from October 2020. The plan was revealed by Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG, at a recent webinar on C&D waste management in India, organised by Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) to mark the launch of a new report titled ‘Another Brick Off the Wall: Improving Construction and Demolition Waste Management in Indian Cities’,Singh also emphasized the role of C&D waste management in pushing up Gurugram’s score on the annual Swachh Survekashan survey, with the Basai plant having started operations in December last year. Gurugram this year ranked 62nd among 382 cities with a population of 100,000 to 1 million on India’s annual cleanliness survey. In 2019, Gurugram was placed 83 out of 425 cities. In 2018, it had a rank of 105 and in the year before that, it was 112. Despite these improvements, Singh added that the city is grappling with close to nine lakh tonnes of legacy waste that has accumulated over the years, with at least another 300 tonnes per day (TPD) which continue to be generated. “Steps are being taken to address this. MCG has assessed the amount of C&D waste generated. Non-disclosure of the estimation of the C&D waste generated attracts penalties, which have been increased five times this year,” said Singh, explaining the increase in fine collection. Experts, on the other hand, said that the efficient management of C&D waste in Gurugram — as with other cities — continues to be a challenge. The CSE report identifies at least 10 broad reasons for the poor implementation of the Centre’s 2016 rules, including slow progress in adopting required technology, lack of preparedness at a state level, constraints of finding available land, and affordable pricing of recycled aggregates. These points were based on investigations carried out in 16 Indian cities, including Gurugram. Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager, sustainable cities, at CSE, who authored the report, said, “We found Gurugram has mounted a better response, or at least has a better idea of what an appropriate response is, than most other cities we surveyed. Bombay, for example, still does not have a C&D waste plant, while the model deployed in neigbouring Delhi has not been successful. Gurugram is one of the few Indian cities which has both the infrastructure to treat demolition waste, and a model to collect and transport waste.” In terms of vigilance, too, Somvanshi added, the quantum of fines collected for C&D waste violations suggest that Gurugram has done a better job at trying to deter violations — though the CSE report does not provide comparative figures for fine collections in other cities. “Even so, Gurugram’s response needs to be scaled up, and it indicates mainly how poor the regulations are in other cities. Gurugram has a blueprint for a successful model, which has now commenced and whose real efficacy is yet to be seen.” Other steps taken by Gurugram — which Somvanshi added were largely absent in other cities — is inclusion of a C&D waste clause in building permits. As per the CSE report, this ensures that “generators deposit all the waste at their disposal points at the time of building permits. This basically removes the access of the informal sector to the waste.” Gurugram has also “notified segregation on premises in six different streams — namely brick and masonry; concrete and steel; soil, sand and gravel; wood and plastics; other metals; and miscellaneous.” “For comparison, Delhi has not spelled out its segregation criteria, while Ghaziabad has notified that every generator needs to segregate waste into four streams (concrete, soil, wood and plastics, and bricks and mortar) at premises,” according to the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/1-25-lakh-tonnes-of-c-d-waste-collected-in-2020-fines-worth-rs-40-lakh-levied-for-violation/story-fk8EsIBqF1DpBFGqoxf7yJ.html
27-08-2020||Gurugram||Woman molested, attacked with sickle in Farrukhnagar||A woman suffered serious injuries when an unidentified person allegedly attacked her with a sickle after attempting to molest her in Farrukhnagar on Thursday afternoon. The police said when the woman put up a fight, the suspect snatched the sickle from her hand, and hit her on her neck and head. She was rushed to a hospital in Farrukhnagar and later referred to the Civil Hospital, where she is reported to be stable. According to the police, the incident took place around 1pm when the woman, a resident of Farrukhnagar, had gone to a farm on Joniawas Road to get fodder for cattle. The police said as she was cutting the fodder with a sickle, an unidentified man pounced on her and tried to snatch her earrings. “The suspect molested her and as she resisted. He snatched the sickle from her hand and attacked her with it. She suffered at least five injuries on her neck, scalp and face. She managed to run away from him before some commuters came to her assistance. She was rushed to a hospital nearby, where she was provided with first aid. She was then referred to the Civil Hospital in Sector 10, where she is undergoing treatment. The suspect managed to escape,” said Savit Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Farrukhnagar police station. The police said the victim in her statement told the police that the suspect appeared to be ‘intoxicated and his intention was to molest her.’ After the incident, at least three men, locals from the area, blocked a road near the crime spot. The police said a team was sent to the area and the road was cleared for vehicular movement within a few minutes. A case was registered against the unidentified suspect under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) at Farrukhnagar police station on Thursday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/woman-molested-attacked-with-sickle-in-farrukhnagar/story-t3eOq2J8SHMQWN5tSYgoqI.html
27-08-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19 cases doubling at 81 days as cases continues to shoot up||Gurugram’s doubling rate — as per data available with the health department — has fallen to 81 days as compared to 104 days in the first week of August, in a sign that the spread of Covid-19 virus has become more rapid in the district. The doubling rate estimates the number of days that it will take for the total number of cases to double. An increasing doubling rate means fewer days until the total number of cases doubles.On Thursday, the total number of active cases jumped to 937, with the district adding 141 cases to its tally, taking the total number of people infected with SARS-CoV2 to 11,429. At least 132 people have succumbed to the disease so far, with one fresh death being recorded on Thursday.Records show that the number of active cases till the first week of August was under 650 and gradually declining. However, the number of new cases on a weekly basis have increased since then. Between August 13-20, the total new cases were 543,. Between August 21- 27, however, at least 793 new cases were confirmed. Confirming the rise in infection, the health department officials said that Gurugram’s daily growth of Covid-19 cases is also fluctuating between 0.87% (August 7) to 1.1 % (as on Thursday), indicating the Covid-19 cases are growing at a faster pace again. In July, the daily growth rate of cases was 1.4%. Health officials say that calculating doubling rate is a dynamic process, where average of cases reported in the last seven days are being taken. It can be calculated either every day or every three or five days. But as per ICMR guidelines, Haryana health department has been using a mathematical calculation called Cumulative Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) to decipher the doubling rate.In April, the doubling rate of cases fluctuated between 18 and 36 days, when the total number of active cases were almost 60. As the numbers started increasing in May first week, the doubling rate dropped to just seven days. Data shows there was a slight improvement in the doubling rate from May 15 till May 29. During these weeks, cases were multiplying after every 17 and 13 days. With over 675 cases reported from May 29 till June 3, cases again doubled rapidly in just four days. In July, the doubling rate improved to almost 51 days. Till August 13, the doubling rate was 108 days, while the case positivity rate was 7.23%. However, last week the doubling rate came down to 88 days. It has been a week since Gurugram is reporting more than 100 new cases per day, thereby affecting the doubling rate, health officials said, while pointing out that the numbers were rising across the country. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Since, active cases and testing numbers are rapidly changing, the doubling rate continues to vary. It has come into our notice that cases are increasing as all the members of a family are being tested positive in one go. Therefore, we are now holding more testing camps to isolate people quickly and prevent mortality. Cases are increasing across the country as people are freely moving out without ensuring social distancing norms.”Dr Dhruv Chaudhary, state nodal officer for Covid-19 at PGIMS, Rohtak, said, “Doubling rate is a parameter to indicate the rate at which infectivity is spreading. It is critical when the doubling rate is in a single digit. It is due to increased testing, cases are multiplying in 81 days in Gurugram. Now the focus should be on preventing the active cases from increasing so that elderly and those with co-morbid conditions are not exposed to the coronavirus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-19-cases-doubling-at-81-days-as-cases-continues-to-shoot-up/story-DGos5hMzKH4dTwC66qWwhM.html
27-08-2020||City||Road safety measures for six accident prone spots in Gurugram to be reviewed next week||Gurugram: Measures taken by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and Gurugram traffic police to reduce accidents and casualties at the city’s six most critical black spots — Shankar Chowk, Rajiv Chowk, Hero Honda Chowk, Khandsa, Bilaspur Chowk and Sidhrawali cut — will be reviewed by Gurugram deputy commissioner Amit Khatri in next week’s district road safety committee meeting, officials said Thursday.All six spots are located on National Highway 48. For each of these spots, recommendations were given by Haryana Vision Zero (HVZ)— a Haryana government program on road safety now defunct—in February this year, and Khatri has asked various departments, mainly NHAI and the Gurugram traffic police, to submit an action report where steps they have taken to reduce fatalities at these spots would be highlighted.A road stretch is termed as a black spot if more than five fatalities are recorded in a 500-metre stretch over a three-year period.Going by data from HVZ, the number of road fatalities recorded at Shankar Chowk between 2016 and 2019 was 12, 17 at Rajiv Chowk, 16 at Hero Honda Chowk, 22 at Khandsa, 17 at Bilaspur Chowk, and seven at Sidhrawali cut.“I have directed the agencies concerned to submit the action they have taken at each of the six stretches, in the next district road safety committee meeting. Our main objective is to reduce the number of accidents across the city and identify areas which are prone to them and subsequently undertake necessary steps to reduce them,” said Khatri.According to district administration officials, the meeting is scheduled for next week but a final date will be decided depending on the availability of the deputy commissioner and other officials. They further said the meeting will be conducted via video conference.Sarika Panda Bhatt, former programme coordinator with HVZ and a road safety expert, who is part of the district road safety meetings, said for each of these points, various recommendations for reducing accidents and fatalities were submitted by HVZ, however, most of them are yet to be implemented.Bhatt said some of the recommendations made by HVZ were to install traffic signals and mark pedestrian crossings at some of the black spots and to provide pedestrian amenities wherever possible.“For both Rajiv Chowk and Shankar Chowk, we had asked authorities to install a traffic signal below the flyover so that pedestrians can cross the junction without much difficulty and also to paint and mark crossings. With residential areas, located on both sides of Bilaspur Chowk, we had recommended installation of a foot over-bridge (FOB) as there is no pedestrian amenity there and people were crossing the main highway amid traffic,” said Bhatt.None of these recommendations have been implemented on-ground, said Sarika. HVZ was a program of the Haryana government compromising private and government road safety experts and engineers for reducing accidents across the state. The program was privately funded. Due to lack of funds, however, it ceased operations in April.She said although based on HVZ’s recommendations, at Hero Honda Chowk and IFFCO Chowk, traffic signals have been installed, both were often found to be not working. “At Khandsa, which has the highest number of fatalities in the city, NHAI has installed an FOB earlier this year, based on HVZ’s recommendation, but the structure still does not have a direct power connection. Hence, the escalators are not working and a large number of pedestrians are not able to avail of the facility,” said Bhatt. At both the Sidhrawali cut and Bilaspur Chowk, HVZ had stated that the stretches are not properly fenced which is not only enabling pedestrians to cross the main highway on foot but also resulting in two-wheelers criss-crossing from one side of the highway to other, which can lead to accidents. “At both Rajiv chowk and Hero Honda Chowk flyover, underpasses for non-motorised transport (NMT) are already complete. At Shankar Chowk, an elevated u-turn is under construction. After its completion, a large number of local traffic will shift to arterial stretches and there will be a major reduction in the volume of vehicles on service roads of the national highway.

The police on Thursday booked her husband and four members of his family on charges of dowry death after her brother alleged that she was subjected to continued harassment over dowry-related matters since her marriage last year. According to the police, the incident was reported around 8pm, when the woman’s brother informed the police control room. In the police complaint, her brother stated,“My sister got married in May 2019. Ever since her marriage, her husband and her in-laws had been harassing her for insufficient dowry. They often rebuked her for the same. My sister often complained about their frequent demands for dowry during her visits to our house. Her husband did not allow her to talk to us freely over the phone. On Wednesday, at 7.46pm, I got a call from him informing me that my sister had hanged herself,” said the complainant, adding that they rushed to their house and found her dead. The police said the complainant alleged that the victim killed herself due to repeated harassment by her husband and in-laws for dowry. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “A case has been registered and we are verifying the allegations. No arrests have been made so far.” The victim’s body was handed over to the family after the post-mortem examination on Thursday.

27-08-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana BJP gen secy accuses Cong MLA of ration scam||General secretary of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Ludhiana unit, Parveen Bansal, on Thrusday accused Congress MLA Rakesh Panday for selectively distributing and wasting ration sent by the central government for the poor. Members of the district BJP unit led by Bansal reached a school run by Congress worker Baljinder Singh Sandhu, husband of Congress councillor of ward no 91, Gurpinder Kaur, in Sandhu Nagar, where the ration is stored. Bansal said he checked the stock following complaints that the ration was only reaching select people close to MLA Panday or Sandhu, while the rest is rotting in the godown. “Today, some residents of the area lodged a complaint that a huge pile of ration was dumped, following which we decided to conduct an inspection. We were shocked to find a huge stockpile of ration kits and unaccounted ration dumped in the godown,” alleged Bansal. He said that over 1,500 rations kits were kept in the godown and some of the stock was rotten and infested with worms. The ration kit include 2-kg sugar, 2 pulses or gram and 10-kg flour meant for distribution among the poor. Terming it a scam, Banal has demanded high-level probe in the matter. Bansal said that even during the lockdown, migrants had protested against the Congress councillor’s husband for withholding the ration. Sandhu, on the other hand, said the allegation were baseless. He said that everything was accounted for and the ration was being equally distributed among the councillors who are distributing it to the poor. “The distribution work is being carried out in a transparent manner and that’s why we asked the opposition leader to verify the stock kept in the godown,” said Sandhu. On the other hand, MLA Panday hit out at the BJP for playing cheap politics to hog limelight. “BJP has a habit of creating an issue out of nothing. We are open to any kind of verification. Rather than visiting the godown, Banasal could have asked me about the status of ration. He could have visited district food supply office or lodged a complaint with the minister. But, he opted to visit the godown for photo opportunity,” Panday said. On the other hand Raju Thapar, husband of Reenu Thapar, Congress councillor from ward No 83, said that that he has not received any ration kit for the past month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-bjp-gen-secy-accuses-cong-mla-of-ration-scam/story-e9d2mcDN7D7TJNuyCzi13O.html

27-08-2020||Noida||Noida: Two new roads opened to decongest Dadri-Surajpur-Chhalera road||The Noida authority on Thursday said it has opened two new stretches – known as Badshahi road and Bhangel-Gejha road – to decongest the Dadri-Surajpur-Chhalera (DSC) thoroughfare that witnesses traffic congestion due to construction underway on it. The authority had been constructing a 5.5 km long elevated corridor above the DSC road, which is one of the city’s key routes, since March. The work of piling to build pillars is in full swing. As a result, the DSC road’s 5.5 km stretch sees heavy traffic daily, particularly during peak hours. To ease the traffic pangs the authority has built and opened two alternate routes. The two roads were inaugurated by Dr Mahesh Sharma, Member of Parliament from Gautam Budh Nagar, and Noida MLA Pankaj Singh, along with Noida authority general manager Rajiv Tyagi.“Commuters need not face traffic jams on Dadri road anymore as these stretches will provide relief. We have built these two routes because work on the Bhangel elevated above Dadri road is on in full swing. These two routes were earlier in a bad condition before we constructed them,” said Tyagi. The Badshahi road is 7.5meters wide and 1.250 km long, beginning from Sector 110 and ending at Sector 107. The authority has spent Rs 1.81 crore on this project. The four-lane 1.25 km long Bhangel to Gejha road connects these two villages. The authority spent Rs 3.4 crore on this project, said officials.“If you want to travel from and to sectors 107 to 110 or 108, where the police commissioner office is located, then you need not take Dadri road anymore. Now, one can directly take these two roads and travel from sectors 80, 108, 93 to sectors 107, 100 or 47 without facing congestion,” said Tyagi. Earlier, the Badshahi road was not in use as it was not in working condition due to it being a low lying area filled with water all the time, said authority officials. “We have also repaired the drains running along these two roads so that they remain clean without water logging issues,” said Tyagi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-two-new-roads-opened-to-decongest-dadri-surajpur-chhalera-road/story-TIiUSmLWInUwu43wEUBbsO.html

Since then, the gap between discharges and active cases has widened with figures of August 26 stating total discharges at 6,352, while the number of active cases at 1,237. This is about 5.13 times the active cases. At national level, according to the figures of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on August 26, the number of Covid recoveries across the country exceeded the active cases by 3.5 times. The figures by the Ministry indicated that 1,760,489 people have recovered which is more than the number of active cases which stood at 7,07,267 on August 26. With the figures, the country’s recovery rate amongst the Covid-19 patients crossed 76%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/state-govt-directs-ghaziabad-to-increase-rt-pcr-testing-surveillance-in-non-containment-zones/story-b4kOypHv8T3wsWyEueJkgO.html
27-08-2020||City||Random testing helped Ghaziabad discover most of its positive cases||Random testing and testing people with symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (Sari) helped Ghaziabad find most of its Covid-19 positive cases since March, according to the state health department data till August 27. While each found four out of every 10 positive cases in the district, contact tracing of positive cases gave only eight percent of the district’s 7,863 cases. This, however, needs to be seen in the context of data collection process when those collating sources included cases from several sources such as contact tracing and international and domestic passengers as people with “ILI and Sari symptoms”, said health department officials.The figures of the realtime state Covid-19 portal revealed that about 44.14% of cases have resulted from tests conducted on ILI and SARI cases across the district from March to August 27 (data up to 4pm). Of these, ILI contributed about 2,234 positive cases while SARI resulted in 1,237 positive cases out of total of 7863 cases. “As expected, the ILI and Sari have been major contributors to our cases and this is why our surveillance teams have been specifically asked to track such patients. The idea is to detect such cases at the earliest so that they do not move to stage of complication. We have also enhanced the number of our surveillance teams and focussing on early detection, testing and immediate referrals,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “The district has been continuously taking up 3000-3500 tests per day and contact tracing activities have also been about 99% complete. Since we have improved our systems we have positive cases coming in but we are focussing on their quality treatment. This is why the number of discharges is high and there is considerable reduction in fatality rate which is below 1%.” Presently, surveillance teams and also teams of booth level officers are deployed to trace ILI and Sari cases in containment as well as non-containment zones. The next major contributor to the tally is of positive cases which resulted due to random sampling at the booths or from high incidence areas. Together, such sampling/testing resulted in 3421 cases which account for 43.51% of 7863 total cases. For the purpose, the district administration has been carrying out random sampling in high incidence areas with 20 different facilities comprising of mobile vans, mobile teams as well as static booths where anyone can walk-in and get themselves tested. The contact tracing, despite its seemingly low contribution, is the third largest source of infections with 630 positive cases. According to the officials of the district health department, they have traced the contacts of 99% of 7,744 patients till August 26 and identified 52,343 people who may have contracted the disease this way. “The average contact per patient is about 6.82 for overall cases from March to August 26. Of these, testing of 96% contacts was completed. In the month of August, we have traced 2409 contacts of 2544 patients with a rate of about 9.5 contacts per patient and 22782 contacts identified. Of the overall contacts identified in 26 days of August, testing of 98% contacts was completed,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. The contact tracing exercise is vital for early identification of people who came in contact with positive cases and such persons need immediate identification, testing and speedier referral to appropriate Covid facilities if found positive. Of the total 7863 cases, 96 were those who were found positive during ante natal care or tests conducted before surgeries. Testing for healthcare workers was also taken up during the period and the activity resulted in about 138 positive cases during the period. During the initial months of March and April, several cases had emerged in which people were involved in foreign/domestic travel as well as those who attended religious congregations. The travellers according to the official statistics accounted for about 30 cases while 24 resulted due to their attending different religious congregations. “If we look into the figures of August, they indicate that most of the patients are found positive with ILI/SARI symptoms and also found positive at the walk-in booths. The number of people with history of foreign/domestic travel and also those attending religious congregations have reduced drastically. The contact tracing activities are also yielding positive cases,” said an officer from the health department who wished not to be named. Dr VB Jindal, president of the Ghaziabad chapter of the Indian Medical Association said that the administration must increase random testing in high incidence areas and contact tracing. “These are three core areas where there is high possibility to detect positive cases. Apart from these, people should also be encouraged to come out and get tested. The testing should continue at the same level and immediate tracing of contacts is must. With these, we hope that more cases can be detected and treated timely,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/random-testing-helped-ghaziabad-discover-most-of-its-positive-cases/story-PqRZ57fc6do3Vl26WmNYxL.html

Mandal general secretary Kamaljit Panchhi added that the odd-even restrictions were especially bad for the small traders in some of the congested markets as they didn’t have enough money to make ends meet.The traders have also reached out to municipal commissioner KK Yadav and BJP president Arun Sood regarding the issue.The mandal had held a virtual conference with heads of all markets of the city where it was decided that if weekend and odd-even restrictions were not removed, market-wise protests will be started throughout the city this weekend.Vohra, however, confirmed that the UT adviser was sympathetic to the problems faced by the traders and they were hopeful that the curbs would be revoked at the war room meeting on Friday.TRICITY SALON BODY MEETS UT ADVISERThe Tricity Salon Association also met with the UT adviser over the weekend restrictions issue. Veer Kaul of Headmasters Salon in Sector 8-C, who was present in the meeting, said weekends accounted for around 50% of their business and the administration’s decision to close non-essential shops had especially affected salon owners. They also discussed details of ‘Save the Barbers’ campaign that the association has started with the Rotary Club of Chandigarh.AAP FOR ENDING ODD-EVEN SYSTEMThe city unit of Aam Admi Party (AAP) has demanded relaxation in the weekend lockdown, besides the withdrawal of odd-even system for shops in congested markets.An APP delegation led by its convenor Prem Garg, along with organising secretary Vikram Pundir, met UT adviser Manoj Parida on Thursday and submitted a memorandum for not labelling a locality or area as containment zone where one or two persons test positive for Covid-19. “Declaration of an area as containment zone results in untold miseries on the residents and their lives get disturbed,” the delegation stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/will-protest-if-market-curbs-not-retracted-chandigarh-traders-to-ut-admn/story-WzOaR5mpSCqhpLWfjyZIOM.html
27-08-2020||Noida||National Fertilizers Limited promotes Warli painting on its walls||Noida-based National Fertilizers Limited (NFL), a central Public Sector Undertaking, and country’s leading fertilizers manufacturer, is promoting warli painting. The paintings, done by a few artists who were rendered jobless in the last few months, now adorn its outer wall of the Sector 24 Noida head office. Warli painting is a style of tribal art mostly created by the people from the North Sahyadri Range in Maharashtra. The Warli culture is centered on the concept of nature and its elements are often focal points depicted in the painting. These rudimentary wall paintings use a set of basic geometric shapes: a circle, a triangle, and a square for depiction. Virendra Nath Datt, NFL chairperson and managing director, said these paintings display the life of rural India, which the company primarily caters to. “NFL manufactures 38 lakh metric tonne urea annually in its plants located at Nangal & Bathinda in Punjab; Panipat in Haryana; and Vijaipur in Guna district of Madhya Pradesh. The company has been serving the farming community for the last four and half decade through its products. In continuation with the same intention, we decided to promote the painting at our office,” he said. He said that he had seen some wall paintings in Noida city and planned to use similar painting at the office. “We came to know that some artists had made paintings on the pillars of Noida elevated road. We contacted them and received information that they were jobless after the coronavirus outbreak and the lockdown. Last week we engaged five artists who completed the work in four days,” he said. “We are getting good feedback from local people and visitors. We may also install such paintings at our manufacturing plants,” said Sanjeev Randeva, deputy general manager, corporate communication, NFL. NFL is serving the rural communities through different projects including rural electrification by installation of solar lights, construction of toilets in government schools, rejuvenation of village ponds, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/national-fertilizers-limited-promotes-warli-painting-on-its-walls/story-QS154Rt5jzAWbBgJVwsWkK.html
27-08-2020||Noida||Noida: Parents demand fee waiver, hold demonstration outside school||A group of parents on Thursday demonstrated outside the JSS Public School in Noida’s Sector 61 demanding tuition fee reduction. The parents said that most of them have faced salary cuts and job losses and hence are unable to pay the fee.Akhilesh Kumar Singh, one of the parents, said due to the pandemic, the incomes of most of the people have been adversely affected while some have even lost their jobs. “People are unable to pay the EMIs of their loans and meet other expenses. The parents requested the school management to waive 50% tuition fee till normalcy returns. We also wrote emails to the school management but they did not reply. We then decided to protest,” he said. He added that the school sought salary slips and other financial documents of parents when asked for fee waivers. Manoj Kumar Kataria, another parent, said the school has stopped classroom teachings since lockdown began. “Their expenses have reduced as the school is closed. They are organising online classes but this facility is no match to face-to-face classroom teaching. This is why we demand reduction of fee,” he said. “We want the school management to address this problem so that our children can continue to study in the same school uninterrupted,” he added.The school runs classes from nursery to class 12 and has a quarterly fee of Rs 15,000. Naina Singh, principal of JSS Public School, said a delegation of parents had met her over their demands. “The parents had raised concerns in the previous month as well and we had reduced the fee by 10%. We have not increased the tuition fee in this academic year. The parents are demanding a 50% reduction in tuition fee. We will discuss the issue with the school management to resolve the issue,” Singh said. Meanwhile, Alok Singh, a parent and resident of Sector Alpha 1, said parents are raising fee waiver demands in Greater Noida-based schools as well. “We know schools are closed and the managements of schools are not incurring expenses on water, power, maintenance, transportation, etc. On the other hand, some parents have faced salary trims and job loss. In such a situation, schools should understand parents’ grievances and reduce the fee,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-parents-demand-fee-waiver-hold-demonstration-outside-school/story-wm1ecgR1rOoE64qkHvG5cN.html

27-08-2020||City||DDA to start public consultation for Delhi’s master plan 2041 from Sept 2||New Delhi: The Delhi Development Authority will start public consultations for the preparation of Master Plan of Delhi-2041, a vision document for the city’s development in the next two decades, from September 2.The existing Master Plan of Delhi-2021, which came into effect on February 7, 2007, will be in force till the new plan is notified. To begin with, the land-owning agency will call resident welfare associations of unauthorised colonies. The Centre, last year, had started the process of giving ownership rights to residents of Delhi 1,731 unauthorised colonies -- which has become a core issue and a bone of contention between Delhi’s political parties.A senior DDA official said, “To begin this process, an online meeting will be held on September 2 with RWAs of unauthorised colonies of Delhi. This is to understand the issues in their localities and discuss possible solutions for improving the quality of life of residents in these areas.”The DDA has roped in the National Institute of Urban Afffairs, an advisory body under the Union minister of Housing and urban affairs, for the preparation of MPD-2041.The DDA had started the process to confer ownership rights to residents in unauthorised colonies in December 2019. Just days before the model code of conduct for the Delhi assembly elections was put in force, the Centre had handed over ownership rights documents to 20 property owners under the Pradhan Mantri Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana (PM-UDAY). Close to 30% to 35% of the city’s population live in 1,731 unauthorised colonies in Delhi.The DDA official said that for the consultation process, RWAs of these colonies can register by sending an e-mail at mpd2041@gmail.com. The land-owning agency has also launched an interactive microsite ‘Public Engagement Portal for MPD-2041’ for dissemination of information about the consultative process, the official said.DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain said, “We look forward to active participation from the people of Delhi and seek their support towards shaping a shared vision for Delhi.”The DDA official said that the land-owning agency plans to hold large-scale consultative meetings with various groups. But due to the Coronavirus pandemic, these meetings will be held online.After unauthorised colonies, DDA will hold meetings with various stakeholders and citizen groups such as RWAs, market and trader associations, industry associations, informal sector, women, children and youth, professional bodies and associations, etc., in the next two months.The NIUA has been asked to submit the draft MPD-2041by December this year, another official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dda-to-start-public-consultation-for-delhi-s-master-plan-2041-from-sept-2/story-lLUlPGeCEtsFB2PkiC0gwM.html
27-08-2020||Delhi||Consider giving subsidised tickets to DU students, HC tells railways ministry||The Delhi high court on Thursday directed the ministry of railways to consider issuing confirmed train tickets to specially abled Delhi University students who have to appear in person for their final-year exams that are to start from September 14.The court put forward the suggestion after it was informed that many students living in far-off cities were not in a condition to arrange travel and stay in Delhi for the duration of their exams from September 14 to October 1.HT had earlier reported that the second leg of the open book examination (OBE) for final-year students will be conducted in both online and offline modes so that students can choose the mode they prefer.A bench of justice Hima Kohli and justice Subramonium Prasad was hearing pleas by law student Prateek Sharma and the National Federation for Blind seeking to set up effective mechanisms for visually impaired and the specially abled students. Senior advocate Santosh Rungta, appearing for National Federation for Blind , told the court that 222 students with disabilities, who could not appear in the first leg of OBE, were apprehensive about appearing in person for the second leg because of several constraints.He said that while his organisation was ready to bear the expenses of the boarding and lodging of students, it was the responsibility of the government to ensure that students do not suffer.The court then directed the ministry of human resources development (now ministry of education) to approach the railways ministry and request it to arrange the travel of students with disabilities from states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh, among others, to Delhi.It asked the two ministries, and the ministry of social justice to file separate affidavits on the feasibility of providing subsidised tickets to students and to ensure that students reach the city at least five days prior to the examination.It also asked students with disabilities to specify the mode— online or offline — in which they would prefer to attempt the exam, while also directing them to mail their credentials to Delhi University if they want to come to the city to take the examination in person.Senior advocate Sachin Datta, appearing for the varsity, said students who are unable to appear in person for the exam, can take the examination in the online format.However, Rungta said that while it was easier for students to arrange scribes in Delhi, it would be difficult for them to do so in other states. Following this, the court asked the ministries to look into the issue and posted the matter for further hearing on September 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/consider-giving-subsidised-tickets-to-du-students-hc-tells-railways-ministry/story-jIlIQOa1DFXVoc29v1ERqM.html
27-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi woman’s distress email to British PM sends police into a tizzy; she is rescued from Rohini in 2 hours||A “distress email” from a Delhi woman to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday night (Indian time), seeking his urgent help and threatening to kill herself if help did not reach her in two hours, send the Delhi Police into a tizzy, with officers acting swiftly to locate and rescue her.The sensitive nature of her email had Johnson’s office contacting the Indian High Commission in London, which in turn alerted the external affairs ministry (MEA) in Delhi. The ministry wasted no time in passing on the information to the Delhi Police, seeking their “immediate intervention” in saving the woman’s life, officers privy to the matter said. The Delhi Police launched a “door-to-door search operation” and within two hours, they managed to trace her location to a house in Rohini’s Sector 21 from where she was rescued, the police said. “The woman was found living in an unhygienic condition and it looked like her house had not been cleaned in years. The woman was of poor mental health possibly due to breakdown of her marriage and a huge financial burden from past loans,” deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pramod Kumar Mishra said. DCP Mishra said on Wednesday around 11pm -- it was around 6.30pm in London -- the 42-year-old woman sent the email to Johnson, seeking his urgent help and sounding to be in an extremely distressed state of mind. She further said that “if help is not met in the next two hours, she would commit suicide”. “The Indian high commission in London immediately contacted the MEA officials in India and sought their quick response as the woman’s life appeared to be at stake. Subsequently, the information reached Aman Vihar police station from where 10 personnel were sent to locate her,” Mishra said. The information sharing procedure from London to the Delhi Police involved multiple channels and took around 45 minutes. The 10-member Aman Vihar police team took around an hour to locate her, said a police officer, requesting anonymity. Asked how the woman got Johnson’s email address, DCP Mishra said, “She is being counselled. As and when we get this information, we will share it.”An officer, who was part of the rescue team, said the rescue was difficult as they only had her name and an incomplete address to go by. The team had to undertake a door-to-door search. All the while, police kept trying the phone number mentioned in the email, but there was no answer. “With the help of local security guards and residents, we reached the building where the woman lived alone on the third floor. However, despite our repeated persuasions, the woman did not open the door. So, we called in a team from the fire department and while they were about to break open the door, she opened it,” the officer said. DCP Mishra said the woman looked fraught with anxiety and fear.She requested the rescue team to leave and told them that “she was okay”. Obliging her, only a few officers stayed back while the others left. Thereafter, the officers counselled her and went inside the house to find some 16-18 cats roaming around, he said. During the course of counselling, the officer said, the woman told them that she used to teach at a municipal school but resigned because of personal reasons. The woman also spoke of her divorce, almost a decade ago, and her financial crisis. “It appears that the stress of the financial burden took a toll on her mental health. We called in two psychologists and a doctor to address her problems and advise us if we should obtain the requisite assent to shift her to the Institute of Human Behaviour & Allied Sciences for further treatment,” DCP Mishra said.A police officer said the woman is currently at her home and is being counselled. Her house has also been cleaned, the officer said.No other official comment was forthcoming on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-woman-s-distress-email-to-british-pm-sends-police-into-a-tizzy-she-is-rescued-from-rohini-in-2-hours/story-buy4yCoJjRBKOuFIo9rwTI.html

As soon as the house proceedings began, AAP councillors entered well of the house started shouting slogans against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which rules the civic body. Following the ruckus, the house was adjourned for the day.Vikas Goel, leader of opposition in the north corporation, alleged that purchase of anti-larvae chemical was a scam running into crores of rupees. “They (the BJP leaders in the civic body) appointed their favourite civic official to approve the drug procurement order. They bought the anti-larvae drug at ₹3,256.8 per kilo whereas the same quality drug was bought by Bhopal Municipal Corporation at ₹2,500 a kilo. This is a case of corruption,” Goel said.The AAP councillors demanded suspension of the official involved and also an inquiry into the matter.Jai Prakash, mayor, north corporation, refuted the allegations and said the AAP behaved in an “irresponsible manner” and did not let the house function and deliberate on important issues such as the financial crisis looming large on the civic body.“These are completely baseless allegations. They (the AAP) are rattled by our anti-dengue and malaria campaign. They have no achievements to tell so they are making such allegations,” Prakash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ruckus-in-north-delhi-municipal-corporation-over-purchase-of-anti-dengue-spray/story-3y5mMZMAIiqsRgotBzuD4O.html

We told them that the Sudarshan News has not only tried to tarnish the image of Jamia Millia Islamia and a particular community but the image of Union Public Service Commission as well,” said media coordinator Ahmad Azeem.Jamia’s teachers’ association also condemned the incident earlier in the day and asked the administration to take action on the matter. “The tweet and language in the video is anti-national, it accuses the selection process by UPSC in highly objectionable words. It also targets recruitment of Muslims in the Indian Administrative Services and labels them with the word “Jihadi” and dares how any Muslim can become an Indian administrative officer,” JTA secretary Majid Jamil said, adding that the video puts Jamia’s Residential Coaching Academy in “bad light.”This year, 30 students from Jamia’s Residential Coaching Academy cleared UPSC civil services exams. Indian Police Service (Central) also condemned the video on twitter. “A news story targeting candidates in civil services on the basis of religion is being promoted by Sudarshan TV. We condemn the communal and irresponsible piece of journalism,” the service tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jamia-demands-action-against-sudarshan-news/story-fgyqDh9mO4Q8PuOjOoaC0L.html
27-08-2020||Chandigarh||Frequent Covid infections among Chandigarh admn, MC staff derail public dealing works||With more and more officials and employees of the UT administration and municipal corporation testing positive for Covid-19, the work in public dealing offices has come to a grinding halt.The worst hit by the pandemic are the office of the deputy commissioner (including registrar office), estate office, RLA and the municipal corporation, where already piled up routine works have been delayed by months.One of the busiest public-dealing offices, RLA in Sector 17 was completely shut down on Wednesday after its four employees tested positive in the recent past. Reports of over 40 are awaited.“For transferring ownership of a car, which required one or two days, now the RLA office is giving appointment of two to three months. DC’s office and estate office have also prohibited public visits. Residents are at the receiving end of these shutdowns, as not everyone can easily get through to officials concerned over the phone,” said Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED).RLA, MC LATEST TO GET IMPACTEDBefore the pandemic hit the city in March, at least 800 people visited the RLA office on an average per day. After the lockdown restrictions were lifted in June, RLA introduced online appointments for all its services. But, even then the office saw a daily footfall of nearly 400 people.“The public dealing has been suspended not just for protection of the RLA staff but also the visitors. For now, the office has been closed till August 31, but if more employees test positive, the shutdown may be extended,” said a senior UT official, requesting anonymity.On Thursday, parts of MC office in Sector 17, including the booking department, vendors’ registration office, fire department, etc., were sealed for 48 hours after a social development officer tested positive. He was into public dealing with street vendors among others.Earlier, other parts of the MC office were sealed after an official of the additional commissioner-level was found infected.“MC deals with the daily needs of residents, so it is difficult to shut down the entire office. Things are tough, but we have to manage somehow,” said an MC official, not wishing to be named.FREQUENT SHUTDOWNS AT DC AND ESTATE OFFICESince July, when the city started to witness sharp surge in Covid-19 cases, the DC office and estate office in Sector 17 have been frequently closed whenever their employees test positive. Even after the offices are reopened after disinfection, public access to offices remains limited to just an hour, that too with appointment, often restricted to two or three a day. A senior estate official said, “Though the diary desk is open, work in the public dealing departments has been affected. When an employee tests positive, we have to quarantine all their contacts, which is a sizable number and affects staffing. Then, other staffers also go on leave fearing risk of infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/frequent-covid-positive-cases-among-chandigarh-mc-staff-derail-public-dealing-works/story-vC8u8J39CQ1nEPzMEV8sbI.html

27-08-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh increases testing, but high positivity rate remains a concern||Under fire for the last few months over low testing rates, Chandigarh has, for the first time, managed to test 700 samples in a 24-hour cycle. The feat, however, has been marred by the high positivity rate of 12%, which is four percent more than the national average.A community health expert at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), not wishing to be named, said, “The high positivity rate indicates that authorities are testing sick patients and those reporting for testing which is as per the established protocol. However, if more random samples within the high-risk and low-risk groups are taken, the positivity rate will eventually go down.”When contacted, UT health secretary Arun Gupta said the city has now brought its testing rate to 700 a day and this number will be further be increased to keep up with the infection spread. “There is no target to be achieved here. We will go according to the virus spread. More people will come under the ambit of testing as the infection spreads,” he said. The city’s testing rate was 150 a day in July, which jumped to 500 in early August and has now touched 700. Gupta added that number has increased after antigen tests were also included for the detection of infection in the asymptomatic cases. UT’s test per million ratio currently stands at 23,381.7, which is less than the national average of 28,941.8.TRACKING UT’s POSITIVITY RATEChandigarh’s positivity rate (number of tests turning positive per 100 tests) has grown from 7% on August 1 to 12% in just 27 days. According to the World Health Organisation’s suggestions, a city’s positivity rate should remain below 5% for 14 days before it can be considered that the outbreak is under control.Director, health services, Chandigarh, Dr G Dewan said, “Chandigarh is carrying out high-quality testing of symptomatic cases reporting in flu clinics established by the UT health department.

27-08-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration to spend ₹10 lakh on urgent cleaning of Sukhna Lake||Keeping in mind the increase in the water level of the Sukhna Lake due to incessant rains, the UT administration has decided to spend ₹10 lakh on immediate cleaning of garbage and weeds from the water resource.The officials of the UT engineering department said that though cleaning is annual work, the present drive is an urgent matter because of flooding caused by the release of excess water from Sukhna flood gates.“The high court has also issued guidelines from time to time regarding the cleaning of Sukhna Lake. The heavy growth of weeds and garbage lower the water storage capacity of the lake. Last year, a private agency hired by the engineering department had begun cleaning in October, but had to suspend it with the lockdown in March this year,” said a senior department official wishing not to be named.The department has now floated a fresh tender, and after the work is allotted, it will take another six months to complete.On August 23, the flood gates had to be opened after the water level crossed the danger mark of 1163 feet. The resulting discharge wreaked havoc down the Sukhna choe in the low-lying areas of Baltana in Zirakpur, Mohali. There was widespread damage and several areas were submerged in 8-10 feet flood waters. In Chandigarh, too, several bridges constructed on the Sukhna choe had to be closed to traffic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-administration-to-spend-10-lakh-on-urgent-cleaning-of-sukhna-lake/story-unYlHs8OWYB2y6TxO3rc1J.html

27-08-2020||Lucknow||SP removes backward classes cell chief after anti-Ram remarks||Samajwadi Party (SP) on Monday removed Lotanram Nishad as president of the party’s backwards classes cell (pichda varg prakoshth)reportedly over his recent remarks against Lord Ram.Nishad had called Lord Ram “fictitious” in Ayodhya on August 19.The party’s state president Naresh Uttam Patel on Monday issued a letter, stating that Lotanram Nishad was replaced by Rajpal Kashyap (a backward caste leader and member of the UP Legislative Council). The step was taken with the consent of the party’s national president, the letter added.Patel has asked Kashyap to form a new state executive of the cell within 15 days.When asked about the reason for the party’s decision, a senior party spokesperson said: “It’s the SP national president’s decision. Anyway, you are wise to guess.”Lotanram Nishad was not available for his comment.Nishad had been appointed to the post in March. The backwards classes cell is one of the most significant caste/community cells of the party, which has a support base of backward classes and Muslims. Nishad had expressed his views on Lord Ram before reporters during a visit to Ayodhya. The visit was part of the tours he had been undertaking since his appointment.Nishad’s utterance came as an embarrassment to the party that had given unwritten instructions to its members not to make statements against any deity, Ayodhya temple or mosque.Going against the party line, Nishad had said: “I am least bothered if a temple comes up for Ram or a temple comes up for Krishna. I have nothing to do with Ram, I have no faith in Ram...This is my personal view. My faith is in Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar’s Constitution, Karpoouri Thakur, Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj, Jyotiba Phule, Savitri Bai Phule who gave us the right to speak, get jobs, get an education, and political power. I know those who directly benefited me. If Ram ever was or not, I even put a question mark on his existence. He is a fictitious character, the way it is in the movies. He is part of a story. Even the Constitution said that there was no Ram.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/sp-removes-backward-classes-cell-chief-after-anti-ram-remarks/story-zKYDI0zwDCVAt143RZfQhK.html

27-08-2020||City||Case against 54 for dumping debris on Pawana blueline||PUNE: A case has been registered against 54 people living near the blue line of Pawana river for dumping debris and waste.The booked people are mainly residents living near the blue line in Kasarwadi area of Pimpri-Chinchwad, according to the police.“They are small-time farmers living nearby. It is not a major encroachment as we see it. It is the job of municipal corporation, but since they have lodged a complaint, we have registered a case. A panchnama will be conducted and due process will be followed,” said senior inspector Shankar Awtade of Bhosari police station.The complaint was lodged by Rajendra Vasantrao Dumbre, deputy engineer in the building permission department at Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC).“They had been served with notices in the past. As the PCMC noticed that the debris is still there, they lodged a complaint and a case was registered. After the notice served months ago, PCMC officials realised that they had not moved the debris,” said sub-inspector Bhimsen Shikhare of Bhosari police station who is investigating the case.There are several spots along the Pawana as well as the Mula-Mutha rivers that run through the city. The issue of debris dumping must be discussed in the light of flash floods and intense rainfall in the city in the past few years. Satellite images could be a solution to finding these spots in an efficient manner, according to Sarang Yadwadkar, architect and environment activist from Pune.“One can use Google Earth and go back on the timeline and then check for spots to find out where debris has been dumped and where new constructions have cropped up. It can be compared with images from different points in the timeline. The issue, however, with Google Earth is that it is two dimensional. I have presented such images before court as well (for Mula-Mutha river bed). In fact, the state government had come up with a notification to have high resolution satellite images taken in city as well as river bed. But no corporation has followed the notification,” said Yadwadkar.A case under Section 53 of Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 along with Sections 260, 261, 267 and 472 of Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 was registered at Bhosari police station against the offenders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/case-against-54-for-dumping-debris-on-pawana-blueline/story-427ykDxE3jhaOXsb7Rz1oI.html

In the meantime, Vidyapati Sewa Sansthan (VSS), a literary and cultural organisation of Mithila region, has accused the state government of plotting to brand makhana of Mithila in the name of Bihar.“Mithila is known across the globe for its specific aquatic crop makhana, which is intimately associated with local culture and is often held synonymous with it,” said VSS general secretary Baidyanath Choudhary ‘Baiju’. He said Mithila region was the largest producer of makhana in the country. Hence, its branding must be in the form of Mithila Makhana, and not in name of Bihar Makhana.Former Darbhanga MP Kirti Azad said Thursday that makhana crop had been associated with Mithila since ancient times and the ongoing effort to obtain GI tag in the name of Bihar makhana had triggered widespread protests on different forums. Azad has also sent a letter addressed to BAU’s dean while suggesting that GI tagging should be in the name of Mithila Makhana.According to a Darbhanga based college principal Prof Vidyanath Jha, who is regarded as an eminent makhana researcher, “Makhana is one of the unique flora found in Mithila region, which accounts for 75 percent of makhana production in India. The aquatic crop is produced across over a dozen districts of north Bihar.”Former principal of MLSM College, Darbhanga, Anil Kumar Jha, said Madhubani, Darbhanga, Saharsa, Katihar, Purnia, Araria, Supaul, Sitamarhi and Katihar districts of Mithila region were main centres for makhana production.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-branding-row-bid-for-gi-tag-for-makhana-hits-hurdle/story-WFN1D6adQxrF5ukzMelQoI.html

On August 20, the HAM-S had quit the opposition’s Grand Alliance, after spending 30 months as a constituent. For the record, Manjhi, a former chief minister, denied having any political deliberations with Kumar and told reporters that the talks centred on local issues and problems. “Political talks have not yet taken place, they are likely to be held soon. Wait till August 30 about party’s decision. “Today’s talks with Kumar were on local issues,” Manjhi said as he emerged from the CM residence.Recently, Manjhi joined one of the virtual inauguration programmes of Nitish Kumar. The CM notice the HAM-S chief only at the end of his speech and welcomed him for supporting government programmes and policies. The HAM chief is the lone member of his party in the Legislative Assembly currently. According to NDA sources, HAM wants to contest 15-20 seats, mostly in the Magadh region, but JD(Uis willing to give his party 10-12 seats. Some of these seats are also considered BJP’s stronghold. “I will talk to you (media persons) on August 30,” he said, when asked about seats offered by JD (U). NDA in Bihar comprises BJP, JD(U) and LJP at present. JD (U) sources said Manjhi could be a Dalit face of the party after the exit of Shyam rajak, who joined the RJD.Manjhi, however, made it clear his party was not going to merge with any other political outfit, contrary to speculation.Manjhi, formerly with JD(U), quit the party in 2015 after he was forced to step down as the chief minister to make way for the return of Nitish Kumar to the post. He later formed the HAM(S) and joined the BJP-led NDA.With Kumar returning to the NDA in July 2017, Manjhi quit the alliance and joined the opposition alliance in Bihar. His party unsuccessfully contested three Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general elections. Mahadalits and Dalits form 16% of Bihar’s population of Bihar, as per the 2011 census.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/manjhi-meets-nitish-says-nothing-political/story-wQ2cMEuI9RgevC8PJJDUgI.html

If you fall in the category of people who won’t last a minute, you have surely had an overdose of the digital world. The coronavirus pandemic has made our laptops and phones, our new best friends. The primary source of binge watching shows, paying games, and even seeking entertainment is the Internet. But, some individuals have found ways to detox from the constant barrage of social media and work apps.Exercise your body and mind“I have made it a point to put my phone on silent once I log out from work, which is often at 9pm. Post that, I don’t check my social media accounts. I recently also deactivated my Twitter account. It was getting too much to handle. The need to constantly have my phone on me was overwhelming,” says Delhi-based lawyer Aman Saxena. He also recommends going for a run in the evening to clear one’s head.Break up with your phone Priya Choudhary, a Noida based content writer, says she breaks up with her phone at least once every week. “I have a weekly target — to go an entire day without checking my social media accounts. Plus, I would play online video games for hours; thankfully some apps were banned and I can’t do that anymore. But if this work from home situation is to persist, I am working on incorporating regular exercise into my regime,” she adds.Rule of 8For Delhite Pooja Bhateley, staying connected with people holds immense value during the pandemic. “I’m surrounded by screens all day for work. Once I am done for the day, I talk to my family, and spend time with my partner instead of going back online. I follow the rule of 8s — eight hours for work, eight hours for sleep and eight hours for things I find interesting, whether it’s cooking, reading or gardening,” she says.Curb your internet addictionSaurabh Mehrotra, a Gurugram-based psychiatrist, opines internet addiction has risen during the pandemic. “This addiction is seen in various forms. Addiction to social media, pornography, gaming, shopping and even blogging. Internet addiction leads to problems in physical and psychological health, sleep disturbances, academic decline or poor productivity and problems in interpersonal relationships,” he says. “It’s essential to monitor your screen time,” he suggests and recommends engaging in positive addictions such as reading, sports, music and arts so that people don’t feel burnt out.Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/digital-detox-can-t-go-a-minute-without-being-online-here-are-some-tips-to-try/story-tiUiyXFMl9vhRIflCcM1yN.html

In the latest rankings, announced for smart cities across the country, Pimpri-Chinchwad is ranked at 61.Ahmedabad, Surat and Indore are ranked in the top three spots. In Maharashtra Nashik has been ranked 15th at the national-level and first in the state. Ahmedabad, Surat and Indore are ranked in the top three spots. In Maharashtra Nashik has been ranked 15th at the national-level and first in the state, while Nagpur is ranked 42nd, Sollapur 43rd, Thane 55th and Aurangabad 66th. Oppositions parties in the city, immediately sought to blame the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), for failing to carry out planned schemes under the Pune smart city initiative.Pune Smart City Development Corporation chief executive officer (CEO) Rubal Agarwal confirmed the 28th ranking and said, “Some of the projects are going on as a public-private partnership. Pune smart city has not been able to give information of completed projects to the central team. Overall, our ranking has come down, but it will improve.”The Smart City mission is a project personally driven by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Pune’s missed the number one ranking in 2019 by a point margin of 0.5. Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) leader and former mayor Prashnat Jagtap said, “During my tenure as mayor, Pune ranked second after Bhubaneshwar. The Prime Minister himself launched the project from Pune in 2016. PMC did this on the basis of works carried out by NCP and Congress in its tenure. In 2017, BJP won an absolute majority, but local BJP leaders neglected the scheme. Now BJP will try to blame administration and will not accept their failure.”Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “Due to the Covid situation, Smart City is not able to spend money. Even the administration is responsible for the degradation. It is the responsibility of the administration to execute the schemes.”Pune Smart city director Ravindra Dhangekar said, “All the top IAS officers are on the Smart City board. They should take care of the maintaining the position.

Gurdaspur SSP Rajinder Singh Sohal said, “We received a complaint from Kiranpreet Khakh, of Ranjit Bagh locality of Dinanagar, on August 5. She claimed she was tricked into providing detailed information about herself, on the pretext of a job, leading to fraudulent withdrawal from her bank account.” He added that she had uploaded her biodata on an employment portal, after which she received phone calls from two different phone numbers. “The speakers told her they had checked her biodata and the process to recruit her is on. They sent her a link of an online form on WhatsApp, which she filled out giving her complete information. Then she received an One-Time Password (OTP) that she conveyed to those who called her, after they demanded it. Within minutes, her bank account was debited of Rs 5 lakh and transferred to other accounts,” he said.On her complaint, a case was registered under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and 66 of the IT Act at the Dinangar police station. On the basis of the details of the bank accounts to which the money was transferred, police chalked out a plan. A team went to Delhi to execute the arrests. Those arrested are Pardeep Kumar, Jeetu, Neeraj Sharma and Jai Parkash. “Those arrested are part of a gang that has Asees Mittal and Manish Kumar as kingpins. Under the garb of running a money transfer firm, they were duping people. Manish forged documents such as Aadhaar cards, voter card, driving license etc. By zeroing in on mobile numbers, they collected their details on the pretext of fulfilling their requirement. After they had the bank account details etc, they transferred the money, in a very clever manner,” Sohal added. The items recovered from those arrested are a scanner, a camera, a DVR box, 37 swipe machines of banks and seven fake Aadhaar cards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gang-of-online-fraudsters-busted-4-held-from-delhi/story-38lvLsUibxFp0Kg0BxROYI.html

Taking cognisance, PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar said, “It was found that two of the artificial tanks used by one of the contractors were old and not cleaned properly, but they were not dustbin containers. We have taken strict action against the contractor and he has been black listed for three years.” The fifth-day immersion, observed locally as the “grand immersion” day is very much part of the Ganesh festival in Pune, this year muted in its public observance, but still resonant in faith and devotion. PMC expects an average of five lakh idols to be immersed on Thursday and has already increased the number of artificial immersion tanks across the city. However, it has appealed to citizens to immerse the Ganpati idols at home as far as possible. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “There are an increasing number of Covid-19 positive cases in Pune and during this crisis situation it will not be safe to come out for Ganpati visarjan. So we appeal to citizens to immerse their Ganpati idols at home. PMC is making ammonium bicarbonate available and by using it, idols can be immersed at home. If there is a problem, then citizens can immerse the idol in the ‘tanks on wheels’ or donate the idol at the donation centres.” Residents can get ammonium bicarbonate from the ward office or immersion centre in their area and can even donate the idols here. Also, ‘tanks on wheels’ will operate on various routes in the city and the routes are decided by the respective wards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-civic-body-blacklists-contractor-for-using-old-tanks-for-immersion-purposes/story-Sfl49HBCb4qriq3qcVyUOO.html
27-08-2020||Mumbai||Cannot discriminate against Shia Muslims: Bombay high court directs state to allow Muharram rituals||The Bombay high court (HC) has said that it would be discriminatory if the Shia Muslims, who are seeking permission to commemorate the martyrdom of Imam Hussain by observing rituals as per the norms laid down by the Maharashtra government’s disaster management department, are barred, as a similar approval was given to the Hindus to celebrate the annual 10-day Ganesh Utsav that started on August 22, despite the prevailing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. The observations were made while hearing a petition filed by All India Idara Tahfaz-e-Hussainiyat, an organisation from south Mumbai, which had sought directions to the state government to allow a limited number of people be allowed to perform mehendi, alam and taziya rituals for the Muharram.HC has asked the state government and the disaster management department to hear the petitioner and submit their report by Friday (August 28) morning. A two-member HC division bench, comprising justices SJ Kathawalla and Madhav Jamdar, while hearing the petition on Thursday, was informed that Shia Muslims in Mumbai and Maharashtra desired to observe a period of mourning for two hours on four days of the Islamic month of Muharram – from August 27 to 30 -- by performing rituals.Advocate Rajendra Shirodkar, who appeared for the petitioner along with advocate Shehzad Naqvi, submitted that the Shia Mulsims were seeking permission for a group of 20-50 of them to perform the rituals through a procession, which would start at Bhendi Bazar and end at Mazgaon Kabrastan in Mumbai. When the court sought to know about the mehendi, alam and taziya rituals, Shirodkar explained that a group of Shia Muslims would carry flags and replicas of the mausoleum of Imam Hussain and go from Bhendi Bazar to Mazgaon. However, HC was not convinced and sought an explainer that was submitted by Shirodkar later in the day. Shirodkar submitted that though the prayer was made for 20-50 Shia Muslims, the number of participants could be reduced as per the court’s order. State additional government pleader Geeta Shastri and government pleader Poornima Kantharia opposed the petition.They stated that the petition was seeking permission for a procession, where thousands of Shia Muslims take part in the annual procession and it should not be allowed because of the prevailing viral outbreak and it would impossible for the state authorities to enforce social distancing norms.Kantharia submitted since Ganesh Utsav processions were not permitted, similarly there should be a ban on the Muharram procession. Earlier, Shastri informed HC that the Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday had rejected a petition for carrying out Muharram processions throughout the country following which the court perused the summary of the apex court’s order. The court observed that there was no SC order barring Muharram processions across the country. The court stated that the petition in SC was only for taking out a procession in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, and other states were not involved in it. “If limited permissions are issued for Lord Ganesha, then refusing permissions for Muharram would be discriminatory. Hence, we direct the (state) authorities to give the petitioner a hearing and decide on it,” said Justice Kathawalla. The court directed Amitabh Gupta, principal secretary (home), Maharashtra; and Kishor Raje Nimbalkar, secretary, disaster management department, Maharashtra, to give the petitioner a hearing. The court also directed Gupta and Nimbalkar to submit a report on the state government’s decision on Friday morning.HC will hear the case again in the first half on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cannot-discriminate-against-shia-muslims-bombay-high-court-directs-state-to-allow-muharram-rituals/story-va6Do07gdy8j55Sl9r3DrK.html

27-08-2020||Pune||Clinical trial of Oxford Covid-19 vaccine begins in Pune, 2 get first shot||Two volunteers from the city became the first in the country to be administered phase II of the ‘Covishield’ vaccine developed by Oxford University and being mass-produced by Pune based Serum Institute of India (SII). Of the five volunteers who came forward to get vaccinated, three were declined doses after they were detected with antibodies for Covid. Phase II will determine the safety of the vaccine to check if volunteers report any reactions. Two male volunteers aged 31 and 48 were found eligible and will now be followed up for any symptoms or reactions due to the vaccine. The trials were conducted at Pune’s Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital and research centre on Wednesday, where all the five volunteers were tested for infection and for comorbidities. The volunteers were explained possible reactions that they might experience in a short course of time or in the near future. Like all clinical trials, the participants were covered through an insurance, sponsored by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Serum Institute in this case. The sponsors also paid travel allowance for the participants. This was the first dose and participants were asked to stay for about 30 minutes to check for immediate reactions and then would be contacted through phone calls for the next seven days. On the 28th day, they would be called again for the second dose when they would be physically examined again and again, on the 56th day, and then, six months after the first dose. Dr Sanjay Lalwani, medical director at Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical College, Hospital and research centre said, “This trial will determine the safety of the vaccine, like to check for any pain, fever, nausea or any other reactions. About 100 volunteers at 14 sites across the country will be selected for this trial, who will be checked for any reactions which will determine the safety of the vaccine. Since we have first started, we expect about 25 such volunteers.” According to Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director at the hospital said, every fourth person is administered with a placebo to ensure that it is not a placebo effect. Once the vaccine is found safe then the others would be tested for efficacy. “There are many more questions that need to be answered like will the antibodies produced through this vaccine be neutralising antibodies or how long will the antibodies stay in the body. In the worst-case scenario, the vaccine would not work but even if it is able to avoid complications then it would be a great deal. This is a completely new virus and so if we have a vaccine which even prevents complications and brings down case fatality or deaths due to Covid19 then it is definitely a breakthrough. For now, we need to first check that it is safe,” he said. Maharashtra civil supplies and consumer protection minister, Dr Vishwajeet Kadam said that these volunteers were selected as per ICMR guidelines and those who are eligible will be vaccinated.  “Once the vaccine is found to be safe on these healthy volunteers, the vaccine will be given to Covid-19 patients too. The medical and research team at Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital will keep a watch on these volunteers who are vaccinated,” Kadam said. Dr Oswal also added that three of the five were asymptomatic Covid-19 positives at some point of time and were recovered from the virus without them realising about the infection. This does show a high prevalence in the city but is also good news that antibodies are being generated. Earlier, the ISSER Sero-survey had found that over 50 per cent of the 1,600 samples collected from highly affected areas tested positive for antibodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/clinical-trial-of-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-begins-in-pune-2-get-first-shot/story-3pPfYpwHP6bJND9epHVYtL.html

In a press statement, the ED said that the charge sheet (also called Prosecution Complaint) under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) has been filed in Patna with a prayer for awarding punishment to the accused persons of money laundering. The agency has sought that his movable and immovable properties worth Rs 8.8 crore, which have already been attached, be confiscated. ED initiated the investigation under the provisions of PMLA based on two FIRs registered by Mahila Police Station, Muzaffarpur, and an FIR lodged by CBI Patna against Brajesh Thakur and others for misappropriating the funds/ grant-in-aid received from the government and other agencies in the name of the NGO Sewa Sankalp Ewam Vikas Samiti and its sister NGOs. It said that Brajesh Thakur was the de facto owner, who, in connivance with others, misappropriated the fund/grant-in-aid to the tune of Rs 7.57 crore.“Investigation under PMLA revealed that Brajesh Thakur and others diverted/siphoned off the funds/grant-in-aid received for the welfare of girl children and others and used the funds for his personal gain by acquiring huge movable and immovable properties in his name and in the name of his family members—Kumari Asha, Rahul Anand, Manorama Devi and others—for acquiring huge movable and immovable properties including payment of fees for his younger son Mehul Anand’s medical education [sic],” the ED statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/ed-files-charge-sheet-against-man-accused-of-abuse-in-bihar-shelter-home/story-1hUjW4Xrd393rFXbk6S28H.html
27-08-2020||Chandigarh||Supreme Court says its 2004 verdict on sub-classification of SC/STs needs to be reconsidered||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday held that its 2004 verdict holding that states do not have the power to further sub-classify the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, for grant of quotas in jobs and admissions to educational institutions, needs to be revisited. A five-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said the 2004 verdict of a constitution bench in the EV Chinnaiah case needs to be reconsidered and, therefore, the matter be placed before the Chief Justice of India for appropriate direction. The bench, also comprising Justices Indira Banerjee, Vineet Saran, MR Shah and Aniruddha Bose, said in its view the 2004 verdict was not correctly decided and states can make laws to give preferential treatment by sub-classifying caste within SC/STs. The bench referred the case filed by the Punjab government against the high court order before CJI Justice SA Bobde for setting up of a larger bench to revisit the earlier verdict. The Punjab and Haryana high court had struck down a state law empowering the government to sub-classify SC/STs for grant of quotas. The high court had relied on the 2004 verdict of the apex court and held that the Punjab government was not empowered to undertake the exercise of sub classifying SC/STs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/supreme-court-says-its-2004-verdict-on-sub-classification-of-sc-sts-needs-to-be-reconsidered/story-QaVTniO0vIty89heHR4haM.html
27-08-2020||Dehradun||Nanda Devi festival begins sans devotees due to Covid; rituals live on social media||This year the devotees were not able to attend the famous three-day long Nanda Devi festival that started here in Kumaon on Wednesday due to the Covid 19 pandemic. Instead, for the first time, the organisers made arrangements for live-streaming of rituals on social media to overcome the restriction placed on the presence of more than five people inside the temple for the conduct of rituals at a time. The three-day Nanda Devi festival and accompanying fair is also called the Nanda Devi Mahotsav, which generally attracts over a lakh of devotees and is dedicated to Goddess Nanda Devi (Nanda means the joy-giving Goddess), the patron goddess of the residents of Uttarakhand Himalaya, where the Nanda Devi peak is located in Kumaon’s Chamoli district. Nanda Devi is a two-peaked massif, with its eastern summit known as Sunanda Devi. Normally a large number of devotees come to Naina Devi temple to seek blessings from Nanda Devi and her sister Sunanda, whose idols are enshrined in the temple premises in a banana trunk on day one and then taken in a religious procession in a ‘dola’ (palanquin ) on the third day (this year on Friday). Naina Devi is one of the 51 Shakti Peeths, where goddess Sati’s eyes are believed to have fallen after she burnt herself alive in a Yagna. Vinod Kumar, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Nanital, said this year due to the epidemic the district administration decided with the Ram Sewak Sabha and Naina Devi Temple Trust to not allow devotees to offer prayers in person before the idol of Nanda Devi. “This year we are not allowing anybody, except for temple and festival managers in limited numbers, to go physically before the idol to have darshans and offer prayers. We have appealed to people to offer their prayers from their homes and have darshan through live streaming,” he said. Jagdish Chandra Bawari, general secretary Ram Sewak Sabha that organises the festival in Nainital said the festival held in honour of the Nanda Devi and her sister Sunanda is one of the most important festivals in the lives of the people in the hill state. Also Read: NEET, JEE Mains 2020: Uttarakhand govt ready for exams, says it has held board exams for more students“This is for the first time since 1902, when the festival was started, that devotees won’t be able to offer their prayers in person before the idol.

Mukesh Joshi, executive member of Ram Sewak Sabha said there will be no procession of people accompanying the idols before their immersion in the Nanital lake waters on the third day (Friday).“Also, this year, there won’t be any fair, which normally attracts over a lakh people from across Uttarakhand and other states,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/nanda-devi-festival-begins-sans-devotees-due-to-covid-rituals-live-on-social-media/story-XGaHNOntPIlCPzoGM6tU7H.html
27-08-2020||Chandigarh||Bar owners seek Himachal govt’s help to revive business||With hotels in Himachal Pradesh set to resume operations in October and the state government easing Covid-19 curbs to revive the tourism and hospitality sectors, owners have sought the removal of bars from the list of prohibited activities. The Hotel and Restaurant Association of Northern India, associated with the Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India, has urged the government to remove bars from the list of prohibited activities. “The government has allowed restaurants to open and serve food with soft beverages since June but serving of liquor with food has not been allowed. This when the retail sale of liquor was one of the first activities to be unlocked in all states,” says Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, the vice-president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Northern India. He said that the association had put up its demand before Union home minister Amit Shah. “It makes no difference if guests at a table consume food during a dine-in along with a soft drink, coffee or an alcoholic beverage. The bar owners in Shimla have also made a representation to the government. The bar is a general term that should not be linked only with serving alcohol,” he said. “The government should normalise the opening of shops, restaurants, and eating joints just as it was before Covid-19 hit us,” says Sanjay Sood, the owner of Devicos bar and restaurant and president of the Shimla Hotel and Restaurateur Association. There are more than 2,300 hotels and restaurants registered in Himachal Pradesh. CURBS EASED FOR HOTELS The Himachal Pradesh government amended the standard operation procedure to facilitate the tourism industry that has borne heavy losses due to the lockdown. Hotels in Himachal will resume operations in October, almost six months since the lockdown to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. The minimum stay for tourists has been reduced to two days from the earlier five days. Tourists can put up at different destinations. Tourists can visit the state with a Covid-negative report of 72 hours prior to entering the state instead of 96 hours. The information technology department has been asked to modify the electronic-pass software to generate a separate consolidated list of applications under the “tourist category”. The district administration shall scrutinise the uploaded documents within 24 hours of submission of the application. In case a guest at the hotel tests positive, the room will be sealed for 48 hours unlike earlier when it was mandatory to seal the entire unit. “The government’s decision to ease norms is appreciated. We have to see what impact it has on the inflow of tourists. If there is a need to relax the norms further, we will approach the government again,” says Mahinder Seth of the Tourism Industry Stakeholders Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bar-owners-seek-himachal-govt-s-help-to-revive-business/story-Y0YBiDO9GgJ2WziuyIL1GL.html

27-08-2020||Mumbai||Decision on reopening gyms, places of worship likely in September first week: Sanjay Raut||Sanjay Raut, a Rajya Sabha (RS) member from the Shiv Sena, said that the Maharashtra government is expected to take a decision on reopening gymnasiums and religious places of worship in September.The demand to reopen gymnasiums and religious places of worship, despite the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19), has been gaining momentum in Maharashtra.Several leaders, including from the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government, comprising the Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, have also demanded the reopening of gymnasiums and religious places of worship. Earlier in August, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had allowed gymnasiums and religious places of worship to be reopened amid the pandemic. However, the state government has been treading cautiously on this policy decision, as Maharashtra has emerged as the Covid-19 hotspot in the country.“I think the Chief Minister has already made statements regarding it. As per my understanding, a decision on reopening gymnasiums and religious places of worship would be taken in the first week of September,” Raut told media persons in Mumbai.Devendra Fadnavis, the leader of Opposition in Maharashtra; and Raj Thackeray, chief, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena; have also been demanding the reopening of gymnasiums and religious places worship in Maharashtra. Raj Thackeray had questioned the state government’s move, as the latter had allowed the reopening of shopping malls.Supriya Sula, a Member of Parliament (MP) from the NCP, too, had said last week that the state government should allow the reopening of gymnasiums and religious places of worship.State health minister Rajesh Tope is in agreement with these leaders. “There are several people, who want gymnasiums to be reopened. The move will help build herd immunity against Covid-19. However, the CM is concerned that social distancing norms may not be maintained. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) can be issued before gymnasiums are reopened,” Tope had said last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/decision-on-reopening-gyms-places-of-worship-likely-in-september-first-week-sanjay-raut/story-PonAVdGv1pMR2Jd33N6rTK.html
27-08-2020||Delhi||Traffic in Capital spikes, chaos at borders||The volume of road traffic in the national capital has reported a spike of late, despite the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, and traffic snarls during rush hour have again become commonplace, much to the inconvenience of commuters. The burden on road traffic has also increased because Metro Rail services in the national capital region (NCR) have been suspended since end-March in a bid to prevent the spread of the contagion. Initially, the Delhi government, like other parts of the country, had enforced lockdown restrictions that were in place for over two months to tackle the viral outbreak. Delhi Traffic Police said the national capital’s borders with neighbouring states such as Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have been reporting massive traffic jams since the phased easing of lockdown restrictions.Delhi Traffic Police’s data showed that between June 1 and August 20, the Delhi-Noida entry points had seen up to a 12% surge in road traffic volume. Similarly, there was an 8% uptick in the road traffic between Delhi and Gurugram during the corresponding period.The police said the worst-affected state borders are Kalindi Kunj, DND flyway and Mayur Vihar phase-3 entry. Estimates show that in Kalindi Kunj, over the last one month, nearly three lakh daily traffic volume had been recorded during peak rush hours. Before the lockdown (before the route was closed for passenger movement because of the Shaheen Bagh protests), this figure stood at around 1.5 to 2lakh vehicles every day. The traffic officials attributed the increase in road traffic to private employees, who have started commuting to work.Besides, commuters have limited public transport options because of the suspended Delhi Metro services. Many office-goers are relying on their private vehicles.Prior to the lockdown, around 27.5 lakh passengers were availing of the Delhi Metro service daily. “Delhi Metro had eased traffic bottlenecks on both Delhi-Noida and Delhi-Gurugram borders,” said a Delhi Traffic Police official.Delhi Traffic Police’s data showed around 5.7 lakh vehicles used to enter the national capital daily from the neighbouring satellite towns such as Gurugram, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad before the lockdown restrictions were imposed.Many commuters, who have been commuting between Delhi, Noida and Gurugram, have complained of massive traffic snarls, especially during the morning and evening rush hours . They also blamed the police for traffic mismanagement such as putting up unmanned barricades on arterial stretches in a bid to enforce Covid-19 guidelines that allegedly slowed down the movement of vehicles. Mridul Despandey, an information technology (IT) consultant, who works in Noida, singled out police barricades placed on the Delhi-Noida Direct (DND) Flyway as the most inconvenient for commuters.“At a time when traffic is crawling at a snail’s pace, I don’t understand the logic behind placing these barricades on unmanned roads. Earlier, I used to take the Delhi Metro to work. However, since the Delhi Metro service is yet to resume, it takes me over an hour to reach my workplace in Noida from my house in Moti Bagh in south Delhi,” said Despandey..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/traffic-in-capital-spikes-chaos-at-borders/story-vALqY8U6GQ83mm4I6cPwON.html
27-08-2020||Delhi||North Delhi Municipal Corporation engineers threaten strike over unpaid salaries||A forum of engineers has threatened its members will go on a strike if their employer--North Delhi Municipal Corporation--did not pay their unpaid salaries for three months even as the civic body cited a financial crunch because of the Covid-19 pandemic for the delay and promised to address the issue soon.Forum of MCD Engineers president SD Tomar said the engineers will have no option but to go on strike or protest if their pending salaries are not cleared soon. He said engineers working with the East Delhi Municipal Corporation have not been paid their salaries for two months. Tomar added it has started taking a toll on their lives. “The livelihood of municipal engineers and their lives is badly suffering due to these inordinate delays in payment of salaries. We also raised the matter with the north corporation mayor on Monday. For how long should we work without pay? Our patience is now giving up,” Tomar said.The forum said the salaries have not been paid since May and that they have written to the corporation’s mayor, Jai Prakash, and commissioner seeking the payment.In a letter to the commissioner on August 21, the engineers’ body said there has been a persistent delay in disbursal of salaries and pensions of municipal engineers. “…a delay of 3-4 months is common in getting salaries. This has been causing unrest and resentment among municipal engineers and their motivation is getting killed gradually. In view of the above, kindly look into the matter and formulate a scheme or policy for timely disbursal of salaries.”According to civic authorities, there are nearly 1,200 engineers working with the three municipalities of North, East, and South Delhi. The north corporation employs around 600 engineers.AP Khan, the forum’s general secretary, said it is becoming hard for them to survive under such conditions.Prakash said the civic body was going through an “acute financial crisis” due to the pandemic and that is why salaries have been delayed. “I am aware of the issue and we are making arrangements to pay salaries on time to all of our employees--be it engineers, doctors, teachers or sanitation workers. Pending salaries will be cleared soon,” Prakash said.Teachers, doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, and civil contractors working with the North Delhi Municipal Corporation have also complained that they have not been paid their salaries and other dues for the last three to four months.In June, doctors of Hindu Rao and Kasturba hospitals threatened mass resignations if their salaries were not paid, forcing the civic authorities to pay them. Teachers of north corporation schools in July also threatened to go on strike over pending salaries. The civic body later paid them a month’s salary. In June, civil contractors of the north corporation threatened to stop work and refused to take fresh projects over non-payment of bills amounting to approximately Rs 500 crore. They are yet to be paid and have stopped taking new projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-delhi-municipal-corporation-engineers-threaten-strike-over-unpaid-salaries/story-Vdw6OncwPMAK8jKGIqU9lI.html

However, all the centres are located in the two Covid-hit cities of Gurugram and Faridabad. As many as 16,298 candidates will appear for NEET this year in Haryana against last year’s 14, 686 aspirants. The number of centres for Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) stands at 16 this time as against 15 last time. A total of 24,763 have registered for JEE Mains in September as against 22,350 candidates who took the exam in January. The JEE (Mains) will be conducted from September 1 to 6. Generally, the JEE (Mains) exams for engineering aspirants is conducted in April, while NEET is held on the first Sunday of May. These exams have been postponed twice this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25 to restrict the spread of the disease. DON’T WANT TO MISS THIS CHANCE: STUDENTS A day after chief ministers of opposition-ruled states held a video-conference with Congress president Sonia Gandhi raising concerns over the holding of the entrance exams amid the Covid-19 pandemic, students are divided on the issue. Tushar Gupta, a NEET aspirant from Hisar, said he has been working hard for the medical entrance exam for two years and he doesn’t want to miss a chance this year. “Instead of debating on this topic, everyone should understand the importance of one year for a student. We have studied for 12 to 14 hours a day and only we know the importance of this exam. I urge the stakeholders to arrange transport for us from various corners of Haryana to the exam centres in Gurugram and Faridabad,” he said. Vikranta, a student from Bhiwani, said she is only focusing on the upcoming NEET exam. “My mother and I have been staying in Rajasthan’s Sikar town for my coaching. The career is much more important than the pandemic. We have learnt to live with Covid-19, so I don’t see any problem in appearing in the exam,” she said. However, Prashant Nain, a JEE (mains) aspirant, said that the government should revoke its decision to conduct the exams at this stage. “Safety comes first. Covid-19 cases have been rising and the government is putting students at risk by conducting the exams in September,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/40-neet-centres-in-haryana-all-in-worst-hit-covid-cities-of-gurugram-faridabad/story-2L4pxeiXBDw5AHL8waegZO.html
27-08-2020||Delhi||Army’s Delhi station gets Forest department notice for damaging trees||The Station Headquarters of the Army (Delhi Area) have run into a conflict with the public works department (PWD) and the Delhi forest department for damaging at least 45 trees along the Ring Road on the periphery of the Rajputana Rifles Regiment Centre and the Army Environmental Park and Training Area (AEPTA), Delhi Cantonment, by carrying out trenching activity in the tree line for construction of a boundary wall.Also read: Green concerns over Metro Phase-4 workForest department officials said the trenching work starts from the Sawai Man Singh Dwar and goes up to the AEPTA. The stretch along the Ring Road is under the PWD, which has served a ‘cease and desist’ notice to the General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the station area, asking him to stop the trenching work. “Trenching activitiy within one metre radius of a tree trunk is a violation of National Green Tribunal’s 2015 order as well as of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. It was found that during the trenching work, a total of 45 trees were damaged. The GOC is therefore requested to stop the work in the tree line,” stated the notice issued by the PWD’s horticulture department to the GOC (Station Area) on August 20. The notice also details the variety of trees damaged, including full grown native trees, such as gular, semal, bargad, shehtut, neem and peepal. Besides, a report of violations prepared by the Delhi forest department based on its inspection of the stretch on August 7 stated that 27 trees have been “damaged/felled” during the construction activity by the Station HQ of the Army. The forest department’s report also elaborates on the kind of damage caused to a variety of old and full-grown trees. “The trees have been damaged in an area spread across 4389 square metres. In case of most trees, the roots have been exposed. While five trees have fallen, in some others, the upper and middle parts have been cut. In case of another, only the root stump was found. The trees are located in a line in front of Metro pillar number 45 to pillar number 79,” it said.According to forest departnemt officials, the construction work is going on despite several reminders intimating the Station (HQ) to stop the work, as the said patch is a ‘deemed’ forest land where no construction activity can be carried out without seeking prior permission for diverting the land from the union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. Carrying out any kind of construction activity in a ‘deemed’ forest amounts to violation of the FCA, 1980.When HT visited the spot on Tuesday, work was going on in full swing. Deep trenches of about 5-6 feet were dug up in the area while a portion of the green patch has been cleared of trees and has been levelled with earth using heavy machinery. Also, an earth moving machine was mounted on the said patch, damaging the thick growth on the ground. A forest guard had also reached the site and informed the police about the construction activity, however, work on the stretch continued.The report of violations in the said area prepared by the deputy conservator of forest (West) dated August 19 and sent to the chief conservator of forests (CCF), the nodal officer (for FCA, 1980) in the Delhi government, stated, “The investigation officer (IO) from this office had inspected the stretch on August 7 and reported felling/damaging 27 trees at Ring Road, New Delhi. The IO also informed that he was not allowed to enter the premises of the Delhi Cantt area and was threatened by the contractors at the site.”The report further said, “As per the records available in this office...it is informed that no such permission has been issued by this office for felling of trees at the area in question. The area is listed as a ‘deemed’ forest by a Supreme Court order. The violated area is under the possession of the PWD, but the working permission has been given by the Army HQ...After considering all facts, it is being reported that prima facie the offence under section (2) of FCA1980, may be committed by Army HQ in the said area by damaging and felling trees here without the permission of Government of India,” it said.In a response to HT’s query, Colonel Aman Anand, spokesperson, Indian Army, said that the work undertaken is primarily a matter of repairing the wall on certified A1 defence land and no trees have been damaged in the process. “The scope involves recasting of plinth in the existing wall along with raising of height of wall at identified places for augmenting security of army area. The work pertains to repair of an ‘Existing Asset’ and does not involves fresh construction. Further, it is clarified that neither any trees have been damaged in the process and nor any intent for such an act exists within this organization”. DCF (West) S K Muan Guite said that the Army HQ have been informed to stop the work, as it is a ‘deemed’ forest land and the work is prima facie in violation of the FCA, 1980. “We had issued a restraining order as well. Also, on Monday, the forest staff had reached the site, the local police was informed and directed the contractor to stop the ongoing work. In this case, I have already given a violations report to the Nodal officer of the state,” said Guite.He added that work was stopped on Tuesday evening. HT was at the site till 4.30 pm until when the work was still going on. Colonel Anand further said that the work has only been taken up to safeguard the existing assets and enhance security of army installations. “No damage to the environment is foreseen or planned. We as an organisation are fully seized with the concerns and responsible behaviour towards the environment needs,” he said.As per the Supreme Court order, in Delhi’s context, a deemed forest is one which is spread across an area of at least 1 hectare and the number of trees per hectare is 250 or above. If both conditions are fulfilled simultaneously, the area is considered a deemed forest.The forest department had first received a complaint regarding the construction work in the tree line on July 23 after which an inspection of the site was taken up by the forest officials on August 7. The written complaint had highlighted that the work besides being in violation of FCA, 1980 is also a violation of National Green Tribunal (NGT) 2015 order that does not allow any trenching activitiy within one metre radius of a tree trunk as well as of the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994.C R Babu, professor emeritus at the Centre for Environment Management of Degraded Ecosystems at Delhi University, said that roadside trees and vegetation must be preserved as they act as a filter against air pollution. “Firstly, no construction activities must be carried out in a tree line or in this case of a deemed forest land. Trees such as gular, bargad, semal and peepal have a high dust-trapping efficiency and play a crucial role in mitigating pollution, in particular, on stretches like the Ring Road, which gets heavy traffic on a daily basis. Trenching activity anyways destroys the root system of the trees, which disturbs the ecology of the area,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/army-s-delhi-station-gets-forest-department-notice-for-damaging-trees/story-Rt3nTGECLrv7mWAGIm3HwN.html

The police said the murder conspiracy was hatched by Kumar’s minor daughter. Earlier, the victim’s wife was arrested for Kumar’s murder.Jayant Kant, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Muzaffarpur, said Kumar was stabbed to death on April 17 in his bed room at Nazirpur locality that falls under the jurisdiction of Ahiyapur police station.A case was lodged against Kumar’s three tenants _ Manish Kumar, Pankaj Kumar and Mohammad Anwarul Haque _ on the basis of the statement of Rita Devi, the wife of the slain teacher.Kumar’s daughter had alleged that her mother had an extramarital relationship with one of the tenants, which led to regular fights between her parents and a separation case was pending in a family court.The police conducted a probe in the murder case and arrested Devi, despite her pleading innocence. She told the police that Manish, one of their tenants, had vacated the house on April 5 -- 12 days prior to Kumar’s murder.The SSP said the police stumbled upon vital leads in the course of the investigation and Devi’s statement. Acting on a tip-off, the police conducted a raid on one of the premises on Akhara Road and arrested Manish on Monday.During interrogation, Manish revealed police that he had fallen in love with Kumar’s minor daughter, who had incited him to commit the crime. He alleged that the girl provoked him to kill her father, as he was opposed to the relationship.Manish hatched the plot to eliminate Kumar along with the other two tenants, Pankaj and Haque. He claimed that Pankaj agreed to be a party to the crime because he had fallen in love with Devi. The trio allegedly entered Kumar’s house around 2.30am on April 17 and stabbed him to death. Devi was also attacked when she had tried to protect her husband from them.Haque and Pankaj belong to Belsand in Sitamarhi district and the police have started a hunt for them.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Tuesday issued an alert for ‘moderate to heavy’ rainfall in Delhi from Wednesday to Friday and warned of flooding in low-lying areas along with disruption in traffic. Delhi minister Satyendar Jain said that the state government was prepared to face any flood-like situationYamuna’s water level on Thursday was 203.77 metres at 10 am while it was 203.78 metres on Wednesday at 6pm at the Old Railway Bridge in Delhi, an official belonging to Delhi’s irrigation and flood control department said. He added that the flow rate on Wednesday afternoon was 24,994 cusec, the highest in the last 24 hours.The official although pointed out that the level is likely to remain below the warning mark of 204.50 metres unless a very large amount of water measuring at least 2 lakh cusec, is released into the river from the Hathnikund barrage in Haryana’s Yamunanagar district. Also read: Cloudy skies followed by rain predicted in DelhiHathnikund barrage acts as a source of drinking water in Delhi and water discharged from here usually takes between 36-48 hours to reach the national capital. The flow rate at the barrage is 352 cussec but the discharge is increased after torrential rainfall is witnessed in catchment areas.

27-08-2020||Patna||Bihar opposition alliance in talks with left to get poll arithmetic right||The Grand Alliance (GA) in Bihar is treading cautiously this time to firm up alliance in the face of growing dissension with the camp, aware that the electoral arithmetic would require it to fill the big void left by the JD-U after 2015 assembly elections. This time JD-U is in the National Democraric Alliance (NDA). Though Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM)-Secular of former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi has moved out of the GA, sources in the Opposition alliance said it was not too much of a concern, as talks were already underway with the left parties, which have their cadres in several constituencies of the state despite their depleting strength over the years.CPI-ML general secretary Dipankar Bhattachary had earlier also called for Opposition unity in Bihar, even if it required some compromises by all the constituents, to stop the NDA from returning to power in the forthcoming elections by checking fragmentation of votes.In that backdrop, RJD state president Jagtanand Singh’s separate talks with the CPI-ML leaders and a group of CPI-CPM leaders on Tuesday and Wednesday assumes significance.CPI-ML was the only left party in 2015 Assembly elections to have opened its account and won three seats against the formidable Grand Alliance (GA) comprising the JD-U, RJD and the Congress. All the six left parties had then fought jointly, independent of both the GA and NDA. Even during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, left parties were out of the GA over denial of ticket to CPI’s Kanhaiya Kumar and differences on seat-sharing formula.That the RJD and the CPI-ML could be coming closer was apparent during the one-day monsoon session of the Bihar Assembly, when the latter allowed the leader of Opposition Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav to consume its time while speaking. CPM leader Sarvoday Sharma said there had been regular meetings of left parties and there is a general understanding in favour of a broader Opposition alliance, with the RJD, being the biggest party, at the centre of the formation. “An effective campaign for a viable alternative could make the difference as chief minister Nitish Kumar will have to face the anti-incumbency factor and also account for the government’s failure in addressing people’s basic concerns,” he added.After the whitewash in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, when RJD could not even open its account and the Congress could manage just one seat, the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections scheduled in October-November is understandably not going to be easy for the faction-ridden Grand Alliance (GA) to turn the table. To pose another challenge, six of its sitting MLAs have already shifted to the JD-U, while party veteran Raghuvansh Prasad Singh is still sulking over the prospect of ‘bahubali’ Rama Singh’s induction.Also Read: Day after declaring ‘war’ on Nitish’s JD(U), RJD plays down mass defectionsThe electoral mathematics weighs heavily in favour of the existing National Democratic Alliance (NDA) comprising the BJP, JD-U and the LJP. The depleting strength of the RJD amidst speculations about more crossovers would only make it more difficult for the GA. Shyam Razak’s return to the RJD fold has been the only significant induction in the party.In 2015, BJP had emerged the party with the largest vote share of 24.5%, but still lost in seat count against the combined might of the GA, as JD-U tilted balance against it.Also Read: JD(U) snubs LJP says alliance in Bihar is with BJP, NDA rift widens “It is all about numbers in the end. Left parties have their pockets of influence. Though they may not have the strength to convert their strength to seats, they can certainly add to the GA numbers, which will require some catching up to do to get closer to the NDA numbers. It will help the left parties also,” said a senior RJD leader, adding RJD chief Lalu Prasad was also for it, as was the Congress.With the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) of former union minister Upendra Kushwaha and Vikashsheel Insaan Paery (VIP) of Mukesh Sahni also appearing to stay with the GA, the opposition hopes to take on the NDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-opposition-alliance-in-talks-with-left-to-get-poll-arithmetic-right/story-Bfc3DFdKhcDEx6CQGLPWLK.html

27-08-2020||Mumbai||Mangroves hacked at Panje, environment violations pile as HC panel yet to meet after March||Mangrove destruction was reported from the Panje area at Uran in Navi Mumbai on Wednesday, as a patch of the salt-tolerant trees located in the middle of the wetland was spotted missing.A complaint was filed with the mangrove cell and Bombay high court (HC)-appointed state committee that was set up to protect mangroves and wetlands along the Konkan coast. Environmentalists said they felt frustrated, as the HC panel has not met since March, despite repeated reminders by its own members to expedite the hearing of the complaints. The committee’s member secretary said about 10 new complaints and close to a 100 previously heard complaints are still pending.On Wednesday, a closer inspection of Panje by local birders unearthed chopped off branches of about 15-18 mangrove trees buried in sections of the wetland. “We had visited the site last week and the mangrove trees were still there. Unidentified persons mercilessly chopped off the trees after rainwater receded. There have been attempts to block high-tide water in a bid to dry up the site,” said Parag Gharat, an Uran resident and a keen birder. He alleged that he was threatened by industry officials. “Since they have spotted me several times in the area, I have been told not to take pictures and stay away from the site, or I may be roughed up,” he alleged. Spread across 213 hectare (ha) core and 157 ha buffer area for migratory birds’ roosting, Panje is a natural habitat to up to 1,50,000 birds, including both migratory and resident, during winter. The west side of the wetland shares a border with a narrow patch of mangrove that is up to 500 metres (m) wide and 1.5-kilometre long, while the east side is surrounded by degraded mangroves, villages and roads. Sections of Panje towards the Arabian Sea have been declared by the Maharashtra authorities as Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) I, the highest ecological protection. Mangrove destruction and construction within 50 m of the vegetation was banned by the Bombay HC in September 2018.Environmentalists, the City Industrial Development Corporation Limited (CIDCO) and private companies have been in a tussle for over two years to protect Panje from proposed industrial and residential projects. States bodies claimed the area was not a wetland, despite the fact it was identified as one by the National Wetland Atlas, Maharashtra, in 2011.Hours after Gharat shared the images of the hacked mangroves, environmental groups such as Shree Ekvira Aai Pratishthan (SEAP) and NatConnect Foundation sent complaint letters to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and urged him to book the violators . They also requested for closed-circuit TV (CCTV) surveillance at the site in a bid to protect the remaining mangrove patches. “This kind of illegal activities are carried out at night with the help of local residents. Panje wetland is being reclaimed to be under the control and illegal possession of the Navi Mumbai Special Economic Zone. The project proponents are preventing local fishermen, birders and researchers from entering Panje,” said Nandkumar Pawar, head, SEAP.BN Kumar, director, NatConnect Foundation, said, “Vested interests are active and damaging the biodiversity by chopping off mangroves in the absence of any official surveillance since the state authorities are busy with tackling the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. The HC committee must hold an online meeting to take stock of the situation and instruct appropriate authorities to file contempt cases for dereliction of their duties.”Neenu Somraj, deputy conservator of forests (mangrove cell) and member secretary, HC panel, said, “Panje has been a matter of concern for a long time because it is not an identified wetland on paper. Mangrove destruction is a serious offence. Our range forest officer has been informed to verify the allegations. Further action will be initiated against the guilty.”In September 2018, a two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices Abhay Oka and Riyaz Chagla, while banning mangrove destruction in Maharashtra had directed the state authorities to form the grievance redressal committee to identify the vulnerable mangrove forests and wetland patches along the Konkan coast and ensure restoration of these sites to their original condition. On Wednesday, the state published a list of transfers for top bureaucrats with former Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) commissioner Annasaheb Misal appointed as the Konkan commissioner. “I have just taken charge. We will do the needful,” said Misal on holding the next HC-committee meeting. On August 17, HC panel member Stalin D wrote to the additional commissioner Konkan to convene a meeting soon. “Previous directions passed by the committee have been ignored by various state bodies and the crisis has deepened. More reclamation is happening and also permissions are being given for constructions on khazan lands, wetlands, water bodies etc. It is crucial for the committee to look into these pressing issues at the earliest,” said Stalin.Somraj said 15 fresh complaints had been received across the Konkan coast since the last meeting was held in the first week of March. At least 10 complaints were related to Uran, including Panje, while the rest were from Versova, Dahanu and Alibag. A total of 97 complaints are still pending, where a first-information-report (FIR) was registered, but charge sheets are yet to be filed. “Besides the non-appointment of the Konkan commissioner, revenue officials from all districts had been busy with the management of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the mangrove cell has followed up on all the complaints, filed punchnamas and documented each matter to be presented before the committee. Now, we are waiting for the next meeting to be called,” said Somraj..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mangroves-hacked-at-panje-environment-violations-pile-as-hc-panel-yet-to-meet-after-march/story-lP9ATfaHIpyVY1y6SWx0BM.html

We are in the process of identifying the moneylenders who had loaned the money to the two men and ascertain the family’s allegations. They will be questioned to find out the reason behind the deaths,” said an investigator, who did not wish to be named.The family of the jewellers told journalists the two were being “threatened by a local businessman and his associate” and they “hanged themselves because of the torture”.An employee of the jewellery store also told journalists moneylenders would come to their shop and harass the two brothers. They used to ask them to have poison if they did not have money to repay, he said.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Monika Bhardwaj, said, “We will record the statement of their father today [Thursday]. We will proceed with the investigation accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-jewellers-suicide-police-may-summon-moneylenders/story-ZNxB1quX0ldca7QTn1lZ9J.html
27-08-2020||Delhi||Ola, Uber drivers threaten strike across NCR from September 1||Drivers working for app-based cab aggregators such as Uber and Ola have threatened to go on strike from September 1, across the National Capital Region (NCR). Also read: Mumbaiites may now book autos on UberThey have been demanding an extension to pay the EMIs of their vehicles, a hike in the per km fare, reduction in commission charged by the companies operating the services and e-challans’ rollback. With government buses accommodating fewer passengers and the Delhi Metro services yet to resume, the strike could affect travel for thousands of citizens across the NCR. Sarvodaya Drivers Association of Delhi, a union of Ola-Uber drivers, which claimed to have around 200,000 cabs attached to them across the NCR, on Thursday said they will go on strike from September 1 unless their demands are met. The association said that most drivers attached to the union are those who have taken bank loans for purchasing the vehicle and have to pay monthly instalments of up to Rs 15,000. “After the lockdown, our condition had deteriorated. The number of clients has come down to just 10%, as most people are still working from home. The drivers are struggling to make ends meet. We have sent letters to the Prime Minister, the union finance and transport ministers to urge banks to extend the relaxation on paying EMIs till December 31 this year,” said Kamaljeet Gill, president, Sarvodaya Drivers Association of Delhi. He added that they there has been one relaxation between March and August, but they need an extension, as work has not picked up. “Many drivers are borrowing from friends to run their houses. These days, a driver is earning about Rs 150-200 per day, after deducting 26% commission to the company, maintenance and fuel charges. This is much lower than what we made in pre-Covid days. Back then, if a driver worked for 14-15 hours a day, he would take home around Rs 800-900 after deducting all the charges. It is a huge difference and we request the government to save our livelihoods otherwise drivers will have to sell their cabs or the banks will take them away,” said Gill. He also said that so far, the cab aggregators have fixed the fares at Rs 6 per km, which is much less than the government rates fixed for taxis and go up to Rs 10-12 per km. “If the fare is hiked to at least Rs 10 per km, it will help us earn more and will only be fair to do so,” he said. On e-challans (camera-based traffic challans where drivers are not prosecuted on the spot), Gill alleged that drivers have got 10-20 challans in the past few months for driving above the speed of 40km/h. “Even for personal cars, the speed limit is 50km/h. There are no roads signs for commercial vehicles such as cabs to drive at 40km/h and many drivers have got a number of challans of Rs 2,000 each. How are we supposed to pay off these challans? We request the government to waive them off or roll back this policy,” said Gill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ola-uber-drivers-threaten-strike-in-ncr-from-september-1/story-HAX3eUsGue5RK07HeNrI3L.html

Police said that the duo got trapped under the debris when a portion of the house they lived in collapsed around 5.30 am on Thursday. Police managed to rescue them and rushed them to the hospital. It took almost three hours to rescue the woman from under the debris. She succumbed in the hospital. There was water logging on several arterial roads, lanes and bylanes in central and north Kolkata. Water logging was also reported from the port area in western part of the city. But as the state administration has enforced state-wide lockdown on Thursday, there were fewer vehicles on the roads and less of traffic congestion. The regional weather forecasting centre said that the rain was triggered by a low pressure that had developed a few days ago. Rain and thunderstorms have hit almost all districts in south Bengal. Many rivers were flowing above the danger level and water has entered several villages inundating large areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/heavy-rains-in-kolkata-house-collapse-leaves-two-injured/story-vien49GQsRmDpSKBhK1BAM.html

27-08-2020||Chandigarh||Pakistani team to meet Indian authorities at Dera Baba Nanak for building bridge in Kartarpur Corridor||Amritsar: A team of 10 Pakistani engineers will cross over to India at 11am on Thursday to meet officials of the Border Security Force (BSF), National Highway of India (NHAI) and Land Port Authority of India (LPAI) at Dera Baba Nanak town of Gurdaspur district and discuss the construction of a bridge in the Kartarpur Corridor. According to official sources, the engineers will discuss the construction of a bridge on a low-lying stretch near the border on the Pakistan side. They will also conduct a survey of the portion of the bridge built on the Indian side. “The standard operating procedure (SOP) on preventive measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus will be observed during the meeting,” a senior BSF official said. BRIDGE AND SHARE OF CONSTRUCTION The 420-metre bridge was to be constructed under the Kartarpur Corridor project last year. India built the 100-metre stretch of the bridge in its territory before the corridor’s inauguration last year. Pakistan had expressed its inability to construct the 320-metre portion in the stipulated time but promised to complete the construction in the coming days. The construction of bridge was necessitated as the low-lying area of the border gets inundated when the Ravi river is in spate every year. Pakistan had built a causeway on the low-lying stretch as a temporary measure. FIRST MEETING SINCE COVID OUTBREAK This is the first meeting between officials of India and Pakistan since the borders were closed due to the Covid-19 outbreak in March. India temporarily suspended the pilgrimage and registration for the Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara in Pakistan on March 16 in view of the pandemic. Pakistan also closed the corridor after India’s decision. On June 29, Pakistan announced it has reopened the corridor for pilgrims from India. Amid rising Covid cases, the Indian government is yet to decide on the matter. On Wednesday, the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) urged the Indian government to reopen the Kartarpur Corridor for Sikh devotees on the occasion of Guru Nanak’s Joti Jot Diwas, the day of immersion in eternal light, on September 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pakistani-team-to-meet-indian-authorities-at-dera-baba-nanak-for-building-bridge-in-kartarpur-corridor/story-KVsh4oKStywFm2A1AiPtRK.html

27-08-2020||Delhi||Over 180K fined Rs9.18 crore for not wearing masks in Delhi||At a time when experts, both in India and abroad, have stressed on strict safety norms to prevent the spread of Covid-19, Delhi Police have fined at least 188,578 people for not wearing masks in public, collecting a total of Rs 9.42 crore from people guilty of the violation since June 14, according to data accessed by HT.Addressing a press conference on the marginal rise of Covid cases in the city, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday urged people to continue wearing masks and not mind if authorities were issuing fines because they were doing it for a greater good. “Confidence is good but it should not lead to complacence at any cost...... In case one if fined, one must understand that it is for a greater good,” he said adding that he has directed authorities to strengthen enforcement of rules.Also read | Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe penalty for not wearing a mask is a Rs 500 on-the-spot fine under a rule passed by the Delhi government under the Delhi Epidemic Diseases, (Management of Covid-19) Regulations, 2020, approved by the Delhi L-G in June. The drive to penalise those moving about in public spaces without a mask was launched on June 14.A senior Delhi police officer, who did not wish to be named, said that a majority of people fined were those who could afford a mask but still stepped out in public without one. “Most of these people have no reason whatsoever not to wear masks. Issuing fines is not the solution but it serves as a deterrent. We do not fine the underprivileged persons. Instead of issuing fines, we distribute masks among them. Till Tuesday, we have distributed 221,735 masks. Our teams are visiting areas in the Capital where underprivileged citizens live,” the officer said.Dr VK Paul, member(health) at Niti Aayog, had on Sunday said that while Delhi has done well in terms of testing, surveillance, containment measures, contact tracing, and scaling up health infrastructure, leading to a drop in overall cases, the lack of caution among residents has emerged as impediment in preventing a further reduction in number of cases. “There’s laxity in people’s behaviour as far as adopting preventive measures is concerned, which is extremely important along with surveillance and other epidemiological measures, to bring down the rate of infection,” Paul told HT. Also read| Delhi at an inflection point in Covid battleAccording to the police data, least number of fines were imposed in the New Delhi district, which includes the Lutyens’ zone. Till 23 August, 6,482 people were found without mask in New Delhi. The maximum number of violations, 22,136, were reported from Outer Delhi district -- which includes places like Mangolpuri, Aman Vihar, Sultanpuri and Kanjhawala, followed by West Delhi where 16,772 people without mask were fined. Data suggests that more people in South Delhi are complying with the mask rule now since on July 20, the district which has areas such as Defence Colony, Hauz Khas, Lodhi Colony and Mehrauli, had the maximum violations at 5,539. The district has reported total 15,331 violations till August 23. Second maximum violations had been reported from Southwest district at 4,564. This includes RK Puram,Vasant Vihar, Delhi Cantonment and Vasant Kunj.Police officers in outer district said while many people have gamchhas (a cotton cloth), they do not cover their faces. They said a lot of people are not aware that not wearing a mask can attract a penalty. “In many cases, when we ask people that they could be fined for not wearing a mask or covering their faces properly, people don’t believe us. Some even smile and apologise. If the violator is a factory worker or labourer, we usually counsel them, make them cover their face and let them go with a warning,” a patrolling officer, who has been involved in the drive, said requesting anonymity. Other officers said fines are proving a deterrence. “In places such as south Delhi or New Delhi, we could see a change within days of people learning that police had started issuing fines. The word spread quickly so those districts managed to reduce the number. It will take time, but violations will decrease in other districts too,” a senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said.HT reached out to at least three people who were fined for not wearing a mask but all of them refused to speak to the media. The police clarified on Tuesday through their Twitter account that wearing a face mask is mandatory even for those who are driving alone in their car. Police officials pointed out instances in which people driving cars argued with them that they couldn’t be penalised since they were alone in the vehicle. Experts stressed that wearing masks and hand hygiene were essential to contain the spread of the disease.“I strongly advise citizens to wear masks and wash hands.This is basic and the first level of protection, which should not be ignored. There are many reasons why people are now moving around without a mask. Maybe they think there is no risk. Many perceive that the threat from the virus is to others and not to them. Some may also be fed up of the virus. A minor reason could also be fake news from irresponsible social media companies, which say that wearing masks is harmful. Until the day, we find a cure, or the virus mutates to a weaker strain or we develop herd immunity, it is important to wear masks, wash hands frequently and maintain social distancing,” said Dr Puneet Mishra, professor of community medicine, AIIMS.Delhi added 1,693 fresh Covid-19 cases and 17 fatalities on Wednesday, according to the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin. The total number of infections in the capital now stands at 165,764 and the toll at 4,347.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/over-180k-fined-9-18-crore-not-wearing-masks-in-delhi/story-1euXRQ51i4HpBcqJNtQROJ.html
27-08-2020||City||Whitefly attacks cotton crop in Haryana’s Hisar, Fatehabad, Jind and Bhiwani||Cotton growers in many villages of Hisar, Jind, Fatehabad and Bhiwani districts were left worried after whitefly attacked several fields in their areas.After a good spell of rain in the beginning of August, especially in some villages of Hisar’s Barwala, Fatehabad’s Bhuna and Bhiwani’s Tosham and Siwani blocks, coupled with hot and humid weather conditions have now led to pest infestation.Dayanand Dhaka, a farmer from Hisar’s Kirtan village, said his cotton crop on three acres was damaged due to whitefly attack. “This time, we had no rain for the past few weeks and now, the weather has turned hot and humid, leading to damage to cotton crop. Only rain can take away the threat of whitefly. Over 50% of the cotton crop in our neighbouring 15 to 20 villages was damaged,” he added. Ajit Jaglan, a farmer from Bhiwani’s Kalali village, said pests have been detected in nearly 10 villages in Siwani block alone.“The whitefly attack is in its initial stage. Agriculture officials should visit the affected fields and guide the growers about proper chemicals and spray methods to kill the pest. The colour of the crop is turning black and its leaves have started shrinking. The next 10 to 12 days are very crucial for this crop. If it rains, the crop would be saved, otherwise the pest will damage up to 50% of cotton,” he added.Jashpal Singh, a farmer from Fatehabad’s Bhuna block, said scanty rainfall has led to infestation on his seven acres of cotton fields. “Our crop was good and we were expecting a good yield this time. But for the last two weeks, our crop is being damaged due to pest attack. Due to use of insecticides, our input cost will go up. The government should provide us some compensation,” he added. Hisar deputy director (agriculture) Balwant Saharan said they are giving demonstrations to farmers about what kind of insecticides to be used on cotton field to save it.“Due to showers received in the starting of this month, plants were washed and chances of damage to the crop were minimised in the district. We are receiving complaints about the crop damage and we are in process of accessing the losses,” he added.However, the deputy directors of other districts could not be reached for their comments as they were busy in a videoconference with senior state officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/whitefly-attacks-cotton-crop-in-haryana-s-hisar-fatehabad-jind-and-bhiwani/story-rq47jDklwTnrPb2KixLl1O.html
27-08-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana assembly’s monsoon session lasts barely three hours||CHANDIGARH: Haryana lawmakers of the opposition political parties not only let the ruling BJP-JJP government push through the important legislative business, but also went on the offensive, demanding debate on ‘scams’ even as the assembly session held in the shadow of Covid-19 was wrapped up in barely three hours on Wednesday. The House was adjourned sine die after the 170-minute proceedings during which the Congress staged two walkouts, while the lone INLD MLA Abhay Chautala made his presence felt by indirectly attacking his nephew and deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala and raising what he called liquor and land registration scams. In all, 12 bills were passed despite the Congress raising objections and making suggestions and Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda reminding the treasury benches that during the business advisory committee (BAC) meeting, it was decided to introduce only urgent bills and not all. Given the extraordinary circumstances in which the House assembled and in the absence of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, speaker Gian Chand Gupta, two ministers and some MLAs who tested positive for the Covid-19, the Congress didn’t go hammer and tongs after the government. Instead, the principal opposition party just kept the government on the defensive. The question hour was waived and instead, answers of the questions and written replies of two calling attention motions were tabled on the floor of the House. As the session began at 2pm and deputy speaker Ranbir Gangwa apprised the House of BAC decisions, a section of the Congress MLAs opposed the move. Congress MLAs like BB Batra and Geeta Bhukkal, Narnaund MLA Ram Kumar Gautam (JJP) and Balraj Kundu (Independent) kept generating heat on the treasury benches. And, the deputy speaker deflated every opposition attack by allowing the MLAs to air their views. However, at this, home minister Anil Vij and parliamentary affairs minister Kanwar Pal reminded the Congress MLAs to respect the BAC decisions in which CLP leader Hooda represented them. As the deputy speaker reminded the opposition members that House proceedings were being held under extraordinary circumstances to transact important business, Hooda reiterated that only important bills and supplementary estimates should be laid in the House and the remaining business, including adjournment and calling attention motions, should be kept pending for the next sitting of the assembly, whenever it is convened. Congress MLA Geeta Bhukkal interrupted the proceedings, demanding that higher education examinations should be put off in public interest, a point Hooda backed, saying the issue raised by her was valid. The House saw a sharp verbal duel between Bhukkal and Kanwar Pal over the BAC decisions. Kanwar Pal took digs at Bhukkal, saying: “You are not speaking against the government, but against your own leader. The way Congress leaders are opposing BAC decisions, it shows their lack of confidence in Hooda.” Kanwar Pal, who is also education minister, said the Khattar-led BJP government will make appropriate arrangements to ensure exams are held smoothly. “We don’t want these students to get labelled as corona degree holders,” the minister said after Bhukkal asked to defer the examination. INLD MLA Abhay Chautala was also unimpressed with the BAC decisions. He said the government did not invite him or any independent legislator to the BAC meeting. “Are you the only ones running the assembly? What about lone MLAs like me?” he asked. “No one is dying of coronavirus here. Why can’t we have a discussion on corruption issues? Why did you call us from so far when all you wanted was a shortened session?” questioned Abhay.The House observed two-minute silence in the memory of soldiers killed in action and the prominent personalities such as classical vocalist Pandit Jasraj, who had died in recent past. Deputy speaker Ranbir Singh Gangwa, deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, home minister Anil Vij, and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda read out the obituary resolutions. Among the prominent personalities remembered were former Karnataka governor Hansraj Bhardwaj; former governor of Madhya Pradesh Lalji Tandon; former Haryana minister Mange Ram Gupta, MLA Sri Krishan Hooda and former MLA Mani Ram. Among others remembered were freedom fighter Dhara Singh of Jhajjar’s Kulasi village and 25 soldiers of the state killed in action in past about six months. The House also paid tributes to those 20 bravehearts who sacrificed their lives in the Galwan Valley on June 16. The House placed on record its deep sense of sorrow on the sad and untimely demise of those ‘Corona Warriors’ and other people who have lost their lives due to Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-assembly-s-monsoon-session-lasts-barely-three-hours/story-LsHub9ls7eqU6ulwAamW8K.html

27-08-2020||City||Badlapur residents complain of frequent power cuts since two days||Residents have complained about frequent power cuts in Badlapur town since the past few days. The residents have taken to social media to highlight the issue as their work and school schedules are being affected.They complained that power outages have increased since Monday with no electricity for more than three hours at a go. Many have tweeted to the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Corporation Limited (MSEDCL) demanding an explanation. Aparna Mahadik, a resident of Belavli in Badlapur (West), said “It has been very difficult to work from home as the power supply is cut frequently. In fact, it lasted for three hours on Tuesday night from 10.30pm to 1.30am.” Residents also blamed MSEDCL for poor communication as there was no prior intimation regarding the cuts. Mahadik, who works in a private firm in Dadar, added, “On Wednesday afternoon there was no light for three hours. When I called up MSEDCL, they said there is some technical issue and work is under progress. They did not mention when it will be resolved. I had to cancel my meetings due to this.” Kiran Krishnan, 32, another resident from Badlapur (West), said, “We have no problem with power cuts for maintenance purposes and it might also happen due to some unforeseen circumstances. However, even after regular maintenance, there are power cuts which sometimes last for hours. As a lot of us are working from home in view of the pandemic, if power cuts take place frequently without any prior intimation, it leads to a lot of troubles.” He added, “We are already facing the recent rise of per unit charges since April and the subsequent rise in electricity bills. In such a situation, we expect good service without too much interruption.” An officer from Badlapur (West) division of MSEDCL said, “Power supply to Belavli in Badlapur (West) was off on Tuesday due to high tension conductor snapping at Vadavli. We restored partial supply by diverting load around midnight, while the remaining supply was restored around 1.15am on Wednesday. However, another conductor at Shanti Nagar snapped around 1pm on Wednesday which was restored by 3.40pm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/badlapur-residents-complain-of-frequent-power-cuts-since-two-days/story-hz1oojeqRsuakpGU67XKcP.html

27-08-2020||Mumbai||Education department reverses circular on social quota in minority colleges||The state education department on Wednesday reversed its Tuesday’s circular wherein it had asked minority junior colleges to offer social reservations in non-quota seats.In a circular issued late on Wednesday, Dinkar Patil, director of secondary education, clarified that minority colleges need not implement social reservations — seats reserved for students belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes — on non-minority seats. However, the department has upheld its decision asking colleges to offer vacant minority seats to other minority students before they are surrendered for open category admissions. For instance, a religious minority college will have to offer its vacant minority seats to a linguistic minority student before the seats can be surrendered for the centralised admission process for open category.Thereafter, the vacant seats can be filled up “as per centralised admission process,” said the circular. On Tuesday, Patil’s office had issued a circular asking minority colleges to implement social reservations on its non-minority seats, which constitutes 45% of its total seat share. This upset many minority colleges in the city. Maharashtra Association of Minority Educational Institutions wrote to Patil stating that social reservations were not applicable to minority colleges. In November 2017, the Bombay high court (HC) upheld that minority institutions cannot be asked to apply social reservations after it set aside a circular by the University of Mumbai as ‘unconstitutional’. Thereafter, in July 2018, the Supreme Court refused to overturn the Bombay HC decision to exempt minority degree colleges in Maharashtra from reserving seats for students belonging to socially weaker sections.In minority colleges, up to 50% of the seats are reserved for students belonging to linguistic or minority communities. Patil told HT that the department had received a letter from the minority colleges association. “We have reviewed the matter and issued a fresh decision,” he said.Principals said that the education department’s earlier directive to implement social reservations for students hailing from Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes, would interfere with the admission process of such institutes. “Social reservations do not apply to minority colleges. The judiciary has said that it is the constitutional right of a minority institute,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College, Bandra, which is a Catholic religious minority college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/education-department-reverses-circular-on-social-quota-in-minority-colleges/story-9v210dxcvYKWpDn6DuZc5H.html
27-08-2020||Mumbai||At Sonia meet, Thackeray urges non-BJP CMs to unite||Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray has appealed to CMs of all non-BJP governments to join hands to push their demands before the Central government and safeguard the federal structure accorded in the Constitution. Thackeray, who along with six other CMs participated in a meeting with Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday, also pressed for the reconsideration of GST regime. Apart from Thackeray, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh, Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot, Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren and Puducherry CM V Narayanasamy also participated in the video conference which lasted for around two hours. The meeting was convened to discuss the pendency of GST compensation and the stand to be taken on Joint Entrance Examination and National Eligibility cum Entrance Test. Thackeray said it is the time to revisit the implementation of GST regime by comparing it with the older one. “The compensation to be given to states under GST regime is piling up day by day, making it difficult to meet the expenditure. It is time to reconsider if the older regime was better or there should be via media between the two regimes. If there are any lacunae in the new system, they should be rectified (by the Centre),” he said. He further said that they should come together and fight in the interest of the people from their respective states. Thackeray said that if the prime minister has been elected by the people, they too are the elected representatives of the people and that the mandate should be respected (by the Centre). “(Former prime minister) Rajiv Gandhi brought Panchayat Raj with the intention of decentralising the power. If somebody wants it to be centralised again, there would be no meaning to the existence of the state governments. We will not allow anybody to hijack our right which was been given to us by the federal structure accorded in the Constitution by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. It is our right in democracy and we should safeguard it,” he said. Thackeray reiterated that conducting final-year exams was not possible when Covid-19 pandemic was at its peak in the state. He added that the state government has decided to pass the students by giving them aggregate marks on the basis of the average from earlier semesters and if students want to appear for exams, they will be given an opportunity. Appealing other CMs who attended the meeting to decide whether to fight back (to safeguard the rights of the states), Thackeray said they need to firmly stand together. “We have been fighting for the rights of the people who have elected us. The people electing us are the same voters who elect the prime minister, and it is our duty to safeguard their interest.

The NCB on Wednesday registered a first information report (FIR) against actor Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik Chakraborty, talent manager Jaya Saha, Rajput’s former manager Shruti Modi and one Gaurav Arya under sections 20, 22, 27 and 29 of the Narcotics Drugs and Pyschotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.The NCB action came after the ED wrote to the agency, asking it to probe if drugs were supplied to Rajput and Chakraborty, who has been questioned multiple times by the latter. NCB director Rakesh Asthana confirmed that a FIR has been filed. “We received a letter from ED on Tuesday evening, stating that during their probe into the financial aspects, they found that drugs were supplied to Rhea and Sushant. An NCB team will now conduct an inquiry and people involved will be questioned,” Asthana said. ED sources said during their questioning of Saha, Chakraborty’s talent manager, they found some conversation between the two about some drug. However, none of the three central agencies provided any details into the form of drug or if it was consumed by any of the persons involved in the case. Satish Maneshinde, senior counsel and Chakraborty’s lawyer, said, “Rhea has never consumed drugs in her life. She’s ready for a blood test any time.” The ED, however, has called Saha to its South Mumbai office for questioning once again. Meanwhile, the CBI on Wednesday continued to question the late actor’s cook Neeraj Singh, roommate and creative manager Siddharth Pithani at the DRDO guest house in Santacruz (East). Rajput, 34, was found dead in his Bandra flat on June 14. The post-mortem report concluded he died by suicide. The probe was handed over to CBI by the Supreme Court, after it upheld the validity of a first information report (FIR) lodged by Bihar Police in response to a complaint filed by Rajput’s father, KK Singh, who has accused Chakraborty and her family of abetting his son’s suicide and misappropriating his money.SECTIONS OF NDPS ACT UNDER WHICH FIR HAS BEEN FILEDSection 20 of the NDPS Act prescribes punishment for anyone who cultivates, produces, manufactures, possesses, sells, purchases, transports, imports inter-state, exports inter-state or uses cannabis.

Maximum proposals of new institutes placed were for traditional arts, science and commerce colleges followed by law and hotel management.MU at present has more than 823 affiliated colleges spread across Mumbai city and the state.“The new colleges are spread across Mumbai, Thane, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts. Two new college proposals, one each for physical education and sports, have also been approved,” said a spokesperson for the university.The annual senate meeting for approval of the new perspective plan was conducted virtually this year on August 25, however, the meeting went on till the early morning of August 26, and the proposal for new colleges was tabled at 3am, said officials.The annual plan lays out locations for the proposed new affiliated colleges, under the university’s five-year perspective plan. According to information shared by MU, the 36 new colleges include 16 traditional colleges, six law colleges, three hotel management, night and social work colleges each, two hospitality colleges and one college each for integrated education, physical education and sports.To fill the slots for new colleges, the government invites proposals from education trusts every year.

Hence... the complaint deserves to be dismissed being not tenable in the eyes of law..,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/anti-caa-stir-court-junks-brinda-karat-s-plea-seeking-fir-against-bjp-mps/story-KlOWBOB3zcWzEx9MA37uRJ.html
27-08-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana assembly passes bill to validate land de-licensing||With an aim to grant legitimacy to past actions of town and country planning department since 1975, including de-licensing of land, the Haryana assembly on Wednesday passed a bill to amend and validate the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas (HDRUA) Act. The amendment and validation bill, if assented to by the governor, would come as a relief to the developers of the Gurugram-based Ambience Mall besides several similar cases involving de-licensing of land.The Punjab and Haryana high court had in July quashed the TCP department’s October 18, 2001 and September 1, 2010 orders to de-license two chunks of land (eight acres and 3.9 acres) out of 18.98 acres approved for constructing Ambience Lagoon Island residential complex. The de-licensed land was then permitted by the department for raising a commercial complex, the Ambience Mall. De-licensing here meant that a part of the land for which a residential licence was issued was taken out of the purview of the residential licence. On HC’s orders, the CBI had also registered a criminal case in the matter. Officials said over 54 similar cases of de-licensing were detected by the department after the HC ruling, which needed to be validated. ‘De-licensing a misnomer’ The HC, however, had termed the term de-licensing a misnomer in the context of the Act and the case at hand. The HC bench said that state counsel had candidly admitted that there was no such provision in the Act. “He tried to justify this Act by referring to clause 21 of the General Clauses Act that power to grant a licence also contains implied power to de-license as well. We, however, find the argument bereft of any merit or logic,” the HC said. “Ignoring all statutory provisions and throwing caution to wind, the authorities acted more promptly than expected. The order granting permission on eight acres to build a commercial complex was passed on October 16, 2001, two days before the order to de-license the same area was passed (October 18). This showed a preconceived plan for a commercial complex to be raised within the area licensed for residential complex,” the bench said while ordering CBI probe. Twin steps to validate actions The validation clause passed by the assembly said that notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court or tribunal or any authority, any action taken or orders issued, things done or purporting to have been taken or done by the director, before the commencement of the HDRUA (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2020, will be deemed to be valid and effective as if such action, approval, orders were issued or action taken in accordance with its provisions. The assembly on Wednesday also approved insertion of a new clause section 3 (a) in the Act which would give power to add to, amend, vary, suspend, withdraw or rescind, licence or notification, order, rule or direction or to de-license. The statement of objects and reasons of the amendment and validation bill said it has been proposed primarily to make express statutory provisions to clarify certain provisions of the HDRUA by drawing upon the laid-down law in section 21 of the General Clauses Act and section 20 of Punjab General Clauses Act and to validate various actions taken and being taken by the department as a consequence of which would have the effect of reconciling the conflicting judicial pronouncements on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-assembly-passes-bill-to-validate-land-de-licensing/story-L6CsvanviDwuDcbMrGaoxM.html
27-08-2020||Mumbai||Nagpur civic chief transferred, his 16th transfer in a 15-yr career||Nagpur municipal commissioner and IAS officer Tukaram Mundhe has been transferred to Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran as a member secretary by Maharashtra government on Wednesday. Ramaswami N, chief executive officer of Maharashtra Maritime Board will now replace Mundhe.Mundhe was appointed Nagpur civic chief in January 26 this year. He is currently under home isolation after testing Covid-19 positive.  Mundhe has faced his sixteenth transfer in less than 15 years of his service. Of the 15 posts he has held so far in his career, in most, he was transferred in less than a year of appointment. He has served the highest period of 26 months as joint commissioner, sales tax, followed by 17 months as a collector in Solapur. He had short tenures as civic chiefs of Nashik, Navi Mumbai and now Nagpur.Mundhe has often had a face-off with politicians due to his style of functioning.Representatives across the party line had complained against him. Corporators from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress in Nagpur had announced to bring the no-confidence motion against Munde, protesting his ‘high-handed style of working’. Congress leaders Nana Patole and Vikas Thakre had demanded his transfer.“A major complaint against him is that he ill-treats fellow politicians including legislators and ministers. In a democratic setup, the stature of the elected represented cannot be underestimated. Even though the chief minister had backed him openly during his interview a few weeks ago, Mundhe could not have retained the post in the wake of the rising complaints against him,” said an official from the general administration department.The leaders had also clashed over the handling of Covid-19 situation and the curbs imposed in the city. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari too had reportedly complained against the officer recently.However, citizens in most cities where he worked have always supported Mundhe.Meanwhile, 14 other IAS officers were also transferred. Avinash Dhakne, who was Jalgaon collector till his recent transfer, has now been posted as transport commissioner. Dhakne will replace SM Channe, who has been appointed as vice-chairman and managing director of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation.

The positivity rate on Wednesday was at 21.54%,Mumbai, meanwhile, recorded a higher number of cases with 1,854 new infections. However, the increase in numbers was attributed to data adjustment. On Tuesday, Mumbai reported 587 new cases, owing to a technical issue on the website of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The backlog of Tuesday’s cases was added on Wednesday, owing to the technical issue on Tuesday.Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in a statement said, “Due to ICMR portal update, yesterday’s [Tuesday’s] remaining case figures are added in today’s [Wednesday’s] reports.” The city civic body has not provided any breakup of the adjusted data. Mumbai reported 28 deaths, taking the city’s death toll to 7,505Mumbai’s highest single-day jump in cases was recorded on June 27 with 2,077 cases, followed by 1,751 cases on May 22 and 1,725 cases on May 24.

In the month so far, 16,63,929 tests were carried out and over 2.96 lakh samples were found positive, which is a positivity rate of 17.82% --marginally lower than the state’s overall positivity rate of 18.94%.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has repeatedly cautioned the state administration to remain alert to prevent a second wave of coronavirus in the state. A state bureaucrat said, “The CM in all review meetings recently has spoken on preventing another wave. There are no new measures to be adopted to prevent it. Rather, whatever is being done now has to be done rigourously and diligently. The state government is also mindful that once more relaxations are provided, the cases would increase.”Thackeray said that the ‘chase the virus’ campaign will be implemented in the state to break the chain of infection. Under the campaign, 15 people who come in close contact with patient will be strictly put in institutional quarantine. The campaign has yielded good results in Mumbai, Malegaon and few other locations.Thackeray, while commissioning a jumbo Covid facility with 816 beds in Pimpri said, “Testing should increase in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and rural part of the district and those found positive must be treated in time. Along with that, more attention should be given to senior citizens and those with co-morbidities. The health machinery should reach people with infections under the ‘chase the virus’ campaign; this will help us break the chain of infection. A similar campaign will be implemented across the state and everybody should ensure that the coronavirus infections do not spread.”Thackeray, on Wednesday, indicated that the state government is treading cautiously in allowing further relaxations. The CM, who participated in a conference of opposition party chief ministers, convened by Congress party president Sonia Gandhi, cited the hare and tortoise parable and said, “We have opened up industries and businesses in May itself. We are giving relaxations gradually in the densely populated belt in of Mumbai and Pune. Some people might think that we are going very slow. But we do not want to open up in a haste and then be forced to go back to a lockdown,” he said while speaking.The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) recorded 30% or 4,585 new cases reported in the state on Wednesday. Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli reported 519 and 517 new infections, respectively. Kalyan-Dombivli breached 30,000-mark on Wednesday.

27-08-2020||Chandigarh||Amendment to water down urban area law modified by Haryana assembly||The Haryana assembly on Wednesday passed a bill to undo a 2017 amendment in the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act which had watered down section 7-A of the Act. The stipulations under section 7-A pertained to grant of a no objection certificate (NOC) by the town and country planning department before registration of land in notified urban areas to prevent ill planned and haphazard construction. The move to undo the amendment comes in the wake of massive violations in registrations of sale deeds without obtaining the NOCs in notified urban areas in Gurugram district. The state government had in July booked six serving and one retired Gurugram revenue official for executing registration of sale deeds of properties in notified urban areas without obtaining NOCs. Later, the ambit of inquiry into the malpractices in registration of sale deeds was widened and registrations carried out from April 3, 2017 to December 31, 2019 were also probed for section 7-A violation. The fresh inquiry started from April 3, 2017, the day an amendment in section 7-A was notified by the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP government to water down the law. The 2017 amendmentThe 2017 amendment in section 7-A, steered by previous BJP government, led to two modifications in the provision. First, it decreased the size of notified urban area land holding for which NCC is required from less than one hectare (2.5 acres) to less than two kanals. Secondly, the definition of land for which the NOC was required was changed from vacant land to agricultural land. The agricultural land was defined was nehri (canal irrigated), chahi (irrigated from well), barani (dependent on rainfall) or any other term in revenue records. “The 2017 amendment ensured that real-estate developers were able to circumvent the requirement of NOC by converting an agricultural land into uncultivable (gair mumkin) in revenue records. The reduction in land size from less than hectares to two kanals also worked to the advantage of realtors,” officials said. The new amendment bill The amendment bill passed by the state assembly on Wednesday will change the definition of notified urban area land and size of the holding for which the NOC was required. Now, the land holding for which NOC is required is proposed to be less than one acre instead of less than two kanals and the notified urban area land definition has been changed from agricultural to vacant again. Vacant land has been defined as land wherein either no construction of any nature exists or such construction is in existence which is either uninhabited or not fit for human habitation and stands constructed without following the due course of law. Also, now NOC will be required for transfer of land through gift deed Congress MLA from Rohtak Bharat Bhushan Batra said that new stipulations brought in by this amendment bill pertaining to Section 7-A needed a re-look. “Please review the definition of vacant land under Section 7-A before you pass the amendment bill. It should be referred to an assembly committee for deliberations before it is passed by the assembly,” Batra said. Leader of the opposition, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, also supported Batra. JJP MLA from Narnaund MLA Ram Kumar Gautam said that there should be no ban on the registration of sale deeds. Some Congress MLAs walked out over the tabling the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas (Amendment) Bill as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amendment-to-water-down-urban-area-law-modified-by-haryana-assembly/story-B7ZW7AuPg9UOo3s119tLYL.html
27-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra reduces stamp duty to 2% from Sept 1 to Dec 31||The state government on Wednesday said it will reduce stamp duties levied on sales of apartments to 2% from September 1 to December 31 and then hike it slightly to 3% from January 1 to March 31, 2021, among relief measures for various sectors such as real estate, commercial transport and agriculture, fisheries sector, which were hit by the Covid-19 lockdown over the past five months. Currently, stamp duty in the state is 5% and 4% in urban and rural areas respectively. This is apart from 1% surcharge in urban areas and 1% zilla parishad cess in rural areas. The state government levies stamp duty on sale, gift and usufructuary — refers to temporary right to derive income from someone else’s property — mortgage of immovable properties. “We have decided to reduce stamp duty from September 1. It will be applicable till December 31. In this period, people will be charged 2% stamp duty on property transactions. But from January 1, stamp duty will be 3% on all property transactions till March-end 2021,” said a senior official from the state revenue department. “The move is to boost the real estate sector, considering the ongoing slump following the lockdown imposed to contain Covid-19 spread. It will also bring relief to the common people who wanted to buy their own house,” he added. CREDAI-MCHI (Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry), a leading builders association, said the decision will offer respite to the real estate sector, which is going through a rough phase. “The reduced cost of the stamp duty is bound to encourage first-time homebuyers, fence-sitters as well as resale flat buyers to invest in real estate,” said Nayan Shah, President, CREDAI-MCHI. Similar is the view of Farshid Cooper, MD, Spenta Corporation, who said this move, which comes ahead of the upcoming festive season, will definitely help the sector improve their sales volume.To give a boost to the transport sector, which has sustained losses owing to the lockdown, the state cabinet on Wednesday decided to waive off road vehicle tax levied on commercial vehicles for six months. This will benefit about 11.40 lakh commercial vehicles with the annual burden of Rs 700 crore on the state exchequer. “The waiver will be applicable for the period of April to September 30, 2020,,as a bid to offer them relief in the wake of business losses. The commercial vehicles paying annual vehicle taxes can now pay 50% of it,” said transport minister Anil Parab. Commercial vehicles, including goods carriers, tourism vehicles, vanity vans, private services vehicles, will benefit from the step. Cabinet also decided to give ex-gratia to fishermen to give them relief from the losses they sustained owing to the cyclones a few months ago. More than 54,000 fishermen are expected to get Rs65.17 crore from the scheme. The ex-gratia ranges between Rs10,000 and Rs3,000 depending on the scale of fishing they are involved in. The amount will be directly credited into the bank accounts of the fisherfolk, said fisheries minister Aslam Shaikh. State cabinet also decided to extend the ongoing milk-purchasing scheme, under which the excessive milk is purchased from farmers to convert it into skimmed milk powder. State government produced 4,421 metric tonnes powder and 2,320 metric tonnes butter from 5.99 lakh litres of milk it procured between April 6 and July 31. More than 20 lakh litres of milk remain unsold in the state owing to closure of hotels, restaurants, sweet shops and drop in sales of ice creams and other milk products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-reduces-stamp-duty-to-2-from-sept-1-to-dec-31/story-sie7xuvxWdJUjM8bkkSHyI.html
27-08-2020||City||Covid-19: Only 4 Punjab districts have level-3 beds in govt-run hospitals||Even as the Punjab government has called for a war-like preparedness to deal with the rising Covid-19 cases, only four districts have proper facilities in the state-run hospitals to treat critical patients. Currently, the state’s three government medical colleges in Amritsar, Patiala and Faridkot and the Jalandhar civil hospital have 350 level-3 beds for treating those with severe infection. A total of 800 level-3 beds, including those in private hospitals, are available in the state. Even the Ludhiana district, which has the highest number of positive cases and death rate, does not have level-3 beds and the patients have to avail the treatment at private hospitals or to go to Patiala. Data shows that Punjab has the worst recovery rate at 63%, followed by Kerala and Karnataka at 65%. Also, it figures among states with the worst fatality rate at 2.5%, followed by Madhya Pradesh 2.4%. All government hospitals in the state, except the three government medical colleges and the Jalandhar civil hospital, refer the critical patients elsewhere as they only have level-1 and level-2 beds. The government hospitals have nearly 13, 000 level-1 beds for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients and around 6,000 level-2 beds for mild to moderately symptomatic cases. “We are planning to get level-3 beds in Ludhiana soon considering the rise in cases in the district. Now, almost every district has an advanced life support ambulance equipped with the latest equipment to transport patients during an emergency,” said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. In the absence of critical care in local government hospitals, many patients are spending large amount of money in private hospitals for availing treatment in critical cases. A senior doctor said most of the patients come to government hospitals in a serious condition and it affects the recovery rate and contributes to the fatality rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-only-4-punjab-districts-have-level-3-beds-in-govt-run-hospitals/story-ze0v87gXedxKBnMF4hJViL.html
27-08-2020||City||Open Kartarpur corridor on Guru Nanak’s Joti Jot Diwas: Pak gurdwara body to India||The Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) on Wednesday urged the Indian government to reopen the Kartarpur corridor for Sikh devotees on the occasion of Guru Nanak’s Joti Jot Diwas (day of immersion in eternal light) on September 20. PSGPC president Satwant Singh said this while presiding over a meeting at the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB)’s head office in Lahore to make arrangements for observing Joti Jot Diwas at Kartarpur. Later, talking to HT over phone, the PSGPC chief said, “We are marking the occasion for the first time after the opening of the corridor at Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib. We want the corridor to be opened from today itself. But if that is not possible, it should be opened on the day. We request the Indian government to allow the passage of Sikh sangat through the corridor to take part in the function being organised from September 20 to 22.” They also want the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), which manages the affairs of gurdwaras in Punjab and other states of India, to send special jathas of ragis (hymn singers) on the occasion, he said. “We also invite SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal and Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh to be part of the function,” he said.The PSGPC chief said they will also follow the Covid-19 guidelines of the health agencies during the visit of the Sikh sangat through the corridor. Special arrangements will be made for maintaining social distancing, he added. India temporarily suspended the pilgrimage to the Kartarpur gurdwara on March 16 in view of the coronavirus outbreak. Pakistan had also closed the corridor soon after. On June 29, Pakistan had announced that they have reopened the corridor for the pilgrims from India. The Indian government, however, is yet to take a decision on the matter.BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION: PAKISTAN TEAM TO VISIT DERA BABA NANAKA team of engineers from Pakistan will meet the officials of Indian officials at Dera Baba Nanak town of Gurdaspur district on Thursday on the construction of a bridge over a low-lying area at the border as part of the corridor project.A senior Border Security Force (BSF) official said, “The Pakistan team will survey the Indian side of the bridge before starting construction.” Officials of the National Highway Authority of India, BSF and Land Port Authority of India (LPAI) will be present in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/open-kartarpur-corridor-on-guru-nanak-s-joti-jot-diwas-pak-gurdwara-body-to-india/story-BBSr6pWVf9DYM6cxWB1CYO.html

This comes after the state vigilance department in July had asked the additional chief secretary (ACS) of the local bodies department to conduct an inquiry into the alleged illegal constructions by comparing the number of new electricity connections issued by the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) with the number of building plans approved. In June, RTI activist Rohit Sabharwal had written to the vigilance department, seeking action against the officials involved in the matter. Sabharwal had alleged that around 25,000 connections were approved by PSPCL within MC limits, but only around 8,000 building plans were approved by MC in this period. Sabharwal had alleged that the building branch officials failed to take action against illegal buildings due to “gratification or protection money” given by the owners, thereby causing a loss of crores to the public exchequer. MC had also commenced a similar exercise in February this year, when it was reportedly found that PSPCL had issued around 1 lakh power connections in the last three years, while MC had approved just around 5,000 building plans. But, the exercise remained on paper, with no action against the officials concerned. Recently, two municipal town planners (MTP) were also asked to assist MC additional commissioner Rishipal Singh in this inquiry. Singh said an inquiry was already underway and he had sought the details regarding building plans approved by the building branch in the respective period, but the details were awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/illegal-constructions-punjab-local-bodies-dept-asks-ludhiana-mc-for-report-on-building-plans/story-s0vVOTntKNkKJQbU1hnXqN.html

It had started the campaign in September last year but as the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease broke out, priorities changed and people slowly started using plastic bags again, defeating the goal of making Noida a ‘plastic free city’, said officials.The authority re-started the drive from August 24 the use of plastic bags choke drains.“The campaign against use of plastic bags will continue until the city becomes completely plastic waste free. We worked intensively in 2019 after starting our campaign to make Noida a plastic free city. But due to Covid-19, we focused on other jobs related to the pandemic. Since Monday, we are taking action against those who use plastic bags regularly since Monday,” said SC Mishra, senior project engineer of the Noida authority, who is heading the health department that has the onus of enforcing the ban on plastic bags.On Monday, the authority carried out a drive against violators in sectors 44, 45 and Harola village, wherein it imposed a penalty of Rs 5,000 against ten vendors who were allegedly found using plastic bags. On Tuesday, the authority imposed Rs 5,000 penalty each against 10 vendors in sectors 11, 12, 22, 66 and 121.The authority has imposed a total of Rs26,200 in penalties against those found using plastic bags since January 2020.On Wednesday, however, the authority did not carry out the drive. “The authority will conduct random drives so that the use of the plastic bags can be discouraged,” said Mishra.The Uttar Pradesh cabinet in December 2015 had approved a complete ban on distribution, manufacture and sale of polythene carry bags of a thickness of 40 microns and below in the state, following an Allahabad High Court order in November 2015, directing it to ensure that the order is complied with by December 31.Noida Non-degradable Garbage/Polythene (control) Bylaws, 2015, were drafted in line with the UP Plastic and Non-Biodegradable (Regulation of use and disposal) Act, 2000. As per the law, the authority staff can levy a penalty of R5,000 on those found using a plastic bag thinner than 40 microns. If a person is found violating the ban a second time, the authority can charge a penalty of R500 per day. A third-time violation would lead to imprisonment of three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-restarts-drive-to-check-plastic-bag-usage-in-city/story-jReaWKtudpj5wUhFQgeg2L.html
27-08-2020||Mumbai||77% treated with Remdesivir, Tocilizumab survived: Data||A total of 77% of Covid-19 patients treated with Tocilizumab and Remdesivir – the two drugs under trial which are an essential part of the treatment protocol – have survived, according to data procured from a major tertiary-care civic-run hospital. However, doctors have recommended further studies to establish the effectiveness of the drugs. Remdesivir is an antiviral drug used for treatment of Ebola which costs ₹5,000 per vial. It is manufactured by Hyderabad-based Hetero Healthcare and Cipla. Tocilizumab, also known as Atlizumab, was originally designed as an immunosuppressive drug to treat arthritis, and imported by Roche pharma and marketed by Mumbai-based Cipla. Data shared by the health department of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) showed that till August 23, 642 patients suffering from Covid-19 were treated with Tocilizumab and Remdesivir at the hospital. Of these, 493 survived, while 149 (23%) succumbed to the infection.At the civic-run hospital, 477 Covid-19 patients were treated with Remdesivir. On the first day, 200mg of dosage was given. In the next four days, 100mg of dosage was provided to the patients. Following which, 385 of them recovered, which makes the recovery rate 80.7%. Ninety-two of them died. At the same hospital, of the 165 patients who were given Tocilizumab, 108 survived (65.5%), while the remaining 57 (34.5%) died. The data also shows there were more deaths among people who were given two doses of Tocilizumab. In the first set of patients, 141 of them were given 400mg of Tocilizumab dosage. Of these, 100 recovered, taking the recovery rate to 71% and 41 (29%) died. In the second set, where 24 patients were given two dosages of Tocilizumab, only 8 (33.3%) survived, while 16 (66.7%) died. “Mostly, critical patients with comorbidities are given two doses of Tocilizumab, but as the result shows, it doesn’t prove to be fruitful. We have instructed civic-run hospitals to provide only one dose of Tocilizumab to patients,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. A state Covid-19 task force member Dr Rahul Pandit also recommended a single dose of Tocilizumab be given. In July, Roche said their trial didn’t find Tocilizumab to be effective when used on Covid-19 patients. “Several international studies have shown that Tocilizumab is ineffective in the treatment of novel coronavirus. In my experience, steroids have proved to be more helpful. The survival and mortality rate of patients on Tocilizumab don’t hold much importance until it is supported by scientific studies,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, an epidemiologist from Hinduja Hospital.“Research has shown that both the drugs (Tocilizumab and Remdesivir) may not be effective in saving lives, but do contribute to faster recovery. It reduces the recovery rate of patients by 2-3 days,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/77-treated-with-remdesivir-tocilizumab-survived-data/story-AUgSpycXKBkklE0zaftbUP.html
27-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Illegal farmhouses in Aravallis bulldozed, eight more on radar||A joint team from the department of town and country planning (DTCP) and the municipal corporation Gurugram (MCG) on Wednesday carried out a demolition drive in which at least eight farmhouses and adjoining structures, such as like plinths and boundary walls, which were allegedly being constructed in Bandhwari village in Aravallis hills without any permission, were razed. The team was supported by around seventy personnel of the city police deployed to prevent any untoward incident, officials said.RS Bhath, district town planner, who also has the charge of enforcement, said the corporation had already given notices to the eight farmhouses. “As notices and other formalities for the eight farmhouses were complete, their walls, major structures and sheds were demolished. There are eight more unauthorised farmhouses which have been carved out there and these would be demolished on Thursday,” said Bhath, who was also the duty magistrate.The MCG, meanwhile, said these farmhouses were allegedly being developed on 30 acres of land without any permission. He said their team, led by Hari Om Atri, the MCG joint commissioner, worked in tandem with DTCP officials to raze the structures. “A team of officials led by joint commissioner Hari Om Atri and those from engineering cell, including Rajiv Yadav, Ajay Sharma, Hari Om Rohit and Ashish, reached the site in morning. They jointly worked with DTCP team and carried out demolition of farmhouses with assistance from police,” said an MCG spokesperson. Officials also said that efforts are being made to identify the developer of these unauthorised farmhouses, who is believed to be a resident of Delhi. “We will take action against violators and a police case would be registered in this matter,” Bhath said.The enforcement wing of town and planning department, which mostly deals with private licensed colonies and unauthorized colonies in controlled areas, is likely to expand its operations against the unauthorised development of farmhouses in the district as this issue has started to assume serious proportion, said DTCP officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-illegal-farmhouses-in-aravallis-bulldozed-eight-more-on-radar/story-gYkB2shKOrFpz3Q0QpIlQN.html
27-08-2020||Delhi||‘Harassed by moneylender’: Brothers kill selves at Chandni Chowk showroom||Two brothers, both jewellers who suffered financial losses due to the Covid pandemic and the lockdown , allegedly hanged themselves at their shop in the Walled City’s Chandni Chowk on Wednesday afternoon, police said. The brothers, aged 47 and 42, left behind a “suicide note”, in which they blamed their “poor financial condition” for their step but did not “name” any person. Family members and employees, however, alleged the brothers were “thrashed” and “threatened” by the musclemen of a private financer from whom they had taken a loan but were not able to repay it or pay the monthly interest because of losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic, said a police officer, who did not want to be named.“The family verbally made the allegations. Their statements are being recorded in writing. The allegations will be verified and further action will be taken accordingly,” deputy commissioner of police (north) Monika Bhardwaj said.The DCP said police received a call about the hanging of the brothers on the third floor of their shop. “An employee saw the two brothers hanging and raised an alarm. Their father was on the first floor at that time,” Bhardwaj said.Police said the elder brother was married and is survived by his wife and two children. The younger one is unmarried. The family lives in north Delhi.Speaking to media persons, the father and another brother of the two jewellers alleged they were being “threatened by a local businessman and his associate” and the two “hanged themselves because of the torture”.“We want police to call those people. They should not be harassing someone so much so that the person kills himself. Today, my brothers died. We don’t want anyone else to take a similar step,” the brother said.He alleged that his two brothers were being “harassed” daily since the lockdown. “When business was shut during the lockdown, how could have they paid the money,” he alleged.Another police officer associated with the incident said on the condition of anonymity that the two brothers had allegedly borrowed around Rs 60 lakh on interest from private financiers. As they were unable to return the money or pay the interest amount, the financers used to send their “bouncers” to their showroom to collect the money.“Many moneylenders used to come to the showroom and torture them (the two brothers). They used to ask them to consume poison if they did not have money to pay,” an employee of the showroom told the media persons, saying he had been working there for nearly 15 years.Yogesh Singhal, president of the bullion and jewellers’ association of Kucha Mahajani, Chandni Chowk, released a video statement regarding the incident. “The death of the two brothers is disturbing news for the jeweller fraternity. The jewellery business is affected because of the Covid-19 pandemic and jewellers have become debt-ridden. The moneylenders harass them for getting back their money,” he said.If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

27-08-2020||Delhi||South civic body says Delhi govt creating financial crisis; AAP hits back||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Wednesday accused the Delhi government of “deliberately creating a financial crisis” in the civic body by not releasing its due amount of Rs 1,100 crore in this financial year and warned of a protest to press for their demand. South Delhi mayor Anamika Mithilesh said the civic body’s councillors and employees would stage a sit-in outside the Delhi secretariat with a “begging bowl” from September 10 and demand release of their funds.In response, Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in a statement said that if the BJP can’t run the municipal corporations, then they should resign immediately rather than “cry and make excuses” for every issue. “They are so steeped in corruption that they can’t even pay the salaries of MCD employees. AAP will run MCD efficiently in the present budget only,” AAP said.During the pandemic, the civic authorities said, SDMC has spent Rs 4.35 crore on Covid-19 related measures but no monetary help was provided by the Delhi government.“According to the 5th Delhi Finance Commission recommendations, the Delhi government has to give us our dues of Rs 1,100 crore for two quarters of the current financial year. We are yet to get this money from the government despite several communications. Not releasing money is an attempt to create a financial crunch in the civic body. We are now compelled to stage a sit-in protest at Delhi secretariat with begging bowls in our hands from September 10 to demand the release of our funds,” mayor Mithilesh said.The government, she said, was not allowing the civic body to increase revenue by hiking one-time parking charges. “We had sent a proposal in 2018 to the government to allow us to increase one-time parking charges, which a new car buyer pays while purchasing a vehicle. The government, after keeping the file with them for a year, declined our request. They neither give us money nor do they allow us to increase taxes. So how should we survive?” she asked.Under 5th Delhi Finance Commission, the Delhi government has to give 12.5% of its net tax collection to urban local bodies every year.Narendra Chawla, leader of the house in the SDMC, said the Delhi government had decreased grants in sanitation, health and dengue control schemes. “Even this 12.5% share is not being given to the civic body by the government. For dengue control, SDMC spends Rs 100 crore every year but the government gives Rs 36 crore only. In 2019-20, Rs 80 crore was given for sanitation purposes but no fund has been released for sanitation for 2020-21. Due to reduction in allotment of funds, sterilisation of dogs and management of stray cattle was also affected,” Chawla said.Chawla said the government was not releasing even the allocated funds. In 2018-19, the government allocated Rs 1,081 crore but the civic body got only Rs 810 crore. In 2019-20, it approved Rs 450 crore for SDMC but released only Rs 145.52 crore, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/south-civic-body-says-delhi-govt-creating-financial-crisis-aap-hits-back/story-uXYRUOGglUrDNfZ8tNLnDO.html

Showers are likely to continue through Friday, as per the Met’s fresh forecast, which revised its earlier prediction that the city would receive heavy rain starting Wednesday evening.The department has now said that some parts of the city will see light rainfall on Wednesday night. The city is expected to get moderate to heavy showers from Thursday morning. “The forecast rain has shifted to Thursday morning. In Delhi, in most parts we will witness moderate rain, but in some parts of the National Capital Region (NCR), there is a possibility of heavy rainfall,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre. IMD has predicted intense spells of rain in many parts of northwest India between August 26 and August 28. Scientists explained that the monsoon trough (line of low pressure) is active, lying south of its normal position and is likely to remain active for the next two or three days. Apart from this, there is a convergence of lower level south-westerly winds from the Arabian Sea over north-west India till August 28. In Delhi, the peak rainfall activity due to this will be between August 27 and August 28. “The monsoon trough is shifting northwards and will stay very close to Delhi-NCR between August 25 and August 28. Under its influence, the convergence of lower-level easterlies from the Bay of Bengal and south-westerlies from the Arabian Sea will take place over north-west India,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/met-revises-forecast-delhi-now-likely-to-get-heavy-rain-from-thursday/story-wKJNK7UyDfduea2VJHP0MI.html
27-08-2020||Delhi||DU’s second round of exams from Sept 14 will be in both in offline and online modes||The Delhi University on Wednesday informed the Delhi high court that the second leg of the open book examination (OBE) for the final-year students, slated to begin from September 14, will be conducted in both online and offline modes so that students can choose the mode they prefer.In an affidavit filed before the bench of justice Hima Kohli and justice Subramonium Prasad, the varsity said the examination, which is being conducted for students who did not appear in the first leg of OBE, held from August 10-31, will be conducted in both modes, even though the format, which is OBE, remains the same. It said the exams would start from September 14 and end on October 1. Earlier, the high court, while hearing pleas by law student Prateek Sharma and the National Federation for Blind, seeking to set up effective mechanisms for visually impaired and the specially abled students, had asked the varsity to hold offline examinations from September 14. It said students can take the exams by coming to the examination centres in the city. However, students who cannot reach the city due to the pandemic and other issues would have the option of appearing in the second leg of the OBE remotely. The varsity also said the specially abled students, who want to better their scores, can also appear in the examination and they would be given five hours to complete the test.The varsity told the court that the arrangement has been made in light of the revised guidelines on the academic calendar and examinations issued by University Grants Commission (UGC) on July 6 which has laid down provisions for the universities to conduct examinations in a blended (a mix of online and offline) mode for final-year students as a one-time measure in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.DU also said the undergraduate results of the first leg of OBE shall be notified from the last week of September through the last week of October.“Since the undergraduate courses are based on credit system and the results are prepared through relative grading, the processing of results can’t be started until all answer scripts have been evaluated and their marks/awards have been entered into the results portal,” the affidavit read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-s-second-round-of-exams-from-sept-14-will-be-in-both-in-offline-and-online-modes/story-KFeSF7eaqGncZ80GxCQpcP.html
27-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi BJP requests Centre to restart Metro, AAP says ‘nothing but drama’||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s Delhi unit has requested the Centre to restart Metro service in the national capital. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, met housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri in this regard on Wednesday. Later, the party leaders slammed the Aam Aadmi Party government in the Capital for doing little to provide adequate public transport to the people. The AAP hit back, saying despite the fact that the decision to reopen Metro rests with the L-G and the Centre, the BJP is fooling people. Gupta said, “We have requested the minister to start Metro, which is Delhi’s transport lifeline, at the earliest and issue guidelines for the same.”The BJP said that ever since the unlock process has begun, people are facing a lot of difficulty in commuting due to lack of public transport. It hit out at the AAP government for doing little to provide adequate public transport to people of Delhi.“If the Delhi government was concerned about the transport system, it could have bought buses, used school buses, hired private operator buses to ensure people don’t face any difficulty. But they did not, as the reality is that they do not want to work,” said Gupta.After the meeting with Puri, Bidhuri said, “In Delhi, weekly markets have been allowed to operate. Then why can’t Metro operations resume? People of Delhi are facing a lot of problems and if the Metro starts it will be a big relief to them.”In a statement, the AAP said, “The BJP is doing nothing but drama. The BJP is at the Centre, the L-G reports to the Centre and yet the party enacts a drama every day, sending requests to their own government. The party demands reopening of gyms but the L-G disapproves. What is this if not a drama. People understand everything.” New BJP team Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta appointed 250 new mandal –the lowest level in the party’s state unit hierarchy—presidents to start the work for the municipal elections, scheduled in 2022. For the first time, the BJP has appointed 20 women party workers as presidents of a mandal (ward).Gupta, who took charge of Delhi BJP in June, had earlier told HT that more women party workers will be given key responsibilities. The new state team will be announced in the next few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-bjp-requests-centre-to-restart-delhi-metro/story-KHrGG0eaNwwcVc482j5iBP.html

27-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: High court asks police to submit case diary on FIR against Natasha Narwal, others||The Delhi high court on Wednesday directed the city police to file the case diary pertaining to the FIR against several people, including Pinjra Tod member Natasha Narwal, who have been charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for their alleged involvement in the north-east Delhi riots. Justice Vibhu Bakhru, while hearing Narwal’s bail application, said the case diary should be submitted by Saturday in a sealed cover, so that the matter could be heard on Monday, August 31. The court also agreed to the request made by solicitor general SV Raju that the petitioners’ counsel not be allowed to attend that hearing as the case diary has sensitive information.A case diary is a record of the daily investigation into a case. Any police officer conducting any inquiry is required to maintain a record of the investigation done on each day in a particular case. It is an important document to understand the investigation carried out in a case and the court can ask for it during trial proceedings. Narwal, through her counsel Adit S Pujari, had sought bail in the case. Narwal and another member of Pinjra Tod, Devangana Kalita, were arrested in May by the crime branch of the Delhi Police and booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including rioting, unlawful assembly and attempt to murder.They have also been booked under the stringent anti-terror law UAPA for allegedly being part of a “premeditated conspiracy” leading to the riots.On Wednesday, Raju told the court that he would require the examination of case diary to oppose Narwal’s bail plea and that he wanted limited participants as the contents of the case diary were sensitive and cannot be put in the public domain before the charge sheet is filed.To this, Bakhru proposed that he could adjourn the matter to September -- when in-person hearing is slated to start -- and the matter could be heard in the presence of limited persons. However, advocate Pujari said he does not have any problem to the sealed cover report or from being excluded from the hearing. He said if the matter is further pushed to September, by which time the charge sheet would also be filed, it would prejudice Narwal’s case.He also informed Bakhru that the trial court could not pronounce the order on the bail application of co-accused Kalita on Tuesday, because the case diary was brought to the high court.Following this, Bakhru directed the police to send the case diary to the trial court while also ordering that the same be submitted in a sealed cover by Saturday at his residence, as the matter is currently being heard over video conferencing.The next hearing is on August 31||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-high-court-asks-police-to-submit-case-diary-on-fir-against-narwal-others/story-6bd2BKfDN9cZphqgLVX1jL.html

Kale is the first student from the school to pass out and secure a job.“Education has helped me move ahead in life. Now I have a job in hand, and won’t have sell flowers on the streets,” said Kale.The school not only focusses on imparting education but also trains them in other areas, such as health, hygiene and good behaviour.“I have seen my family starve after my father lost one leg in an accident many years ago. My family was into agriculture. We had three-acre land in Osmanabad, however, the drought for three consecutive years impacted us a lot. We were under debts, after which we moved to Thane in search of livelihood. It was difficult for us to survive in this big city, so we resorted to selling flowers. I had studied till Class 7 in the village, but left school mid-way as we did not have enough money,” said Kale.His family includes his parents and two elder brothers, all of them sell flowers or eatables at various signals in the city.When the Signal School was launched, Kale was 18 years old, but he resumed his studies from class 8 onwards. “In the very first-year, he secured above 80%. He was very dedicated towards studies and managed to score 77% marks in SSC exams. He used to diligently study for ten hours a day. He put in equal efforts in his engineering exams as well,” said Aarti Parab, a teacher, Signal School.

At least 1,379 people were tested for the Covid-19 infection and 962 or close to 70% were found positive. These people had not reported any history of coming in contact with a positive person. The survey had been conducted in Pune city, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune rural area. A total of 6.66 lakh people were found to have comorbidities or were from the vulnerable age group from the entire district who were screened for temperature and oxygen saturation. Of these 2,185 were suspected and found to have symptoms. From these cases, the swab samples were taken of 1,379 people of which a total of 962 were found to be positive.Saurabh Rao, divisional commissioner, said, “These people who had no known contact history of being in touch with any Covid-19 positive person were found positive during the door-to-door survey. Such timely action helped take care of these patients and early intervention and medical help could save many lives, especially from the vulnerable group.” Dr Sanjay Dabhade, member of Jan Aarogya Manch, said, “The survey indicates that there is high prevalence of the infection here, which has been supported earlier through the sero surveillance done by the government. However, I must appreciate the government’s efforts to conduct this survey and their timely intervention did help treat these patients immediately. For those who are comorbid and from the vulnerable age group, I believe, the government can look beyond the ICMR guidelines because today no one realises that they are infected or are infecting others. So, contact tracing has gone for a toss. However, this random survey will definitely help bring down the case fatality rate which should be the prime objective now.”Results of surveyArea-Total screened- Suspected- Swab taken- Tested positivePune city- 2,64,860- 538- 538- 502PCMC- 3,534- 827- 472- 420Pune rural- 3,97,867- 1,358- 369- 40Total- 6,66,261- 2,185- 1,379- 962||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/comorbidity-survey-sees-70-testing-positive-for-covid-19-in-pune-district/story-AOzbgM7EWjNJZ3tqPfPDsM.html

Two of the deceased – Bala, 45, and Kajal, 20, hailing from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh (UP) – were riding in the canter, while the third victim – Shakil, 22, native of Saharanpur, UP, was travelling with his brother, who was driving the other truck. The mishap also left four people injured – Sham Lal, 45, Rajinder Singh, 30, Sanjogta, 19 and Anju, 13, all migrants hailing from Muzaffarnagar, UP.ASI Harvinder Singh Ghuman of Doraha police station said the migrants were travelling from Muzaffarnagar to Moga when the accident took place around 6am. Shakil’s brother Farman told the police that as the two trucks reached near Rajwant Hospital in Doraha, the canter driver missed the slip road leading towards Southern Bypass and braked suddenly in the middle of the road. Moving right behind, he lost control of his vehicle and rammed into the canter, causing both vehicles to overturn. The impact of the collision killed two migrant women and his brother on the spot.The trucks toppling in the middle of the highway caused serpentine queues of vehicles in no time. After a police team rushed the victims to medical aid, the trucks were removed with the help of a JCB machine.Two of the injured persons are stated to be in a critical condition at Christian Medical College and Hospital in Ludhiana. The other victims are admitted at ESI Hospital, Ludhiana. The canter driver fled the scene after abandoning the vehicle.He has been booked under Sections 279 (rash driving), 304-A (causing death by negligence), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the Indian Penal Code on the statement of Farman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-killed-as-truck-rams-into-canter-at-doraha-near-punjab-s-ludhiana-town/story-bw3LBFMifzuJHS73pMz68K.html

Of the total number of 189 applications, decisions (grants or refusals) were reached in 163 cases.The Home Office’s country policy and information note for India on notes that on September 6, 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that consensual sexual acts between adults, conducted in private, was no longer an offence under Section 377 of the IPC.“The historic ruling effectively scrapped the colonial law, which deemed sex between consenting gay men, a punishable offence”, the note adds.The 189 applications based on sexual orientation were among overall 8837 asylum applications made by Indian citizens in the period 2015-19. Of all asylum applications from citizens of various countries, the grant rates are among the lowest for Indians: 3 per cent.The figures also record that the list of largest number of voluntary returns to country of origin of those either detained under immigration rules or those who are in the country illegally is topped by Indians: 1,290, or 16 per cent, in the year ending June 2020.Visitor visas issued during the year were down due to the coronavirus pandemic. Chinese and Indian nationals accounted for 42 per cent of all such visas issued, but they were down 44 per cent for Chinese and 41 per cent for Indians compared to the previous year.“There were falls in the number of visitor visas granted due to travel restrictions implemented in response to Covid-19 to almost all nationalities, with the largest falls seen for: Chinese nationals, down 273,105 (-44%); Indian nationals, down 206,206 (-41%)”, the Home Office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sexual-orientation-less-indians-seek-uk-asylum-after-sc-ruling/story-vi3OLtvCOZPCD5ngdif5UI.html
27-08-2020||World||‘I looked him in the eyes’: Pakistan family watches mosque shooter face justice in New Zealand||Around 3 am each morning this week, Khurshid Alam woke up in his Pakistan home to watch survivors give testimony against the man who shot dead 51 worshippers in New Zealand mosques, including his brother, Naeem, and nephew, Talha.Divided by thousands of miles, a seven-hour time difference and the coronavirus pandemic shutting borders, Naeem’s widow, Ambreen, was among those who faced the shooter in Christchurch High Court and on Thursday heard his sentence.White supremacist Brenton Tarrant, a 29-year-old Australian, was jailed for life without parole for the March 2019 attacks he launched on two Christchurch mosques while livestreaming.“It was a very traumatic time, the last few days,” Alam said from his home in Lahore in eastern Pakistan. “What we have lost cannot come back, but at least we know that justice has been given.”Alam had earlier watched the address by his sister-in-law, admiring her bravery. Alam’s wife also travelled for days amid the pandemic and spent two weeks in quarantine to provide support for Ambreen, who lives in Christchurch, in court.Many victims’ families have watched from secure video links overseas and more than 50 received support to enter New Zealand, which has largely closed its borders to non-residents.Ambreen described how her life had capsized since the moment last year, standing in a hospital in the early hours of the morning after the shooting, she realised her missing husband and 21-year old-son were not among the names hospital staff read out as injured.Act of bravery “Since my husband and son passed away, I have never had a proper normal sleep,” she told the court, and the gunman, on Tuesday. “I don’t think I ever will.”She also spoke of her pride in her husband, who was posthumously awarded for courage in Pakistan for charging at the gunman, buying precious time for worshippers to escape.“Naeem died trying to save others and his act of bravery is something his sons will always feel proud for. His death was a reflection of his life,” she said.Ambreen said she felt distressed watching survivor after survivor stand up to address the shooter, but that once she had delivered her speech, she felt a surge of victory.“It was quite a relief to express my opinion in front of him,” she said. “I looked him in the eyes.”Since losing her eldest son, who had just graduated as an engineer, and her husband and “best friend”, Ambreen has cared for her two surviving sons, is learning to drive, has taken her family on the Haj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia and endured New Zealand’s strict weeks-long lockdown.Throughout, she said, her anxiety grew over what would happen to the shooter.When the sentence was finally delivered on Thursday, her family from New Zealand to Pakistan felt some solace.“I miss them. It’s a lifelong struggle for me,” she said. “But I felt like Naeem and Talha were there with me. I thought: they are waiting for justice to be done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-looked-him-in-the-eyes-pakistan-family-watches-mosque-shooter-face-justice-in-new-zealand/story-HEXiSrG7bKMEGCWMB7IBHL.html

Traffic was blocked on the interstate and Highway 90.“Stay inside and wait for additional direction from local officials,” Edwards wrote on Twitter.Residents of Lake Charles heard Laura’s winds howling and the sound of breaking glass as the storm passed through the city of 78,000 with winds of 85 miles per hour (137 km per hour) and gusts up to 128 mph (206 kph) in the hour after landfall.The windows of the city’s 22-floor Capital One Tower were blown out, street signs were toppled and pieces of wooden fence and debris from collapsed buildings lay scattered in the flooded streets, video footage on Twitter and Snapchat showed. Lake Charles resident Borden Wilson, a 33-year-old pediatrician, was anxiously anticipating his return home after evacuating to Minden, Louisiana.“I never even boarded up my windows. I didn’t think to do that. This is the first hurricane I’ve experienced. I just hope my house is fine,” he told Reuters in a telephone interview.Laura made landfall just before 1 a.m. as a Category 4 storm packing winds of 150 mph (240 kph) in the small town of Cameron, Louisiana, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. It rapidly weakened to a Category 1 storm on Thursday morning with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph), and was forecast to become a tropical storm later in the day. The NHC warned that high water levels would persist along the Gulf Coast for several hours as Laura moved north and then northeast.Besides threatening life, the storm slammed the heart of the US oil industry, forcing oil rigs and refineries to shut down production.The Port of Lake Charles remained closed as workers were unable to enter or exit the facility due to downed power lines and trees. The port avoided significant flooding but power was out as of Thursday morning, manager of security and safety Ed Manint said. The harbor police were assessing the damage, he said. ‘Less surge than we thought’Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Pete Gaynor told Fox News that the agency would make storm damage assessments on Thursday and had the resources to respond to the storm now, adding he expected to see significant damage from wind and building damage.“I think we’re generally fortunate - less surge than we thought,” Gaynor said.The NHC on Wednesday predicted storm surge would be “unsurvivable” and could penetrate up to 40 miles inland. While the worst projections had not materialized, damaging winds and flooding rainfall would continue spreading inland later on Thursday, the NHC said. Laura could spawn tornadoes on Thursday over Louisiana, Arkansas and western Mississippi, and was expected to drop 4 to 8 inches of rain (101 to 203 mm) across portions of that region, the NHC said.US President Donald Trump on Thursday approved an emergency declaration for Arkansas, the White House said, authorizing federal officials to coordinate relief efforts and freeing up federal funds. He had approved an emergency declaration for Texas on Monday.Trump was scheduled to visit FEMA’s headquarters in early afternoon to receive a briefing on the hurricane.The eastern coastal counties of Texas that had braced for the worst were largely spared Laura’s rage. Galveston’s acting mayor, Craig Brown, told MSNBC he was canceling the island city’s evacuation on Thursday after the storm turned more toward Louisiana. The mayor of Beaumont, Texas, Becky Ames, told MSNBC the situation was “manageable.”Texas Governor Greg Abbott was planning to travel to east Texas to survey the damage on Thursday, his spokesman said. Around 650,000 homes and businesses in Louisiana and Texas were without power early Thursday, and local utilities in the storm’s path warned outage numbers would climb as the storm marched inland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-laura-slams-southwestern-louisiana-gutting-buildings-and-killing-at-least-one/story-D6Ef0Y7XciFwPdOu2WZGSK.html

Last week, deaths fell 17% from the prior week and below an average of 1,000 a day for the first time in weeks, according to a Reuters analysis. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHowever, while US metrics on cases, deaths, hospitalizations and test positivity rates were declining, health experts warned there could be another surge as schools reopen and colder weather forces more gatherings indoors.This week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said people exposed to Covid-19 but not symptomatic may not need to be tested. This contradicted earlier guidance from the CDC, shocking doctors and politicians and prompting accusations that it may have been based not on sound science but on political pressure from the Trump administration.The governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut slammed the CDC’s move as “reckless” and “not based on science,” and said they will not change testing guidelines in their states. “CDC and HHS have not shared their scientific rationale for this change in policy, which substitutes sound science-based public health guidance with the president’s misinformation,” they said in a joint statement. “Health experts recommend testing close contacts of individuals with Covid-19 to identify and prevent asymptomatic spread. This type of robust testing by our states has been a key factor in our success so far to flatten the curve in the tristate area.”On Wednesday, the top US government infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci told CNN he was having surgery during discussion of the change and expressed worry about the CDC’s move. US confirmed cases are now over 5.8 million - the highest total in the world. The US death toll is also the world’s highest.On a per capita basis, the United States ranks 12th in the world for the number of deaths, with 54 deaths per 100,000 people, and tenth in the world for cases, with 1,774 cases per 100,000 residents, according to a Reuters analysis.US consumer confidence dropped in August to its lowest in more than six years, as households worried about the labor market and incomes, casting doubts on the sustainability of the economy’s recovery from the Covid-19 recession.The ebb in confidence followed the expiration of a $600 weekly unemployment benefit supplement on July 31. For weeks, Republicans and Democrats have been deadlocked over the size and shape of a fifth coronavirus-response bill, on top of the approximately $3 trillion already enacted into law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-deaths-exceed-180-000-cases-continue-to-fall/story-lHcWl49VSkXoeng0CKLDyK.html

It’s a multi-organ disease, so the virus is really attacking the lungs, but also the heart and other organs,” Kluge said.“Younger people, particularly with the winter coming, will be in closer contact with the elder population,” he said. Older people and at-risk groups must protect themselves with a flu vaccination as winter approaches, a season when more hospitalisations and deaths may be expected, he added.Kluge, asked about concerns that schools could become a driver of infection, said that WHO’s 53 European member states would discuss the issue in meetings on Aug. 31 and in mid-September. “What we know is that we can’t open societies without opening the schools first,” he said. “So the key issue here is that it depends a lot on the level of transmission in the community. Basic measures have to be applied everywhere.”He added: “So far we know that the school setting has been not a main contributor to the epidemic. There is also more and more publications that adds to the body of evidence that children do play a role in the transmission, but that this is so far more linked with social gatherings.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tricky-moment-for-europe-as-schools-reopen-but-not-a-driver-of-covid-19-who/story-9N1gvqJlUnVER8WMqCWLHL.html
27-08-2020||World||Russia: No signs of crime in Alexei Navalny coma case so far||Russian authorities said Thursday they have found no indication so far that opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s coma, which his allies and German doctors treating him believe may have been brought about by poisoning, was caused by a criminal act.A preliminary inquiry launched last week hasn’t found any indication of “deliberate criminal acts committed against” Navalny, Russia’s Prosecutor General’s office said. The statement comes amid growing pressure from the West to investigate the sudden illness of the Kremlin’s fiercest critic and authorities’ apparent reluctance to do so.Navalny, an opposition politician and corruption investigator who is a longtime foe of President Vladimir Putin, fell ill on a flight back to Moscow from Siberia on Aug. 20 and was taken to a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk after the plane made an emergency landing.Over the weekend, he was transferred to the Charité hospital in Berlin, where doctors found indications of “cholinesterase inhibitors” in his system. They are yet to identify a specific substance.Found in some drugs, pesticides and chemical nerve agents, cholinesterase inhibitors act by blocking the breakdown of a key chemical in the body, acetycholine, which transmits signals between nerve cells.Navalny’s allies insist he was deliberately poisoned and say the Kremlin was behind it, accusations that officials denounced as “empty noise.”The Russian doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia have repeatedly contested the German hospital’s conclusion, saying they had ruled out poisoning as a diagnosis and that their tests for cholinesterase inhibitors came back negative.The politician’s team submitted a request to Russia’s Investigative Committee, demanding authorities launch a criminal probe on charges of an attempt on the life of a public figure last week, but said they received no response.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday he saw no grounds for a criminal case until the cause of the politician’s condition was fully established.On Thursday, Russian police said they have been conducting a preliminary probe — an inquiry to determine whether a criminal investigation should be launched — to “establish all the circumstances of the incident.”The announcement about the inquiry came after multiple Western and European officials — including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — called upon Russia to start a full and transparent investigation into Navalny’s condition.On Wednesday night, the politician’s illness was discussed in a phone conversation between Putin and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.According to the Kremlin’s readout of the call, Putin pointed out that “premature and unfounded accusations” were unacceptable and underscored Russia’s “interest in a thorough and objective investigation of all the circumstances of the incident.”German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Thursday once again urged Moscow to investigate Navalny’s condition.“We still expect of Moscow that a contribution be made from there to things being cleared up,” Maas said in Berlin ahead of a meeting with his counterparts from other European Union countries.“Otherwise, conjecture and speculation will remain that certainly won’t improve relations between Germany and Russia, and also relations between the EU and Russia, but will continue to weigh on them,” he said.Peskov on Thursday refused to comment on Maas’ statement and reiterated that there were no grounds for a criminal investigation.“Nothing has changed in that regard. We still, unfortunately, don’t understand what caused the condition the patient is in,” Peskov told reporters.He added that the inquiry announced by the Interior Ministry had started “in the first days” after Navalny fell ill and is routine police work “always carried out in cases like this.”The Prosecutor General’s office, in the meantime, said they reached out to Germany with a request to share their findings and clinical evidence of the alleged poisoning, adding that German law enforcement confirmed their “intention to cooperate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-no-signs-of-crime-in-alexei-navalny-coma-case-so-far/story-BbfkAo1LceGT87UEoveGSO.html

27-08-2020||World||Donald Trump’s big night: Expect talk of GOP progress, Dem anarchy||Four years ago, Donald Trump accepted the Republican Party’s nomination for president with a dark convention speech that painted a dystopian portrait of America in decline and offered a singular solution: himself.Though Trump has been president for three-and-a-half years, his rhetoric on the state of the nation has remained bleak. And as he prepares to deliver his second acceptance speech on Thursday, the president faces a country in crisis, one gripped by a once-in-a-century pandemic, a battered economy, a racial reckoning and a massive hurricane taking aim at the Gulf Coast.Though he will promise national greatness, there was little expectation he would deliver a message designed to unify the divided electorate.In 2016, his message was “I alone can fix it.” This time, while trailing in the polls, he will offer himself as the last remaining defense against radical forces threatening the American way of life.Aides have closely guarded details of the address, which was being revised the night before Trump was to speak from the White House South Lawn. While Trump has centered his recent stump speech on anarchists that he depicts overrunning city streets, aides signaled that Thursday’s speech will not be as dark as his infamous “American carnage” inaugural address.Against a backdrop of patriotism, Trump will describe America as a work in progress, one that is not perfect but has achieved much. It’s an argument meant to offer a contrast with Democrats whom the president has described as not loving their country. In a similar vein, aides said, Trump would speak to progress made on combating the coronavirus, which has been treated as something of an afterthought during much of the convention although it is still killing 1,000 Americans a day.But it is Trump’s handling of the pandemic that has sent him tumbling in the polls and maximized the pressure around his speech. And while aides recognize that few Joe Biden supporters are likely to switch sides, their goal with the speech is to set up a permissions structure for Republicans who have defected from Trump over his rhetoric or policies to come home.“He needs to give those people who don’t approve of him an excuse to be for him,” said Ari Fleischer, who served as White House press secretary for President George W. Bush.Fleischer said Trump should speak personally about his experiences with COVID-19 — including friends lost to the virus. And while much of the convention has been about energizing Trump’s base, Fleischer also saw openings for Trump to address the public’s concerns about social unrest and crime, particularly after violence erupted in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where a white officer shot a Black man seven times.“It strikes me that the choice for Republicans, the choice for the county, is that Biden is a good man who will do a lot of bad things to the country. Trump is a pretty rough and boorish guy who has done and will do a lot of good things for the country,” Fleischer said.The Trump campaign has struggled to make this a choice election. So far, voters have instead viewed it as a referendum on how the president has handled a pandemic that has killed more than 175,000 Americans and left millions unemployed.Most of the convention has been aimed at former Trump supporters or nonvoters as well as trying to drive up negative impressions of Biden so that some of his possible backers stay home. Aides said Trump is expected to deliver some direct attacks on his Democratic opponent and will sharply juxtapose the far left — whom he argues has Biden in its thrall — with the rest of the nation.But Jeff Shesol, who served as a speechwriter for President Bill Clinton, said Trump should use the moment to try to broaden his appeal to moderates and independents.“Here’s a guy who’s never had 50 percent approval at any point in his presidency, who’s down in the polls considerably nationally and in many of the battleground states,” Shesol said. “If there ever was an occasion for someone to sort of extend his arms and sweep more people in, if he conceivably could, it would be this moment.”“Yet it would be unwise to suggest that he’s going to do it,” Shesol said, “or that he, you know, is capable of doing it.”Trump met with top aides Wednesday afternoon to edit the speech before traveling to Baltimore to support Vice President Mike Pence’s turn in the convention spotlight. Further revisions could come until shortly before he was to appear on the White House lawn.New security fencing went up around the perimeter of the White House complex to prepare for possible protesters — some in town for a civil rights march on Friday. Aides were not certain if the noise from protesters would be heard during the speech. Earlier in the summer, demonstrators were audible during some outdoor presidential events.Stripped of the ability to do his mega-rallies, Trump has few set pieces left in the race’s remaining 68 days to overtake Biden. Beyond the fall debates, Thursday’s speech may be his biggest moment, but historians say there are few acceptance speeches that have truly altered races.Franklin Roosevelt’s 1932 speech, in which he laid out the New Deal, set the course for his time in office. George H.W. Bush’s 1988 speech, which helped him win that year, also tripped up his reelection bid four years later after he broke his “read my lips: no new taxes” promise, said presidential historian Julian Zelizer of Princeton University.“He’ll offer a few lines, I’m sure, about building a consensus,” Zelizer said. “But the focus will be divisive comments, dark rhetoric and blaming his failures on his enemy. It will be classic Trumpism.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-big-night-expect-talk-of-gop-progress-dem-anarchy/story-E64divSaEgv3ZsJNg3BwxL.html

He will address the nation with the White House as his backdrop, irking critics who say he is flouting conventional norms by hosting a political event on such historic grounds.The president, who faced criticism earlier this year for not articulating a clear vision for a second term, will be sharing his policy plans on Thursday and in upcoming speeches on the campaign trail, a campaign official said.Fireworks are expected over Washington’s nearby monuments at the conclusion of Trump’s speech accepting his party’s presidential nomination. He will address a large crowd on the lawn despite warnings against such gatherings because of the pandemic, which has forced both political parties to scale back their conventions and turn events mostly virtual.Trump’s campaign says precautions against the coronavirus will be taken. The president often boasts about his crowd sizes; his campaign has largely done away with his signature rallies because of the virus.‘NOT GROUNDED IN REALITY’Also on Thursday, in a bit of counter-programming, Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris plans to deliver a speech in Washington characterizing the Republican convention as a dishonest distraction from the White House’s pandemic response.“Part of what I will be talking about is that they’re dealing in lies but also they are not grounded in reality,” Harris said during a fundraising event on Wednesday. “People are grieving. They’re grieving the loss of lives and the people they’ve loved. They’re grieving the loss of jobs. They’re grieving the loss of normalcy and consistency.”Democrats have criticized Trump’s aggressive response to demonstrations after the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man in Minneapolis.On Wednesday Trump said he was sending federal law enforcement and the National Guard to Kenosha, Wisconsin, after violent protests there in the wake of the latest shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, by police. Republicans at the convention have embraced his “law and order” approach and falsely accused Biden of trying to “defund the police.”Republican officials had promised an uplifting and hopeful convention this week, though many speakers have used their time to paint dire portraits of chaos and the advent of socialism in the United States if Democrats win the White House.Trump kicked off the week on Monday by accusing Democrats of seeking to steal the election by advocating for mail-in voting. His previous high profile speeches have also emphasized grim themes, including his inaugural address in January 2017 that described “American carnage.”Other speakers scheduled for Thursday include Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell; Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson; attorney Rudy Giuliani, a fierce critic of the Bidens, and religious leader Franklin Graham.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-caps-republican-convention-with-pitch-for-a-second-white-house-term/story-K3p9nGeBagOoShtCdh4qRP.html
27-08-2020||World||Unicef report flags unequal access to online classes across globe||At least a third of the world’s schoolchildren, which works to around 463 million, could not access remote learning since schools have been shut down because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak since early this year, according to a new report released by the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) on Thursday. Also read: Covid-19 spreading fast as billions don’t have water to wash hands, says UNThe report has been released amid several states in India have started taking steps on reopening schools, despite the contagion. Around 1.5 billion schoolchildren are affected by closures during lockdown across the world, said Unicef’s Remote Learning Reachability report, which underlines the limitations of remote learning and exposes deep inequalities in access and prioritise reopening schools safely.In India, at least 1.5 million schools are closed because of the pandemic, which is affecting 286 million students from pre-primary to secondary levels, of which 49% are girls. Another 6 million girls and boys were already out of schools prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Unicef.“Schools are closed, parents are out of work and families are under a growing strain. An entire generation of children have seen their education and learning interrupted. Access to digital education is limited and by itself cannot solve the learning gap. Blended approaches are needed involving communities, parents, volunteers to reach out to these children and support their learning activities,” said Dr Yasmin Ali Haque, India Representative, Unicef.Globally, 49% of schoolchildren are in their primary classes. Reopening of schools is a challenge in India because of the large size of classrooms and poor infrastructure at several institutions. Many of these schools have limited washrooms and cramped canteens, where maintaining social distancing norms is not always possible. “It’s difficult for children to wear masks and follow hygiene and social distancing norms, whether it is at school, on their way to school, or in the playground. This makes reopening of schools safely a massive challenge. The central and state governments are using the online portal Diksha; TV channels like Doordarshan and Swayam Prabha and the National Repository of Open Education Resources; and other platforms for continuing education at home. Radio is also a great way to reach children in remote areas and should be used for distance learning,” said Dr Rajesh Sagar, a professor of psychiatry at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi. Around 24% households in India have access to the internet, but connectivity is patchy across states. The situation is likely to be far worse for children at home, according to experts. Access to technology and tools at home is a challenge and children may not be able to use them to learn remotely. This is because of several competing factors such as sharing the gadgets with parents and other siblings, additional pressure to do home tasks, and also because of the absence of online curriculum support for quality education content in many Indian languages. The Unicef report found that a country’s choice of remote learning technology appears to be influenced by their income group. For example, radio-based instruction is implemented at much higher rates by low-income countries (80%) than lower middle-income (56%) and upper-middle-income (46%) countries.Internet- and TV-based instruction is much less common among low-income countries (47% and 60%, respectively), while these methods are implemented by a much larger share of lower middle-income countries (79% and 82% cent, respectively) and upper-middle-income countries (95% and 92%, respectively), the report stated. The report, which compiled data from over 100 countries, used a globally representative analysis on the availability of home-based technology and tools needed for remote learning among pre-primary, primary, lower-secondary and upper-secondary schoolchildren. The data included access to TV, radio and internet, and the availability of curriculum delivered across these platforms during school closures.The report found students in sub-Saharan Africa are the most affected, as remote learning proved elusive to at least 50% of them. “For at least 463 million children whose schools closed due to Covid-19, there was no such a thing as remote learning. The sheer number of children whose education was completely disrupted for months on end is a global education emergency. The repercussions could be felt in economies and societies for decades to come,” said Henrietta Fore, executive director, Unicef, at the launch of the report on Thursday..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unequal-access-to-online-classes-widening-learning-gap-unicef-report/story-f0H98ZoBTDNTZWUm8gZFIK.html

It reported damage to houses and public facilities in North Hwanghae and South Hwanghae provinces, where the typhoon made landfall. Roads were also flooded in the city of Nampo, which is closer to Pyongyang.In South Korea, the Ministry of the Interior and Safety reported damages to buildings, walls, roads and other structures.By Thursday afternoon, power had been restored to most of more than 9,300 South Korean homes, including over 3,500 in cities and towns near Seoul and around 900 in the southern resort island of Jeju, which was hit by the typhoon on Wednesday.More than 470 domestic flights in and out of Jeju and the southern mainland city of Busan were canceled. South Korean authorities also halted some railroad services, shut down public parks and sea bridges and moved hundreds of fishing boats and passenger vessels to safety.Workers in Seoul and other major cities were restoring makeshift coronavirus testing stations that had been dismantled out of concerns that the tents and booths wouldn’t have withstood the strong winds.The North’s official Korean Central News Agency said earlier this week that leader Kim Jong Un had called for thorough preparations to minimize casualties and damage from the typhoon. Fishing boats were moved and buildings, farms and railroads reinforced, according to state media.The storm comes weeks after torrential rains caused flooding and massive damage to homes and crops in North Korea, inflicting further pain to an economy ravaged by border closures over the pandemic and U.S.-led sanctions over Kim’s nuclear program.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-damages-buildings-floods-roads-on-korean-peninsula/story-bM8daHN0y2SUx3Q5QzjPsI.html

The incident has led to a fresh wave of protests across the country, which had started after the shooting of George Floyd.Officer Rusten Sheskey, a seven-year veteran of the police force in Kenosha, Wisconsin, shot Blake seven times at point blank range while three of his children watched in the Midwestern city.Blake survived, but may be paralysed for life.The Wisconsin Department of Justice also gave the official account of Blake’s shooting for the first time on Wednesday, saying he had a knife in possession when Sheskey opened fire.“Mr Blake walked around his vehicle, opened the driver’s side door, and leaned forward. While holding onto Mr Blake’s shirt, Officer Rusten Sheskey fired his service weapon 7 times. Officer Sheskey fired the weapon into Mr Blake’s back,” the department said in a statement.It was not clear from the statement if the knife, recovered from inside the car, was in Blake’s hands when he was shot.The US Department of Justice announced late on Wednesday that it was opening a civil rights investigation into Blake’s shooting.Protests over the incident have descended into violence across the US. The governor of Minnesota declared a state of peacetime emergency on the city of Minneapolis after violent protests erupted on Wednesday night following the death of a Black homicide suspect who police say shot himself.Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey imposed a curfew following what he described as mass looting of businesses, destruction of property and unrest. Authorities also said there was misinformation spread in relation to the death of the suspect.Many sportsmen and women have also showed their support with NBA basketball players, tennis star Naomi Osaka, baseball and soccer players all pulling out of fixtures in protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kenosha-cop-who-shot-jacob-blake-in-the-back-7-times-named-more-details-of-incident-revealed/story-oMETyLUp7YtMtsobj2vnzI.html

Videos on social media showed heavy winds and rain battering a tall building, blowing out windows and littering glass and debris into the air and onto the ground as the hurricane moved over southwestern Louisiana.The damage was observed in Lake Charles, which is about 45 miles (72 kilometres) north of where the storm made the landfall.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) hurricane-chasing airplane gave people a rare glimpse of the conditions inside Laura as it passed through the hurricane. A time-lapse video of the journey was shared by Nick Underwood of the NOAA on Twitter. Kermit (#NOAA42) flew through Hurricane #Laura FIVE times today.

It did not provide further details and could not be reached for comment. Hong Kong media identified one of those on the vessel as Andy Li, who media said was recently arrested under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing on its freest city on June 30. The security legislation, opposed by many in Hong Kong, punishes what Beijing broadly defines as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. The Hong Kong government, police and security bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The National Hurricane Center said the storm, which intensified rapidly on Wednesday, came ashore at 1 am on Thursday.A Weather Channel meteorologist had a narrow escape from the falling debris while reporting Hurricane Laura’s landfall. Stephanie Abrams was continuously moving back and forth to maintain her balance and was struggling to provide live coverage as the winds pushed her to one side.Videos and photos surfaced on social media showing the ruthless impact of Laura as streets were covered with water closer to the coast of Lake Charles in Louisiana.Authorities urged coastal residents of Louisiana and Texas to evacuate. After initial refusal, people decided to vacate their premises after strong winds started moving trees back and forth.Laura will be the seventh named storm to strike the United States in 2020 setting a new record for landfalls by the end of August.Apart from Laura, here is a look at other tropical storms that are headed towards Mexico:1. Tropical Storm Hernan is expected to curve toward the southern tip of Baja California and may swing near the coast around the resort of Puerto Vallarta. The National Hurricane Center said Hernan had wind speeds of about 65 kmph and was located about 300 km south of Cabo Corrientes, Mexico.2. Tropical Storm Iselle, formed within hours is also expected to curve towards the southern tip of Baja California. It formed further offshore, about 1,095 km southwest of the tip of the Mexican state.Both these tropical storms are likely to decline to tropical depressions later in the week.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-laura-makes-landfall-in-louisiana-a-look-at-other-tropical-storms-heading-towards-mexico/story-Ds0qukY90URVyiv8ZIBvmJ.html

27-08-2020||World||Working fast to resolve problem in India, TikTok founder tells employees||Chinese software developer Bytedance, which owns TikTok, is moving fast to resolve problems it is facing in India and the US, its founder Zhang Yiming said Thursday, hours after the embattled company’s top executive quit a few months into the job.“…we are moving fast to find solutions to the problems we face globally, especially in India and the United States,” Beijing-based Zhang told his employees in a letter.Zhang’s letter was released after the company’s chief executive Kevin Mayer quit TikTok, which has been banned in India and accused by the Donald Trump administration of breaching US’s national security.Thirty-six-year-old Zhang’s letter seemed an attempt to assuage the worries of those working in the company, which is under increasing international scrutiny for its ties with the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC).“First of all, I want to thank Kevin for joining us when we encountered our biggest challenges—especially in India and the United States,” Zhang wrote in Mandarin.“Second, I hope everyone understands that we are moving fast to find solutions to the problems we face globally, especially in India and the United States. I can’t say too much now. But I can guarantee that we are looking for solutions that are in line with the interests of users, creators, partners, and employees,” Zhang wrote.The Indian government banned the popular short-video sharing app TikTok on June 29, two weeks after Indian and Chinese troops violently clashed in eastern Ladakh, causing fatalities on both sides for the first time in decades.Dozens of other Chinese apps were also banned.Also Read: How to download all your videos from TikTok before you lose access to the appIn a statement, New Delhi said the apps were “prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order”.“The compilation of the data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures,” the statement added. The company denied breaking any law in India.“TikTok continues to comply with all data privacy and security requirements under Indian law and has not shared any information of our users in India with any foreign government, including the Chinese government,” TikTok India tweeted the statement after the ban.The company faced new problems in the US weeks after.In early August, US President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok on the basis of national security concerns.Trump then signed two Presidential executive orders banning US transactions with the Chinese companies that own TikTok and WeChat, owned by Chinese tech giant, Tencent, saying Washington must take “aggressive action” in the interest of national security.TikTok this week sued the US government over the executive orders.Until recently, TikTok was one of the most downloaded mobile apps.According to the report by Sensor Tower, which provides market intelligence and analysis on the mobile app market, said in April that TikTok had crossed the 2 billion-mark.Of the 2 billion, Indians had downloaded the app 611 million times, the most in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/working-fast-to-resolve-problem-in-india-tiktok-founder-tells-employees/story-3897NjxHdT2vTr99SMRNxO.html
27-08-2020||World||Hurricane Laura makes landfall in southwestern Louisiana near Texas||Hurricane Laura made landfall in southwestern Louisiana as a ferocious Category 4 monster with 150 mph winds early Thursday, swamping a low-lying coast with ocean water that forecasters said could be 20 feet deep and unsurvivable.The National Hurricane Center said the storm, which intensified rapidly Wednesday before plowing into land, came ashore at 1 a.m. CDT near Cameron, a 400-person community about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of the Texas border.“Potentially catastrophic impacts will continue,” forecasters said.Also read: ‘Unsurvivable’ storm surge feared as Hurricane Laura strengthens to Category 4Winds gusted above hurricane force to 127 mph (204 kph) while Laura’s northern eyewall moved onshore over Cameron Parish. Forecasters said even stronger winds were possible that could rip apart buildings, level trees and toss vehicles like toys.Authorities had implored coastal residents of Texas and Louisiana to evacuate, but not everyone did before howling winds began buffeting trees back and forth in an area that was devastated by Rita in 2005.Video and photos on social media showed torrents of rain flying sideways past street lights in Lake Charles, and streets covered with water closer to the coast. A sudden storm surge knocked over cameras meant to capture the hurricane’s effects.With hours of violent weather ahead, officials said the extent of destruction likely wouldn’t be clear until daybreak, when search and rescue missions will begin.Drawing energy from the warm Gulf of Mexico, the system arrived early Thursday during high tide as the most powerful hurricane to strike the U.S. so far this year.“It looks like it’s in full beast mode, which is not what you want to see if you’re in its way,” University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy said.Also read: Hurricane Laura poses biggest storm threat to US oil output in 15 yearsHurricane-force winds extending 60 miles (95 kilometers) from the storm’s center neared the coast, forecasters said, and bands of heavy rain fell 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the beach in Lake Charles.Maximum sustained winds increased to 150 mph (241 kph) before nightfall, and forecasters said up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain could fall. Forecasters issued a string of tornado warnings as the storm pushed on to land, but there were no immediate reports of damage. More than 100,000 homes and businesses were without power in Texas and Louisiana.One major Louisiana highway already had standing water as Laura’s outer bands moved ashore with tropical storm-force winds. Earlier Wednesday, winds picked up as shoppers rushed into a grocery store in low-lying Delcambre.Trent Savoie, 31, said he was staying put. “With four kids and 100 farm animals, it’s just hard to move out,” he said.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards fretted that the dire predictions were not resonating despite authorities putting more than 500,000 coastal residents under mandatory evacuation orders.Officials said at least 150 people refused pleas to leave and planned to weather the storm in everything from elevated homes to recreational vehicles in coastal Cameron Parish, which could be completely covered by ocean water.“It’s a very sad situation,” said Ashley Buller, assistant director of emergency preparedness. “We did everything we could to encourage them to leave.”Edwards activated the state’s entire National Guard. In Lake Charles, Guard members drove school buses around neighborhoods, offering to pick up families. Across the state line in Port Arthur, Texas, few stragglers boarded evacuation buses, and city officials announced that two C-130 transport planes offered the last chance to leave.A Category 4 hurricane can render wide areas uninhabitable for weeks or months and knock out power for just as long. The threat of such devastation posed a new disaster-relief challenge for a government already straining under the coronavirus pandemic. The parts of Louisiana that were under evacuation orders included areas turning up high rates of positive Covid-19 tests.The National Hurricane Center kept raising its estimate of Laura’s storm surge, from 10 feet (3 meters) just days ago to twice that size — a height that forecasters said would be especially deadly.On Twitter, President Donald Trump urged coastal residents to heed officials. Hurricane warnings were issued from San Luis Pass, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, and reached inland for 200 miles (322 kilometers). Storm surge warnings extended from Freeport, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River.For some, the decision to leave home left them with no place to stay. Wary of opening mass shelters during a pandemic, Texas officials instead put evacuees in hotels, but Austin stopped taking arrivals before dawn because officials said they ran out of rooms. Other evacuees called the state’s 211 information line and were directed to Ennis, outside Dallas, only to be told after driving hundreds of miles no hotels or vouchers were available.Taniquia Ned and her sisters showed up without money to rent a room, saying the family had burned through its savings after losing jobs because of the coronavirus. “The Covid-19 is just totally wiping us out,” said Shalonda Joseph, 43, a teacher in Port Arthur.Edwards lamented that the storm meant suspension of community testing for Covid-19 at a crucial time — as elementary and secondary schools in Louisiana open and students return to college campuses.Forecasters said storm surge topped by waves could submerge entire towns.Laura was expected to cause widespread flash flooding in states far from the coast. Flood watches were issued for much of Arkansas, and forecasters said heavy rainfall could arrive by Friday in parts of Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky. Laura is so powerful that it’s expected to become a tropical storm again once it reaches the Atlantic Ocean, potentially threatening the Northeast.Becky Clements, 56, evacuated from Lake Charles after hearing that it could take a direct hit. She and her family found an Airbnb hundreds of miles inland. Almost 15 years have passed since Hurricane Rita destroyed the city.“The devastation afterward in our town and that whole corner of the state was just awful,” Clements recalled. “Whole communities were washed away, never to exist again.”The hurricane also threatened a center of the U.S. energy industry as the majority of Gulf oil and natural gas production shut down. Consumers are unlikely to see big price hikes, however, because the pandemic has decimated demand for fuel.Laura closed in on the U.S. after killing nearly two dozen people on the island of Hispaniola, including 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.Laura will be the seventh named storm to strike the U.S. this year, setting a new record for U.S. landfalls by the end of August. The old record was six in 1886 and 1916, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-laura-makes-landfall-in-southwestern-louisiana-near-texas/story-7OMHHv0tuTh9EnVMcjJN7I.html
27-08-2020||World||National Guard activated after downtown Minneapolis unrest||The governor of Minnesota activated the National Guard on Wednesday night to help quell unrest that broke out in downtown Minneapolis following what authorities said was misinformation about the suicide death of a Black homicide suspect.“We once again see the unrest on our streets. And not just Minnesota but as a nation, this pain continues on,” Gov. Tim Walz said at a late night news conference.Walz declared a peacetime emergency in Minneapolis and said he was mobilizing the Minnesota National Guard but did not say how many troops were being deployed. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey imposed a curfew Wednesday night until 6 a.m. Thursday and requested National Guard help after people broke windows and stole merchandise from downtown stores.“Minneapolis, it’s time to heal. We must rebuild and recover. Dangerous, unlawful behavior will not be tolerated,” the Democratic governor said in a statement.Minneapolis was rocked by protests that turned violent after George Floyd, a handcuffed Black man, died after a white police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for nearly eight minutes on May 25. Floyd’s death sparked protests worldwide. Demonstrators also have gathered in downtown Minneapolis this week to protest after Jacob Blake, a Black man, was shot multiple times by police in Wisconsin on Sunday, leaving him paralyzed.In Minneapolis, Floyd’s death set off several nights of violence, including the burning of a Minneapolis police precinct office, until Walz activated the National Guard. South Minneapolis, where Floyd was arrested, and North Minneapolis saw the brunt of vandalism, but downtown Minneapolis was largely spared.TV footage and reporter’s tweets Wednesday night showed people grabbing merchandise at a Saks OFF 5TH store, a fire at a British pub and broken windows on the door and shrimp scattered on the sidewalk outside Ruth’s Chris Steak House. Minnesota Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said fireworks were being set off and bottles thrown late Wednesday, and there were reports of gunshots.Police were making arrests and trying to clear downtown, Schnell told reporters. The number of arrests would not be available until Thursday morning, Minneapolis police spokesman John Elder said. One officer was hospitalized with a serious injury that was not life-threatening, Elder said.The Minnesota State Patrol has mobilized about 150 troopers and all available metro area state troopers in response to the unrest in Minneapolis, Walz said.“This is part of a larger narrative. It was the flash point of George Floyd, it has spread across this nation. It does us no good to try and either divide or ignore or to make it worse or to blame someone. We’re just, as a state and as a nation, going to have to come together and figure out what our next steps are,” Walz told reporters.Frey said during a news conference Wednesday night that he and Walz had been in contact to address the unrest. Frey said bolstering enforcement was an effort to “stay ahead of the game as much as possible.”“What we’re calling for right now is peace,” Frey said. “What we’re calling for right now is for people to return to their homes.”Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo dispelled rumors on social media about the death of an unidentified Black man suspected in a Wednesday afternoon homicide, who later fatally shot himself on the Nicollet Mall as officers approached. The incident, which was captured on city surveillance video and released by police within 90 minutes, nonetheless sparked protests and looting in the heart of downtown.The video confirmed the police account of what happened and showed the man glancing over his shoulder before pulling out the gun and firing, then collapsing to the ground as a half-dozen witnesses ran away with their hands in the air, according to the Star Tribune. The officers, one of whom had his gun drawn, shooed a remaining witness away and kicked the suspect’s gun away before performing chest compressions.“This is not an officer-related incident,” Arradondo said. “We’re compounding more tragedy by the destruction and folks wanting to do harm to our communities in our downtown sector this evening.”“This is my city. We will not tolerate that,” he continued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/national-guard-activated-after-downtown-minneapolis-unrest/story-sue0CihptEeL2jOaguvH9M.html
27-08-2020||World||Pence accepts nomination, calls Biden Trojan horse for radical left||Vice-president Mike Pence on Wednesday accepted the Republican party’s renomination, calling Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for President, a “Trojan horse” for the radical left wing of his party, reprising the Trump campaign’s chief argument against the challenger.Republicans are framing the November 3 election as a choice between themselves as protectors of law and order against an onslaught by the radical wing of the Democratic party, which, they argue has a stranglehold on Biden, on this and the issues of taxation, education, and climate change.Pence deployed that line of attack as the United States struggled to come to grips with yet another shooting of a black man by a white police officer. This time in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which led to the killing of two persons during clashes between anti-racism protestors and armed white militiamen.“When you consider their agenda, it’s clear: Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for a radical left,” Pence said in his prepared remarks, seeking to discredit the Democratic nominee in the eyes of American voters by tying him to the extreme wing of his party.Pence delivered the acceptance speech from Fort McHenry, a historical monument in Baltimore, an hour’s drive from Washington DC. Its survival against unrelenting night-long bombardment by the British navy in 1812 inspired the American national anthem “The Star Spangled Banner”.“Last week, Joe Biden didn’t say one word about the violence and chaos engulfing cities across this country,” Pence said on the third day of the convention, attacking Biden. The Trump administration, on the other hand, he added, “will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and colour.”Pence went on to defend the president and his policies. “He does things in his own way, on his own terms,” he said, seeking to make sense of and explain Trump’s chaotic presidency, as had First Lady Melania Trump in her speech to the convention on Tuesday.“Not much gets past him, and when he has an opinion, he’s liable to share it. He’s certainly kept things interesting, but more importantly, President Donald Trump has kept his word to the American people,” Pence added.The vice-president, who heads the White House task force on the coronavirus outbreak, predictably defended the administration’s response against persisting criticism that it was confused, sluggish and, worse, marked by stark disregard of the advice of its own public health experts.The United States has been hit the worst by the epidemic — with nearly 6 million cases and 180,000 deaths.“But tonight, our hearts are with all the families who have lost loved ones. We mourn with those who mourn, and we grieve with those who grieve,” the vice-president said, striking a different note from other speakers who have either tended to only praise Trump’s response to the epidemic or ignored it altogether. “And this night, I know millions of Americans will pause and pray for God’s comfort to each of you.”President Trump will deliver his acceptance speech on Thursday, the last day of the convention, from the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pence-accepts-nomination-calls-biden-trojan-horse-for-radical-left/story-ruF5DI1iLoT9y2qWjRJuTP.html
27-08-2020||World||UN chief to renew call to India, G20 nations to invest in sustainable transition post-Covid||UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres will renew his call to India and other G20 countries to invest in a clean, sustainable transition as they recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, during his virtual address to The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI). Guterres will deliver the 19th Darbari Seth Memorial lecture on August 28 organised by TERI, a global think-tank focusing on a broad range of sustainable development and climate-related issues, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Wednesday. In his lecture titled ‘The rise of renewables: shining a light on a sustainable future’, Guterres will renew “his call on G20 countries, including India, to invest in a clean, sustainable transition as they recover from the Covid-19 pandemic”. G20 consists of 19 individual countries -- including the US, Russia, China, Japan, Australia, Saudi -- plus the European Union. Dujarric said Guterres is expected to say that as governments mobilise trillions of dollars to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, their decisions will have climate consequences for decades. While Guterres will deliver the memorial lecture, India’s Minister for External Affairs S Jaishankar will preside and deliver the presidential address. The annual lecture was initiated by TERI in 2002 in memory of the institute’s founder Darbari Seth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-to-renew-call-to-india-g20-nations-to-invest-in-sustainable-transition-post-covid/story-517ob3WUcxDpVixQ44P8WP.html
27-08-2020||World||Rapid USD 5 coronavirus test doesn’t need specialty equipment||The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday authorised the first rapid coronavirus test that doesn’t need any special computer equipment to get results.The 15-minute test from Abbott Laboratories will sell for USD 5, giving it a competitive edge over similar tests that need to be popped into a small machine. The size of a credit card, the self-contained test is based on the same technology used to test for the flu, strep throat and other infections.It’s the latest cheaper, simpler test to hit the US market, providing new options to expand testing as schools and businesses struggle to reopen and flu season approaches. The FDA also recently greenlighted a saliva test from Yale University that bypasses some of the supplies that have led to testing bottlenecks.Both tests have limitations and neither can be done at home. Several companies are developing rapid, at-home tests, but none have yet won approval. Abbott’s new test still requires a nasal swab by a health worker, like most older coronavirus tests. The Yale saliva test eliminates the need for a swab, but can only be run at high-grade laboratories.And in general, rapid tests like Abbott’s are less accurate than lab-developed tests. The FDA said in a statement announcing the decision that negative results with Abbott’s test may need to be confirmed with a lab test in some cases. The agency granted Abbott’s test an emergency use authorization late Wednesday for patients with suspected Covid-19.The two additions should help expand the number of available tests. The US is now testing about 690,000 people per day, down from a peak of 850,000 daily tests late last month. Many public health experts believe the country will soon need to test vastly more people to find those who are infected, isolate them and contain the virus.The FDA noted that Abbott’s test could be used in a doctor’s office, emergency room or some schools. “Given the simple nature of this test, it is likely that these tests could be made broadly available,” the FDA said.Since the start of the pandemic, nasal swab tests that are sent to a lab have been the standard for Covid-19 screening. While considered highly accurate, the tests rely on expensive, specialized machines and chemicals. Shortages of those supplies have led to repeated delays in reporting results, especially during a spike in cases last month.Government and health experts view rapid tests that can be run outside the laboratory system as key to boosting capacity.“Those screening tests are what we need in schools, workplaces and nursing homes in order to catch asymptomatic spreaders,” said Dr Jonathan Quick of the Rockefeller Foundation, in an interview earlier this month. The nonprofit group has called for the US to conduct about 4 millions per day by October, mostly rapid, point-of-care tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rapid-usd-5-coronavirus-test-doesn-t-need-specialty-equipment/story-VHPtlz8L2XW4C7YmRerMbO.html
27-08-2020||World||Hurricane Laura moves toward landfall in southwestern Louisiana||Laura roared toward landfall in southwestern Louisiana near the Texas border as a menacing Category 4 hurricane late Wednesday, pushing ocean water topped with waves on to a low-lying coast that forecasters said would be inundated with “unsurvivable” storm surge as much as 20 feet deep.Authorities implored coastal residents of Texas and Louisiana to evacuate, but not everyone did before howling winds began buffeting trees back and forth in an area that was devastated by Rita in 2005.Also read: ‘Unsurvivable’ storm surge feared as Hurricane Laura strengthens to Category 4The storm grew nearly 87% in power in just 24 hours to a size the National Hurricane Center called “extremely dangerous.” Drawing energy from the warm Gulf of Mexico, the system was on track to arrive early Thursday during high tide as the most powerful hurricane to strike the U.S. so far this year.“It looks like it’s in full beast mode, which is not what you want to see if you’re in its way,” University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy said.Hurricane-force winds extending 60 miles (95 kilometers) from the storm’s center neared the coast, forecasters said, and bands of heavy rain fell 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the beach in Lake Charles.Late Wednesday, Laura was churning about 60 miles (95 kilometers) south of Lake Charles and moving north-northwest at 15 mph (24 kph).Maximum sustained winds increased to 150 mph (241 kph) before nightfall, and forecasters said up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain could fall. Forecasters issued a string of tornado warnings as the storm pushed on to land, but there were no immediate reports of damage. Thousands of homes and businesses were without power.Also read: Hurricane Laura poses biggest storm threat to US oil output in 15 yearsOne major Louisiana highway already had standing water as Laura’s outer bands moved ashore with tropical storm-force winds. Thousands of sandbags lined roadways in tiny Lafitte, and winds picked up as shoppers earlier Wednesday rushed into a grocery store in low-lying Delcambre.Trent Savoie, 31, said he was staying put. “With four kids and 100 farm animals, it’s just hard to move out,” he said.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards fretted that the dire predictions were not resonating despite authorities putting more than 500,000 coastal residents under mandatory evacuation orders.Officials said at least 150 people refused pleas to leave and planned to weather the storm in everything from elevated homes to recreational vehicles in coastal Cameron Parish, which could be completely covered by ocean water.“It’s a very sad situation,” said Ashley Buller, assistant director of emergency preparedness. “We did everything we could to encourage them to leave.”Edwards activated the state’s entire National Guard. In Lake Charles, Guard members drove school buses around neighborhoods, offering to pick up families. Across the state line in Port Arthur, Texas, few stragglers boarded evacuation buses, and city officials announced that two C-130 transport planes offered the last chance to leave.Abbott warned that people who fail to get out of harm’s way could be cut off from help long after the storm hit.A Category 4 hurricane can render wide areas uninhabitable for weeks or months and knock out power for just as long. The threat of such devastation posed a new disaster-relief challenge for a government already straining under the coronavirus pandemic. The parts of Louisiana that were under evacuation orders included areas turning up high rates of positive Covid-19 tests.The National Hurricane Center kept raising its estimate of Laura’s storm surge, from 10 feet (3 meters) just days ago to twice that size — a height that forecasters said would be especially deadly.By Wednesday night, Laura was churning about 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of Lake Charles and moving north-northwest at 15 mph (24 kph).On Twitter, President Donald Trump urged coastal residents to heed officials. Hurricane warnings were issued from San Luis Pass, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, and reached inland for 200 miles (322 kilometers). Storm surge warnings extended from Freeport, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River.For some, the decision to leave home left them with no place to stay. Wary of opening mass shelters during a pandemic, Texas officials instead put evacuees in hotels, but Austin stopped taking arrivals before dawn because officials said they ran out of rooms. Other evacuees called the state’s 211 information line and were directed to Ennis, outside Dallas, only to be told after driving hundreds of miles no hotels or vouchers were available.Taniquia Ned and her sisters showed up without money to rent a room, saying the family had burned through its savings after losing jobs because of the coronavirus. “The Covid-19 is just totally wiping us out,” said Shalonda Joseph, 43, a teacher in Port Arthur.Edwards lamented that the impending storm meant suspension of community testing for Covid-19 at a crucial time — as elementary and secondary schools in Louisiana open and students return to college campuses.Forecasters said storm surge topped by waves could submerge entire towns. Water was already rising in the small Louisiana community of Holly Beach in the imperiled Cameron Parish.Laura was expected to cause widespread flash flooding in states far from the coast. Flood watches were issued for much of Arkansas, and forecasters said heavy rainfall could arrive by Friday in parts of Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky. Laura is so powerful that it’s expected to become a tropical storm again once it reaches the Atlantic Ocean, potentially threatening the Northeast.Becky Clements, 56, evacuated from Lake Charles after hearing that it could take a direct hit. She and her family found an Airbnb hundreds of miles inland. Almost 15 years have passed since Hurricane Rita destroyed the city.“The devastation afterward in our town and that whole corner of the state was just awful,” Clements recalled. “Whole communities were washed away, never to exist again.”The church educator said she fears for her office, which is in a trailer following recent construction.“I very much anticipate that my office will be gone when I get back.”The hurricane also threatened a center of the U.S. energy industry as the majority of Gulf oil and natural gas production shut down. Consumers are unlikely to see big price hikes, however, because the pandemic has decimated demand for fuel.Laura closed in on the U.S. after killing nearly two dozen people on the island of Hispaniola, including 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.Laura will be the seventh named storm to strike the U.S. this year, setting a new record for U.S. landfalls by the end of August. The old record was six in 1886 and 1916, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-laura-moves-toward-landfall-in-southwestern-louisiana/story-XGhzjc8fhx2M44fGnjFsiL.html
27-08-2020||World||Global coronavirus cases top 24 million||Worldwide Covid-19 infections exceeded 24 million as cases continued to climb in Europe and Asia, with Italy, France and South Korea reporting the most new infections in months. New U.S. testing guidelines drew criticism from state leaders and public-health experts, while a top Trump administration official defended the move.Moderna Inc. presented new safety data from an early trial that provides the first evidence that its vaccine stimulates the immune systems of older people. Abbott Laboratories won US clearance for a 15-minute Covid test that will be priced at just $5.The World Economic Forum postponed its annual gathering of business and political leaders in the Swiss resort of Davos to early summer 2021. The European Union’s trade chief stepped down after growing criticism that he broke virus regulations in his native Ireland.Key Developments:Japan Virus Jump Hitting EconomyJapanese Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said a jump in virus cases from July and heavy rains are dragging on the nation’s economy. He told a parliamentary committee the economy’s overall recovery trend is not yet back. Nishimura said on Wednesday a second wave of the virus now spreading in Japan is bigger than the one that caused the government to declare a state of emergency in April.South Korea Sees Most Cases Since MarchSouth Korea had 441 more coronavirus cases confirmed in the past 24 hours, the biggest gain since early March, according to data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. That compared to 320 the previous day. Of the new cases, 154 were confirmed in Seoul, 100 in Gyeonggi province and 59 in Incheon.Vice Finance Minister Kim Yongbeom said he believed that the nation can handle the resurgence of the coronavirus with current social distancing rules. Still, so-called Level 3 rules would be needed if the situation worsens, he added at a briefing.WHO Team Didn’t Visit Wuhan, FT SaysA World Health Organization team that was meant to investigate the origin of the coronavirus concluded their trip to China without a visit to Wuhan, the Financial Times reported, citing the UN agency. The WHO told the FT that its advance team had remote conversations with senior scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology but declined to comment on whether the team had planned to visit the city.The organization said the initial team had been laying groundwork before a larger international investigation but didn’t provide details on whether the bigger task-force would travel to Wuhan. China’s foreign ministry called concerns over the credibility of the inquiry “totally unjustified,” according to the FT.Singapore to Provide Tests for China-Bound TravelersSingapore will offer Covid-19 tests for travelers to China prior to departure, in an effort to align with new Chinese requirements aimed at stemming the growing number of imported virus cases.The new travel rules were instituted after China earlier registered dozens of passengers arriving from the Singapore who tested positive for the coronavirus. In response, the world’s second largest economy had temporarily suspended a number of flights from Singapore as a precautionary measure.Texas Deaths Rise, Hospitalizations DeclineTexas virus deaths rose by 229, a number that has remained persistently high as new cases and hospitalizations have declined since July. A total of 11,805 people have died from Covid-19, according to state death certificate data, since the outbreak began. Cases climbed to 592,137 after the state added another 5,507 to the tally Wednesday, including some backlogged data. Hospitalizations declined to 4,806, continuing a two-month downward trend.Abbott Cleared for $5, 15-Minute TestA 15-minute Covid test from Abbott Laboratories that will be priced at just $5 won emergency authorization for use in the U.S., a breakthrough that could ease the bottleneck that has crimped much of the nation’s testing capacity.The product, dubbed BinaxNOW, works without relying on laboratory equipment at a time when labs can take as long as two weeks to produce results. It uses a nasal swab and a small reactive card, and it can be administered by a range of health-care workers, including pharmacists, at almost any location.Abbott will start shipping the test within two weeks and intends to manufacture 50 million tests a month by the end of October.Fauci Concerned Over New Test Guidelines: CNNAnthony Fauci, the top U.S. top infectious disease doctor, told CNN that he is concerned that the CDC’s new coronavirus testing guidelines will make people believe “that asymptomatic spread is not of great concern, when in fact it is.”Fauci said in the CNN interview that he was in surgery when the new testing recommendations were discussed.EU Trade Chief Quits After Virus-Rule BreachThe European Union’s trade chief, Phil Hogan, stepped down after growing criticism that he broke virus regulations in his native Ireland.Hogan was under pressure over his attendance at a golf dinner last week that violated coronavirus regulations as well as his behavior during quarantine upon arrival in his home country. The resignation came a day after Ireland’s government said that Hogan’s “delayed and hesitant” response impaired public confidence.U.S. Cases Rise 0.8%Coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 0.8% as compared with the same time Tuesday to 5.8 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. The increase matched the average daily gain over the past week. Deaths rose by 0.8% to 179,150.French New Cases Hit Four-Month HighFrance reported 5,429 new Covid-19 cases over the past 24 hours, a four-month high that comes after similarly important surges in recent days. Prime Minister Jean Castex will hold a press conference on Thursday to address the health situation as infections rise.Greece Reports Record New Cases Greece reported a record-high 293 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number to 9280. The number is the highest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The average age of people who tested positive is 39. The country also recorded five new deaths, bringing the total to 248.Cuomo Blasts CDC Guidance as ‘Propaganda’New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday said the state won’t follow recent guidance on the coronavirus from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, calling it “political propaganda.”The CDC this week said that people who have potentially been exposed to the virus and are asymptomatic don’t need to be tested. The agency, contrary to its previous recommendations, also said that people traveling from hot spots no longer need to self-quarantine for 14 days.“We’re not going to follow the CDC guidance,” Cuomo, a Democrat, said on a conference call with the media.He accused Republican President Donald Trump of using the agency to “forward his political agenda,” saying it’s “frightening and it is alarming.”Italy Reports Most New Cases in 3 1/2 MonthsItaly recorded 1,367 new cases Wednesday, the highest number in three months and a half, on the day the government ruled out a new lockdown.Many of the new infections involve Italians returning from vacations either within the country or abroad. The Lombardy region said two out of three of the latest cases are holidaymakers returning from outside of Italy.In response to the surge, Italy is ramping up testing in ports and airports, with a record 93,529 tests carried out Wednesday. Still, the health minister said the country is ruling out a new nationwide lockdown.Moscow Invites Residents to Join Vaccine TrialsMoscow is inviting all its residents to participate in Phase 3 testing of a Covid-19 vaccine that was approved for use earlier this month, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on his blog Wednesday.Russia approved the use of the Sputnik V vaccine, which Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute is developing with the sovereign Russian Direct Investment Fund and the Defense Ministry, before it finished clinical trials. The testing will continue even as medical workers are vaccinated. Many members of the local elite, including one of President Vladimir Putin’s daughters, have already been inoculated.The capital accounts for more than a quarter of Russia’s nearly 1 million cases.Moderna Vaccine Produces Antibodies in Trial of Older PeopleModerna Inc. presented new safety data from an early trial that provides the first evidence that its Covid-19 vaccine stimulates the immune systems of older people.In a phase 1 trial, Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine produced “consistently high levels” of neutralizing antibodies -- a key component of the body’s protective response -- in older adults, the company said in a statement. Antibody levels produced in people more than 55 years old were comparable to those seen in younger adults, the company said in a statement.The findings are important because older adults often don’t respond as well to vaccines as younger adults.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-coronavirus-cases-top-24-million/story-HI5k9Y8ZmyYYy1JDkETbMP.html
27-08-2020||World||New Zealand mosque shooter sentenced to life without parole||The white supremacist who slaughtered 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques was sentenced Thursday to life in prison without the possibility of parole.The judge imposed the maximum available sentence on 29-year-old Australian gunman Brenton Harrison Tarrant, the first time the sentence has been imposed in New Zealand.Judge Cameron Mander said Tarrant’s crimes were so wicked that a life time in jail could not begin to atone for them. He said they had caused enormous loss and hurt and stemmed from a warped and malignant ideology.“Your actions were inhuman,” Mander said. “You deliberately killed a 3-year-old infant as he clung to the leg of his father.”The March 2019 attacks targeting people praying at the Al Noor and Linwood mosques shocked New Zealand and prompted new laws banning the deadliest types of semi-automatic weapons. They also prompted global changes to social media protocols after the gunman livestreamed his attack on Facebook.During the four-day sentencing hearing, 90 survivors and family members recounted the horror of the attacks and the trauma they continue to feel.Also read: Man sacked, deported from UAE for ‘celebrating’ New Zealand mosque shootingSome chose to yell at the gunman and give him the finger. Others called him a monster, a coward, a rat. Some sung verses from the Quran or addressed him in Arabic. A few spoke softly to Tarrant, saying they forgave him.Tarrant had earlier fired his lawyers and told the judge that he didn’t wish to speak at the hearing. A standby lawyer appointed by the court told the judge that Tarrant did not oppose a sentence of life without parole.Tarrant in March had pleaded guilty to 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one count of terrorism, reversing his earlier not guilty pleas.Prosecutors said Tarrant had flown a drone over the Al Noor mosque and researched the layout as he meticulously planned his attacks. He arrived with six guns including two AR-15s.Crown prosecutor Mark Zarifeh said he’d aimed to kill as many people as possible.“The offender’s actions are a painful and harrowing mark in New Zealand’s history,” he said.Also read: 5 Indians among those killed in New Zealand mosque shootingsTarrant was noticeably thinner in his sentencing hearing than when he was first arrested. He didn’t show the brazenness he did at his first court appearance the day after the attacks, when he made a hand gesture sometimes adopted by white supremacists.Dressed in a gray prison tracksuit, Tarrant showed little emotion during his sentencing. He watched the speakers, occasionally giving a small nod or covering his mouth as he laughed at jokes, often made at his expense.Sara Qasem spoke Thursday during the four-day hearing about her beloved father Abdelfattah, who was killed in the attacks.“All a daughter ever wants is her dad. I want to go on more road trips with him. I want to smell his garden-sourced cooking. His cologne,” she said. “I want to hear him tell me more about the olive trees in Palestine. I want to hear his voice. My dad’s voice. My baba’s voice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-mosque-gunman-sentenced-to-life-without-parole/story-VlnWPeSevOnygelJ9SIf2I.html

27-08-2020||World||Facebook removes ‘Kenosha Guard’ page following shooting||Facebook Inc said on Wednesday it removed a page for the Kenosha Guard, a group which had posted a “call to arms” in Kenosha, Wisconsin, saying the page violated its policy against “militia organizations.”The company’s action followed the shooting deaths on Tuesday night of two people during protests in Kenosha, which broke out in response to the police shooting of a Black man earlier this week.Authorities charged a 17-year-old from Illinois with homicide on Wednesday in connection with the deaths.Militias organized rapidly on Tuesday on Reddit and Facebook, where users shared coverage from Infowars, a right-wing conspiracy site. Infowars in turn amplified the Kenosha Guard’s Facebook post and said the groups were “recruiting citizens to patrol.”Though Facebook banned Infowars’ page long ago, tracking tool CrowdTangle showed its article on Kenosha was shared 274 times, according to the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensics Research Lab. It was also posted nine times to pages with a combined audience of more than 103,000 people.Many of the pages contained threats of violence.One commentor wrote on the Stand Up Kenosha page on Facebook: “Shoot to kill folks. Cause they won’t give you a second chance.”A Facebook spokeswoman said the company had not found evidence suggesting the shooter followed the Kenosha Guard page or had been invited to its event.She said Facebook was also removing content tied to the shooting, including the suspect’s page, which previously showed him posing with rifles.Reddit did not respond to a request for comment, although posts threatening to bring guns and pipe bombs and to “cleanse Kenosha of the rioters” were deleted there too.Before its removal from Facebook, the Kenosha Guard’s profile photos featured a large American flag and a man holding a military-style rifle.“Any patriots willing to take up arms and defend out (sic) City tonight from the evil thugs?” one post read, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. (https://bit.ly/2YC9uGJ)The group, which identified itself as a “social club,” also created a Facebook event called “Armed Citizens to Protect our Lives and Property” on Tuesday and warned police they would be “outnumbered.”Created on June 2, the page had nearly 3,500 followers as of Wednesday morning.After the shooting, the group posted a statement saying it was “unaware if the armed citizen was answering the Kenosha Guard Militia’s call to arms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-removes-kenosha-guard-page-following-shooting/story-TaO6QtkZ5Y511kerydl6QI.html
27-08-2020||World||Covid-related emergency regime in Lebanon extended until year-end: Report||Lebanon’s Supreme Council of Defense said the decision had been made to extend the coronavirus-related emergency regime in the country until December 31 due to an increase in the number of cases, the presidential press service said in a statement.“The Supreme Council of Defense extended the civil mobilization regime from August 31 to December 31 and demanded that the health minister hold talks with private hospitals within five days to open specialized departments for the treatment of patients with coronavirus,” the press service said.The Lebanese Health Ministry has reported 561 new cases of the novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) over the past day. The overall number of patients increased to 14,248, with 139 deaths.Lebanon reintroduced from August 19 the regime of an epidemiological emergency until September 7, with a curfew from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. As part of the emergency regime, all shopping centers, crowded places, restaurants and beaches are closed. Government agencies and the international airport continue to work in a reduced mode.The civil mobilization regime was first introduced in Lebanon on March 16. Since July, according to daily Health Ministry reports, the number of Covid-19 cases has begun to grow sharply. The Lebanese authorities say the deterioration of the epidemiological situation is primarily due to the neglect of the safety and personal hygiene measures prescribed by the ministry.Also, a negative role was played by citizens who arrived in the country from abroad after the opening of the international airport and violated the self-isolation regime. The explosion in the port of Beirut, which destroyed several neighborhoods, and thousands-strong demonstrations played a negative role as well.The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of the new coronavirus a pandemic on March 11.According to the WHO, the global coronavirus death toll has surpassed 815,000 people, with the number of cases worldwide exceeding 23.7 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-related-emergency-regime-in-lebanon-extended-until-year-end-report/story-EUtP1NKtKkdQdbWHBaqJiI.html
27-08-2020||World||Top Democrat says Donald Trump’s remarks on TikTok deal are inappropriate||A top House Democrat rebuked President Donald Trump for commenting on the potential acquisition of the domestic operations of the popular TikTok video app by a US company, but at the same time said such a deal could protect American interests.Rhode Island Representative David Cicilline, who is leading a probe of the technology industry, told Bloomberg News on Wednesday that it’s the job of federal enforcement agencies to determine whether TikTok, which is owned by China-based ByteDance Ltd., promotes competition or compromises national security and said that the president shouldn’t insert himself into the outcome of those decisions.Trump issued an executive order August 14 forcing TikTok’s Chinese owner to divest its US assets, citing national security grounds. He subsequently weighed in on possible bids by Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. Cicilline said it’s not the president’s role to decide who that buyer should be.“What we don’t need is the president of the United States injecting himself into a transaction in the way that he did,” Cicilline said. “I think that’s dangerous -- that kind of politicization of that company and their practices.”Trump has stepped up his attacks on TikTok as his administration increased pressure on China ahead of the November presidential election. Earlier this month, Trump threatened to shut down TikTok if its owners didn’t sell the business to a US company by Sept. 15. Then, on August 6, he signed a pair of executive orders prohibiting Americans from doing business with TikTok and another app, WeChat, which is also Chinese-owned, effective in 45 days.“I don’t mind whether it’s Microsoft or someone else, a big company, a secure company, a very American company buys it,” Trump told reporters on August 3. “It’ll close down on September 15 unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it and work out a deal, an appropriate deal, so the Treasury of the United States gets a lot of money.”In an Aug. 19 speech in Arizona, Trump praised another possible bidder, Oracle.“Oracle is a great company,” said Trump during the speech. “I think its owner is a tremendous guy. He’s a tremendous person. I think that Oracle would be certainly somebody that could handle it.”Trump ordered TikTok to sell its US assets after an investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, or Cfius, which reviews acquisitions of American businesses by overseas investors for national security risk. Cfius found ByteDance’s 2017 purchase of the app Musical.ly and merger with TikTok did raise concerns and Trump’s order effectively called for a reversal of that transaction.Cfius will have to certify that a sale to a US buyer resolves all outstanding national security concerns.“I guess Microsoft wants it and so does Oracle, and probably so do other people,” Trump told reporters earlier this month. “But they have to also make sure the United States is well compensated because we’re the ones making it possible. Very simple: We’re the ones making it possible. So our Treasury has to be very well compensated.”Cicilline said if a US company buys TikTok, the purchase could give Facebook Inc. much-needed competition in the social media market and keep valuable data on American users out of the hands of Chinese authorities.“I think we have to obviously be conscious of the implications when that kind of data is collected by a foreign adversary,” Cicilline said, referring to TikTok. “I think it’s perfectly appropriate in reviewing a transaction to take into account the national security interests of the United States.”Cicilline, who chairs the antitrust panel of the House Judiciary Committee, has been investigating whether companies such as Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. are too dominant in the marketplace. Last month, the chief executives of the four US technology giants appeared before the subcommittee to answer questions about whether they use their power to crush rivals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-democrat-says-donald-trump-s-remarks-on-tiktok-deal-are-inappropriate/story-80b1JjUeXSPwwxD3Yi8pXP.html
27-08-2020||World||Trump’s Covid-19 testing chief defends new advice after blowback||The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s shift in guidance on Covid-19 testing away from asymptomatic individuals this week alarmed many public-health experts who say it’s a wrong turn that could restrict how many tests are performed.Brett Giroir, a top Trump administration official overseeing coronavirus testing, fired back on the criticism during a Wednesday briefing, telling reporters that the change wasn’t influenced by the White House and is intended to clarify to the public the limitations of such screenings, not to reduce how many tests are conducted.The new recommendations say testing may not be needed for asymptomatic close contacts and those who attended large, risky gatherings but lack symptoms. Giroir said that in areas with high virus rates, many people without symptoms will be tested at surge screening sites, which he contrasted with someone in a “place where it’s 1% positive saying I want to get tested today, tomorrow and the next day.”“I’m really not sure how people could interpret that if they actually read them because what we’ve tried to do is put more responsibility on public health officials,” he said.CNN reported on Wednesday that the CDC guidance change was due to pressure from Trump administration officials, citing an unidentified official. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo called the move “political propaganda” and an effort by President Donald Trump to bring down the number of cases with less testing. But Giroir said that the guidelines had been a joint effort, with the involvement of top health officials including Anthony Fauci, who has been one of the most prominent administration voices on the virus.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageGiroir said that the final draft was circulated on Thursday at a White House Coronavirus Task Force meeting. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was in surgery that day though and didn’t attend the meeting, NIAID said.“He does recall quickly reviewing a version of the guidelines that circulated at some time before the Aug. 20 meeting,” according to the NIAID statement. “Without having the benefit of the discussion that took place on Aug. 20 at the Task Force meeting where the guidelines were finalized, but now reading them carefully, he has some concern that the revised guidelines could be interpreted as lessening the importance of asymptomatic spread of virus in the community.”The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid issued guidance on Tuesday regarding testing nursing home staff and residents that differs from the CDC recommendations, saying that anyone working or living at a nursing home will have to get tested for Covid-19 regularly.Although the CMS guidance didn’t specify how often staff should be tested, nursing homes will likely have to test them at least once a month. Frequency could rise to once a week if positivety levels in nearby communities are between 5% and 10% and twice a week if positive cases are above 10%, the head of the agency said.Nursing homes also have to offer residents testing after there’s been an outbreak or if they’re showing symptoms, the new guidelines say. Facilities that fail to comply could face hundreds of dollars per day in fines.The CDC’s recommendations for nursing home testing already include a section on reopening facilities that close after an outbreak. In that scenario, “initial viral testing of each resident (who is not known to have previously been diagnosed with Covid-19) is recommended because of the high likelihood of exposure during a pandemic, transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and the risk of complications among residents following infection.”DOJ InquiryCovid-19 has ravaged nursing homes around the country, and the elderly make up a substantial portion of virus deaths in the US Some reports, including an analysis of state data by USA Today, say nursing home residents have made up 40% of coronavirus deaths.On Wednesday, the Department of Justice announced that it was seeking data from four Democrat-led states on deaths at nursing homes to see whether an investigation into whether their policies requiring facilities to re-admit patients diagnosed with Covid caused spikes in cases and deaths.The CDC guidance reflects a shift in tone by the federal government and some states that began earlier this summer, as lengthy delays in getting test results made headlines. In mid-July, for instance, Giroir recommended only testing individuals with symptoms and front-line workers, and Florida asked labs to prioritize tests for symptomatic individuals. Major commercial labs report that test results have become speedier in recent weeks, with turnarounds of a few days on average.Yet public health experts said the new guidance, released as part of an unpublicized update to the CDC’s website, could in fact cut down on testing.“This makes no sense,” wrote Leana Wen, a physician who formerly led Planned Parenthood and currently serves as visiting professor of health policy and management at George Washington University, in a tweet late Tuesday. “We need more testing, not less.”Howard Forman, director of the Yale School of Public Health’s health-care management program, called the shift “insane and counter to all the best evidence that we have about how testing is supposed to work and appears to work.”“We need to identify asymptomatic infected individuals as soon as feasible and isolate them and begin contact tracing when feasible,” he said in an email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-covid-19-testing-chief-defends-new-advice-after-blowback/story-7GYLvY6TQFSsLn9OvDlRCN.html
27-08-2020||World||Kim Jong Un’s regime baffles world with contradictory signals||What’s going on with Kim Jong Un? Is he sick? Worried about Covid-19? Consumed by an economic crisis? Battling internal threats?Perhaps the North Korean leader is biding his time until the US presidential election? Or maybe he’s playing the same game of threats, reconciliation and retreat that has kept his family in charge of the secretive state since the 1940s?All those scenarios have been floated to explain months of surprises and intrigue from Pyongyang, including stubborn -- but so-far-unsubstantiated -- rumors that the 36-year-old leader is unwell. The developments have underscored how little the world knows about North Korea, and left even many professional observers questioning how they go about interpreting Kim’s actions.“We need to check our assumptions about the leadership,” said Soo Kim, a Rand Corp. policy analyst who previously worked at the Central Intelligence Agency. “Perhaps we are imposing our own expectations and habitual knowledge about the North Korean regime on the current situation. And if these expectations are false, then we risk drawing faulty or erroneous conclusions about the regime.”Indeed, Kim is behaving in ways that have defied expectations. After making economic development his central policy focus in 2018, he acknowledged last week that people’s living standards have “not been improved remarkably.” He has attended less than a third of the number of public events as he had at this time in 2019 and earlier this year missed birthday celebrations for his late grandfather, state founder Kim Il Sung.After promising to unveil a “new strategic weapon” and carrying out a record number of ballistic missile launches last year, North Korea has dramatically scaled back weapon tests in 2020. He’s even given his younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, a more prominent role in relations with the US and South Korea, an unprecedented delegation of power that risks elevating a potential rival from the family’s so-called Mount Paektu bloodline.Kim Yo Jong proved her hard-line credentials in June by delivering a stern rebuke to Seoul before North Korea blew up a $15 million liaison office South Korean President Moon Jae-in helped establish on the northern side of the border in 2018. Since then, North Korea has been unusually quiet, foregoing even its standard criticism of US-South Korean military drills that started this month.Illustrating the struggle to read the signals, South Korean lawmakers said after a briefing by spy agency officials last week that Kim Jong Un had delegated some authority to his sister to relieve “stress,” adding that she was running “every aspect” of state affairs. The lawmakers held another briefing shortly after to play down their remarks, saying they were only sharing the spy agency’s interpretation.State media released what appeared to be fresh images of Kim Wednesday, publishing photos of him leading a Politburo meeting, dressed in summer white. Still, the rumors about his health have persisted, due in part to North Korea’s long history of manipulating state media reports for political purposes.The confusion was reminiscent of an episode in April after the Seoul-based news site Daily NK reported that Kim had undergone a “cardiovascular surgical procedure,” potentially explaining his absence from events honoring his grandfather. Subsequent reports that Kim was dead or incapacitated followed, only for him to turn up at a May 1 fertilizer plant visit looking healthy, if still overweight.“Kim Jong Un’s long absences have been unusual in the context of his general public activities in North Korea,” said Ankit Panda, a Stanton senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “This has obviously led to some very poorly reasoned and supported rumors about his health. But it simply appears that the leader is taking precaution -- as so many of us are -- during an unprecedented global pandemic.”North Korea’s stability is not only a concern for its immediate neighbors, but the wider world since a turbulent leadership change would raise new questions about who controls a nuclear bomb stockpile that could grow to 100 warheads by year end. No matter who’s in charge, North Korean leaders have strong incentives to preserve the regime and Kim’s strategy of seeking sanctions relief from US President Donald Trump by building a more dangerous nuclear arsenal.Greater insight may come around Oct. 10, when the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea is expected to celebrate its 75th anniversary. Footage from those events, which analysis of satellite photos suggests will probably include the regime’s first military parade since 2018, should provide a fresh chance to evaluate Kim’s strategy and his relationship with top officials including his sister.As usual, North Korea’s propaganda machine has said nothing about Kim’s health or succession plans. The coronavirus has further cut the flow of intelligence out of the country, with North Korea slashing traffic across the Chinese border and curbing movements of diplomats posted in Pyongyang.Some of the few foreign diplomats and non-governmental organization workers who live in Pyongyang are leaving, with Swedish embassy staff among the latest to depart. Kim told a party meeting earlier this month that he wouldn’t accept international handouts due to worries of spreading the virus.Kim may also be preoccupied with the economic damage wrought by US sanctions and severe flooding, as well as the pandemic. North Korea is on track for its biggest contraction since the 1990s, when Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il, faced a devastating famine, according to Fitch Solutions.“The economic struggle is already damaging Kim’s authority,” said Boo Seung-chan, a former adviser to South Korea’s defense minister who’s now an adjunct professor at the Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies. “Kim may need to share that authority with expert groups to better handle the crisis while minimizing damage to himself.”Economic issues have certainly dominated Kim’s recent public statements, including his decision earlier this month to replace former Premier Kim Jae Ryong after little more than a year on the job. He also announced plans to hold the first Workers’ Party congress in five years in January to update the country’s national development blueprint.The timing of the party congress could provide Kim a convenient platform to deliver a fresh message to the US before the next presidential inauguration on Jan. 20. While it’s unclear whether Trump can break the stalemate with North Korea if he wins a second term, Democratic nominee Joe Biden has signaled a different approach, criticizing the president’s emphasis on a personal rapport with Kim.Rachel Minyoung Lee, a former analyst for the US government specializing in North Korea, noted that Kim Yo Jong alluded to concern about a change in US leadership in an earlier statement about the need for good relations for the two countries, as well as their leaders.“I am surprised that he has not started taking steps to escalate tensions in the lead-up to showing off the ‘new strategic weapon,’” Lee said. “Part of this could be that Pyongyang is weighing its options before the US presidential election, but the main reason seems to be that it remains fettered by domestic issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-regime-baffles-world-with-contradictory-signals/story-1PyDQVNlrAj8AoOcTHNioI.html
27-08-2020||World||‘Unsurvivable’ storm surge feared as Hurricane Laura strengthens to Category 4||Hurricane Laura strengthened into a powerful Category 4 storm in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday, prompting warnings of “unsurvivable” storm surge of up to 20 feet (six meters) and evacuation orders for hundreds of thousands of coastal residents of Louisiana and Texas.The Miami-based National Hurricane Center said Laura was packing winds of 140 miles per hour (220 kilometers per hour) and was expected to make landfall along the Gulf Coast overnight.As an “extremely dangerous” Category 4 hurricane -- the second-highest on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale -- Laura could pummel the Louisiana and Texas coast with storm surge, extreme winds and flash flooding, the NHC said.An “unsurvivable storm surge with large and destructive waves will cause catastrophic damage from Sea Rim State Park, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana,” it said.Storm surges could penetrate up to 30 miles inland along parts of the coasts, and peak surge coupled with high tide could see water as high as 15 to 20 feet above normal levels.“The power of Hurricane Laura is unprecedented, and Texans must take action now to get out of harm’s way and protect themselves,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott said.“The conditions of this storm are unsurvivable, and I urge southeast Texans to take advantage of these final few hours to evacuate.”“Your property can be replaced,” Abbott said. “Your life cannot be replaced.”President Donald Trump told residents in the path of the storm to “listen to local officials.”“Hurricane Laura is a very dangerous and rapidly intensifying hurricane,” Trump tweeted. “My Administration remains fully engaged with state & local emergency managers.”- ‘Not going to play with the good lord’ -Jimmy Ray was among those heeding evacuation orders in Lake Charles, Louisiana.“We were going to try to ride it out at the house, but we found out that it was going to be too bad,” Ray told AFP outside an evacuation facility.Another evacuee in Lake Charles, Patricia Como, said her sister, her brother, cousins and other family members had stayed behind but she was “not going to take a chance.”“I’m not going to play with the good lord,” Como said.At 1800 GMT, Hurricane Laura was about 200 miles south-southeast of Lake Charles and moving north-west at 16 miles an hour, the NHC said.It said the storm was expected to dump between five to 10 inches (13 to 26 cms) of rain on parts of the Gulf Coast between Wednesday and Friday.Craig Brown, the acting mayor of Galveston, Texas, which suffered the deadliest hurricane in US history in 1900 with thousands of deaths, said the authorities were “monitoring this very closely.”“We’ve had good cooperation from our residents on evacuation,” Brown said, adding that it was not mandatory.“If they want to stay put, then we allow them to do that,” he said. “But we do tell them if they stay, they may not have any emergency services available to them.”Angela Jouett, director of evacuation operations in Lake Charles, said the authorities had new protocols in place because of the Covid-19 pandemic.“People that come in they get their hands sprayed with sanitizer,” Jouett said. “They’re having their temperature checks, and we’re also spacing everybody in six foot distancing.”- Struck Haiti, Dominican Republican -In New Orleans, devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the historic French Quarter was empty of tourists, while sandbags were piled up in front of the doorways of colonial-style buildings and windows were boarded up with plywood. New Orleans remains traumatized from Katrina, which made landfall as a Category 3 storm, flooding 80 percent of the city and killing more than 1,800 people.Laura earlier caused flooding in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, killing at least 25 people.In Cuba, it caused material damage but no deaths. The Atlantic storm season, which runs through November, could be one of the busiest ever this year, with the NHC predicting as many as 25 named storms.

27-08-2020||World||Dutch book ‘The Discomfort of Evening’ wins 2020 International Booker Prize||‘The Discomfort of Evening’, written by Marieke Lucas Rijneveld and translated from Dutch by Michele Hutchison, was on Wednesday announced as the winner of the 2020 International Booker Prize, making the writer the youngest winner of the prize at 29.The £50,000 prize will be split between Rijneveld and Hutchison, giving both the author and translator equal recognition. The winner was announced by chair of the judges, Ted Hodgkinson, at a digital event.The book was chosen from a shortlist of six books during a process described by organisers as rigoros by a panel of five judges, chaired by Hodgkindon, who is also head of Literature and Spoken Word at the Southbank Centre.Hodgkinson said: “We set ourselves an immense task in selecting a winner from our superb shortlist, filled with fiction bold enough to upend mythic foundations and burst the banks of the novel itself. From this exceptional field, and against an extraordinary backdrop, we were looking for a book that goes beyond echoing our dystopian present and possesses a timeless charge”.“Combining a disarming new sensibility with a translation of singular sensitivity, The Discomfort of Evening is a tender and visceral evocation of a childhood caught between shame and salvation, and a deeply deserving winner of The 2020 International Booker Prize.”Born in April 1991 in Nieuwendijk, Netherlands, Rijneveld, grew up in a farming family in North Brabant before moving to Utrecht, and has already won awards for both first poetry collection ‘Calfskin’ and debut novel ‘The Discomfort of Evening’.The Guardian described the winning book “an unflinching study of a family falling apart in the madness of grief, rendered all the more unnerving for the childishly plain, undramatic way their compulsive behaviours are reported”.The International Booker Prize is awarded every year for a single book that is translated into English and published in the UK or Ireland. This year the judges considered 124 books, translated from 30 languages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dutch-book-the-discomfort-of-evening-wins-2020-international-booker-prize/story-v9FA6JtPxBRVPiqJYqf5fL.html
27-08-2020||World||US sanctions Chinese individuals, firms over disputed South China Sea outposts||The United States on Wednesday announced restrictions against Chinese individuals and firms involved in the “large-scale reclamation, construction, or militarization of disputed outposts” in the South China Sea (SCS).These are first SCS-centric curbs announced by the Trump administration after a recent shift in policy from indifference to a full-fledged embrace of an international tribunal’s 2016 order rejecting all of China’s claims in the South China Sea.“Today, the Department of State will begin imposing visa restrictions on People’s Republic of China (PRC) individuals responsible for, or complicit in, either the large-scale reclamation, construction, or militarization of disputed outposts in the South China Sea, or the PRC’s use of coercion against Southeast Asian claimants to inhibit their access to offshore resources,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.The department of commerce announced it was adding 24 Chinese companies to the Entity List, which pose a threat to the national security of the United States and therefore subjected to trade restrictions.“The United States, China’s neighbours, and the international community have rebuked the CCP’s sovereignty claims to the South China Sea and have condemned the building of artificial islands for the Chinese military,” said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in a statement. “The entities designated today have played a significant role in China’s provocative construction of these artificial islands and must be held accountable.”The listed firms included the Chinese Communications Construction Company, a largely state-owned entity, and several subsidiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sanctions-chinese-individuals-firms-over-disputed-south-china-sea-outposts/story-F511Dmz5qggIrDM6qycLNP.html
27-08-2020||World||Officials change Covid-19 testing advice, bewildering experts||US health officials have sparked a wave of confusion after posting guidelines that coronavirus testing is not necessary for people who have been in close contact with infected people.The new guidance was posted earlier this week on the website of a federal agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The CDC previously had advised local health departments to test people who have been within 6 feet of an infected person for more than 15 minutes. But on Monday a CDC testing overview page was changed to say that testing is no longer recommended for symptom-less people who were in close contact situations.There was a caveat, however. Testing may be recommended for those with health problems that make them more likely to suffer severe illness from an infection, or if their doctor or local state officials advise they get tested.CDC officials referred all questions to the agency’s parent organization, the US Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, DC. That suggests that HHS ordered the change, not CDC, said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Johns Hopkins University public health researcher.HHS officials officials have offered little explanation, but scheduled a briefing for Wednesday afternoon to answer questions.Across the country, public health experts called the change bizarre. They noted that testing contacts of infected people is a core element of public health efforts to keep outbreaks in check, and that a large percentage of infected people — the CDC has said as many as 40% — exhibit no symptoms.“I was taken aback and didn’t know that it was under consideration,” said John Auerbach, president of Trust for America’s Health, a nonprofit that works to improve US preparedness against disease. “The recommendation not to test asymptomatic people who likely have been exposed is not in accord with the science.”Ultimately, restricting testing could be self-defeating, because it could skew the numbers and create a perception that rates of infection are higher. Testing people who appear to be healthy would tend to lower the overall rate of positive results, while narrowing testing to people who are sick would raise the overall positive rate, Auerbach said.Why HHS would order such a change quickly became a matter of speculation. Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious diseases specialist at Emory University, suggested in a tweet that there are two possible explanations.One is that it may be driven by testing supply issues that in many parts of the country have caused delays in results of a week or more, he suggested.The other is that President Donald Trump simply wants to see case counts drop, and discouraging more people from getting tested is one way to do it, he said.Dr. Tom Frieden, who was head of the CDC during the Obama administration, said the move follows another recent change: to no longer recommend quarantine for travelers coming from areas where infections are more common.“Both changes are highly problematic” and need to be better explained, said Frieden, who now is president of Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit program that works to prevent epidemics.Frieden said he, too, believes HHS forced CDC to post the changes. He called it “a sad day” because “CDC is being told what to write on their website.”New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo harshly criticized the new CDC recommendations and said the state would not be following the guidance.“Why would you reverse yourself on the quarantine order? Because they don’t want publicity that there is a COVID problem. Because the president’s politics are, ‘COVID isn’t a problem We’re past COVID. It’s all about the economy,’” Cuomo told reporters on a conference call.“What possible rationale is there to say ’You’re in close contact with a COVID-positive person. And you don’t need a test?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/officials-change-covid-19-testing-advice-bewildering-experts/story-ZUSyQjKHMQ1mCjiiPcUZyN.html
27-08-2020||World||Coronavirus in vacant apartment implicates toilet in spread||The discovery of coronavirus in the bathroom of an unoccupied apartment in Guangzhou, China, suggests the airborne pathogen may have wafted upwards through drain pipes, an echo of a large SARS outbreak in Hong Kong 17 years ago.Traces of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in February on the sink, faucet and shower handle of a long-vacant apartment, researchers at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said in a study published this month in Environment International. The contaminated bathroom was directly above the home of five people confirmed a week earlier to have Covid-19.The scientists conducted “an on-site tracer simulation experiment” to see whether the virus could be spread through waste pipes via tiny airborne particles that can be created by the force of a toilet flush. They found such particles, called aerosols, in bathrooms 10 and 12 levels above the Covid-19 cases. Two cases were confirmed on each of those floors in early February, raising concern that SARS-CoV-2-laden particles from stool had drifted into their homes via plumbing.The new report is reminiscent of a case at Hong Kong’s Amoy Gardens private housing estate almost two decades ago, when 329 residents caught severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in part because of faulty sewage pipelines. Forty-two residents died, making it the most devastating community outbreak of SARS, which is also caused by a coronavirus.“Although transmission via the shared elevator cannot be excluded, this event is consistent with the findings of the Amoy Gardens SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003,” Song Tang, a scientist with the China CDC Key Laboratory of Environment and Population Health, and colleagues wrote in the study, which cited unpublished data from the health agency.Apartments in multistory buildings may be linked via a shared wastewater system, said Lidia Morawska, director of the International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health at Australia’s Queensland University of Technology. While solids and liquids descend the network, sewer gases -- often detectable by their odor -- sometimes rise through pipes in the absence of sufficient water, said Morawska, who wasn’t part of the research team.“If there’s smell, it means that somehow air has been transported to where it shouldn’t go,” Morawska said in an interview.Respiratory DropletsSARS-CoV-2 spreads mainly through respiratory droplets -- spatters of saliva or discharge from the nose, according to the World Health Organization. Since the first weeks of the pandemic, however, scientists in China have said infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus in the stool of Covid-19 patients may also play a role in transmission. A February study of 73 patients hospitalized with the coronavirus in Guangdong province found more than half tested positive for the virus in their stool.Previous research has shown that toilet flushes can generate germ-laden aerosols from the excreta, the China CDC scientists said. Those particles can remain in the air for long periods and be dispersed over distances of more than 1 meter (3 feet), particularly in confined, poorly ventilated spaces.Fecal aerosolization occurred with SARS, and it’s possible that it may rarely occur with SARS-CoV-2, depending on sewage systems, said Malik Peiris, chair of virology at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health. The China CDC study found traces of virus, “which is not the same thing as infectious virus,” he said. “But one has to keep the possibility in mind.”Fecal PlumeIn the Amoy Gardens case, warm, moist air from the bathroom of a SARS patient excreting “extremely high concentrations” of virus in feces and urine established a plume in an air shaft that spread the airborne virus to other apartments, research showed.Although toilets are a daily necessity, they “may promote fecal-derived aerosol transmission if used improperly, particularly in hospitals,” the China CDC researchers said. They cited a fluid-dynamics simulation that showed a “massive upward transport of virus aerosol particles” during flushing, leading to large-scale virus spread indoors.“The study finds high plausibility for airborne transmission and outlines the evidence in great detail,” said Raina MacIntyre, professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, who was part of an international team invited to collaborate with China CDC on the study.A shared toilet was implicated in a SARS-CoV-2 infection that likely occurred on an evacuation flight from Milan to South Korea in late March, researchers said in a report in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.Airplane ToiletA 28-year-old woman developed Covid-19 symptoms about a week after the flight, during which she wore an N95 respirator mask, except when she used a toilet. The toilet was shared by other passengers, including one seated three rows away who was infected but had no symptoms. Because of strict infection control procedures implemented immediately before and during the flight, the authors concluded that the most plausible explanation for the infection is that it was acquired via indirect contact with an asymptomatic passenger while using an onboard toilet.Previous investigations confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 genetic material was found on toilets used by Covid-19 patients, in the air in hospital nurses’ stations, on air outlet vents, and multiple other sites. The extent to which fecal aerosol plumes are infecting people with the SARS-CoV-2 virus isn’t known, said Queensland’s Morawska.“There are lots of situations where things happen and are pretty unusual,” said Morawska, who was part of a team that studied the Amoy Gardens contagion. Scientists should investigate the “unusual situations” because, by understanding them, they may find “they’re not that unusual.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-in-vacant-apartment-implicates-toilet-in-spread/story-IYsEwXHNxtgKysbtmGO6JL.html
27-08-2020||World||John Lennon’s killer denied parole for an 11th time||The man who gunned down John Lennon outside his Manhattan apartment in 1980 was denied parole for an 11th time, state corrections officials said Wednesday.Mark David Chapman was denied after being interviewed by a parole board Aug. 19, according to corrections officials. Chapman, 65, is serving a 20-years-to-life sentence at Wende Correctional Facility, east of Buffalo.Chapman shot and killed the former Beatle on the night of Dec. 8, 1980, hours after Lennon autographed an album for him. He has said previously that he feels “more and more shame” every year for the crime.“I was too far in,” Chapman told a parole board in 2018. “I do remember having the thought of, ‘Hey, you have got the album now. Look at this, he signed it, just go home.’ But there was no way I was just going to go home.”Chapman’s next parole hearing is scheduled for August 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/john-lennon-s-killer-denied-parole-for-an-11th-time/story-xIWSuIeEEFPCQN9GNdYPOP.html
27-08-2020||India||India speeds up setting up of air defence command||NEW DELHIIndia has accelerated work on setting up an Air Defence command to enhance military synergy and optimally utilise the resources of the armed forces, and it is likely to come up in October, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Air defence refers to protecting the military’s assets from aerial threats such as the enemy’s fighter planes and missiles and the new Command --- likely to be headquartered in Allahabad --- will control the air defence resources of all the three services. It will be headed by a three-star air marshal, the officials said.After taking over as the country’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) on December 31, 2019, General Bipin Rawat had asked top officials of headquarters Integrated Defence Staff (IDS) to prepare a proposal to create an Air Defence command as part of military’s theaterisation plans. Theaterisation refers to placing specific units of the army, the navy and the air force under a theatre commander. Such commands come under the operational control of an officer from any of the three services, depending on the function assigned to that command. The government expects Rawat to bring about jointness among the three services by 2022. One of the key objectives behind jointness, or jointmanship, is the setting up of theatre commands for the best use of military resources to fight future battles. The air defence systems in the Indian arsenal include the indigenous Akash, the Israeli SpyDer, and Soviet-origin Pechora, OSA-AK and the shoulder-fired Igla. India is also pushing Russia to speed up the delivery of S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems following border tensions with China in eastern Ladakh. India is looking at creating a distinct theatre command for Jammu & Kashmir, and integrating the western and eastern naval commands to create a Peninsular Command, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. India could have up to five theatres to address the country’s security requirements, and the new structures could start rolling out in two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-speeds-up-setting-up-of-air-defence-command/story-O5xpBpSyzyxXKlqgQA2cDM.html
27-08-2020||India||Rajnath, Jaishankar to visit Russia for SCO||New Delhi Defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar will make back-to-back visits to Russia early next month for meetings of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) that are expected to bring them face to face with their Chinese counterparts amid the border standoff. Singh is expected to be in Moscow during September 3-4 for a meeting of the SCO defence ministers while Jaishankar is set to visit the Russian capital for the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting on September 10, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Thursday. The visits are yet to be officially announced. Asked about the matter during a news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava only confirmed that the external affairs minister has received an invitation for the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting. This will be Singh’s second visit to Moscow in a little more than two months – he travelled to Russia to participate in the Victory Day parade on June 24, reflecting the importance attached to the defence partnership between the two countries. The people said bilateral meetings had so far been arranged between Singh and Jaishankar and their Russian counterparts, though there were no proposals as of now for meetings with the Chinese ministers expected to attend the SCO meetings. The people added the possibility of such meetings too appeared unlikely, given the differences that have emerged in the disengagement and de-escalation process along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The people also ruled out the possibility of Russia playing any sort of role in mediating between India and China. “The Russian side has been briefed by the Indian side on the border situation but there has been no discussion whatsoever on any sort of mediation,” said one of the people cited above. At a time when foreign trips by Indian ministers are extremely rare because of the pandemic, Singh and Jaishankar are travelling to Moscow largely because of the insistence of the Russian side, currently the chair of both Brics and SCO, the people said. These meetings will be preceded by a virtual meeting of the foreign ministers of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) grouping on September 4, the Russian foreign ministry announced on Thursday. That meeting, to be chaired foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, will exchange views on “topical international matters”, said Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. Zakharova said the Brics foreign ministers will discuss cooperation in three key areas – politics and security, economics and finance and humanitarian ties. The Brics meeting was to have been held in Moscow at the same time as the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting but was converted into a video conference after the Brazilian and South African ministers expressed their inability to travel due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the people cited above said. The Brics and SCO summits are expected to be held in St Petersburg in October. Indian, Chinese and Pakistani troops are also set to take part Exercise Kavkaz 20, a multilateral tri-services drill being held in Astrakhan region of southern Russia during September 15-27. The exercise will bring together some 13,000 troops from 20 countries, including the eight members of SCO. “The scope of Ex Kavkaz 20 is vast and its aim is to provide real-time training to counter international terrorism,” a second person said. The Indian Army will send a company or about 180 troops from an infantry battalion and elements from other arms along with elements of the air force and observers from the navy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-jaishankar-to-visit-russia-for-sco/story-qNSuMzJ8IgKSjuPUU8uCFO.html
27-08-2020||India||BJP’s Rao seeks NIA probe in Rajput case||NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party national general secretary P Muralidhar Rao on Thursday said that there was scope to involve the National Investigation Agency into the alleged suicide of actor Sushant Singh Rajput to further widen the investigation. In a series of tweets, Rao said that since the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate had already been roped in to probe various aspects of the case, NIA can also be involved. “Abetment of suicide, Unnatural death being investigated by #CBI. #ED is investigating Money laundering NCB is investigating Drug use case under NDPS Act. #NIA may have to get in – may be.!! Case is getting larger – Connecting different cases – web of networks,” he tweeted. In another tweet, Rao said that the demand for a wider probe is aimed at “helping clean the Bollywood movement”.“Entire India and Indians all over are watching keenly – intensively and emotionally, Who’ever is helping & contributing for this is not fighting for #JusticeForSSR but also – helping the clean Bollywood movement. After @KanganaTeam’s tweet to @PMOIndia, #JusticeforSSR & Clean Bollywood are now getting into one big-movement Swachha Bollywood...Swachha Bharat...” he tweeted. Referring to Rao’s tweets, a senior party functionary said the BJP’s demand for a thorough probe is aimed at getting the “underbelly” of the Hindi film industry exposed. “Now there is talk of drugs and links to narcotics traders, which is a serious issue and needs to be exposed since there are links between international drug cartels and terror industry. The idea is to uncover the truth and clean up the industry,” the functionary said on condition of anonymity. The functionary asserted that the speculation that the party was encouraging a “witch-hunt” against actors who were critical of the government is “far-fetched” and “false”. “The SC has already given its nod to the CBI probe and we hope that the investigation reveals the truth,” the functionary said. The Supreme Court last week ruled on that the ongoing probe by the CBI into the case filed against actor Rhea Chakraborty and her family for allegedly abetting Rajput’s suicide is lawful, allowing the agency to continue its investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-s-rao-seeks-nia-probe-in-rajput-case/story-HEx3AidUNKBcC2fuRNZrsM.html

27-08-2020||India||Day after Kejriwal says Delhi’s testing to double, Jain accuses MHA of ‘interfering’||New Delhi: Delhi health Satyendar Jain wrote to Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on Thursday, urging the home ministry to not “interfere” in the Kejriwal government’s decision to double testing within a week in view of the spike in the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the capital. “Ever since Covid-19 hit the national capital, the Delhi government has confronted the pandemic together with the Central government. But now when a few officers said that the home ministry is putting pressure on Delhi government officials to not increase testing further in the city, I was taken aback,” read Jain’s letter.A home ministry spokesperson rebutted the allegations, calling them “false” and “baseless”. The spokesperson said it was because of the Union home minister Amit Shah’s intervention that testing in the Capital went up from 4,000 to 20,000 per day. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced on Wednesday that his government has decided to double the number of daily tests to around 40,000 per day to catch and isolate more infections.Later in the evening, at a press conference AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha said that Jain had also attached a purported note with the letter, which Chadha claimed top bureaucrats of the Delhi government had drafted “under pressure from the MHA”.Senior government officials said the purported note was drafted by principal secretary (health) Vikram Dev Dutt.The MHA in a statement said the annexed note in Jain’s letter was prepared by Delhi government officers in which they proposed to take the opinion of the expert committee led by Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul that was set up by Shah in June when Covid-19 cases in Delhi had peaked.“It may be noted that this note has made no mention whatsoever of any instruction of MHA on the matter of increase in testing in Delhi. The note has only proposed that the views of an expert committee headed by Dr V.K Paul may be taken on the proposed enhancement in testing in Delhi, for technical guidance on various issues such as mix of RT-PCR and rapid antigen, categories of geographical areas and demographics, etc. As such, any allegation that MHA is putting pressure on Delhi government not to increase testing in Delhi is absolutely without any basis,” the ministry said in its statement.In his response to the statement, Jain said that he hopes with this clarification, officials of the city administration will now comply with the chief minister’s directions.“I hope that the officers will comply with this message from MHA. I am sure that the officers, who were reluctant to increase testing today, citing pressure from MHA, will immediately increase testing in Delhi. Our CM has acted in cooperation with the central government to tackle Covid-19 in Delhi. We should continue to act in the same spirit of cooperation for the well being of Delhiites,” Jain tweeted on Thursday.The MHA spokesperson said it was after the intervention of the Union home minister that the daily tests in Delhi, which were averaging around 4,000 per day till mid June, 2020, have gone up to around 18,000-20,000 per day in a calibrated manner. “The marked improvement in the Covid-19 situation in Delhi has been possible due to this enhanced testing and other containment measures,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-kejriwal-says-delhi-s-testing-to-double-jain-accuses-mha-of-interfering/story-596KVeM3l4SuQIDe9zAHfN.html
27-08-2020||India||Cong set to oppose 4 ordinances during session||New Delhi: Congress, the principal Opposition party is all set to oppose at least four ordinances—including the three on farms—when the government tries to replace them in the upcoming monsoon session of Parliament. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020, The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 and The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020 may face a stiff opposition from the Congress in both Houses of Parliament. Senior Congress leaders said, they have found faults with The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, too. The government has promulgated 11 ordinances—an executive route for urgent legislation when the Parliament is not in session—and will seek to replace them with bills in the forthcoming session that starts from September 14. An ordinance has a shelf life of six months and needs Parliament’s approval to make the law permanent. The amendments in the farm-related laws were rolled out in June to help farmers amid the tough pandemic crisis. They were hailed as far-reaching steps to unshackle the country’s farm sector as the Centre changed the six-decade-old Essential Commodities Act and moved the other two ordinances to remove all restrictions on farm trade from while guaranteeing a legal framework for pre-agreed prices to farmers. But the Congress remains unimpressed, especially because its government in Punjab and Haryana state unit have raised major objections and claimed these states have already started facing farmer protests against the new laws. The party last evening, announced a 5-member panel to “discuss and formulate the Congress party’s stands on key ordinances promulgated by the Central government.” It has former union minister P Chidambaram, Jairam Ramesh, former Madhya Pradesh CM Digvijaya Singh, party MPs Amar Singh and Gaurav Gogoi. At least three senior Congress leaders maintain that the move will only help corporate buyers of crops and weaken India’s MSP and other safety net for farmers. While the dilution of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees Act (APMCA) has been widely hailed by experts as better selling power to farmer and allowing them to bypass the Laxman-rekha of local mandis, the Congress will dish out government data to show that more than 50% of different kinds of farm produce including wheat, paddy, maize, mustard, bajra, cotton, soyabean, jowar, potato, sugarcane, groundnut and even coconut—are sold to local private traders and not designated mandis. A Congress leader also claimed that while transaction in traditional mandis will invoke fees, but trade zones specified under the new laws would not see any such levy, creating different systems. “The party is also studying the Bihar experiment when it removed APMCA restrictions in 2006 but instead of benefitting farmers it forced them to sell produce below MSP rates,” said a leader. Kavitha Kuruganti, Convenor of Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture (ASHA), said, “the government talks about freedom for farmers through APMC ordinance but there has never been any legal restrictions to sell outside mandis and under the earlier APMC act they were always free. The APMC and Contract Farming ordinance will lead to asking farmers to have interface with corporates in an unequal market.” She also added that more players in the market without licenses “would not necessarily empower farmers and it will not be possible for them to find best buyers in other states since many farmers are bound by creditors and in reality, they have little choice.” The Congress may ask for a mechanism to ensure that no farmer is forced to sell anything less than the MSP. Kavitha also said there must be a registry of buyers and a strong government oversight. Talking about The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, a senior leader claimed it will only benefit hoarding and consumers would be badly affected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-set-to-oppose-4-ordinances-during-session/story-jIe6zdvCpPOHR6Kpx8C8AM.html

Gauba, along with the Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, held a videoconference with the chief secretaries and health secretaries of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Gujarat, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir on Wednesday to assess the situation in the states. According to the press information bureau, these states and the UT account for 89% of the deaths in the last two weeks. “Union health secretary made a detailed presentation on the current status of COVID-19 in these states/UT, with a focus on districts reporting high case fatality and the need to refine as well as strengthen approach and strategies relating to testing, contact tracing, surveillance, containment, home isolation, availability of ambulances, hospital beds, oxygen, treatment protocols,” said a statement issued by the press information bureau. The cabinet secretary told the states and UT to ensure that at least in 80% of the new cases, all close contacts are traced and tested within 72 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-with-spike-in-deaths-told-to-ramp-up-testing/story-DgntxhVHQZZ6tHV15tOMEN.html
27-08-2020||India||Holding competitive exams must: NTA||New Delhi As opposition persists against the Centre’s decision to hold the Joint Entrance Examination, or JEE, (Main) and the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Examination (NEET) next month, the National Testing Agency and the ministry of education are considering an outreach plan to communicate to stakeholders why conducting these tests is of vital importance.Some students and their parents as well as some educationists and state governments have opposed the decision to conduct the exams next month at a time when the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic is still raging.JEE scores determine admission to top engineering schools including the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and NEET is the basis for admission to medical and dental courses.“It is only after considering all aspects that the government has taken this decision. Moreover, the matter had also come before the Supreme Court, which gave its view. The NTA is maintaining communication with important functionaries of the states, especially those related to the health and education. The ministry is also trying to convey its view so that the tests can be conducted in a smooth manner. It will reach out further,” said a government official who requested anonymity.On Thursday, Union minister of education (MoE) Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank reiterated that the government was clear that it would hold the tests and said the decision had been taken “keeping the career of the student in mind”.Nishank also said that the Director General of the NTA, Vineet Joshi, had told him that over 750,000 out of 858,000 JEE candidates had downloaded admit cards to take the test. Over 1 million of the nearly 1.6 million NEET candidates too had downloaded the admit cards in 24 hours, he added. “Students want that the exams are held at any cost,” Nishank said.“Our education secretary is in constant communication with the chief secretary, education and health secretaries of all the states. There is a lot of vigilance and I want to assure the students that arrangements have been made by the NTA. It has 72 guidelines that will ensure the safe conduction of the two exams and I am confident that students will not waste a year,” he told a news agency.Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the phone and requested him to postpone the exams in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic and the flood situation in the state. Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday wrote an open letter opposing the central government’s decision to hold NEET and JEE exams. Congress leaders have also raised questions and held protests on the issue.The senior government official cited above said there were reservations but the ministry would try to communicate its viewpoint and try to address them.“A delay may lead to a zero year which is not in the interest of students at all. The opportunity needs to be provided to the students and an entire academic year cannot be allowed to be wasted,” said the official.While JEE Main is scheduled from September 1-6, NEET is planned to be held on September 13.On Wednesday, chief ministers of several Opposition-ruled states decided to challenge the Centre over concerns of their rights getting undermined, even as demands surfaced at a virtual meeting that they collectively move the Supreme Court against the Union government’s plan to hold the exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/holding-competitive-exams-must-nta/story-t1yoaZ63cfLyKm7gIeLuWK.html
27-08-2020||India||India calls for a diplomatic solution to border standoff||New Delhi India on Thursday emphasised the need for a diplomatic solution to the standoff with China based on agreements on the border issue, saying the disengagement of troops can move forward only if both sides implement actions they have agreed on in several rounds of diplomatic and military talks. The external affairs ministry outlined India’s latest position on the months-long standoff hours after the Chinese defence ministry said New Delhi should look at the “big picture” of bilateral ties and work with Beijing to bring the relationship back on track while avoiding misjudgements. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava referred to remarks made in a recent interview by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who noted that several border incidents in the past had all been resolved through diplomacy. Jaishankar further said that “when it comes to finding a solution, this must be predicated on honouring all agreements and understandings” and “not attempting to alter the status quo unilaterally”, he added. At the same time, Srivastava pointed out, India believes complete disengagement requires redeployment of troops by both sides “towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the Line of Actual Control (LAC)”. “It is natural that this can be done only through mutually agreed reciprocal actions. Thus, it is important to bear in mind that achieving this requires agreed actions by both sides,” he said. In Beijing, defence ministry spokesperson Colonel Wu Qian told a monthly news briefing that China expects India to work with it to maintain peace and tranquillity on the border while “bearing in mind the big picture of bilateral ties and putting the border issue in an appropriate position in this big picture”. India should “avoid misjudgement, keep divergences from escalating into disputes, and take concrete steps to bring the bilateral relations back to the right track of normal development”, Wu said. Wu’s comments echoed remarks in a recent speech by China’s envoy to India, Sun Weidong, who described the June 15 border clash that killed 20 Indian soldiers as “a brief moment from the perspective of history”, and said the two sides should now “seek common ground while reserving differences”. Like the Chinese foreign ministry, Wu’s statement, published on the official military website, put the onus on India to restore normalcy in ties, currently at their lowest level in decades. The remaining issues at the LAC should be handled properly and both sides should further “cool down the China-India border situation”, Wu said. The “big picture” advice in China’s diplomatic narrative appeared to suggest that Beijing doesn’t want the border tensions to impact other components of the relationship, such as trade and economic cooperation. But it was evident at the end of the last meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs on August 20 that the two sides had been unable to bridge differences on troop disengagement. New Delhi said there were “outstanding issues” that need to be resolved speedily at the meeting, and Jaishankar said in his recent interview the current situation was “surely the most serious situation” since the 1962 war, and that the “quantum of forces currently deployed by both sides at the LAC is also unprecedented”. Srivastava said that at the last meeting of WMCC, the two sides reaffirmed they will “continue to sincerely work towards complete disengagement of the troops” in line with agreements reached by the two foreign ministers and the two Special Representatives (SRs) during their conversation on July 5. “Both sides also agree that full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas would be essential for the overall development of bilateral relations. The two sides had also agreed to continue their engagements both through diplomatic and military channels,” Srivastava said. Experts, however, believe the Chinese side is glossing over India’s concerns, with several statements from China’s foreign ministry projecting a positive picture of the disengagement process. Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said: “I think developments are moving in the expected direction, with the level being raised from the operational military and diplomatic level to the political level. The external affairs minister’s statement about the situation being the most serious since the 1962 war is the government’s position articulated by a cabinet minister. “For the moment, we have no option but to talk to the Chinese but the gap between the two sides hasn’t been reduced at all. The Chinese are underplaying the seriousness of the situation, while India is emphasising the gravity and complexity of the total relationship with China.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-calls-for-a-diplomatic-solution-to-border-standoff/story-lfFUN1zmCro96G92yD0wdJ.html
27-08-2020||India||Our victory that Congress will have full-time president after six months, party chief should be elected: Ghulam Nabi Azad||Senior Congress Ghulam Nabi Azad, who was among 23 leaders who sent a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi calling for sweeping changes in the party, on Thursday strongly pitched for elections to the Congress Working Committee and said the party chief should be elected and it is their “victory” that the party will have “full-time president” after six months.He also pitched for elections to the key organisational posts of state chief and district chief.“Anyone who has a genuine interest in the internal working dynamics of Congress would welcome our proposal to have every state and district president as being elected. The entire Congress Working Committee should be elected,” Azad told ANI.Azad, who is Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, defended the move to write the letter and said their effort was to make the party strong and active and those who simply got “appointment cards” continue to oppose their proposal. “The intention is to make Congress active and strong. But those who simply got ‘appointment cards’ continue to oppose our proposal. What’s the harm in having elected CWC members who will have fixed tenures in the party,” he said.CWC is the highest decision-making body of the party.Answering a query, Azad referred to the stormy meeting of the Congress Working Committee and said both Sonia Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi showed statesmanship. “In fact Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi said let’s do the election within a month but we said it’s not possible, So it’s our victory that after six months we will have a full-time president,” he said.Azad said it will not be fair to compel Sonia Gandhi for elections from block to CWC.“We will raise it to next president who will be elected,” he said.Azad, a former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, said the party should have an elected president. “I don’t have any problem. Whosoever becomes president, should be elected, Rahulji was elected for five years but he resigned and we had to elect interim president,” he said.The CWC meeting was held in the backdrop of a letter in which Azad and 22 other leaders had called for “full time” active leadership, sweeping reforms and elections of the CWC. There was also a suggestion for a mechanism for collective leadership to guide the party’s revival.Several leaders in the party, including party chief ministers, had raised questions over the letter and the issue figured in the CWC meeting.The resolution adopted at the meeting said that “CWC makes it clear that no one will be or can be permitted to undermine or weaken the party and its leadership at this juncture”.It said the responsibility of every Congress worker and leader today is to fight the pernicious assault on India’s democracy, pluralism and diversity by the Modi Government.The resolution said inner-party issues cannot be deliberated through the media or in public for and urged and advises all concerned to raise such issues only in party fora in the interest of propriety and discipline.The resolution requested Sonia Gandhi “to continue to lead the Indian National Congress” until such time as circumstances will permit an AICC session to be convened.It authorised her to make necessary organisational changes that she may deem appropriate to take on the challenges faced by the party.Apart from hailing the leadership of Sonia Gandhi, the CWC also lauded the role of party leader Rahul Gandhi, saying he has resolutely led the fight against the BJP-led government from the front.Sonia Gandhi as interim president of the party in August last year after Rahul Gandhi resigned taking responsibility for the party’s dismal performance in the Lok Sabha polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/our-victory-that-congress-will-have-full-time-president-after-six-months-party-chief-should-be-elected-ghulam-nabi-azad/story-1DRlOVVhXn9mtusOeBCfGJ.html

Emerging out of a GST Council meeting, he said the Centre has refused to pay GST compensation to states and asked them to take a loan from the RBI to meet their shortfall caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.“However, under the current hybrid system (of governance), the Delhi government cannot take a loan from the RBI. The Centre should take a loan from the RBI on behalf of the Delhi government,” he said.Sisodia, also Delhi’s Deputy Chief Minister, said the city government estimates a revenue shortfall of around Rs 21,000 crore in the current financial year.The Central government’s refusal to pay GST compensation to states is the “biggest betrayal” in the history of federalism in India, he said. Sisodia also charged the Centre with failing to fulfil its promise made to states at the time of launch of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime four years ago.“The Centre had promised that it will pay GST compensation to states at the rate of 14 percent for five years in case of revenue shortfall. But, today at the GST Council meeting, the Centre refused it, saying there was no provision in law for compensation in situations like a pandemic,” Sisodia said in a briefing.He accused the Centre of “double standards”. “In the first two years when the Central government earned extra cess of Rs 47,000 crore, which was supposed to be given as compensation, they kept it in their fund. Today, when the revenue is decreasing, they started taking opinion of the Attorney General on whether they are liable to give this amount to states or not,” he said. Sisodia also alleged that the Centre has “failed” to properly implement the GST which was why it could not neither control price rise nor boost revenue of the states.“I am not against GST, but the central government has failed to implement it properly. Had they implemented it properly, the states would not have to beg like this. First, the Centre failed in implementing GST reforms properly, and now they are betraying states and running away from its responsibility of giving GST compensation,” he said.The Delhi government collected Rs 7,000 crore less tax in the first four months of the fiscal. It will have a shortfall of Rs 21000 in the whole year.“The central government should take a loan on our behalf as we also need to pay salaries to our doctors, teachers, engineers and other employees,” he said. If there were no GST, the states would have managed taxes and expenses in their own way. But after joining the GST regime, they had to surrender most of their rights to the GST council, he said.Sisodia claimed that many states, including some BJP-ruled ones, demanded compensation from the Center in the meeting. They quoted the minutes of previous meetings of the GST Council where it was “clearly stated” that the Central government “takes full responsibility” to compensate them in case of revenue shortfall, he added.

27-08-2020||India||Rajnath Singh, Jaishankar set to visit Russia for SCO meetings next month||Defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar will make back-to-back visits to Russia early next month for meetings of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) that are expected to bring them face to face with their Chinese counterparts amid the border stand-off. Singh is expected to be in Moscow during September 3-4 for a meeting of the SCO defence ministers while Jaishankar is set to visit the Russian capital for the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting on September 10, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Thursday. The visits are yet to be officially announced. Asked about the matter during a news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava only confirmed that the external affairs minister has received an invitation for the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting. This will be Singh’s second visit to Moscow in a little more than two months – he travelled to Russia to participate in the Victory Day parade on June 24, reflecting the importance attached to the defence partnership between the two countries. The people said bilateral meetings had so far been arranged between Singh and Jaishankar and their Russian counterparts, though there were no proposals as of now for meetings with the Chinese ministers expected to attend the SCO meetings. The people added the possibility of such meetings too appeared unlikely, given the differences that have emerged in the disengagement and de-escalation process along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The people also ruled out the possibility of Russia playing any sort of role in mediating between India and China. “The Russian side has been briefed by the Indian side on the border situation but there has been no discussion whatsoever on any sort of mediation,” said one of the people cited above. At a time when foreign trips by Indian ministers are extremely rare because of the pandemic, Singh and Jaishankar are travelling to Moscow largely because of the insistence of the Russian side, currently the chair of both Brics and SCO, the people said. These meetings will be preceded by a virtual meeting of the foreign ministers of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) grouping on September 4, the Russian foreign ministry announced on Thursday. That meeting, to be chaired foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, will exchange views on “topical international matters”, said Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. Zakharova said the Brics foreign ministers will discuss cooperation in three key areas – politics and security, economics and finance and humanitarian ties. The Brics meeting was to have been held in Moscow at the same time as the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting but was converted into a video conference after the Brazilian and South African ministers expressed their inability to travel due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the people cited above said. The Brics and SCO summits are expected to be held in St Petersburg. Indian, Chinese and Pakistani troops are also set to take part Exercise Kavkaz 20, a multilateral tri-services drill being held in Astrakhan region of southern Russia during September 15-27. The exercise will bring together some 13,000 troops from 20 countries, including the eight members of SCO. “The scope of Ex Kavkaz 20 is vast and its aim is to provide real-time training to counter international terrorism,” a second person said. The Indian army will send a company or about 180 troops from an infantry battalion and elements from other arms along with elements of the air force and observers from the navy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-jaishankar-set-to-visit-russia-for-sco-meetings-next-month/story-KHDkeOcix0L1lowx1Au1QM.html

27-08-2020||India||India speeds up work on setting up Air Defence Command||India has accelerated work on setting up an Air Defence Command to enhance military synergy and optimally utilise the resources of the armed forces, and it is likely to come up in October, people familiar with the developments said on Thursday.Air defence refers to protecting the military’s assets from aerial threats such as the enemy’s fighter planes and missiles and the new Command --- likely to be headquartered in Allahabad --- will control the air defence resources of all the three services. It will be headed by a three-star air marshal, the officials said.After taking over as the country’s first chief of defence staff on December 31, 2019, General Bipin Rawat had asked top officials of Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff (IDS) to prepare a proposal to create an Air Defence Command as part of the military’s theaterisation plans. Theaterisation refers to placing specific units of the army, the navy and the air force under a theatre commander. Such commands come under the operational control of an officer from any of the three services, depending on the function assigned to that command.The government expects Rawat to bring about jointness among the three services by 2022. One of the key objectives behind jointness, or jointmanship, is the setting up of theatre commands for the best use of military resources to fight future battles.The air defence systems in the Indian arsenal include the indigenous Akash, the Israeli SpyDer, and Soviet-origin Pechora, OSA-AK and the shoulder-fired Igla. India is also pushing Russia to speed up the delivery of S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems following border tensions with China in eastern Ladakh.India is looking at creating a distinct theatre command for Jammu & Kashmir, and integrating the western and eastern naval commands to create a Peninsular Command, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.India could have up to five theatres to address the country’s security requirements, and the new structures could start rolling out in two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-speeds-up-work-on-setting-up-air-defence-command/story-uBFbczJL5YXizAZJ5PUCAI.html

Less competition and more freedom for children who wanted to work in TV or films. For me it was so much fun when I shot for my first show ‘Filmy Chakkar’. The shoot was fixed for weekends and it was more like a picnic for me.”The actor remembers, “Working with likes of Satish (Shah) sir and Ratna (Pathak Shah) maam made me grasp the art of acting specially figuring out the concept of perfect comic timing. Today, I feel sad seeing small children auditioning for shows. There is too much competition and they are under a lot of pressure.”Kavin has played positive, funny characters in a number of films and shows ‘Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi’, ‘Kick’, ‘I Hate Luv Stories’, ‘Ristha.com’ and more. “I started with a light hearted comedy show so I love entertaining people with correct dose of humour. As a kid I did shows for five-six years and left acting for studies. It was during college I took up theatre and I am still doing plays. It was in 2008 that I got a chance to be a part of four-month long workshop and production under Pt Satyadev Dubey with Prithvi Theatre. That’s where I learned it all. And then series and TV commercials followed before I got films,” said the ‘My Name Is Khan’ over phone.Talking about his first Hindi film, he shared an anecdote, “In ‘Mumbai Meri Jaan’ we had this one particular scene with Irrfan sir and during the shoot I was flooded with memories as I had done a TV series with him where he played my father. And it was like a ‘wow’ moment and the best part was when I told him that ten years back, we had worked together, he was like, ‘O! yes…I remember.’ It was an absolute nostalgic bit for me,” he said.Currently, Kavin is seen portraying a negative character for a web-series, “I was too excited to be a part of ‘Flesh’ because I was getting a chance to experiment. I believe it is important to discuss issues like human trafficking. I am playing a transporter who is part of this ugly business. It is difficult to get into skin of such characters though I had played grey role in my film ‘Crook’ but this was totally a negative guy. My next OTT series ‘Scam’ will also stream soon.”Theatre too has been keeping Kavin busy, “I love theatre and my last play ‘Catch 22’ was well received but due to the ongoing crisis the shows are on hold.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-love-entertaining-people-with-correct-dose-of-humour/story-jUpM5TJuW1Ao8cEDR33VWJ.html

27-08-2020||India||Sonia Gandhi names leaders in Parliament; Ghulam Nabi Azad retains spot||The Congress on Thursday named Gaurav Gogoi its deputy leader in the Lok Sabha and also formed two groups for smooth functioning and effective coordination in both the Houses of Parliament, according to people familiar with the development. Lok Sabha member from Ludhiana Ravneet Singh Bittu was also named as one of the whips of the party in the Lok Sabha. The group for the Rajya Sabha comprises Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad, deputy leader Anand Sharma, party treasurer Ahmed Patel, general secretary in-charge of organisation KC Venugopal and former union minister Jairam Ramesh. Azad and Sharma are among the 23 leaders who wrote to Congress president Sonia Gandhi seeking a complete overhaul of the organisation and a full-time party chief. The other prominent leaders among the dissenters are Mukul Wasnik, Kapil Sibal, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Prithiviraj Chavan, Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor and Jitin Prasada. Apart from Gogoi and Bittu, the group for the Lok Sabha will have Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh and Manickam Tagore as its members. While Choudhary is the Congress leader in the Lok Sabha, Suresh is the chief whip, and Tagore and Bittu are the whips. The appointments came ahead of the monsoon session of Parliament beginning on September 14, and are an attempt by the Congress to strengthen its team of floor leaders in both the Houses. The deputy leader’s post had been lying vacant in the 16th Lok Sabha. Even in the 15th Lok Sabha, the party had not named any deputy leader after Captain Amarinder Singh took over as Punjab chief minister in 2017. The appointments also came three days after the stormy Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting that asked Sonia Gandhi to stay on as the party chief till a new president is elected. The CWC members also came down heavily on the 23 dissenters who had written the letter to Gandhi. But Thursday’s decisions have caused heartburn among the dissenters. One of the dissenters said on the condition of anonymity that the leadership has ignored two former union ministers and “serious claimants” Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor for the deputy leader’s post in the Lok Sabha and also not included them in the panel. Similarly, he said including a senior leader such as Patel and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi loyalist Venugopal in the panel for the Rajya Sabha is a clear signal that the leadership wants to “keep a check” on those who wrote the letter to Sonia Gandhi. “They should have included Kapil Sibal in the Rajya Sabha group,” said the leader quoted above. On Wednesday, Sonia Gandhi had constituted a five-member committee to discuss and formulate the party’s stands on key ordinances promulgated by the central government. Apart from Ramesh and Gogoi, the panel consisted of former union minister P Chidambaram, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijaya Singh and member from Punjab Amar Singh. Ramesh will be its convener.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-names-leaders-in-parliament-ghulam-nabi-azad-retains-spot/story-lpU38zws9ozYVY9VPBqGbK.html
27-08-2020||India||Telangana schools reopen after over 150 days, online classes from Sept 1||Around 30,000 government schools in Telangana on Thursday re-opened after a gap of 158 days to kickstart the academic year for 2020-21, amid the Covid-19 pandemic.While over one lakh teachers resumed their duties on Thursday, the actual teaching activity will commence from September 1 through online mode. On day one, the teachers began preparations for running of online classes for students as part of e-learning and distance education.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageSpecial chief secretary (education) Chitra Ramachandran said the online classes would be conducted on various digital, TV, T-SAT platforms across all schools. “All the teachers shall prepare e-content, lesson plans etc,” she said.Ramachandran said the alternative calendar prepared by the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) would be followed for online classes. “Separate instructions for regular classes will be issued as per the Government of India guidelines as and when reopening of schools is feasible,” she said.The schools in Telangana were forced to close down abruptly on March 22 following the outbreak of Covid-19 and remained shut since then. In the previous academic year (2019-20), they lost 33 days and had to cancel all the examinations, promoting the students to higher classes.As per the original academic calendar, the schools were supposed to reopen on June 12, but they could not due to Covid-19 pandemic. The teachers have lost 76 days in the 2020-21 academic year. Taking into account 49 days of summer holidays, the schools have reopened after a gap of 158 days.Telangana teachers’ federation leader E Raghunandan Rao said the functioning of schools without students and conducting online classes were easier said than done. “So far, there is no academic calendar and no proper guidelines as to how to conduct the online classes from schools,” he said.Rao pointed out that most of the schools were in the interior areas and had no access to high bandwidth internet facility to conduct the online classes. “As a matter of fact, the teachers have better wi-fi facility at their homes than in schools. They can conduct classes from their homes, instead of going all the way to the schools,” Rao argued.Telangana Pranteeya Teachers Union president K Hanumantha Rao said the biggest problem for the teachers is lack of transportation facility. “On the first day today, most of the teachers somehow went to schools by making their own transport arrangements. But it cannot be done every day. There is no public transport at present and even if it is introduced, it is risky for the teachers to commute every day in this pandemic situation,” he said.Not even 10-15 percent of the school children have access to mobile phones or tablets. “They cannot afford to buy smartphones with high bandwidth at this stage. The government says those who do not have phones can follow lessons on televisions. But who will monitor the students’ attendance in the distance mode?” he asked.Meanwhile, the state government told the high court that it was preparing guidelines for distance and online education for school students, including how to conduct classes through satellite television and Doordarshan.The court, which was hearing a public interest litigation petition against online classes, questioned how will students get their doubts clarified. It asked the petitioners to come out with their objections on the government’s stand on online education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-schools-reopen-after-over-150-days-online-classes-for-students-from-sept-1/story-H2lFMNy9VwqiNrw84aCB9L.html
27-08-2020||India||BJP leader demands NIA probe into Sushant Singh Rajput death case||P Muralidhar Rao, a national general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said on Thursday that there is a scope for widening the investigation into the alleged suicide of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput by involving the National Investigation Authority (NIA). He said “web of networks” is emerging in the case. In a series of tweets, Rao said since multiple agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) have already been roped in to the probe, the NIA too may have to be involved in the inquiry. “Abetment of suicide, unnatural death being investigated by #CBI. #ED is investigating Money laundering NCB is investigating Drug use case under NDPS Act. #NIA may have to get in – may be.!! Case is getting larger – Connecting different cases – web of networks,” he tweeted. Rao, who is also in-charge of Karnataka for the party, went on to tweet that the demand for a wider probe is aimed at “helping clean the Bollywood movement.”  #NIA may have to get in – may be.!!Case is getting larger – Connecting different cases – web of networks.#SSRCase#justiceforSushanthSinghRajput(2/4)“Entire India and Indians all over are watching keenly – intensively and emotionally, Who’ever is helping & contributing for this is not fighting for #JusticeForSSR but also – helping the clean Bollywood movement. After @KanganaTeam’s tweet to @PMOIndia, #JusticeforSSR & Clean Bollywood are now getting into one big-movement Swachha Bollywood...Swachha Bharat...” he tweeted. Also read: Rhea Chakraborty - ‘Sushant Singh Rajput used to smoke marijuana, it started during Kedarnath’Referring to the tweets, a senior party functionary said the BJP’s demand for a thorough probe is aimed at getting the “underbelly” of the film industry exposed. “Now there is talk of drugs and links to narcotics traders, which is a serious issue and needs to be exposed since there are links between international drug cartels and terror industry. The idea is to uncover the truth and clean up the industry,” said the functionary.  #JusticeForSSRAbetment of suicide, Unnatural death being investigated by #CBI.#ED is investigating Money launderingNCB is investigating Drug use case under NDPS Act.(1/4)He asserted that the speculation that the party was encouraging a “witch-hunt” against actors who were critical of the government is “far-fetched” and “false”. “The SC has already given its nod to the CBI probe and we hope that the investigation reveals the truth,” the functionary said. Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that the ongoing probe by the CBI into the case filed against actor Rhea Chakraborty and her family for allegedly abetting the suicide of Rajput is lawful. The top court allowed the federal agency to continue its investigation and rejected a plea by Chakraborty to transfer the case to the Maharashtra Police. The apex court’s decision was hailed by several BJP functionaries including union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad who tweeted, “Justice triumphs! The soul of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput will surely now rest in peace with the assurance of a fair investigation by CBI on the FIR filed in Patna by Bihar Police whose request for transfer of case to CBI has been validated by the Supreme Court.” On the allegations that the BJP has been using the actor’s death as a political tool against its opponents in Maharashtra and for mopping support in election-bound Bihar, where the late actor hailed from, the functionary said, the party’s intentions are only to expose the nexus between unlawful groups and some members of the film industry. In Maharashtra, the party has attacked the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government for stalling the investigation and forcing Patna Superintendent of Police (SP) Vinay Tiwari, who arrived in Mumbai to probe the case, to be under home quarantine. “What the BJP is doing is cheap politics. The Supreme Court has already directed the CBI to conduct a probe and we have faith in the agency. We have nothing to fear and we should all wait for the outcome of the probe,” Shiv Sena’s Vinayak Raut told HT. A former ally of the BJP, the Shiva Sena has also alleged that the BJP has been using the actor’s death to destabilize the government after it failed to topple the MVA government just as it did with the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-demands-nia-probe-into-sushant-singh-rajput-death-case/story-VXn1T206naykijebv1bLwI.html
27-08-2020||India||‘Implement agreed actions’: India reminds China on disengagement at LAC||India on Thursday emphasised the need for a diplomatic solution to the stand-off with China based on agreements on the border issue, saying the disengagement of troops can move forward only if both sides implement actions they have agreed on in several rounds of diplomatic and military talks. The external affairs ministry outlined India’s latest position on the protracted stand-off hours after the Chinese defence ministry said New Delhi should look at the “big picture” of bilateral ties and work with Beijing to bring the relationship back on track while avoiding misjudgements. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava referred to remarks made in a recent interview by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who noted that several border incidents in the past had all been resolved through diplomacy. Jaishankar further said that “when it comes to finding a solution, this must be predicated on honouring all agreements and understandings” and “not attempting to alter the status quo unilaterally”, he added. At the same time, Srivastava pointed out, India believes complete disengagement requires re-deployment of troops by both sides “towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the Line of Actual Control (LAC)”. “It is natural that this can be done only through mutually agreed reciprocal actions. Thus, it is important to bear in mind that achieving this requires agreed actions by both sides,” he said. In Beijing, defence ministry spokesperson Col Wu Qian told a monthly news briefing that China expects India to work with it to maintain peace and tranquillity on the border while “bearing in mind the big picture of bilateral ties and putting the border issue in an appropriate position in this big picture”. India should “avoid misjudgement, keep divergences from escalating into disputes, and take concrete steps to bring the bilateral relations back to the right track of normal development”, Wu said. Wu’s comments echoed remarks in a recent speech by China’s envoy to India, Sun Weidong, who described the June 15 border clash that killed 20 Indian soldiers as “a brief moment from the perspective of history”, and said the two sides should now “seek common ground while reserving differences”. Like the Chinese foreign ministry, Wu’s statement, published on the official military website, put the onus on India to restore normalcy in ties, currently the worst in decades. The remaining issues at the LAC should be handled properly and both sides further “cool down the China-India border situation”, Wu said. The “big picture” advice in China’s diplomatic narrative appeared to suggest that Beijing doesn’t want the border tensions to impact other components of the relationship, such as trade and economic cooperation. But it was evident at the end of the last meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs on August 20 that the two sides had been unable to bridge differences on troop disengagement. New Delhi said there were “outstanding issues” that need to be resolved speedily at the meeting, and Jaishankar said in his recent interview the current situation was “surely the most serious situation” since the 1962 war, and that the “quantum of forces currently deployed by both sides at the LAC is also unprecedented”. Srivastava said at the last meeting of WMCC, the two sides reaffirmed they will “continue to sincerely work towards complete disengagement of the troops” in line with agreements reached by the two foreign ministers and the two Special Representatives (SRs) during their conversation on July 5. “Both sides also agree that full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas would be essential for the overall development of bilateral relations. The two sides had also agreed to continue their engagements both through diplomatic and military channels,” Srivastava said. Experts, however, believe the Chinese side is glossing over India’s concerns, with several statements from China’s foreign ministry projecting a positive picture of the disengagement process. Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said: “I think developments are moving in the expected direction, with the level being raised from the operational military and diplomatic level to the political level. The external affairs minister’s statement about the situation being the most serious since the 1962 war is the government’s position articulated by a cabinet minister. “For the moment, we have no option but to talk to the Chinese but the gap between the two sides hasn’t been reduced at all. The Chinese are underplaying the seriousness of the situation, while India is emphasising the gravity and complexity of the total relationship with China.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/implement-agreed-actions-india-reminds-china-on-disengagement-at-lac/story-cuYdJci5sdi2emuplDoRaN.html
27-08-2020||India||SC asks Centre to clear stand on winding up of Mallya’s United Breweries Holdings Limited||The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Centre to examine whether the assets of United Breweries Holdings Limited (UBHL) attached by the Enforcement Directorate could be available to save the “winding up” of the company and clearing the dues of over Rs 9,000 crore to be paid to banks. Former liquor baron Vijay Mallya holds a little over 10 percent shares in the UBHL which is majorly owned by Dutch beer maker Heineken and British spirit maker Diageo. Mallya’s shares in the company, along with other assets, were attached by the Directorate of Enforcement as alleged crime proceeds in their investigation into a case against Mallya registered under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Prior to his escape from the country in 2016, he took loans from a consortium of banks but failed to repay. According to Mallya’s lawyers, the outstanding dues are worth Rs 6,203 crore. Senior advocate CS Vaidyanathan, who appeared for Mallya, informed the Court that the assets of the company are more than its liabilities. If the assets lying under the attachment with the ED are allowed to be used, this can save the company from winding up and also help banks receive their dues. He informed the Court that the banks have approached the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal with this prayer. Also read: Mehul Choksi moves Delhi high court against Netflix series ‘Bad Boy Billionaires’, demands pre-screeningThis submission did not meet approval from the State Bank of India (SBI), which forms part of the consortium of banks waiting to get its dues. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Court not to entertain Mallya’s request as it will be misused by him in his extradition proceedings. Mehta said, “We cannot ignore the fact that he is a fugitive economic offender. What he owes to the banks is Rs 9,777 crore. Under PMLA, a criminal trial will take place and if it is found to be part of proceeds of crime, the same shall be confiscated.” The bench of Justices UU Lalit and Vineet Saran said, “At present, we are dealing with the company, not the person. You are wearing two hats. Be clear whether you appear for both (SBI and ED).” Mehta said, “There is more responsibility on our (SBI) part to protect the interest of our nation.” The bench gave Mehta time to think over and state its stand on September 8, the next date of hearing. The bench reminded Mehta that the principle of law requires the Court to save a company from winding up. The question posed by the bench was, “Once assets are attached (under PMLA), does it mean under the law that it cannot be considered as part of the company assets.” The court on March 6, 2020, refused to consider this aspect as it had no jurisdiction to direct the ED on the attached assets. The ED has so far recovered Rs 2,877 crore under its investigation. SC reserves order on review against Mallya’s contempt Meanwhile, in a related development, the Supreme Court on Thursday reserved orders on a review petition filed by Vijay Mallya challenging the May 10, 2017 order of the top court holding him guilty for committing contempt of court. The former liquor baron was accused of transferring $40 million received from British spirit maker Diageo to the bank account of his children. Mallya was accused of not disclosing this transaction to the Court and for siphoning the amount from the bank despite the Court restraining him from dealing with any of his moveable and immovable assets. The contempt petition against him was moved by the SBI. The bench of Justices UU Lalit and Ashok Bhushan reserved orders after hearing Mallya’s lawyer Jai Munim who stated that an affidavit by Mallya was not considered before the order of contempt was passed. The bench said that the affidavit did not materially influence the finding against the contemnor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-centre-to-clear-stand-on-winding-up-of-mallya-s-united-breweries-holdings-limited/story-FLLgBrMZyiUp2CMb2jw2ZP.html

Rao emphasised that it was the agri sector on which the majority of the people were dependent and it provided food and also supplied raw material to industries. “Since Indian economy is agriculture-based it was able to withstand all the troubles and tribulations. He (Rao) wanted the government and institutions like NABARD to implement schemes that would encourage agriculture and agri based industries,” the release said.The chief minister favoured cultivating crops as per the natureof soil and said the objective should be not only to increase the produce but to put in place a proper marketing strategy for the produce.Rao also pitched for promoting agri-based industries, food processing and mechanisation in agriculture operations, the release added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-change-negative-attitude-about-agriculture-telangana-cm/story-PI2Qt04o1PlwWcB5sqRm0I.html

Addressing a seminar on ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ in defence manufacturing, Modi said his government has ushered in a “win-win” situation for all players, from public sector to private and foreign manufacturers, and asserted that the concept of a self-reliant India is not “inward-looking”.The goal of this mission is to make India work towards larger global peace, and also to help the world economy become more resilient and stable, he said. The defence sector having self confidence is necessary for making a modern and self-reliant India, the prime minister said, asserting that a new mindset has emerged on his government’s watch. “India has the potential to become a dependable supplier of defence equipment to many friendly countries. This will further deepen India’s strategic partnership and boost its role of being a net security provider in the Indian Ocean region,” Modi said. Asserting that the recent announcement of an import embargo on 101 defence equipment is not merely confined to curbing imports but also aimed at giving a boost to the domestic industry, he said more items will be added to this list later. His government’s efforts are aimed at developing technology in India and expanding the private sector’s role in this sector to the most, Modi said. He said his government has opened the way for 74 per cent FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) in defence production through automatic route. This is an outcome of the self confidence of a new India, he added. Modi noted that India has long been one of the biggest defence importers in the world and rued that enough attention was not paid to augmenting domestic production in the past despite the country having inherited a capable ecosystem of over 100 years old at the time of Independence. Very few nations had India’s abilities and potential and many countries which started (defence manufacturing) later than India have gone far ahead in the last 50 years, the prime minister said. Referring to a number of economic reforms since his government first came to power in 2014, he also mentioned the recent labour reforms in a number of states. The reform exercise is not going to stop, he said. The work on building defence corridor is also on at a rapid pace in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, he said, while adding that Rs 20,000 crore investment would be made for this in the next five years and a state of the art infrastructure will be developed. To boost domestic manufacturing, licensing process has been reformed, level-playing field created, export system simplified and offset provisions reformed, he said. The focus is now on having a “co-production model” by going for joint ventures with foreign partners, the prime minister said. “Considering India’s market size, the best option for our foreign partners is to manufacture in India,” he said. The government is speeding up the procurement process, and the size of domestic industry is set to increase in coming days, he said. Technological upgradation is necessary for developing self-reliance, he said, adding that research is being encouraged in the government-run DRDO, private sector and also academic institutions. India’s ordnance industry is being corporatised which will be a boost to its workers and also security forces, Modi said. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and three service chiefs also attended the seminar, and the prime minister lauded the “tireless” efforts of his Cabinet colleague who, he added, has been working in a “mission mode” to make the exercise successful. Modi said his government has from the beginning worked with the mantra of “reform, perform and transform” and to remove red-tape and roll out red carpet for industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-best-place-for-defence-manufacturing-pm-modi-tells-foreign-players/story-H4AicVuFvoAL5DxewStQtJ.html

But for the past five months, the Covid-19 pandemic has hit the sector hard.Hundreds of pilgrim-tourist vehicles, which used to be busy on routes for Char Dham, Gangotri, Yamunotri, Badrinath, Kedarnath and other popular spots, are now parked at Bairagi camp Kumbh land and at other vacant plots.Around 15,000 people are directly involved with the travel-tour trade in Haridwar and nearly 8,000 vehicles are involved in this industry.

The UGC had, on July 6, directed universities across the country to hold final year examinations by September 30. It had defended this decision saying that future of students will be jeopardised if examinations are not held.The petitioners have demanded the apex court to consider scrapping online/ offline examinations in view of Covid -19 threat and instead direct UGC to declare results based on the past performance of students and internal assessment. States including Delhi, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh have cancelled university exams including final year exams.The UGC, however, maintained that degree cannot be conferred on graduating students without holding final year examinations and it alone can take a call on whether or not exams should be cancelled. “State governments cannot cancel examinations. That power lies with the UGC,” solicito general Tushar Mehta, appearing on behalf of UGC told the top court on August 8.The ministry of home affairs supported UGC and filed an affidavit before apex court on August 13 stating that it has permitted limited opening of educational institutions across the country for holding final year examinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-pronounce-verdict-tomorrow-whether-final-year-university-exams-can-he-held/story-LGLQgz1gf6jIIsXlye6rvJ.html

Azhar, who founded JeM in 2000 after he was freed from an Indian prison in exchange for 155 passengers of a hijacked aircraft, and his brothers Abdul Rauf Asghar and Ammar Alvi have been named as the primary accused in the charge sheet.“The charge sheet has been filed after investigation of a year and half since the attack took place on 14 February 2019. It has been filed to address the act of terrorism and to bring perpetrators of such a heinous crime to justice. Our aim is not to simply issue statements or notifications. “Jaish e Mohammad had claimed the responsibility of Pulwama attack. The organization and its leadership is in Pakistan. It is regrettable that Masood Azhar, the first accused in the chargesheet, continues to find shelter in Pakistan. Enough evidence has been shared with Pakistan but it continues to evade responsibility,” said ministry of external affairs spokesperson. New Delhi highlighted how Pakistan has still not acted on the dossiers and evidence shared after the 2008 Mumbai attack.Forty Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed in the Pulwama attack that brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war.Officials say that the chargesheet has irrefutable evidence - technical, material and circumstantial - on Pakistan’s role in the attack. It cites the roles of the JeM leadership and the arrested accused in the attack and has details like chats, calls details of terrorists.Pakistan has rejected the chargesheet filed in the Pulwama attack probe, claiming it to be a ‘mischievous attempt’ to implicate Islamabad for the attack. It said that India has failed to provide credible evidence to support its claim and that it is meant to serve ‘narrow and domestic political interests.’“At the outset, Pakistan had rejected India’s baseless allegations and expressed readiness to extend cooperation on the basis of any actionable information. India failed to provide any credible evidence for its invective and has instead been using the attack for its malicious propaganda campaign against Pakistan,” read the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-accused-in-pulwama-chargesheet-still-sheltered-by-pakistan-india/story-POC0TKZMyeCxAjymvlciHK.html

27-08-2020||India||Odisha tribal set to come back home 30 years after he left for work||A 65-year-old tribal of Odisha who had left his home more than three decades ago in search of livelihood would come back to his village in Gajapati district on Friday after a man in Arunachal Pradesh made efforts to unite him with his family through social media.Daya Bhuyan, a Saora tribal of Abasingh village in Gajapati district, left his parents and siblings some 30 years ago after a local contractor took him and three other people for road construction work in Arunachal Pradesh sometime in the late 80s. As per his family members, Bhuyan worked there for sometime, but could not return even as the company wound up its work. Left stranded in Ziro valley of Lower Subansiri district in Arunachal Pradesh for decades, it is still not clear whether Bhuyan made any efforts to come back home or how he spent his years away from home.But his ordeal came to an end after a 32-year-old educational entrepreneur of Arunachal Pradesh started an online campaign to get him back to his home late last month. Rubu Ama, who owns the Royal Blue Pine school in Ziro area of Arunachal Pradesh, used social media to bounce around the details of Bhuyan around the virtual world so that somebody could get his family details for facilitating his return to Odisha.“Though I first met him in 2003, I never asked about his native place. He used to live in a makeshift hut of bamboo and tarpaulin near a hill deep in forest, some 7 km away from the main road and used to sell firewood for survival. He hardly spoke when I first met him,” said Ama over the phone from Ziro.Ama who used to meet Bhuyan everytime he passed by the hillside however did not attach much importance till last year when the latter’s health condition worsened. A concerned Ama asked the taciturn Bhuyan about his family, his home. However, Bhuyan did not reveal his real name and identified himself as Jagpati Karji, using another tribal surname popular in Gajapati district. He gave his father’s name as Duja Karji, mother’s name as Sukumati and elder brother’s name as Monmari Karji and younger brother as Suku Karji. He also gave false names of his parents as well as his other family members. However, he gave the correct name of his village - Abarsingh in Gajapati district.Ama then sent the details of Bhuyan to his driver, an Odia boy, who then put it out in the WhatsApp group of Odia community of Arunachal Pradesh. But it just died among hundreds of forwarded WhatsApp messages.Last month, when the Arunachal man met Bhuyan again, he made a short video clip of his place in the forest and then posted the details in a local WhatsApp group which was picked up by a journalist of Gajapati district who worked for a popular web portal. The reporter met Bhuyan’s brother and after some digging found that Jagapati Karji’s real name was Daya Bhuyan.When Ama learnt about Bhuyan’s real name he again went to meet him at the forest. “I asked him why he did not reveal his real name, but he kept on insisting that his name is Jagapati Karji. He said his mother died when he was very young. When shown the photos and videos sent by the Odisha journalist, at first he could not recognise his younger brother and elder sister. He said he did not know them. But I told him that they are his siblings. After sometime, he again asked me where I got those videos and photos. I told him I got it from his place and asked him to identify his family members by their real names so that I could send him back,” said Ama.But Bhuyan was insistent that he would not go back to his native village. “He was worried about questions from his fellow villagers about coming back without any money despite his long stay in a faraway place. He said he can’t face so many questions. He however said he might think of going there in March next year. But I told him March was too far away and he would be sent when I have more more information. But he was insistent on not going back,” said Ama, who travelled to the hut of Bhuyan on August 8 and brought him to his own home where he again made the tribal man speak to his family through video call.Odisha BJP leader Bhrigu Buxipatra, who also helped Bhuyan get back to Odisha, said when he heard about the news, he called an RSS contact in Arunachal Pradesh, who got in touch with an Odia professor living in Itanagar. But when the professor got Bhuyan to speak to his nephew and brothers through video call, he could not recognise anyone. “He however asked about his elder brother, who is no longer alive. His village people as well as his brother asked him to come back,” said Buxipatra.The Gajapati district administration meanwhile got involved and sent his nephew and a labour official to get him back. On Tuesday, the Lower Subansiri district administration of Arunachal Pradesh handed him over to the Assistant Labour Officer of Gajapati in the presence of Ama and other members who actively took part in the online campaign at Gumto police check gate on the borders of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam. As he did not have any ID card such as Aadhaar, Voter ID or ration card, an identity document was swiftly made for his travel.

Four inmates tested positive on Sunday. The jail has a total of 192 inmates, 68 percent of them have contracted the infection.Barmer’s chief medical and health officer Dr Kamlesh Choudhary said that 130 inmates of the jail are positive for coronavirus disease. He said the screening of inmates started on Monday.“The department collected 190 samples from the jail. We are suspecting that the infection has spread from four prisoners who tested positive on Sunday,” Dr Choudhary said.Also read: Covid-19 ‘Act of God’, may result in contraction of economy - Nirmala SitharamanConsidering the large number of Covid-19 cases, the medical department started a new Covid Care Center in the jail on Wednesday. “Earlier, the four inmates were moved to the care center outside the jail but now we cannot move such a large number of inmates, so we have started a Covid Care Center in the jail itself. It has all the required medical facilities,” said Dr Choudhary.There are total 192 inmates in Barmer district jail, 62 of them are negative for Covid-19. The jail superintendent has written to the prisons department headquarters in Jaipur to move other inmates to Jaisalmer district jail.

The impact of La Nina during the post-monsoon season is just the opposite of what it is during monsoon season. La Nina during the monsoon season is associated with above-average rains. But during the post-monsoon season, if a cyclone develops over the Bay of Bengal, the impact can be very different and severe due to La Nina. So, we have to see,” said DS Pai, senior scientist, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune.M Mohapatra, director-general, IMD, said La Nina is good for the southwest monsoon but it does not have a favourable impact on the northeast monsoon (post-monsoon season). “We may record less rain in the post-monsoon period due to the La Nina effect.” Northeast monsoon brings rain to the Peninsular region during October and November.El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, while La Niña has the opposite impact. In India, for example, El Nino is associated with drought or weak monsoon. La Nina is associated with strong monsoon and above-average rains. Last year was a weak El Nino year and June had recorded extremely arid conditions in different parts of the country and the month ended with a 33% rain deficiency.WMO said below-average sea surface temperatures forecasted in the eastern tropical Pacific are leading to La Niña conditions. Global models and expert opinion indicate a 60% chance of La Niña development during September-November. The probability of ENSO-neutral conditions is 40% and El Niño near 0%.The last La Niña event was in 2017-18. It was short-lived; a weak-to-moderate event that started developing in November 2017 and decayed in April 2018, according to WMO. Tropical Pacific has been in ENSO neutral condition since July and since May sea surface temperatures in the region have been slightly below average, it added.But WMO underlined the warming influence of climate change will not be negated by La Nina. “Even if a La Niña event does develop, its cooling signal will not be enough to counterbalance the impact of human-induced climate change,” said WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas.“2020 remains on track to be one of the warmest years on record, with much extreme weather ranging from scorching temperatures and wildfires to devastating floods and marine heatwaves which is largely the result of greenhouse gases rather than naturally occurring climate drivers,” he said in a statement on Thursday.WMO’s Global Seasonal Climate Update indicates that sea surface temperatures for September to November overall are expected to be above average for much of the globe and this will also influence land surface temperatures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/la-nina-may-develop-between-sept-and-nov-likely-to-hamper-post-monsoon-season-in-india/story-Vxwn7VukBtlUU9QwNIOD3H.html

It was evident at the end of the last meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs that India and China had been unable to bridge their differences on disengaging troops at the LAC.New Delhi had emphasised that there were “outstanding issues” that needed to be resolved speedily at the meeting.Chinese defence ministry’s Wu, however, carried on with Beijing’s narrative, which has glossed over New Delhi’s concerns.On Thursday, Wu said that China and India have agreed to follow the important consensus reached by the leaders of both countries and other relevant agreements.Both countries should continue to “…maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels, further ease and cool down the China-India border situation, properly handle the remaining issues, and jointly safeguard peace and tranquility in the border area.”The spokesperson added that China and India are important neighbours. “Maintaining peace and stability in the border area is not only conducive to both sides’ respective development, but also to regional and world peace and stability,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/look-at-big-picture-of-ties-china-messages-india-amid-running-border-row/story-tr14cvkZnlTlnLmEidadxM.html

DGCA director general Arun Kumar said, “The aircraft operator has to ensure that the In-Flight and Maritime Connectivity (IFMC) services being provided en route are approved by the department of telecommunication and the aircraft has approval from the DGCA.”This comes five months after the central government permitted internet access to passengers through onboard Wi-Fi and issued official notification regarding the same on March 2. Passengers in India have been allowed the use of mobiles and laptops to play games, listen to songs, watch videos or do offline work since 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-releases-draft-rules-for-use-of-wi-fi-on-flights/story-pthRmZ3q94hbSHPTUbv0eL.html
27-08-2020||India||Defence ministry working to announce new air defence command by October: Report||Amid the ongoing conflict with China, the Department of Military Affairs has hastened the process of restructuring the armed forces as the new air defence command under the Indian Air Force (IAF) may come up at Prayagraj around the second week of October this year.“The work has been hastened to prepare the structure of the command under an Air Force officer. Efforts are being made to put everything together and announce the creation of the air defence command at Prayagraj around the Air Force Day on October 8 this year,” government sources told ANI.The air defence command is proposed to be set up alongside the Central Command Headquarters of the IAF which controls important air bases including Agra, Gwalior and Bareilly.The aim of the command is to combine the resources of the three services under one command and activate it to protect the air space of the country.A study in this regard was done by the IAF’s Vice Chief Air Marshal HS Arora which has also suggested the structure of the proposed command comprising assets of all the three services.The Department of Military Affairs under Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat has been given the mandate to create joint military commands along with theatre commands.The CDS is also working on the creation of the combined maritime command which would come up either at Kochi in Kerala or Karwar in Karnataka.Each service has its individual air defence set-up. The air defence command would integrate the air defence assets of the Army, Air Force and Navy and jointly provide air defence cover to the country.The CDS has also made it clear to the armed forces that he would not create any additional post at a three-star level for manning any of the new commands and the new formations would be raised from the existing resources only.Meanwhile, for protecting the air space of the country, a proposal for the acquisition of two new PHALCON Airborne Early Warning ad Control Systems from Israel and Russia has reached the Cabinet Committee on Security and may be taken up for clearance soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-ministry-working-to-announce-new-air-defence-command-by-october-report/story-h5E32GFFhhgKorJuzUZuGO.html

He was speaking at industry chamber Ficci’s annual insurance conference ‘FINCON 2020: India Insurance in the post-Covid World’, that took place virtually.“We must understand that in difficult times, insurance companies have to come to the rescue of the policyholders. It is the changing needs of the customers that we need to assess carefully, and we have to cater to that. I am happy that all of you have collaborated in bringing out these products and we have allowed the pricing (freedom) to the insurance companies.“More than 15 lakh lives have already being covered under these two products within a period of about a month and that shows what is the demand of the customers,” he said.Corona Kavach is a reimbursement-based policy, while Corona Rakshak is a fixed benefit cover against COVID-19. The health insurance providers launched products after the first week of July, in compliance with Irdai’s timeframe.Urging insurers to play a greater role in bad times, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) chairman asked them to be innovative both in terms of products and business operations.He said there is a need for simple and transparent products to cater to the changing needs of the customers, and it will be easier for the distribution channels also to solicit business.Khuntia highlighted that insurance industry operations are anti-cyclical in nature, meaning nobody needs protection in good times but wants to have adequate coverage as soon as emergencies or adverse times come.So there is huge scope for the companies to do business and grow during these times, which will be good both for the public and insurers, he stressed.The Irdai chief also tried to allay concerns raised by some insurers that the business prospects are likely to be dampened this year, saying insurers need to get out of this mindset and stop thinking that they should also float along with others as the economy is down.Khuntia said there is a huge business opportunity from small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as workers would like to ensure protection through group insurance policies, if they are not already covered, as and when they get back to work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-15-lakh-people-covered-under-specialised-covid-19-policies-irdai-chief/story-4ardAwOY7ZS6K4I49PptyI.html

Waghmare had also demanded a declaration of the utilisation of money deposited in the fund.A division bench of the high court, consisting Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Anil Kilor, pronounced its verdict on Thursday morning and dismissed the petition on all the three counts. The bench found no merit in any of the pleas made by Waghmare expressing reservation about the existing mechanism.The petitioner, Waghmare, has appeared in person and sought a proper audit of PM CARE’s fund, the appointment of three trustees as per the scheme of the fund. He also demanded the declaration of money collected so far and its utilization.The PM Cares Fund was formed on March 28 this year in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The petitioner lawyer also claimed to have contributed to it.Also read: Decision on reopening gyms, places of worship likely in September first week - Sanjay Raut“This is not a personal fund of any political party,” he claimed while seeking the appointment of leaders belonging to opposition parties to make the functioning of the fund more transparent and inclusive. Additional Solicitor General of India, Anil Singh had sought the dismissal of the PIL filed by Waghmare and stated that the Supreme Court had already rejected the petition last week with detailed reasons. Singh added that most of the issues agitated in this PIL have been covered by the apex court’s ruling.The Centre strongly opposed the petition and dubbed it as politically motivated while doubting the intentions of the petition. The prime minister is the ex-officio chairman of the trust formed to manage the funds and senior ministers are ex-officio members. About the remaining three trustees, the petitioner had sought the appointment of opposition leaders as trustees. The Centre had made it clear that the prime minister had the discretion to appoint any three eminent persons and such a prayer was not legally tenable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-high-court-rejects-pil-on-pm-cares-fund/story-LgulVX1u3hdlajjYahqcRM.html

Earlier this month, it was reported that five welfare staff working with the Jarawa tribe had tested positive for Covid-19.The group added that poachers were allegedly continuing to enter the territory, risking bringing in the virus, while last week eight fishermen were reportedly arrested for illegally entering the Jarawa’s territory.Sophie Grig, senior researcher with the group, said: “It is extremely alarming that members of the Great Andamanese tribe tested positive for Covid-19. They will be all too aware of the devastating impact of epidemics that have decimated their people”.“The Andaman authorities must act urgently to prevent the virus from reaching more Great Andamanese and to prevent infection in the other tribes. The waters around North Sentinel must be properly policed and no outsiders should enter the territories of any of the Andaman tribes without their consent,” she added.The group said in a release that the Great Andamanese are a small group of just over 50 survivors, down from more than 5000 when the British colonised the islands in the 1850s. They suffer from the long term impacts of diseases introduced by the brutal occupation. Tuberculosis and alcoholism are widespread, making them particularly vulnerable to Covid-19, it added.Also Read: Volunteers given first shots of Oxford Covid-19 vaccine are stable, three more get doses “The Jarawa are a nomadic hunter-gatherer tribe, who have only had friendly contact with settlers neighbouring their territory since 1998. Due to their isolation, relatively recent contact and the impact of two measles epidemics, they are also likely to be especially at risk from the virus”, the group said.It further added that the uncontacted Sentinelese-- the most isolated tribe in the world-- are extremely vulnerable to diseases from outsiders and the risk of them contacting the devastating infection is even greater during the global pandemic.Also Read: Health Ministry advises Covid screening for all TB patients and vice versa“Without proper patrolling of the waters around their island, they are at risk of coming into contact with poachers illegally fishing and diving for lobster,” said the group expressing their apprehensions about possible career of the disease to the protected tribe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/call-to-protect-andaman-tribes-after-5-great-andamanese-turn-covid-19-positive/story-Bj2TXLDVQoTuF3Qmh6gjpJ.html

Due to many reasons we are losing species and many have gone extinct, that has disrupted the eco-system,” he said.Bajpayee further said the impact of this pandemic is “so complex” that it will continue to be analyzed for years to come. He added that climate change and the pandemic are related to anthropogenic activities.“Due to the pandemic, many businesses need to change their models of sustainability and understand that we all need to take ownership of the future,” he said.Speaking at the session, D K Aggarwal, President, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry deliberated upon the improvement in the quality of air and water which he described as the “silver lining of the pandemic”.  “We could see the goodness of nature due to the lockdown and, we can see that nature had taken its course of stabilizing the things,” he said.Talking about business sustainability, he said in today’s times it’s driven towards contribution to the environment and society.“The environment is pivotal, we owe our duty and responsibility towards it to ensure that we do not pollute or damage it. In these times, many companies are investing their fund in Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) companies. We need to give back to the planet, people, and profit to sustain the environment,” he added.J P Gupta, Chairman, Environment Committee, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry said environment is a key driving factor for running industries and there is a need to be considerate towards the environment for sustainability and growth. Under the Paris Agreement, India had pledged to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 30-35 per cent by 2030 and create an additional carbon sink of 2.5-3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent through additional forest cover by 2030.Last month Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar had said that India has achieved reduction of 21 per cent in emission intensity of its GDP between 2005 and 2014, thereby achieving its pre-2020 voluntary target.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/carbon-emissions-for-2020-to-come-down-by-8-due-to-lockdown-environment-ministry/story-hP6IQrYUevX6XwQL5t21jO.html
27-08-2020||India||SC dismisses PIL seeking permission for holding Muharram processions||The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed a public interest litigation seeking permission for taking out Muharram processions, saying a general direction for the entire country in this regard will lead to chaos.“It is not possible to give general directions for the entire country. It will create chaos. That particular community will be targeted for spreading Covid-19... we do not want that,” a three-judge bench headed by the chief justice of India SA Bobde said. The bench said such an order can put the entire community in difficulty and noted that states were also not made parties by the petitioner, Muslim cleric Kalbe Jawad.The petitioner cited the concessions given by the court this month to the Jain community to worship at three of their temples in Mumbai for the last two days of the Paryushan festival. He said a similar relief was also granted by the court for conducting the Rath Yatra in Puri.The bench said in the Jain and Puri cases, they could assess risk as they were happening at a particular place. “You are seeking directions for the entire country.” It added that if the request was made for one place, it could be considered.Jawad’s lawyer, Azim H Laskar, pointed out that a majority of Shia Muslims, who mainly take out Muharram processions to mourn the killing of the Prophet’s grandson Hussain and other members of his family in the battle of Karbala in the seventh century, are concentrated in Lucknow. He said the processions are to be held on Saturday.The bench allowed the petitioner to approach the Allahabad High Court. “We cannot know what are the conditions there [in Lucknow]. You approach the High Court, “ said the bench.Two petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court seeking permission for taking out Muharram processions. Two days ago, the Supreme Court heard a similar plea seeking permission for taking out Muharram processions.The bench, headed by CJI Bobde, directed the petitioner, one Sipte Mohammad from Uttar Pradesh , to include all states in his petition and posted the matter for a hearing after four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-dismisses-pil-seeking-permission-for-holding-muharram-procession/story-p9zemX7ivmSLtDhohXAuNO.html

27-08-2020||India||Covid-19 update: UP health department all set to conduct first sero survey||Uttar Pradesh’s health and family welfare department will conduct its first serological survey, also called sero survey, in the state to determine the prevalence of coronavirus infection among people. The survey will begin from Friday (August 28) across 12 districts of the state.The districts include Bareilly, Meerut, Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Kaushambi, Prayagraj, Moradabad, Ghaziabad, Baghpat and Agra.Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said the state health department, in coordination with King George’s Medical University (KGMU), had decided to carry out the survey.Chief medical officers (CMOs) of these districts were directed to constitute teams to collect samples and send them to laboratories for test, Prasad said. The report of the survey is likely to be released in September, he added. The sero survey also involves testing of blood serum of a group of individuals to determine the presence of antibodies against the Sars-CoV-2 infection.Dr Sudhir Singh, spokesperson for KGMU, said, “Our lab is ready for the sero survey testing. As soon as we start getting the samples, we will start testing.”“KGMU in Lucknow has been chosen by the health department for conducting tests of the samples collected from different districts, including the state capital,” he said.“We have been testing samples for Covid-19 on RT-PCR machines and the lab has been functioning here in the microbiology department since March. The staff is trained and equipment are ready,” Dr Singh said.Also read: As Covid-19 cases cross 24 million globally, a look at 5 much-awaited vaccinesMeanwhile, a separate sero survey is being conducted by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) across seven east and west UP districts, including Balrampur, Gonda, Mau, Unnao, Auraiya, Saharanpur and Gautam Buddh Nagar.An ICMR officer said, “The sero survey by different teams of the premier institute in seven districts of UP is part of the nationwide surveillance. The collection of samples in these districts was completed on August 24 and the samples have been sent to laboratories for test. The data will be released by National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai in mid-September,” he said.Earlier in May, the ICMR had conducted the sero survey in nine district - Amroha, Saharanpur, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bareilly, Balrampur, Mau, Auriaya, Gonda and Unnao. Merely a percent of the population in the nine districts had the evidence of past exposure to Sars-CoV-2.Previously, a sero survey was conducted during the lockdown when strict containment measures were in place to check the spread of the coronavirus infection. The second survey was conducted during the Unlock-3 phase when the central, as well as the state government, relaxed several restrictions, an ICMR officer said.“Several activities have restarted. There is a large intra-state movement of people as well as across the state. The data of Covid-19 infection released by the state government clearly shows that there has been a spike in the infection in the urban hubs of Uttar Pradesh. The second sero survey conducted in Delhi found that 29.1 percent of the population has developed antibodies against Covid -19,” the officer added.Also read: Health Ministry advises Covid screening for all TB patients and vice versa“The second sero survey conducted by the ICMR in UP will give a clear picture of the spread of infection in UP,” the officer added.A state health department official said while the ICMR was conducting the survey in the districts with a large rural population, the state health department was carrying out the survey in urban hubs of UP where the maximum spread of the infection was being reported.“The sero surveys by the ICMR and the UP government will give an insight into the extent of Covid-19 infection. The state government can amend its containment plan accordingly,” he said.It will be the first serological survey in Prayagraj and Kaushmabi districts covering 45 locations each, including randomly selected villages and municipal corporation wards under various local bodies and development blocks in these two districts. The exercise is aimed at testing a random section of the population for antibodies against the virus that causes the Covid-19 disease.The officials plan to collect around 1,500 samples from each of the two districts during the survey. The 45 different villages/wards in Prayagraj have an overall population of around 24,986 persons, while those in Kaushambi have a population of around 16,076 as per the 2011 census.The health department is likely to launch a sero survey of 3,240 people in Meerut, Baghpat and Ghaziabad districts of western Uttar Pradesh on Friday, the officials said.Divisional surveillance officer Dr Ashok Taliyan explained the survey would help in knowing how many people had developed antibodies to the Sars-Cov-2 pathogen. He said the authorities in Lucknow had sent a list of 45 areas in each district selected for the survey. These areas have been divided into four parts. The survey would focus on six houses (families) in each part. Samples of 24 people (ageing between 19 to 59 years) would be collected from each part. A total of 1,080 samples would be collected in each district and the total number of samples for the three districts would be 3,240 samples.In Meerut division, thirty-three teams of medical officers and other staff have been constituted for the survey in the three districts. Thirteen teams in Meerut and ten teams each in Bagpat and Ghaziabad have been constituted for the survey.Dr Taliyan said the number of teams was likely to go up in Ghaziabad because it was a bigger district. Each team will comprise a medical officer, a lab technician, a lab assistant, an ANM (auxiliary nurse midwife) and Asha worker (accredited social health activist) of the area.These three districts have so far reported 11,689 Covid-19 cases and 193 deaths. There are 1,888 active cases now. Baghpat has reported 828 Covid-19 cases and 16 deaths, Meerut has 3,464 cases and 110 deaths while Ghaziabad has reported 7,397 positive cases and 67 fatalities.In Agra, 40 members, including 10 doctors, are being selected for the survey. Ten teams having four members each will be assigned the task. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr RC Pandey said, each team will have a doctor, a lab technician, an Asha (accredited social health activist) worker and an ANM (auxiliary nurse midwife).”“These 40 members would be trained by ICMR representatives after they reach Agra. The survey would be conducted as per the guidelines laid down by the ICMR,” Dr Pandey said. According to him, there are 45 locations which the team would visit for the survey in both rural and urban areas.Varanasi is also geared up for sero survey. Ten teams have been constituted for the survey here, chief medical officer Dr VB Singh said.The sero survey is part of a larger statewide exercise. It is expected to begin on August 28 to assess the extent of spread of the coronavirus infection among the population of the district. It will also gauge the percentage of the population that has developed antibodies against the disease.Blood samples of the people in the age bracket of 18 and 59 years will be taken from various localities that will be randomly selected by the health teams. These teams will collect 240 samples from 10 different areas of the district and send them to Lucknow for examination.Dr Singh said preparations for the survey had been completed. The travel history, occupation and age of people whose blood samples will be taken will also be recorded during the survey.The findings from the survey would help develop plans for prevention of Covid-19 and its spread across the state. Blood samples of 24 people from six houses — four persons each from a house — will be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-up-health-department-all-set-to-conduct-first-sero-survey/story-L4AAHmhJpOeomVqRrSwrzH.html

The case pertained to a trademark dispute, not related to the merits of branding or the efficacy of the formulation of products marketed under the brand name ‘Coronil’.A bench headed by Chief Justice of India, SA Bobde declined to interfere with an interim order passed by a division bench of Madras High Court which had, on August 14, granted relief to Patanjali by staying an earlier order of a single judge of the high court. The single judge had, on August 6, restrained Patanjali from using the trademark ‘Coronil’ and also slapped a fine of Rs 10 lakh on it in a trademark infringement suit filed by a private firm, Arudra Engineers Private Limited.“In these Covid times, if we prevent the use of word Coronil, it will be terrible for the product (of Patanjali),” CJI Bobde remarked when the appeal filed by Arudra challenging the interim order of division bench came up for hearing on Thursday.Also read: Patanjali will step in if no other Indian company bids for IPL title, says RamdevThe top court dismissed Arudra’s plea and asked the firm to pursue the matter before the division bench of the high court. The division bench is slated to hear the matter in September. Arudra has claimed that the trademark ‘Coronil’ is owned by them since 1993 for its product used for industrial cleaning and chemical preparations. The single judge, while allowing Arudra’s plea, had noted that Patanjali exploited the public’s fear and panic by projecting and advertising it’s Coronil products as a cure for Covid-19. “The defendants (Patanjali) have repeatedly projected that they are a 10,000 crores company. However, they are still chasing further profits by exploiting the fear and panic among the general public by projecting a cure for the coronavirus, when actually their ‘Coronil Tablet’ is not a cure but rather an immunity booster for cough, cold and fever,” the single judge had noted while imposing fine of Rs. 10 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-favours-patanjali-in-trademark-dispute-refuses-to-restrain-it-from-using-coronil/story-j4Ad4SW3L29bnzBkNzCoNI.html
27-08-2020||India||Assam natural gas well continues to blaze, 3 months since blowout||It’s been three months since a natural gas well operated by Oil India Limited (OIL) at Baghjan in Tinsukia district of Assam had a blowout and caught fire two weeks later. But efforts to douse the flame have failed till date. Also read: At Baghjan OIL blowout site, endangered species at risk, says reportOn August 17, foreign experts engaged by OIL were able to cap the well by placing a blow out preventer (BOP) stack over the well head. But the problem surfaced two days later when attempts were made to douse the fire by ‘killing the well’. To kill a well, a “kill fluid”, sludge-like specially prepared mud, is injected into the well slowly to push the gas from it back to the reservoir. The well at Baghjan is around 3.5 km deep and the operation to douse the fire was expected to be over within the next 36 hours. But the operation had to be suspended on August 19 following rupture of a casing valve. The setback has forced the experts to plug all technical glitches before making another attempt to douse the fire. “Work is underway at the well site and we are looking at another killing attempt in the next few days. Before that, the experts are doing some additional cementing work to strengthen the annulus (gaps between casing pipes),” said OIL spokesperson Tridiv Hazarika on Thursday. “We have completed nearly 70% of that work. We should be able to make another attempt at killing the well in another 2-3 days. If things go as per plans, the entire operation could be over in one week,” he added. With the first attempt to douse the fire failing, Hazarika said that OIL is also looking at other more time consuming options like cutting the entire damaged portion of the casing pipes and replacing them with new ones or to dig up a relief well, which is used to intercept and kill a blowout well. “Since we have already placed the BOP, we are also considering producing gas from the well partially. If we are able to do that, then the killing operation will be slightly easier because the pressure of the gas will be reduced,” he said. The blowout _ uncontrolled release of gas or oil _ during an operation to locate a new gas reservoir happened on May 27. On June 9, the well caught fire, killing two firefighters, destroyed over a dozen nearby houses and displaced thousands of residents from nearby areas. Initially, OIL had said it would take a month to cap the well and douse the fire. Later, the deadline was extended to July 7. But floods and technical issues kept adding to the delay while thousands of residents continue to remain affected. At present, two relief camps are in operation where around 3,600 persons from areas close to the well are taking shelter. According to OIL, around 2,700 families have been surveyed till date for compensation. “The loud noise from the well, which started on May 27, still continues to affect residents. Mild vibrations are occurring once in a while. Till date, no one from OIL has approached us to take stock of damages suffered due to the blowout and fire,” said Hiren Senapoti, a resident of Natun Rongagora village. Since the Baghjan well is located close to Dibru Saikhowa National Park and the ecologically sensitive Maguri Motapung Wetland, there were fears of environmental damage to the area. Studies by different agencies had been commissioned to measure extent of damage. In June, National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered formation of an expert committee to probe the blowout and subsequent fire and assess the damage caused to human life, wildlife and environment because of it. “Maguri Motapung Wetland is an important roosting site for many migratory birds. We were expecting the blowout to be capped and the fire doused within a month, but with the delay, it might affect their arrival,” said Deborshee Gogoi, assistant professor at Digboi College and wildlife cartoonist and bird enthusiast. “The migratory birds start arriving at Maguri Motapung from September. But this year, they might not come due to the noise from the blowout and also because of damage to the wetland as a result of oil condensate getting mixed with in the water bodies of the area,” he added. According to OIL estimates, around 1 lakh standard cubic meter (SCM) of gas has got released daily from the well __ that’s nearly 90 lakh SCM of gas since the blowout. The Baghjan incident has affected production in other nearby oil and gas wells leading to losses of around Rs 40 cr.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-natural-gas-well-continues-to-blaze-3-months-since-blowout/story-TCFj0M9lwUsLRUCJxXGkAO.html

Prasada, a former union minister, was among the signatories to the letter that sought an active and full-time party president. Prasad is also a special invitee to the CWC.“Unfortunate that Jitin Prasada is being officially targeted in UP.Congress needs to target the BJP with surgical strikes instead of wasting its energy by targeting its own,” Sibal said on Twitter. Reacting to it, another Congress leader, Manish Tewari who was also a signatory to the letter, posted a single word “Prescient” on Twitter.   The Lakhimpur Kheri District Congress reportedly passed a resolution demanding action against Prasad, a leader from Uttar Pradesh, and has accused his family of being against the Gandhi family. Jitender Prasad, the father of Jitin Prasada, had also unsuccessfully contested for the post of Congress president against Sonia Gandhi in the past, the DCC reportedly said.The charge comes three days after the Congress Working Committee urged Sonia Gandhi to continue as party president and bring about organisational changes. The CWC was convened to discuss the leadership issue and the letter written by over 20 leaders on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unfortunate-that-jitin-prasad-is-being-targeted-in-up-tweets-kapil-sibal/story-Tw5SkpaoTrhN1Bxb34UINO.html

27-08-2020||India||Congress seniors demoralised Rahul Gandhi more than Modi-Shah, BJP: Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena took on the 23 senior Congress leaders, who wrote to party chief Sonia Gandhi demanding a “full time and effective leadership” in an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana on Thursday. It questioned the leaders’ support over the past six years when Rahul Gandhi faced scathing attacks from the Bharatiya Janata Party, and said that they were more responsible for demoralising him than the BJP leaders.The editorial remarked that none of signatories of the letter were mass leaders, questioning their ability to become active leaders within their own party. The signatories of the said letter include Ghulam Nabi Azad, Kapil Sibal, Anand Sharma, Shashi Tharoor, Mukul Wasnik, Prithviraj Chavan, among others.Also Read: 7 hours of fireworks at CWC“Rahul Gandhi was active and he singlehandedly took on the Modi-Shah duo. He led a change in the country in the Assembly elections. Where were these active letter-writing champions when the BJP attacked him below the belt? The old Congress leaders have demoralised Rahul Gandhi more than the below-the-belt attacks of the BJP under Modi-Shah,” the editorial read. The Sena had earlier backed the leadership of Rahul Gandhi. Sena leader Sanjay Raut had said that the Gandhi family was the “Aadhaar card of the Congress” and the demand for a non-Gandhi to lead the party was inappropriate. Attacking the signatories of the letter, the Sena also said that none of them had the ability to stir a crisis within the party. “Those who have written the letter are reaching the age of 70. And none of them is a mass leader even at a district-level, let alone country- or state-level. Despie that, most of them have enjoyed chief ministirial posts, Union ministership, and several other important posts. P Chidambaram is a noted lawyer, when did he become a leader... What do we say about Prithviraj Chavan and Milind Deora? Prithviraj Chavan had to seek thehelp of Sharad Pawar to win an election in Satara. It is laughable that such people have sought active leadership in the Congress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-seniors-demoralised-rahul-gandhi-more-than-modi-shah-bjp-shiv-sena/story-tVGqE01U3D8DDIV96G3GJJ.html

27-08-2020||India||UP cops begin probe after Cong MLA’s grandmother accuses her of harassment||Uttar Pradesh police have started a probe after Congress lawmaker from Rae Bareli Aditi Singh’s grandmother Kamla Singh lodged a complaint accusing the MLA of harassing her over a property issue.Rae Bareli’s superintendent of police Swapnil Mamgain has tasked additional SP Nityanand Rai to probe the octogenarian’s charge against her granddaughter. “The complaint (against the MLA) was received by Rae Bareli city Kotwali police on August 10. It is over property dispute and harassment. An additional SP has been asked to probe the allegations. But so far neither the complainant nor any of her family or associates have turned up to record their statements,” Mamgain said on Thursday. No FIR has been registered in this regard so far, the police said. In her complaint to the police, 85-year-old Kamla Singh, who lives in Lalupur Chauhan village of Maharajganj, has accused Aditi and some other relatives of barging into her house on December 30, 2019 and threatening her with dire consequences if she did not transfer her property in their name.While the Congress MLA did not respond to calls, sources close to her said she did not want to speak as it was a family matter. All attempts to talk to the octogenarian have been unsuccessful so far, they said.“She would rather avoid talking about it in the media. It’s a family matter and she would rather prefer not to go public on this subject,” the source said.However, Uttar Pradesh unit of the Congress, upset with Aditi Singh for ‘edging closer’ to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), alleged that Aditi was affected by ‘BJP culture’. “Now that Aditi Singh is in BJP, she would obviously show some signs of them. Respecting elders isn’t taught in the BJP,” the Congress tweeted. Hitting back, UP BJP secretary Chandramohan said, “It’s shameful and disgusting that the Congress is choosing to turn a family matter into a political one. Which party Aditi ji belongs to is immaterial. She is a woman and an MLA and the matter is personal. It seems the Congress has lost all morality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-cops-begin-probe-after-cong-mla-s-grandmother-accuses-her-of-harassment/story-SFupvFH4HSM6aSwPA1JR0L.html

They have taught kids about the importance of social distancing, hand sanitisation and wearing masks during the pandemic. Similarly, two brothers, Atharv Khubele (13) and Advik Khubele (8) felt the need of doing something for migrants who lost their jobs during the lockdown. The humanitarian crisis impacted the two siblings who came out with the idea of ‘punarsthapan’. Atharv, a student of Seth Anandram Jaipuria Lucknow, acted as a bridge between job seekers and providers. The duo convinced their father, Avichal Khubele, who is part of Indian Industries Association (IIA), to help them find jobs for migrants based on their skills. The family roped in a software expert who designed an interface that acted as a bridge between job providers (industry) and job seekers (labourers). Sriket Srivastava (18) was the head boy at St Anjani’s Public School, Rajajipuram, batch of 2020. He is a Maths genius and has won several accolades. During March and April, when his class 12 board exams got cancelled, he was flooded with requests by poor children, relatives and friends to help them with the subject that is dreaded by most.“Tired of telling everyone the same thing over and over again, I came up with the idea of creating a YouTube channel to create tutorials. It was high in demand and spread like wildfire,” he said.Saarth Shah, a student of class 12 at City Montessori School, Gomtinagar campus 1, was so moved by the plight of domestic helps and migrants who lost their jobs during the pandemic that he took it upon himself to ensure two square meals for them.He built a database of around 500 such workers who had lost their jobs and built a website. The website had the phone numbers of the needy. He advertised his website through his social media handles like Facebook and Whatsapp. Gradually, his efforts started bearing fruits when people started employing these workers. Son of a chartered accountant, Saarth said he does not expect anything for himself through this activity.“The greatest joy and reward comes to him when these workers thank him for helping them regain employment.”Principal of CMS Gomti Nagar Campus 1, Abha Anant, was overjoyed to learn about this philanthropic activity of her student and said Saarth was very insightful and hardworking who has imbibed the values of service to humanity from his school and his parents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-pandemic-these-youngsters-win-hearts-with-their-acts-of-kindness/story-l3ZEloiPhlX9XJuP2jiY5K.html

Officials have summoned Indrajeet with the locker keys, said ED sources. The agency had, on July 31, registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) in the case after a First Information Report (FIR) was filed by KK Singh, the late actor’s father, against actor Rhea Chakraborty, in Bihar on July 28. Earlier on August 10, ED had questioned Chakraborty, her father and her brother Showik. Later, her manager Shruti Modi and Sushant Rajput’s friend and roommate Siddharth Pithani too were questioned. Investigators had extracted information into the formation of four companies by Rajput and Chakraborty, and her family. Two of these companies were registered while the other two were under the process of getting registered. Investigators wanted to understand the terms mentioned in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed during the formation of these companies to understand how the profit sharing was designed. ED sources said Rhea had responded to all the questions asked but could not divulge details of the exact sequence of events. ED has also questioned Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda, Chakraborty’s chartered accountant Ritesh Shah, and Rajput’s chartered accountant Sandeep Sridhar in the case. Rajput was found dead in his Mumbai apartment on June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-ed-summons-rhea-chakraborty-s-father/story-rCbdGkQKfAz8eJJHQV6hiI.html
27-08-2020||India||Pension a post-retirement entitlement to maintain dignity of the employee: Supreme Court||Pension is succour for post-retirement period and it is not a bounty payable at will, but a social welfare measure as a post-retirement entitlement to maintain the dignity of the employee, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said.The top court said that pension facilitates a retired Government employee to live with dignity in his winter of life and, thus, such benefit should not be unreasonably denied to an employee, more so on technicalities.Coming to the rescue of a man claiming his entitlement for the past 13-years despite having worked with government departments for 32 years, a bench headed by Justices S K Kaul ordered the Kerala government to include the period of service rendered by him as casual workers for determining his pensionary benefits. Also read: No extension to Chandigarh admn staffers after age of 58“Pension is succour for post-retirement period. It is not a bounty payable at will, but a social welfare measure as a post-retirement entitlement to maintain the dignity of the employee. The appellant has been claiming his entitlement for the last almost 13 years but unsuccessfully, despite having worked with Government departments in various capacities for about 32 years,” the bench said.It said “the benefit of the service rendered as a Casual Labour Roll (CLR) worker would, thus, be liable to be counted for determining the pensionary benefits of the appellant at par with other CLR workers and the pension be accordingly calculated”.The bench also comprising Justices Ajay Rastogi and Aniruddha Bose said that the arrears of pension be remitted to the appellant within a maximum period of eight weeks from today with admissible interest as applicable to outstanding pension amounts.The bench settled the dispute which remained pending in the top court for nearly a decade since 2010 while emphasising that the pensionary provisions must be given a liberal construction as a social welfare measure.Also read: More than 50% elderly face abuse, says survey“This does not imply that something can be given contrary to rules, but the very basis for grant of such pension must be kept in mind, i.e., to facilitate a retired Government employee to live with dignity in his winter of life and, thus, such benefit should not be unreasonably denied to an employee, more so on technicalities,” the bench said.The controversy arose as former Kerala government employee V Sukumaran, worked in two departments in different capacities after joining the service as a casual worker in 1976.Sukumaran worked for around seven years till 1983 as a casual worker in the fisheries department and later joined the revenue department as lower division clerk after participating in a direct recruitment process. After serving in the revenue department for a few years he sought an inter-departmental transfer back to the fisheries department and returned to Thiruvananthapuram and joined on September 18, 1987 on probation of two years with the service being subsequently regularised on September 18, 1989.He superannuated as Upper Division Clerk on attaining the age of superannuation on December 31, 2008 after serving the total service of about 25 years, excluding the initial service rendered as casual worker.In 2006, Sukumaran made a representation to the Assistant Director of the Fisheries Department for passing orders to treat his period of casual worker service of more than seven years as qualifying service for pension.However, the State Government did not accept the recommendation of the Fisheries Department and rejected the representation of Sukumaran in 2007 saying the benefit could not be extended to him as Kerala Public Service Commission (KPSC) in the revenue department. He approached the High Court in 2009, which rejected his petition on the ground that he was appointed by KPSC and his period as casual worker could not be counted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pension-a-post-retirement-entitlement-to-maintain-dignity-of-the-employee-supreme-court/story-9TE2J1knDZQFYVTOr9b7qO.html
27-08-2020||India||Launch criminal enquiry into BJP-Facebook nexus, says CPI(M)||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has joined four other opposition parties in Parliament in demanding an explanation from Facebook over reports of alleged bias while censoring hate speech by members of the ruling party. CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury told Hindustan Times that the party will take up the issue in Parliament. The party also has one member in the Information Technology parliamentary panel, which has asked Facebook to offer an explanation on September 2. Hindustan Times, on August 22, had reported that members of the DMK, TRS, TMC and Congress wanted Facebook to explain the role of its India policy head Ankhi Das for alleged violations of the social media company’s hate speech policy. Also Read: Why Facebook is wrong, yet again |OpinionThe IT panel’s request for an explanation had drawn severe criticism from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, with its MP Nishikant Dubey writing to the Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla to seek the dismissal of panel chair Shashi Tharoor for ‘misusing his position’. On Wednesday, Dubey also asked the chair to cancel the meeting on the Jammu and Kashmir Internet shutdowns as it is in contravention with the Speaker’s advisory that says the panel cannot take up matters pending in front of courts. Also Read: Delhi assembly panel to probe Facebook ‘inaction’ on hate speech, bias chargesAccording to Yechury, the Facebook controversy has ‘far-reaching implications on the country’s right to unbiased information’. “How can a social media platform so blatantly violate the right of citizens to access information free from bias,” Yechury said. The party’s IT panel member may also write to the Speaker raising these issues. Yechury, however, declined to comment on that since the proceedings of the panel are confidential. But according to leaders in the CPI(M), the main issues that the party is slated to flag are the role of social media companies such as Facebook and WhatsApp in a democratic country, the selective takedown of content and the impact on the integrity of elections. “How can the business prospects of a company supersede democracy,” said Yechury. “The way Facebook has tried to influence voters in favour of the BJP is an interference in the Indian electoral process by a foreign corporate house.” “We need to launch a criminal investigation to establish the exact nature of the relationship between Facebook and the BJP. Until the inquiry is completed, the social media network should be banned from working in close cooperation with any of the government’s bodies,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/launch-criminal-enquiry-into-bjp-facebook-nexus-says-cpi-m/story-N7pILpTsC8hixaVq5z5z2L.html

He added Kipgen was not re-elected as per the procedure laid down in the party’s constitution.“Former president of NPP Manipur state unit Thangminlien Kipgen acted against the constitution of the party by going ahead with the election and announcing the election,’’ he said. Sangma said this was done even as a show-cause notice was issued and Kipgen was told not to go ahead with the elections as it was not as per the party’s constitution. “Therefore, I, as a president of NPP, decided that they will be expelled from the party.”Sangma said Kipgen and NPP members, who worked to hold this election illegally, have been expelled from the NPP. “In order to ensure that the [party’s Manipur] office continues, we appointed N Kayisii, who is also the tribal affairs minister in the state of Manipur, as the interim president.”He said an election to choose the party’s office-bearers in Manipur will be held shortly in line with the procedure that its constitution lays down.Kipgen said there can be no interim NPP president as per the party’s constitution. He added an elected president cannot be removed by a mere letter as it is unconstitutional.Kipgen was felicitated at a function at the party in Imphal after his re-election.Ch Ajang Khongsai, the working president of the party’s state unit who was present during the felicitation function, said Sangma has been misled. He added Sangma seems to have no clue that Kipgen’s term was due to end on August 26 and not in April.NPP’s four legislators are ministers in the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in Manipur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/npp-expels-newly-elected-state-president-in-manipur/story-T2Tf52FX5qHBv6Ow8APLPP.html
27-08-2020||India||Parliament monsoon session to see Congress oppose farm ordinances||The Congress, the principal Opposition party, is all set to oppose at least four ordinances, including three on farms, when the government tries to replace them in the upcoming monsoon session of Parliament that starts from September 14.Also read: Sonia forms panel to prepare party agenda on government ordinancesThe Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020; The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020; and The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, will face a stiff opposition from the Congress in both Houses of Parliament. The party has also found faults with The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020. The amendments in the farm-related laws were rolled out through promulgation of ordinances in June to help farmers following the unprecedented raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. They were hailed as far-reaching steps to unshackle the country’s farm sector, as the Centre changed the six-decade-old Essential Commodities Act (ESA), 1955, and moved the other two ordinances to remove all restrictions on farm trade while guaranteeing a legal framework for pre-agreed prices to farmers. But the Congress is unimpressed, especially because its governments in Punjab and Haryana have raised major objections to these changes. Congress leaders claimed that these states have started facing farmer protests against the new laws. On Wednesday late evening, the Congress announced a five-member panel to “discuss and formulate the party’s stands on key ordinances promulgated by the Central government”. Some party leaders maintain that the move would help corporate buyers of crops and erode the safety net of the minimum support price (MSP) and other measures to safeguard farmers’ interests. The experts had widely hailed the dilution of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMCC) Act, 2003, because of the more selling power to a farmer and empowering him to bypass the restrictions imposed by local mandis. But the Congress has armed itself with data to show that more than 50% of different kinds of farm produce such as wheat, paddy, maize, mustard, bajra, cotton, soybean, jowar, potato, sugarcane, groundnut and even coconut are sold to local private traders and not at designated mandis. Some Congress leaders also underlined the fact that traditional mandis would continue to charge fees, but trade zones specified under these ordinances would not levy any transaction fee, and as a result, would hurt farmers’ interests. Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Hooda had already written a newspaper article citing the glaring lapses in these ordinances. “We are also studying the Bihar experiment, when the APMCC Act, 2003, was removed in 2006. But the move did not benefit farmers, as they were forced to sell produce below MSP rates,” said a Congress leader. Another senior Congress leader said that amendments to The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, would encourage hoarding and consumers would be the worst affected..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-monsoon-session-to-see-congress-oppose-farm-ordinances/story-jmpO0QJO5fCXQ53JIn7IbO.html

The state is, though, likely to remove restrictions on interstate travel, sources said.Also read: Opening schools during pandemic could worsen crisis, says CMThe government is not looking at resuming “as yet” the Metro and monorail services,which have been shut since March, said a state official.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Wednesday, “People might think that we are progressing slowly but there is no gain in hurrying up (when it comes to unlocking activities). We should ensure that we don’t have to revoke our steps once we have resumed activities.” However, shut Metro services mean huge losses. Sources from the Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd (MMOPL), which runs the Mumbai Metro-1 corridor, said the company is facing losses to the tune of Rs 80 lakh to Rs 1 crore a day.Maharashtra is likely to issue a notification this week to remove some more restrictions as the extended lockdown period ends on August 31. It might also allow more workforce in offices but it is unlikely to take any decision regarding reopening of schools, cinema halls, restaurants and religious places.A traders’ body has also written to Thackeray to allow people working in kirana stores/medical shops/other essential services to travel by the suburban train. The suburban local is currently open for essential staff only and the administration is apprehensive of a spike in Covid-19 cases, if the service is opened for all.“With no locals, there are long queues at bus-stops and crowding in buses, where no social distancing is being maintained. People working in these stores must also be treated at par with the government and medical staff,” said Viren Shah, president of the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association.On Wednesday, Maharashtra recorded its highest single-day jump with 14,888 new Covid-19 cases, taking the total number of cases in the state to 718,711. The active cases in the state stood at 172,873.It also recorded 295 fatalities, taking the toll to 23,089 till date. Of the fatalities on Wednesday, 211 were from the previous 48 hours and 58 were from last week. The remaining 26 deaths were from the period before last week.

27-08-2020||India||By December, 45 airports to use global navigation satellite system for safe landing in poor visibility||The Airports Authority of India (AAI) plans to equip 24 more airports by the end of this year with the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), whose approach procedures enable flights to land at airports despite poor visibility due to heavy rain or fog. As many as 45 Indian airports will now have approach procedures that use the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) which enable flights to land at airports despite poor visibility.Over the last eight months, 21 Indian airports have been equipped with GNSS, aviation officials said.Installing GNSS is part of a global plan by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to make landings more efficient during adverse weather. India started implementing the plan two years ago, aviation officials said.The approach procedure, known as Required Navigation Performance (RNP), will help Indian airports without an Instrument Landing System (ILS, a system that allows pilots to land at an airport when there is low visibility) and those where ILS is dysfunctional because of weather conditions like floods. In Maharashtra, Mumbai, Shirdi, Aurangabad and Kolhapur airports are equipped with this technology. Other Indian airports include Kozhikode, Jabalpur, Indore, Begumpet (Hyderabad), Kolkata, Hubli, Jaipur, Khajuraho, Kannur, Belgaum and Varanasi.A former Directorate General of Civil Aviation official said, “It is good to see India taking steps to harness GNSS technology for designing these RNP approaches that make runways accessible in a safe and efficient manner. This is the future of aviation, as most of the expensive ground-based technology will be replaced by cost-effective space-based technology.”RNP procedures are expected to not only reduce delay in arrivals due to poor weather conditions but also increase the accessibility of airports as fewer flights are expected to be diverted. For instance, when Mumbai came to a standstill during the floods in July 2005, no ground-based navigation equipment was available for operations, due to which pilots had to land aircraft using a visual approach at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA). A senior AAI official said, “For safe landings, aircraft traditionally use ground-based technology like ILS or other navigational aids like VOR (Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range). However, to install and maintain such equipment at every airport is a costly affair and may not be feasible.”A Delhi-based AAI official said, “With the recent advancement in technology like aircraft electronics systems (avionics) as well as GNSS, aircraft can navigate using satellites. It is now possible to design an aircraft approach (towards landing) procedure based on this GNSS, which allows the aircraft to operate even in moderately low visibility conditions (as low as 1,500-2,000m) which is not possible with both VOR and during visible approach.” AAI officials said that this harnessing of technology is most useful for airports that do not have ILS. Now when ILS is not available, the runway can be accessed in low visibility conditions using the GNSS. A Mumbai airport official said, “During the traditional approach (landing) of an aircraft, the minimum visibility required is as high as around 2,400m. Currently, the technology has been made available for Runway 9. It will be made available for Runway 14 on September 10 and for the primary Runway 27, it will be made available in October this year wherein flights will be able to land in visibility as low as 1,500m.”A Shirdi Airport official said that Shirdi Airport is one of the best examples of being benefited with this system. “Flights from Shirdi airport frequently used to get diverted during poor weather, as the minimum visibility required for an aircraft to land was 5km. However, with implementing this technology, the airport will see lesser flight diversions leading to doubling accessibility of the airport.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/by-december-45-airports-to-have-global-navigation-satellite-system-for-safe-landing-in-poor-visibility/story-DsKlGsUpK7Hti3dRKvQckM.html

27-08-2020||India||Will UP face complete Covid-19 lockdown again? Here’s what state govt said||The Uttar Pradesh government has rubbished reports of further lockdown for a fortnight due to recent spike in Covid-19 cases across the state.“The news doing rounds on social media about a possible lockdown is untrue,” Additional Chief Secretary (Information) Awanish Kumar Awasthi said in a statement on Wednesday.The government clarification came after an Allahabad High Court remark asking why it could not go for a fortnight-long lockdown in view of the increase in the number of coronavirus positive cases. Taking a serious note of the spurt in Covid-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh, the court observed that the measures being taken to curb the spread are not sufficient.On Tuesday, a division bench of the high court, comprising Justices Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar, had asked the state government whether it was ready for a fortnight-long lockdown in view of the spike in Covid-19 cases.“We do not doubt government’s will but we are equally conscious that measures being taken are not enough and needed to be made more severe and stringent but of course, workable too at the same time,” the bench observed.While issuing various directions to the state government, the bench, in one of its observations, also said, “When we have to balance between bread and butter and life, the latter has to prevail.”“Food is for life to survive and not vice-versa. We do not think that a lockdown for a fortnight would bring the economy of the state to such a halt that people would die of hunger,” the bench observed, apparently suggesting the government to impose another lockdown for a fortnight.The bench directed Uttar Pradesh chief secretary to tell it if there was any plan of action to contain the infection when the economy was reopened after the nationwide lockdown and if it was ever implemented.The court also asked the chief secretary if any action had been taken against district authorities who had not followed the plans, if there was any.The bench was hearing a public interest lawsuit seeking better facilities at quarantine centres.It also asked the chief secretary to come up with a road map to tackle the spread of infection from now onwards by the next date of hearing.After giving its directions to the government, the bench slated the matter for next hearing on August 28.The court on several occasions during the hearing of the matter in past too had issued various directions to the government to check the spread of coronavirus in the state.

The Centre has been selling PSUs one by one right from Kerala to Jammu and Kashmir.”“During former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s government at the Centre, state-run Balco in Korba district was sold. A steel plant (of NMDC) is under construction at Nagarnar in Bastar district. While the plant is yet to be ready for commissioning, it has been put on the privatization list,” the CM said.Talking about the new education policy of the central government, Baghel said it is harmful for the states and also expressed his disagreement on the new environmental law for the establishment of industries.Baghel also criticised the Centre for not paying Chhattisgargh its share of GST.“There was talk of giving GST compensation to the productive states by 2022. For the last four months, no state has been given a single paisa of compensation, while depending on the need, GST compensation should be given till 2027. Chhattisgarh should have got Rs 2,828 crore under GST compensation, which has not been received.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/must-fight-collectively-to-protect-federal-structure-chhattisgarh-cm/story-xXb9kfYeunfjlZ8P9upnjK.html

The leaders of these mainstream political parties had signed the Gupkar declaration last year on August 4, a day before Article 370 was revoked by the parliament and the erstwhile state was divided into two UT’s.On the other hand, an important two-day meeting of Altaf Bukhari’s newly launched Apni Party is also underway and is expected to take a stand on the Gupkar declaration. The meeting started on Wednesday afternoon.Also Read: Kashmir leaders resolve to fight for restoration of Article 370 and J-K statehoodSources in the know of the agenda of Ram Madhav’s visit said that BJP general secretary will arrive in Srinagar in the afternoon and chair a meeting of party leaders to discuss current political situation and issues regarding Jammu and Kashmir.The issue of security of BJP leaders is also likely to come up in the meeting with Madhav. In the last two months, five prominent BJP leaders were killed by militants in different parts of Kashmir.“Our leaders are on target of the militants, so the issue related to the security of BJP leaders and panchayat members will be taken up with BJP general secretary,” said BJP state spokesman Altaf Thakur.

Neha Shukla applied to the ‘Girls With Impact’ programme in the United States that teaches entrepreneurial skills to young girls.The push for Shukla was the rapid spread of the disease and that fact that people could lose their lives because of a careless mistake, of not social distancing correctly.Watch: Indian-origin girl’s ‘SixFeetApart’ alarm wows US in Covid times “I wanted to do something about it and I set out to create a social distancing device that utilises ultrasonic sensors and microprocessors to detect when a person crosses that six-feet detection range and alert the user through vibrating and beeping,” she told Hindustan Times.With her interest in engineering and technology, Shukla began working on the device that would keep people six feet apart. And to make it useful, the 15-year-old chose a cap.The cap beeps and vibrates when someone breaches the six-feet perimetre.“It’s a microprocessor based device that’s embedded in a hat. Whenever somebody crosses that six feet range, the programme and the microprocessor are alerted,” explains Shukla while describing her device.She adds, “On the inside, there’s an ultrasonic sensor, a microprocessor, a buzzer and a nine-volt battery. I coded a programme that causes these ultrasonic sensors to send out these pulses (ultrasonic waves). Now, when these waves collide with a person within that six-feet detection range, this raw data calculation is converted to a system that it would understand and hence alert the user.”Shukla was born and brought up in the United States. She started working on the project in April and a prototype was ready in June. Shukla is now working on improving the design of the device further to make it easier to wear. “I am also working on developing a Bluetooth app that will send the same notification to your phone as well and you can keep a track of that history,” she says.She has been featured in the New York Times and on the Nasdaq screen last month. Shukla’s LinkedIn profile described her as a student, innovator, researcher and writer.Shukla said that she would love to come to India as soon as the Covid-19 pandemic is over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-origin-girl-neha-shukla-invents-social-distancing-alarm-wins-rave-reviews/story-kii4uMxW7dTpBcIZf4qcnK.html

27-08-2020||India||India’s Covid death toll crosses 60k||India reported at least 1,000 fresh deaths due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on the second consecutive day on Wednesday, as the cumulative toll breached the 60,000 mark. On Wednesday, 1,012 new deaths were reported from across the country and the overall fatalities from the viral outbreak rose to 60,610 to date. The country had reported its first Covid-19 death on March 12. On Tuesday, 1,066 Covid-19-related new deaths were reported. A state-wise toll break-up showed Maharashtra reported 295 Covid-19-related fresh deaths on Wednesday, followed by Karnataka (133) and Tamil Nadu (118). However, the Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoH&FW) reiterated that the country’s Covid-19 management is under control, as the case fatality rate (CFR) stands at 1.84%. India’s CFR, which is the percentage of deaths out of the total number of positive cases, is still among the lowest in the world, as compared to the global average of 3.5%.“Our target is to bring down the CFR to 1% or below,” said Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, MoH&FW.At least 10 states have CFR below, or closer to the 1% target. Assam, Kerala and Bihar’s CFR has dropped to 0.27%, 0.39% and 0.42%, respectively.Around 87% of Covid-19-related deaths have been reported from patients, who were 45 years old and above, the ministry’s data showed. The findings are in line with what scientists have observed about the global trends of the viral disease: it severely affects those who are older. The data also showed that more than half (51%) of the Covid-19 patients who succumbed to the viral infection were 60 years and above and a major chunk of the fatalities (36%) belonged to the age group between 45 and 60 years. While 2% of Covid-19-related deaths were found to be aged up to 25 years.More men (69%) have died of Covid-19 than women (31%), the data further showed. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-death-toll-crosses-60k/story-ne44sS0CN7KT4mrqQvDhHL.html
27-08-2020||India||GST compensation may jump 89% in FY-21 at Rs 3.12 lakh crore||States and union territories (UTs) may require a whopping Rs 3.12 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation in the current financial year, an 89% jump over 2019-20 because of a sharp fall in the tax revenue, as the economy has been severely hit by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and the resultant 68-day nationwide lockdown restrictions, two people aware of the matter said ahead of crucial GST Council’s meeting that will dwell on this key issue on Thursday. The GST law assures states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years from July 1 and also guarantee them that their revenue shortfall, if any, would be made good through the compensation cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liqour, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal and tobacco products. According to an estimate, GST compensation cess requirement for the financial year 2020-21 is pegged around Rs. 26,000 crore per month because of the unprecedented Covid-19 situation. An average monthly compensation cess of about Rs 13,775 crore was paid to states and UTs in 2019-20, even though the average monthly collection was only Rs 7,953.6 crore a month, they said requesting anonymity. Though the impact of nationwide lockdown restrictions on business activities was confined to a few days of the previous financial year that ended on March 31, the compensation cess collection was substantially lower than the actual payout. Nationwide lockdown restrictions were enforced from March 25 in a bid to contain the spread of the contagion. According to an official statement released on July 27, the total amount of compensation paid to states and UTs in 2019-20 was Rs 1,65,302 crore, while the total amount of cess collected in that year was Rs 95,444 crore. The lower revenue collection was primarily due to subdued economic growth. India’s gross domestic product (GDP) had slowed to 4.2% in fiscal 2019-20, which is the lowest in 11 years. States and UTs were fully compensated in 2019-20, as there was some surplus in the compensation fund from previous years. Besides, some cess collected in the current financial year was also used, the persons mentioned above said. The last tranche of compensation worth Rs 13,806 crore for the previous financial year was paid in the third week of July, according to the July 27 statement. A note circulated in the 40th GST Council meeting, held on June 12, said the compensation cess collected in 2017-18 was Rs 62,612 crore that rose to Rs 95,081 crore in 2018-19 and increased to Rs 95,444 crore in 2019-20. However, the compensation paid in 2017-18 was less than the total collection at Rs 41,146 crore, and Rs 69,275 crore (2018-19). So far, the government has paid compensation cess for three fiscal years since the roll-out of the GST regime in July 2017, but this year the gap between cess collection and compensation requirement has widened and needs to be resolved by the GST Council, one person said. “The loss of revenue is for both the Centre and states. In that context, the critical situation should not be viewed as only the problem of the states. The Centre is also equally facing an extraordinary fiscal crisis. This is not only because of a massive dip in GST collection but also of income tax, customs, excise, etc. It’s a collective problem and must not be viewed as the Centre vs. states problem,” the person said. The Covid-19 outbreak and the resultant slowdown impact causing loss of revenue is not arising on account of implementation of GST, the second person said. “It’s a force majeure situation and the Centre and states have to collectively resolve it, according to the true spirit of the GST Act under the federal framework. It is not the Centre’s responsibility alone. The GST Council will have to put its collective decision-making mechanism at work to resolve this critical issue,” the person added. The person cited the Attorney-General (A-G) of India KK Venugopal’s opinion that there was no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for the loss of revenue on account of natural disaster, Covid-19, or economic slowdown, as they are not related to the implementation of GST. “The GST council has to decide how to meet the shortfall in such circumstances and not the Central government,” the person said. “Even the then Union Finance Minister [Arun Jaitley] categorically stated that compensation to the states due to shortfall of GST implementation cannot be paid from the Consolidated Fund of India. However, if required, market borrowing could be an option to compensate and later the same can be repaid through the future collection of cess,” the person said. However, some states say that as per the letter and spirit of the GST regime the Centre is committed to pay the compensation. In a letter to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday, West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra said, “It is surprising that that the constitutional guarantee given to the states is being interpreted in a manner that the Centre is not responsible to compensate the states and it is the states (in the GST Council), which will have to find means to compensate themselves! “Nothing can be more damaging, unfair and unjust than this. Those who are forwarding such views are either not aware of the spirit and intent of the Constitutional Amendment, or are consciously turning a blind eye to renege the sovereign promise to the states,” he said in the letter reviewed by HT. Mitra said there can be no going back on the fact that compensation has to be paid. The rate of 14% is sacrosanct, as it was unanimously decided by the GST Council. “Under no circumstance, states should be asked to borrow from the market, as it will increase their debt servicing liability. It may also lead to cut state expenditure which is not desirable at this juncture, when the economy is witnessing severe recessionary trend,” he said.

27-08-2020||India||Opposition should have common minimum programme: Janata Parliament||A week long Janata Parliament concluded on Wednesday, in which 250 people from different civil society organisations participated, and asked the government to hold a longer session of Parliament so that important people-centric issues can be discussed in detail.Several opposition party leaders, who participated in the concluding session, said there was a need for a common minimum programme to challenge the Central government on different issues and alleged that the present government has undermined the Parliament by not calling a session since March 22, when the nation-wide lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “A common minimum programme should be prepared for the unity of opposition on different issues and bring on board civil society groups,” said Sitaram Yechury, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary.He said pillars of Indian democracy and the Republic are under attack and people’s right to information and food are almost defunct. “This battle against the government cannot be fought by one party or one movement,” he said, adding that CPI(M) will cooperate with all political parties on framing a common agenda.K. Raju, who represented the Congress, was in agreement with Yechury’s suggestion on a common minimum programme and recalled that the first Janata Parliament was addressed by Congress President Sonia Gandhi in 2019. He also said that the Congress would be working in future for a basic income by transferring money directly into bank accounts of poor people and for a universal public distribution system (PDS) without Aadhaar linkage. Also Read: Opposition gets battle-ready for Parliament, five key issues to watch out forCongress chief whip in Lok Sabha, Kodikunnil Suresh, said he was concerned about the number of ordinances promulgated by the Central government in the past five months; some of them having vital policy implications for Indian agriculture and the economy. He referred to three farm sector related ordinances, against which farmers are protesting in several parts of India including Punjab and Maharashtra. Aam Aadmi Party’s Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh said the Central government was looking to convert the on-going pandemic into an opportunity to disinvest in various national assets such as Steel Authority of India (SAIL), Coal India and the Indian Railways. “The Centre is looking to escape questioning and is therefore not convening the Parliament,” he said and added that the NDA has not given adequate relief to people during such extraordinary times.Also Read: Parliamentary committee business not to be leaked: Venkaiah Naidu to MPsRJD spokesperson Manoj Jha said that there would be limited time available for the members to raise important issues as one house will run only for four hours every day and there would be a lot of government business to take care of as well in the limited time. Jha said he was apprehensive that Parliamentary forum would not be available to MPs to bring issues to the attention of the public. He said a common agenda of opposition parties would also be useful for his party in the upcoming elections in Bihar.Aruna Roy, former member of National Advisory Council, said Janata Parliament which started on August 21 had passed crucial resolutions on issues of national importance including expanding MGNREGA, universalisation of PDS and right to free health and education. She also urged the political parties to raise people centric issues in the Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-should-have-common-minimum-programme-janata-parliament/story-fUpO4D9Hhocy0JHTtIViuN.html

27-08-2020||India||Covid-19 can affect almost all organs, say experts at AIIMS||Not just the lungs, Covid-19 can affect almost all organs and the initial symptoms may be totally unrelated to chest complaints, experts at AIIMS here said on Wednesday. They stressed that classification of cases into mild, moderate and severe categories based just on respiratory symptoms should be relooked to include other organ involvement. Experts from the institute, including its director Dr Randeep Guleria, Dr MV Padma Srivastava, head of department of Neurology, Dr Ambuj Roy, Professor of Cardiology and Dr Neeraj Nischal, Associate Professor in the department of Medicine during their weekly ‘National Clinical Grand Rounds’ organised in collaboration with NITI Aayog discussed various possible extra-pulmonary complications of Covid-19.  Dr Guleria said eight months into Covid-19, a lot has been learnt and accordingly strategies are being changed from time to time.  From what we thought of as a viral pneumonia has a lot of other manifestations which are beyond the lungs, he said.“As we have known more and more about Covid-19, we have realised it causes many extra pulmonary manifestations. This is basically of the fact that this virus enters into cell through ACE2 receptors which although are present abundantly in upper airways and lungs, they are also present in many organs and thus other organs are also affected.“We have seen many patients who presented with features which are not been predominantly pulmonary but extra pulmonary manifestations,” Dr Guleria said.He said though pulmonary manifestations continue to dominate as far as majority of Covid-19 cases are concerned, there is a significant number of patients who would present with manifestations which may be along with pulmonary manifestations or may be without pulmonary manifestations.  “We as clinicians need to have a high index of suspicion during this pandemic -- when to suspect, treat and isolate these patients so that we can provide them good quality care,” he stressed.The experts in the programme presented a number of cases in which the patients were labelled as asymptomatic or mild Covid but had serious life-threatening extra-pulmonary manifestations like stroke and heart blocks.   “What started off as a viral pneumonia is now a multi-systemic disease. However, the jury is out whether SARS-COV2 is the culprit in these extra pulmonary manifestations or just an innocent bystander which happens to be at the wrong place at a wrong time,”  Dr Nischal said.“So the classification of Covid-19 into mild, moderate and severe cases based only on respiratory symptoms should be relooked into to incorporate other organ involvement,” he said.Dr Nischal further underlined that management of such patients with other organ involvement should be as per existing guidelines of that particular complication.The doctor from the Medicine Department also highlighted the case of a 35-year old man who had headache and was vomiting but was found to have life threatening cortical vein thrombosis.  When tested, he was found positive for Covid-19. He was asymptomatic for Covid-19 as per existing severity guidelines, Dr Nischal said.“There is a big spectrum of neurological manifestations which have been linked to Covid-19. In some patients, brain is involved and it may lead to clotting, resulting in stroke or can cause infection and lead to encephalitis or other complications which have nothing to do with lungs,” Dr Padma said.Dr Ambuj’s team presented the case of a patient who came with a very low pulse rate, detected Covid-19 positive and required initial support with some medicines to improve heart rate.  “Normally pacemaker is put in such patients to improve their heart rate but based on experiences documented in literature, we realised some of these could be due to Covid-19,  so a pacemaker was not put and her heart rate gradually improved with supportive treatment.“Sometimes, the electrical pulse system of the heart which gives rise to heart beat can be affected in Covid-19 and it is self-limiting and improves with time. “So these patients who would otherwise normally require pacemaker may not evern need it. “However, more evidence is needed to be definitive about this as it is a new disease and limited information and experience regarding it is available as of now,” Dr Roy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-can-affect-almost-all-organs-say-experts-at-aiims/story-nARswEgFgM4GtwoIm7YMVO.html

27-08-2020||India||‘N-95 masks most effective at curbing Covid-19 spread’||N-95 masks may be the most effective at reducing the spread of the novel coronavirus, according to a study by researchers, including those from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), which suggests that any mask is better than no mask at preventing Covid-19.The researchers noted that airborne transmission by respiratory aerosol droplets produced during coughing and sneezing is the dominant mode of spreading for infectious diseases such as Covid-19. Padmanabha Prasanna Simha, from ISRO, and Prasanna Simha Mohan Rao, from the Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research in Karnataka, experimentally visualised the flow fields of coughs under various common mouth covering scenarios.The, study published in the journal Physics of Fluids, found N95 masks to be the most effective at reducing the horizontal spread of a cough.The N95 masks reduced a cough’s initial velocity by up to a factor of 10, and limit its spread to between 0.1 and 0.25 meters, the researchers said.An uncovered cough, in contrast, can travel up to three metres, but even a simple disposable mask can bring this all the way down to 0.5 metres, they said.Simha and Rao hope their findings will put to rest the argument that regular cloth masks are ineffective, but they emphasise that masks must continue to be used in addition to social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/n-95-masks-most-effective-at-curbing-covid-19-spread/story-OB7Uv6MV19pIbg9kvJqQ2L.html
27-08-2020||India||Reconsider 50 per cent cap on quotas, Supreme Court bench told||The 50% threshold on reservation for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Backward castes (OBCs) in public service and educational institutions mandated by a 1992 judgment of the Supreme Court should be re-examined, a slew of senior counsel urged the top court on Wednesday.Lawyers including Mukul Rohatgi and Kapil Sibal submitted before a 3-judge bench headed by justice L Nageswara Rao that a Constitution bench should be constituted to examine the 50% cap laid down by the 1992 judgment in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, delivered by a bench of nine judges. “The matter has to go before a 11-judge bench. 50 percent criterion was evolved through judicial decision making. 85%(people) in Maharashtra belong to backward classes,” Sibal told the bench which also consisted of justices Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat. The court was hearing a plea challenging a 2018 Maharashtra law granting reservation benefits to Maratha community in educational institutions and government jobs. Sibal, who was appearing for one of the applicants Rajendra Datey Patil, also submitted that reservation in 28 states exceed the 50% threshold after the central government enabled grant of 10 percent reservation to Economically Weaker sections (EWS). He said any judgment of the Supreme Court in this regard will affect those states. “So notice should be issued to all states and they should be heard,” he said. The law under challenge, the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act (Maharashtra SEBC Act) originally provided 16% reservation to Maratha community in educational institutions and government jobs. This law was challenged before the Bombay High Court which, in June 2019, upheld the validity of the law but reduced the quota to 12 per cent in admissions to educational institutions and 13 per cent in jobs. The petitions have challenged the law on the ground that it breaches the 50% threshold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reconsider-50-per-cent-cap-on-quotas-supreme-court-bench-told/story-qP1xneoC0uH57GEuvrBImN.html
27-08-2020||India||Delhiwale: Because rajma chawal must go on||Impatient, hungry customers. Some wanting kadhi. Others going for rajma, or chhole, or both. One person demanding more achaar. Another one needing extra raita please. Now one more man blocks the counter, asking for a takeaway.Amid all this humdrum, Neeraj’s hands are a constant blur, as he serves his rajma/kadhi/chhole, standing behind the counter, here at Raju Palwalwale—a small but well-known roadside landmark in Gurugram’s atmospheric Sadar Bazaar. This is the way things were (obviously).And now, how desperately Neeraj yearns to get back to this same madness, “when it was impossible to take a break for even a second.” At 40, he is feeling nostalgic for a life that existed until March, before the coronavirus pandemic upset the chaotic harmony of his modestly-staged establishment. “It is no longer as it used to be,” says the masked Neeraj, talking on WhatsApp video. “Many of the people who used to come regularly for lunch have stopped showing up... perhaps they are scared of eating out.”Raju Palwalwale is a thriving legacy that Neeraj nurtures with care, and whose earnings, he hopes, will help him offer his young daughter a bright future. He inherited it from his late father, Raju, a Palwal native, who founded the eatery a decade ago after settling down in the Millennium City.The lunch stall stayed closed during the lockdown, and finally opened a few weeks back.It was a great relief for Neeraj and his family, he says, to reclaim the patterns of the pre-corona life even as the virus continues to affect their daily living. His mother, Pushpa Rani, gets up early in the morning at 4.30am in their Devilal Colony house and quickly cuts and chops the ingredients for the three dishes, with the help of his wife, Priya. But it’s Neeraj who actually cooks the gravies—he points this out as a significant detail.He leaves for the shop at about half past 10. “My days are no longer as hectic.... the peak lunch time is no longer a peak.” Here, Neeraj emphasises that “yes, things are bad in the business, but not so bad that we cannot live comfortably.” He isn’t sure if he can say the same thing about the young man who used to assist him in the shop. “Deva went back to his village in Bihar during the lockdown, and I don’t think he is coming back.”Which means that Neeraj is obliged to run the shop alone these days. “I cannot hire a new boy right now.... not as long as the business is as it is.”Recalling the pre-pandemic time, he expresses optimism. “Those days will be back again, if not this year, then next year.... I have full faith in God and in the blessings of my father.” Neeraj must now put down the phone. He opened the shop some minutes ago and just decked up the counter with pots, pans and plates. It’s a new, slow-moving normal but he is getting busy, to some extent. “And look,” exclaims Neeraj turning the phone screen to show the scene outside the counter—a customer is already digging into a plate full of rajma chawal. The eatery serves daily from 11am to 3pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-because-rajma-chawal-must-go-on/story-4mp5WfWJkqUqyOkym2PXqJ.html
27-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Just when it looked like Delhi would slip into complacency in its fight against the coronavirus disease, the state government has stepped up its game — or at the least, announced its intent to (see page 1). For at least a week now, HT has been pointing to the number of daily cases and the positivity rate inching up — not alarmingly, but definitely worryingly.According to the HT database, the seven-day average of daily cases in the Capital peaked at 3,446 on June 26, before falling to below 1,000 in late July, and then again in early August (although this can, in part, be attributed to the weekend and public-holiday factor, where testing, and consequently the number of cases recorded, drop off). It has since climbed, and was at 1,333 on August 25.It isn’t just cases, the positivity rate has also increased. The seven-day average positivity rate, which saw its peak of 31.4% on June 14 and 15 fell to 5.7% in late July, stayed at that level for some time, but has since climbed back. It was at 7.5% on August 25. In isolation, that is an impressive number for a state that is testing adequately, but relatively, it still marks an increase.Also read: India’s Covid-19 tally over 3.2 million, recovery rate rises to 76.29%Delhi is also definitely doing fewer tests than it used to: the seven-day average of tests peaked at 21,660 on July 9 but has since fallen. It was 17,924 on August 25. The Capital is not utilising the entire capacity of RT-PCR tests available, relying instead on antigen tests. Sure, the latter helped it scale up testing in late June when cases were peaking, some containment zones were rife with cases, and hospitals were running short of beds. But even after that crisis passed, Delhi continued to depend overwhelmingly on antigen tests. In the week ended August 25, for instance, only 31% of the tests conducted were RT-PCR ones.The Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test is a molecular test that is globally recognised as the best diagnostic for Covid-19. The only problem with it is the time involved — which, including logistical delays and those caused by backlogs, is around three to four days (although is possible to provide results in 24 hours). Antigen tests, in contrast, provide results within the hour — this means a person can walk into a testing centre, be tested, and wait for the result — but are not very reliable. They throw up a high proportion of false negatives, identifying infected people as uninfected. As this column has explained ad nauseam, it makes sense to use them when time is a constraint. And by mid-July, that certainly wasn’t the case in Delhi.Delhi’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has now promised to double testing — which is good — although it isn’t immediately clear whether the government will at least use up the entire capacity of RT-PCR tests available to it. The government has also said it will strictly enforce rules on the wearing of masks in public places — adherence is lax in markets and parks — and social distancing.Also read | Covid-19: Tracing India’s journey to two million casesThe trajectory of coronavirus disease in cities, provinces, and countries around the world suggests that most regions see a long plateau once cases have fallen to a retain level. The trajectory of the disease in Delhi shows a narrow peak (itself a rarity), and it is evident that the Capital is now seeing the plateau. The challenge before the administration is to keep the plateau at a manageable level in terms of number of cases — there is no shortage of hospital beds (in fact, there is a surplus capacity), and the government must ensure it stays that way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-rHjiVnuaWzTqEFBRlnusqO.html

The West Bengal chief minister urged all CMs to together move the Supreme Court for postponing the NEET and JEE as she said students were not prepared to take the tests.Separately, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia reiterated his demand that the exams be postponed and the central government work on alternative methods for selecting students. “They (Centre) are saying protocols will be followed. Following the same protocols that the Centre wants 28 lakh students to follow, lakhs of Indians have tested positive,” he said.The Congress did not invite the chief ministers of Odisha (Naveen Patnaik), Delhi (Arvind Kejriwal), Andhra Pradesh (YS Jaganmohan Reddy) and Telangana (K Chandrashekhar Rao). Amid a growing chorus for postponing the JEE and NEET in view of the pandemic, the Centre has maintained that the tests will be conducted in September as scheduled. While JEE Main is scheduled from September 1-6, NEET is planned on September 13. The Supreme Court last week dismissed a plea seeking postponement of the two exams, saying a “precious academic year of students cannot be wasted and life has to go on”.There have been demands by students and parents’ bodies to postpone the entrance exams in view of the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the country. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said NEET and JEE aspirants were worried about their health and future.Even as pressure piled on the Centre over the plan to go ahead with the exams, the Union education ministry and the National Testing Agency (NTA) continued working towards what would be the biggest entrance tests to be conducted during the pandemic, which has infected 3,305,177 people across India.More than 400,000 students downloaded the admit cards for the NEET exam from the NTA portal within three hours after the agency began to issue them on Wednesday. The figure rose to 515,000 in four hours. At least 950,000 students are expected to take the JEE (Main) at 660 centres from September 1 to 6, while nearly 1.6 million NEET candidates are likely to appear for the test at 3,842 centres on September 13.“I have always reiterated that safety first and then exams. But conducting these exams any time later might lead to a situation where the entire year could be lost, therefore conducting these exams in now with due precautions is a middle path,” education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ told HT in an interview.The minister said that there was a “silent majority” of students and parents who wanted the exams to be held as scheduled. “The parents and students say that they are under stress and preparing for exams for the last two to three years and that they don’t want a zero academic year.”According to a government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the education ministry is keen that the exams are held because it will help keep the academic year on track and not keep students in “perpetual uncertainty”. The official said there was no alternative to these exams. NTA has emphasised that it will hold the exams safely and a detailed protocol has been put in place to ensure the safety of students. Experts say NTA needs support from states to conduct the exams successfully in terms of logistics. During Wednesday’s meeting, Thackeray said the Opposition-ruled states have to first decide whether they want to “fight or fear” the Narendra Modi-led government. “Opposition-ruled states should speak louder as the Centre is trying to suppress our voices. But we are together, we will be together and we will fight together,” he said.Thackeray received support from Banerjee, who said the situation was “very serious” and the Opposition-ruled states should launch a united fight against the Centre.Gandhi ageed with Thackeray and Banerjee. “We have to work together and fight together,” she said. Soren alleged that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was using law enforcement agencies against the Opposition and undermining the federal structure. Earlier, in her introductory remarks, Gandhi said the Centre’s refusal to pay GST compensation to states is “nothing short of betrayal”. “GST compensation being paid to states on time, according to the laws passed by Parliament, is crucial and I know this is not happening. Dues have accumulated. The finances of all states have been affected badly,” she added. Banerjee alleged that states were being “bulldozed” by the Centre, which was not giving money to them. “The situation today is dangerous. We cannot speak freely. From Facebook to everywhere, there is fake and distorted news to destroy the Opposition,” she said. Banerjee said she had raised her concerns about the NEET and JEE exams with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The exams are in September. Why should the lives of students be put at risk? We have written to the Prime Minister, but there has been no response. If the Prime Minister does not listen to us, then we all collectively should approach the Supreme Court,” she said. Thackeray said the time had come to revisit the GST model and see if it was helping or not. “The old tax collection model was good? If there are lacunas in the GST, those need to be addressed so that states don’t suffer,” he said. The Punjab chief minister said the Covid-19 situation was getting worse and his state could face a deficit of ~25,000 crore this year due to the pandemic. “I agree with Mamata ji that we should collectively meet the Prime Minister and apprise him of the revenue situation. And all of us should go to the Supreme Court on the issue of NEET and JEE exams,” he added. IIT Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao said in a social media post that he was in favour of conducting the examinations by taking all precautions and following social distancing norms. “Lockdown is not a solution to COVID. Lockdown was needed to prepare ourselves better. We cannot be perpetually in lockdown mode. COVID is not going to go away for another 6 months to one year. We all need to get used to this new normal. The earlier we realize that, the better it is for all of us. The last postponement of exams definitely helped us prepare well now,” Rao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-cms-join-hands-against-holding-neet/story-1KQFxM6huY4fWam8M0GeiM.html
27-08-2020||India||Delhi to double tests as Covid spike continues||Covid-19 cases in Delhi are increasing, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal acknowledged on Wednesday as the government took note of persistently rising numbers at an emergency meeting, where it decided to double the number of daily tests from current levels to around 40,000 per day in an effort to catch and isolate more infections.With 1,693 new cases reported on Wednesday, the last seven days have seen an average of 1,375 cases every day. This is the highest since the seven-day period ending in July 15, when the Capital recorded 1,732 cases on an average – and a trend that HT highlighted in news reports on August 23, 25 and 26. The increase has been preceded by a drop in testing and an increased focus on the relatively less reliable rapid test – also an issue that this paper highlighted in a news reports on August 15 and August 16.Also read | Covid-19: What you need to know today“For nearly one and a half months now, the Covid-19 situation in Delhi is under control. But, since August 17, cases have been increasing again. In today’s health bulletin, which will be released in the evening, Delhi recorded 1,693 cases. Yesterday, 1,544 cases were recorded,” said the chief minister in a press briefing over video in the afternoon.Experts warned that the Capital, which was the first Covid-19 hot spot to get some measure of control over the disease, stands at a critical juncture in the fight against the highly contagious virus.“Delhi is at the crux where the rise in the number of cases can be controlled, if it is not controlled now, we can enter a second wave in a few months. People are fed up and have become casual about using masks and maintaining social distancing, and we have to factor this in when planning a response to prevent resurgence,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi. In light of these trends, the rate of testing will be doubled over the next week, Kejriwal added, while assuring that the situation was still under control. “Other parameters are in good shape. For instance, the death rate is low. For August, it is 1.4%, which is the best in the country. We have adequate hospital beds too. There are 14,130 total beds now, of which 10,448 beds are vacant. The recovery rate is good. And, the home isolation model has worked well. Since July 15, there has been no death in home isolation,” he said. Home isolation has been one of the centrepieces of Delhi’s Covid-19 mitigation strategy, as has been the testing programme that has covered the highest number of people in per capita terms among major states. But, as reported on August 25, a slackening of testing coincided with a rise in positive rate – the proportion of samples confirming an infection – suggesting the city may have begun missing new infections.WATCH | Covid update: Delhi 90% recovery rate; govt exams delayed in MaharashtraIn the 7-day period ending on Wednesday, the average positive rate for daily tests was 7.8%. The last time this number was this high was in the week ending July 18. Test positive rate can rise if there are fewer tests, but also if the outbreak is growing. This is among five factors that data and circumstantial indicators suggest may be powering a spurt in cases in Delhi. The others are behavioural fatigue that could be reducing mask discipline, the reopening of the city that is leading to more crowding, a lag in reporting that could be leading to a statistical build-up, and the possibility that the rise may be part of a cyclical wave trajectory that epidemic disease outbreaks follow.In statements offered separately, the chief minister’s office said the increase in cases was a “momentary situation” that does not, at the moment, require putting curbs on the economic activities that have been allowed, and the government still believes the Delhi Metro must be restarted.“Our stand on the Delhi Metro remains the same. Such decisions, including opening of other economic activities, were taken keeping in mind all possible parameters. The prognosis of the current Covid-19 situation doesn’t call for any drastic or knee jerk decision. Going by the current infection rate, Delhi government is very well equipped to manage the case load and treat patients. We are certain that the situation will be brought further under control soon with the latest announcement of doubling tests and ensuring stricter enforcement of wearing masks and social distancing,” the chief minister’s office said. According to the Kejriwal, tests will now be increased from “around 20,000 tests per day being conducted currently to 40,000 tests per day”. “Our strategy would remain the same – test and isolation,” he added, urging people to get themselves tested on feeling the slightest of influenza-like symptoms.According to a government official, the announcement on testing reflects a reorientation in the chief minister’s approach to the outbreak. “During the past few weeks when the cases were on a decline, the chief minister had shifted his entire focus on reducing the number of Covid deaths in the city. The emphasis was on serious patients. Now, with Delhi recording more than 1,400 cases in a row, the CM has once again started reviewing the steps taken to control the infection rate in his daily meetings,” the official said, asking not to be named.A second senior government who asked not to be named, said the increase in testing will be proportional for the two modes -- through nucleic acid lab tests, known as RT-PCR tests, as well as the rapid antigen test kits, which offer quick results but run a higher risk of throwing up false negatives. A way to ensure this is being worked on, this person added. The first official cited above said the government will prod labs to increase RT-PCR tests, which are at present the most reliable. “Directions will soon be issued to all hospitals and private testing labs to conduct RT-PCR to their full capacity. The health department has also been asked to explore if capacity for RT-PCR tests can be increased beyond the current level of 11,000,” this person said, while adding: “But, rapid antigen tests will continue to be more in numbers compared to RT-PCR as is the current format.”Experts welcomed the planned steps. “Cases are going up. At this stage, the government must go for aggressive testing, isolate positive cases and strengthen surveillance. People should always wear masks, adhere to social distancing norms and follow respiratory etiquettes. There is no room for complacency,” said Lalit Kant, the former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Wednesday’s meeting was attended by health minister Satyendar Jain, chief secretary Vijay Dev, and top officials of the health department. Kejriwal said the administration has also taken note of people struggling with residual symptoms after recovering from the disease and the government will now provide them pulse oximeters (which measure oxygen concentration in blood and can identify severe breathing issues) and oxygen concentrators free of charge if required.The chief minister said he has also directed authorities to strengthen enforcement of rules. “People should wear masks and maintain social distancing. Confidence is good but it should not lead to complacency at any cost. We hope nobody is penalised. In case one gets fined, one must understand that it is for a greater good,” said Kejriwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-to-double-tests-as-covid-spike-continues/story-P9ntuxopzEmF2nxwjoQouO.html
27-08-2020||India||Panel seeks 100% FDI in tobacco production||A multi-party committee of Indian Parliament has asked the Narendra Modi government to impose 1% tax on cigarettes help tobacco farmers and allow 100% FDI in tobacco production and cigarette manufacturing, to boost one of India’s major cash crops. The parliamentary committee on commerce, however, also listed conditions for such FDI in a submitted to Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday. “The tobacco produced by FDI would be marketed through auction platforms. Also, FDI may be permitted in cigarette manufacturing wherein the value addition of such products is done only in SEZs for export purpose with no domestic sale,” it said. India occupies third position globally in terms of production of tobacco and in exports, after Brazil and China. In the last financial year, tobacco and tobacco products contributed about Rs.22,737crore in excise revenue to the union exchequer. They also earned around Rs.5870 crore through foreign exchange. The panel, headed by V Vijayasai Reddy, argued that as per the 2017 FDI policy, 100% FDI is allowed in tea, coffee, rubber and cardamom plantation and cultivations under automatic entry route. “The Committee is of the opinion that the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in tobacco sector albeit in a regulated manner would stimulate the production and processing of Indian tobacco thereby boosting its export,” the report added. The panel has asked the commerce ministry to “undertake a study to analyse the prospects of opening FDI investments in the tobacco sector at the earliest”. The commerce committee of Parliament maintained that “tobacco farmers, at times, are forced to sell their tobacco at prices less than their cost of cultivation.” “Therefore, 1% of tax on the sale of cigarettes may be imposed and the amount thus accumulated should be utilized as ‘Market Stabilization Fund’ for tobacco. The additional special levies on sale of cigarettes may be expended on starting market intervention in the interest of the welfare of tobacco growers,” it recommended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panel-seeks-100-fdi-in-tobacco-production/story-XdT6fmUrCkIts1ISXboWII.html
27-08-2020||India||Better opportunities for India after Israel-UAE deal: Jaishankar||New Delhi: The normalisation of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has opened up “lots of opportunities” at a time when ties between New Delhi and Abu Dhabi are growing, external affairs minister S Jaishankar has said. India has welcomed the deal between the UAE and Israel, both key allies in West Asia, and also called for the resumption of direct talks between the Israeli and Palestinian leadership for a “two-state solution”. Referring to the normalisation of ties between the UAE and Israel, Jaishankar told Gulf News: “When two strategic friends come closer it opens up lots of opportunities.” India and the UAE, he said, have a “fast growing relationship”. He added: “UAE is central to India’s extended neighbourhood. We see UAE on the crossroads of international trade. As Singapore is in the East, UAE is in the West.” The report in the Gulf News stated Prime Minister Narendra Modi personally directed officials to give a new thrust to ties with the UAE after coming to power in 2014. Over the past few years, New Delhi has expended considerable diplomatic capital in improving ties with West Asian countries, particularly members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and Saudi Arabia, and the relations now extend from energy security to security and defence cooperation, including intelligence-sharing and counterterrorism. The presence of some eight million Indian expatriates in West Asia has been a key factor in these efforts. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have also played a role in improving India’s ties with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), though differences remain on issues such as Kashmir. Jaishankar’s visit to the UAE while he was foreign secretary in 2015 helped him build rapport with minister of state for foreign affairs Anwar Gargash and gave a boost to ties, the report said. Modi’s team also sought to go beyond the perception formed about West Asian countries through a narrow focus on the Israel-Palestine issue or merely as sources of energy, the report added. In 2015, Modi became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit the UAE in 34 years, and Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, was the chief guest at India’s Republic Day celebrations in 2017. During the past six years, Modi visited the UAE three times. Jaishankar said: “It is a relationship where the highest leadership of both countries have invested goodwill and energy. As a result, you can see the transformation during the last five years.” In his new book “The India Way – Strategies for an Uncertain World”, Jaishankar has listed the UAE among the five countries that India must concentrate on while conducting its foreign policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/better-opportunities-for-india-after-israel-uae-deal-jaishankar/story-5GbUzZDQ8aooikES16SNCJ.html
27-08-2020||India||On strategic security, Prez Rajapaksa has India-first approach: Lankan foreign secy||President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has made it clear that Sri Lanka’s strategic security policy will have an “India first” approach though Colombo remains open to dealing with other major countries for economic development, the country’s new foreign secretary Jayanath Colombage has said. Colombage, a retired admiral who commanded Sri Lanka’s navy during 2012-14 and is perceived as close to Rajapaksa, made the remarks in two recent interviews. He also said Rajapaksa’s administration has adopted a posture of neutrality in its dealings with key powers at the regional and global level as Sri Lanka cannot become a “staging area” for any country to do “anything against another country – especially...India”. “Very categorically, the president has stated that we have a strategic security-wise ‘India first’ policy because we cannot be, we should not be, we can’t afford to be a strategic security threat for India, period,” Colombage said in an interview to Derana 24 news channel that aired on August 20. “We can’t be and we don’t have to be [a security threat to India]. They are a very big power, [the] fastest developing major economy in 2018, 1.34 billion people, a 7,500-km coastline, it’s a huge country. We need to benefit from India,” he added. Colombage made similar remarks in an interview with the Daily Mirror newspaper, pointing out that Sri Lanka is “between two economic giants” ,a reference to China. He added: “That is why the president mentioned that as far as strategic security is concerned, Sri Lanka will always have an India-first approach. That means Sri Lanka will not do anything harmful to India’s strategic security interests.” However, he said Rajapaksa had made it clear to India’s leadership that Sri Lanka cannot depend on any one country for economic development. “We are open to anyone. We know China is one country willing to invest and develop (sri Lanka). They have the capacity to do it. We have to benefit from it. We have to balance,” he told the Daily Mirror. Colombage also told the news channel: “Even to India...very firmly, the president has said, you are my first priority insofar as security is concerned but I have to deal with other players for my economic prosperity.” Colombage, who was appointed foreign secretary on August 14 and previously served as additional secretary to the president for foreign relations, also said the Sri Lankan government will not hand over total control of strategic national assets to a foreign power following the experience with Hambantota port, which was given to China Merchant Port Holding for 99 years. “Now in that deal, roughly...about 85% of that project’s stakes are for China Merchant Port Holding and only 15% for Sri Lanka. We will do everything so that no one can use our country against another country but then giving total control for a long period, of majority 85% is a very high stake,” he told the news channel. In future ventures, Sri Lanka will retain a 51% stake in any project with foreign investment, he said. Colombage told the Daily Mirror that China understands Sri Lanka’s position and “is pushing for commercial things”. He added, “China also understands it isn’t ethical to push Sri Lanka beyond a certain point that is worrisome to India.” He also told the daily that in 2015, India feared “we had moved towards China too much”, and that India, Japan and the US considered it was wrong for Sri Lanka to give Hambantota port on lease to a Chinese firm. “We actually made India jittery during the period between 2015 and 2019. But India is comfortable with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.” The Modi government has focused on improving ties with Rajapaksa’s administration. Modi was the first world leader to congratulate Rajapaksa even before the final results of Sri Lanka’s parliamentary elections were declared earlier this month, after his Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) party took an unassailable lead. Last month, India announced a $400-million currency swap facility for Sri Lanka under the Saarc framework, and officials said Colombo’s request for a bilateral swap facility for $1.1 billion was also being considered. When Rajapaksa visited India last November, just 10 days after becoming president, New Delhi announced a $400-million line of credit to boost infrastructure and development, and offered another $50 million to fight terrorism and enhance intelligence gathering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-strategic-security-prez-rajapaksa-has-india-first-approach-lankan-foreign-secy/story-XtddEW352JyVetiR4ySDNM.html
27-08-2020||India||Sonia forms panel to prepare party agenda on govt ordinances||New Delhi Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday constituted a five-member committee to formulate the party’s stance on key ordinances promulgated by the central government. A press release by party general secretary in charge of organisation KC Venugopal said Rajya Sabha members and former Union ministers P Chidambaram and Jairam Ramesh, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijaya Singh, Lok Sabha members Amar Singh and Gaurav Gogoi will be the five members of the panel. Ramesh will be the convener of the committee, the release said. The government is planning to bring in 11 ordinances in the 18-day monsoon session of Parliament beginning September 14. If any ordinance lapses, the government can re-promulgate it. In another decision, Sonia Gandhi named former general secretary in charge of Rajasthan Avinash Pande as chairman of the party’s screening committee for the upcoming Bihar assembly elections. Pande’s removal from Rajasthan was a key demand of party rebel legislators led by former state deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot. Pande will be assisted in shortlisting party candidates for the Bihar polls by two young leaders, Devender Yadav and Qazi Nizamuddin. The decisions came two days after a stormy Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting that asked Sonia Gandhi to stay on as party chief until a new president is elected. The CWC members also came down heavily on 23 dissenters who in a letter written to Gandhi had, among other things, sought a complete overhaul of the organisation, a full-time and active president, and a parliamentary board. Sonia Gandhi and former party president Rahul Gandhi spoke to some of the dissenters after the CWC meet in a bid to bring about peace. On Wednesday, Sonia Gandhi chaired a meeting of opposition chief ministers, including Mamata Banerjee (West Bengal), Uddhav Thackeray (Maharashtra) and Hemant Soren (Jharkhand), on the issues of goods and services tax compensation, and the NEET and JEE exams. At the meeting, Thackeray congratulated Sonia Gandhi for once again assuming the reins of the Congress party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-forms-panel-to-prepare-party-agenda-on-govt-ordinances/story-3JP5nq1WLmpq0D3LbwrIoM.html
27-08-2020||India||Govt to push for market borrowing at GST meet||Thursday’s scheduled meeting of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council is expected to be stormy , with the Centre likely to push for a market borrowing mechanism that will leverage states’ recently enhanced borrowing limits to temporarily plug the hole in their finances caused by a shortfall in revenue and the Centre’s inability to compensate them -- and states ruled by non-National Democratic Alliance parties likely to, in turn, push for the compensation itself. According to two government officials familiar with the matter, debt raised from market borrowings will be repaid from the compensation cess fund.Other options, such as levying cess on more items, increasing cess rates on existing products or raising overall GST rates to raise revenue appear difficult at a time when demand is already subdued and the economy is badly hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, the officials added, asking not to be named.Also read | Net tax liability to be considered for interest on late GST payments from Sept 1States aren’t likely to accept this without argument. In a letter to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday, West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra said, “It is surprising that that the constitutional guarantee given to the States is being interpreted in a manner that the Centre is not responsible to compensate the States and it is the States (in the GST Council) which will have to find means to compensate themselves!”The Union finance minister chairs the council, which includes state finance ministers. The special meeting of the council has been convened to discuss how to compensate states for their revenue shortfall at a time when the economy is facing headwinds and the compensation cess kitty for 2020-21 is almost empty, the officials said. The GST law assures states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years from July 1, 2017, and also guarantees them that their revenue shortfall, if any, will be made good through the compensation cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal and tobacco products.As cess collection fell sharply due to subdued business activities, states could not be paid compensation on time. According to official data, the last tranche of the GST compensation worth Rs 13,806 crore for 2019-20 was paid towards end of July. So far, states have been paid Rs 1,65,302 crore GST compensation for 2019-20 against total 95,444 crore cess collection for the fiscal year.Also read | ‘Neither luxury nor sin good’: GST tax rate on 2-wheelers may witness a cut“With promised 14% year-on-year revenue growth, the gap is expected to be unmanageable this financial year without borrowing from the market,” one of the officials said. The compensation requirement for 2020-21 is expected to exceed Rs 1.88 lakh crore even if the GST collection in 2020-21 remains at the same level as last fiscal year, he added. Some states have misconception that it is the commitment of the Union government to compensate states, therefore, the central government should borrow the money to pay compensation to states and union territories, the officials mentioned above added. In fact, paying compensation is the collective commitment of both Union and state government, and the GST Council is the apex body that will take a decision on this matter, they said.“The GST law is clear that states will be compensated for their revenue shortfall only from the compensation cess fund. There is no legal provision that the compensation money will come either from the Consolidated Fund of India or the Union government will borrow from the market. Therefore, this matter will be resolved at the GST Council on the principle of collective responsibility. Ideally, states should leverage their enhanced borrowing limits,” the second official said.Mitra’s letter suggests otherwise. “Nothing can be more damaging, unfair and unjust than this. Those who are forwarding such views (on market borrowings) are either not aware of the spirit and intent of the Constitutional Amendment or are consciously turning a blind eye to renege the sovereign promise to the Sates,” he said in the letter reviewed by HT.Mitra said there can be no going back on the fact that compensation has to be paid. The rate of 14% is also sacrosanct as it was unanimously decided by the GST Council, he added.“Under no circumstances States should be asked to borrow from the market as it will increase their debt servicing liability. Further, it may lead to cut State expenditure which is not desirable at this juncture when the economy is witnessing severe recessionary trend,” he said.In order to give fiscal space to states in this time of crisis, the Union government recently raised their borrowing limits. Announcing the last tranche of Rs 20 lakh crore ‘Atamnirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (Self-Reliant India Initiative) on May 17, finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the Centre had also accepted the demand of states to raise their borrowing limit from 3% of their respective gross state domestic product (GSDP) to 5% that would give them additional resources of Rs 4.28 lakh crore during the Covid-19 crisis.Experts say the shortfall in compensation cess collection is mainly because of unforeseen circumstances as the architects of the GST regime could not foresee a pandemic-like Covid-19 that would batter the economy. India is expected to report its April-June GDP numbers by the end of this month. Economists expect its economy to contract by at least 5% this year (2020-21). Archit Gupta, founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of the financial technology platform ClearTax said, “Increasing state borrowing seems to be an option to fund the revenue shortfall for states. The other option suggested was to allow the GST Council to borrow, and repay from cess collection in future years.”He, however, said that these measures were short term. “It is imperative that states need to become more fiscally responsible -- reduce their own debt and make attempts to become fiscally self-reliant to a large extent,” he added. Pratik Jain, partner and leader of the indirect tax practice at PwC India said, “It is evident that cess collected is not enough to compensate the States, particularly in current economic slowdown due to the pandemic. However, at this point, neither increasing the rate of cess nor the ambit look like feasible options.”He said, “Centre will need to negotiate the quantum of compensation, possibly by reducing the 14% annual increment and increasing the period of compensation beyond five years as initially envisaged. In the long term, we will have to find ways for the states to be more economically independent and enhance the tax base.”In his letter, Mitra reminded the finance minister of her promise to pay compensation to states at the 39th meeting of the GST Council. He said the tax regime is hailed world over as an example of cooperative federalism, which is based on mutual trust. “Some dent in this trust has already been made due to delayed payment of GST Compensation. Let us not do anything that will give a death blow to this unique collective effort.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-push-for-market-borrowing-at-gst-meet/story-RDTV6JJJs0KeXYqVMUaRTN.html
27-08-2020||India||Jharkhand caps fee for Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals||The Jharkhand government on Wednesday fixed the maximum rates that private hospitals and nursing homes can charge symptomatic as well as asymptomatic Covid-19 patients across the state.“We have been receiving information about private hospitals charging exorbitant rates from the patients on the pretext of Covid-19 treatment. Considering this, the state government has fixed different rates for treatment facilities and services that private hospitals can charge Covid-19 patients henceforth in all the 24 districts of the state. If any such hospitals are found violating the detailed rate-chart, legal actions will be taken against them,” Banna Gupta, who himself is undergoing Covid-19 treatment in RIMS-Ranchi, said on Wednesday.The rates were fixed after studying the rates implemented in Bihar, Delhi, Haryana, Kerala and Maharashtra. The move came in the wake of rampant allegations of some private hospitals charging Covid-19 patients over Rs 50, 000 per day.The health minister also released a district-wise detailed rate chart under which the districts have been divided into three categories of A, B and C and hospitals into two categories of National Accreditation Board for Hospital and Health Care (NABH) listed and non-NABH private hospitals.Jamshedpur (East Singhbhum), Ranchi, Dhanbad and Boakro have been put in A category districts while Hazaribag, Ramgarh, Giridih, Palamu, Seraikela-Kharsawan and Deogarh in B category districts and Chatra, Dumka, Garhwa, Godda, Gumla, Jamtara, Khunti, Koderma, Latehar, Lohardaga, Pakur, Sahebgunj, Simdega and West Singhbhum in C category districts.The maximum charge for intensive care unit (ICU) with ventilators (invasive and non-invasive) for very critical Covid-19 patients has been fixed at Rs 18, 000 per day at NABH listed hospitals and Rs 15, 000 at non-NABH hospitals in category A districts. This will be Rs 14, 400 and Rs 12, 000 per day in category B and Rs 10, 800 and Rs 9000 in category C districts.ICU without ventilators in NABH private hospital will now cost severely sick patient Rs 15, 000 in NABH and Rs 13, 000 in non-NABH hospitals in category A districts, Rs 12, 000 and Rs 10, 400 in category B districts and Rs 9000 and Rs 7800 respectively in category C districts. All the rates are inclusive of the cost of PPE kits.Moderately ill patients will have to pay Rs 10, 000 for isolation beds with supportive care and oxygen supply in NABH hospitals and Rs 8000 in non-NABH hospitals in category A districts, Rs 8000 and Rs 6400 in category B, Rs 6000 and Rs 4800 respectively in category C districts.Asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic Covid-19 positive patients will have to pay Rs 6000 in NABH hospitals and Rs 5500 in non-NABH hospitals in category A districts as bed charge in normal wards. This will be Rs 5500 and Rs 5000 in category B and Rs 5000 and Rs 4000 in category C districts.The state health department has also fixed Rs 400 for ABG test, Rs 100 for blood sugar level test, Rs 800 for D-Dimer test, Rs 150 for haemoglobin level, Rs 3500 for CT scan chest, Rs 500 for chest X-Ray and Rs 300 for ECG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-caps-fee-for-covid-19-treatment-in-private-hospitals/story-HqNH29RDCXd4bBt3rI3dsK.html

His renal parameters are slightly deranged since yesterday. He continues to be in deep coma and on ventilator support,” the bulletin said. The 84-year-old former President underwent a critical brain surgery to remove a clot after he suffered a fall at his Rajaji Marg residence on August 10. He was also tested positive for coronavirus at the time of his admission to the hospital. He later developed a respiratory infection. The bulletin also didn’t specify whether Mukherjee’s vital and clinical parameters are stable or not, a departure from the past bulletins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hospital-pranab-s-renal-parameters-slightly-damaged/story-pznIREXNJZcWgDQpdY3lkO.html

AFT chairperson Justice Rajendra Menon inaugurated hearings by video conferencing for all 10 regional benches of the tribunal. “With this provision of hearing by video conferencing, an immense relief has been brought to the armed forces personnel, whose applications are awaiting justice at various Regional Benches,” the defence ministry said in a statement. AFT’s principal bench is the only court that has been conducting physical hearings since June 8, 2020, amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “Physical hearings are being conducted at the Principal Bench taking into account hardships and limitations faced by armed forces personnel, retired as well as serving, primarily due to their far-flung locations and various security related issues,” the statement said. All precautions are being taken during the physical hearings at the principal bench. These include high hygiene standards, the court premises being sanitised twice daily, entry to the court being restricted to a bare minimum and social distancing norms being followed.

27-08-2020||India||DRDO expert panel to review charter of labs to cut overlap||The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has set up an expert panel to review the charter of its laboratories and minimise the overlap of technologies they are working on at a time when self-reliance in the defence sector is a top priority for the government, people familiar with the development said on Wednesday. DRDO chief G Satheesh Reddy has constituted the five-member committee under the chairmanship of Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi director V Ramagopal Rao and asked the panel to submit its report within 45 days, according to a government letter dated August 24 reviewed by Hindustan Times.The mandate given to the expert panel includes suggesting measures to provide a push to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (self-reliant India Movement) and cut dependence on imported weapons and systems, the officials cited above said on condition of anonymity. According to the letter, the terms of reference of the committee are to study and review the charter of duties of all DRDO labs, to redefine the charter of duties on the basis of current and futuristic defence and battlefield needs and to minimise the overlap of technologies between the labs. The other members of the committee are Indian Air Force deputy chief Air Marshal Sandeep Singh, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre director S Somanath, Instruments Research & Development Establishment (a Dehradun-based DRDO lab) director Benjamin Lionel and Director General-Naval Systems and Materials, Samir V Kamath. The chairman of the committee may co-opt subject specialists as invitees to specific meetings, the letter said. This is a long overdue review and the committee needs to critically, and clinically, analyse the work of the 57 DRDO labs since their inception vis-a-vis their outputs that have seen deployment with the armed forces, and not just their theoretical claims, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “Money for R&D is scarce and must be used judiciously if the Atmanirbhar Abhiyaan is to move forward,” Bahadur said. The August 24 letter came on a day the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet approved the extension of DRDO chief Reddy’s term by two years with effect from August 26. He was appointed to the post two years ago. Before that, Reddy was the scientific adviser to the defence minister, a charge he was given in June 2015. From mini unmanned aerial vehicles to fire detection systems and bullet proof vehicles to tank transporters, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has come out with a list of 108 systems and sub-systems that it will help the Indian industry design and develop to strengthen the local defence ecosystem. A DRDO delegation met defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday and briefed him on the 108 defence items identified for local production by the industry to achieve self-reliance in the defence sector. It will also allow the DRDO to sharpen its focus on advanced technologies, the defence ministry said. Several steps have been taken in the past to make DRDO more competitive and accountable. These include decentralising its management by merging its labs to form seven clusters based on technology domains such as missiles, electronic warfare, radars, aerial vehicles and underwater weapons. The recommendations made by the P Rama Rao Committee in February 2008 — DRDO’s first external review — formed the bedrock of the roadmap for restructuring the R&D body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-expert-panel-to-review-charter-of-labs-to-cut-overlap/story-DrxVuZGtmPgI7zegRbKiUJ.html
27-08-2020||India||Protests in Kerala as Opposition steps up pressure over secretariat fire||Even as opposition parties continue to allege the fire that gutted ‘important files’ and furniture at the Kerala secretariat on Tuesday was deliberate, the state witnessed a series of protests on Wednesday over the incident as protestors clashed with police injuring many. While the opposition parties allege fire was deliberate attempt to destroy key evidences in the sensational gold smuggling case, the ruling party claim it was a mere accident.Even though the first information report (FIR) says many files were destroyed, but government and senior officers maintain that none of the important files were lost and the incident had nothing to do with the smuggling case. The general administration department (GAD), where the protocol office falls, said gutted files were related to government guest house bookings and ministers swearing-in details. However, nobody is willing to believe GAD secretary P Hani’s claims. A section of the employees however allege that it was a well planned and executed fire and important files dealing with the exemption certificates in UAE consular office, tour itinerary and travel history of some controversial bureaucrats and ministers were destroyed. They say the room in which the fire originated was closed for last two days after one of the employees tested Covid-19 positive. They also allege that the secretariat has a small fire unit but it was not put into action, instead officials waited for reinforcement to arrive from outside. They also question suspicious movement of some government trade union leaders on the premises. According to the FIR, the fire started from a fan after overheating and its remains fell on curtains and later spread to an ‘almirah’ where files were kept. The opposition also said that Chief Secretary Viswas Mehta’s role in the incident was ‘mysterious’ as he was in a hurry to drive out the media and politicians from the scene. When asked about the incident, Mehta refused to comment saying investigation was on. The government also plans to book BJP state president K Surendran, who was among the first to reach the spot, for breach of security. Two inquires are going on separately, one led by police and other by the disaster management secretary. “Many IAS officers’ names also cropped up during the investigation. You don’t need an in-depth inquiry to find out it was an orchestrated one. There are chances for more such manmade fires. We want the NIA to take custody of remaining important files,” said N K Premachandran, RSP MP from Kollam. After meeting Governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Tuesday UDF leaders sent another written submission seeking his intervention on Wednesday. Some officials say video clippings of smuggling accused Swapna Suresh and Sandip Nair with some officials of the GAD department were doing rounds in social media for last few days. There are reports that Suresh was a frequent visitor to the GAD department and she religiously invited officials for important functions at the consulate and after every foreign trip she allegedly gifted them with latest mobile phones and other gadgets. “When CCTV visuals were sought the government said they were destroyed in lightening. Later it said some of them can be retrieved. CM’s office knew everything about Swapna and Co. Now they are desperately destroying evidences. We hope NIA will question them soon,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said both Congress and BJP have aligned to derail a democratically-elected government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protests-in-kerala-as-oppn-steps-up-pressure-over-secretariat-fire/story-LZmXhaGqJLF1RJgFZLfZ4H.html
27-08-2020||India||Railways cites delays by states, contractors on dedicated freight corridors||Following concerns raised by the Prime Minister’s Office over delays in the completion of dedicated freight corridors (DFCs), one of the largest rail infrastructure projects, the Indian Railways has cited “poor progress of work” by contractors and raised concerns over law and order and delays in construction by some states, according to people aware of the developments.An official said the railways has identified delays in both the eastern and western dedicated freight corridors and revised the deadline for completing them to 2022 from 2021.The railways’ project implementing arm, Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL), in an internal report reviewed by HT, has cited slow progress of road over bridge (ROB) approaches. It has also pointed towards law and order issues in some districts as an area of concern for the delay in the eastern corridor.In the western corridor, DFCCIL also mentioned slow progress citing “slow acquisition of land for approaches.”DFCCIL, in its observation, identified delays by the following contractors: GMR group, Alstom, Beijing National Railway Research & Design Institute of Signal & Communication, Tata projects, Hitachi and Texmaco rail & engineering limited. The railways citied “inadequate mobilization” as of the reasons for delays, followed by “slow pace of work” by the contractors and cash flow issues.“The project is monitored on a weekly basis now. Another meeting is scheduled to be chaired by MR Next Monday with all stakeholders. Railways would listen to all. If contractors are unhappy, we can’t be happy; idea is to take all with you. However, the railways will not tolerate any slippages in timelines of the contracted works. Action would be taken against any entity causing delay in the project of such importance. This strict monitoring is for all the working parties involved including entities in railways. Rules of monitoring is applicable for all,” a spokesperson for the railway ministry said.A spokesperson for the GMR Group said: “Despite the adverse effect of Covid, which has impacted availability of manpower, raw material and other resources, due to support from government agencies, we have overcome it to large extent over the last few month.”A spokesperson for Alstom said the company has completed 90% of the work awarded to it.HT’s requests for comments from other firms mentioned above remained unanswered as of press time.On June 18, HT reported that DFCCIL decided to terminate its contract with the Chinese firm Beijing National Railway Research & Design Institute of Signal & Communication for work pertaining to signalling, citing delays.A review of the DFC is scheduled to be held on August 31 with the contractors. The railways will also hold a review with state government officials of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat and Maharashtra on September 1.“A review meeting was held on the DFFCIL and Shri (Piyush) Goyal directed the DFFCIL management team to take necessary steps to speed up the project to compensate the loss of time due to lockdown during Covid-19,” DFCCIL said.Arindam Guha, Deloitte India’s partner, said: “There are also issues around land acquisition and encroachments which are adversely impacting progress in certain stretches.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/concerns-push-dedicated-freight-corridors-deadline-back-by-1-yr/story-fp7Y3dX1f7CUDQem0nF26K.html
27-08-2020||India||Karnataka plans to reopen colleges from October||Karnataka’s deputy chief minister and higher education minister CN Ashwathnarayan announced that in-person classes for degree colleges in the state would resume from October, until which online classes would be held from September 1, when the academic session commences.In a series of tweets, the minister, who also holds the IT & BT, and skill development portfolios, said, “We have decided to use the online medium to get the ball rolling on all academic activities from next month as we will need to conduct a few degree exams in September.” Even as he gave a timeline for resumption of classes, Ashwathnarayan, however, cautioned that the state is awaiting detailed guidelines from the Centre regarding the resumption of offline classes and said the state would follow any additional directions that may be issued in this regard.Asserting that the state government was working with the sole intent of ensuring students’ interests are served, Ashwathnarayan said, “Once the academic year begins, final year exams will be scheduled for all undergraduate, diploma and engineering students. Backlog exams will also be conducted accordingly.”If the government goes ahead with the plan, the state is likely to be the first in the country to reopen in-person classes and academic coaching. Usually, the academic year for colleges in the state starts in June, which has been delayed this year due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/k-taka-plans-to-reopen-colleges-from-october/story-rNMjwTf3JTf5MzdQ60RNoK.html
27-08-2020||India||BJP’s Dubey asks Tharoor to cancel I-T panel meeting||Bharatiya Janata Party MP and member of the parliamentary panel on Information Technology, Nishikant Dubey has written to the chairman of the committee, Shashi Tharoor, seeking cancellation of the panel’s upcoming meeting claiming that its agenda is in contravention of the rules of the House. Dubey’s letter to the Congress MP comes a day after Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla wrote to the heads of all panels asking them to select subjects based on rules and keeping in mind the convention that the House does not discuss issues that are “pending in the courts”. “In this connection, I may like to bring to your kind notice that recently, your good self has convened yet another sitting of the Committee on 1 September 2020 to discuss the issue of 4G services in Jammu and Kashmir,” Dubey wrote in his letter on Wednesday. “Since this issue is presently pending before the Hon’ble Supreme Court… any further deliberations on this would again be a violation of the relevant rules/directions, as well as the recently issued advisory of the Hon’ble speaker.” Dubey and Tharoor have already sparred over l’affaire Facebook, where the social media company’s top lobbyist in India advised that the company not act against a BJP lawmaker whose posts violated the company’s standards on hate speech on the grounds that it wouldn’t go down well with the ruling dispensation., according to an investigative report in The Wall Street Journal. “The Committees should give due consideration to rule 270 and other necessary rules and directions while selecting subjects for examination,” Birla said in a letter, which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times. “In addition, I would like to point out that as per convention, the Committees do not take those subjects for examination where the issue is pending in the Courts.”According to rule 270, “a Committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records, provided any question arises whether the evidence of a person or the production of a document is relevant for the purposes of the Committee, the question shall be referred to the Speaker whose decision shall be final”.Moreover, the rule adds that the Government may decline to produce a document on the ground that its disclosure would be prejudicial to the safety or interest of the state.The Speaker’s letter came a week before the Information and Technology Panel is slated to discuss two contentious topics, the issue of Internet shutdowns in Jammu and Kashmir on September 1 and Facebook’s testimony over alleged bias towards the ruling party on September 2. The Supreme Court is still considering the matter of Internet shutdowns in Jammu and Kashmir. While the date of the next hearing has not been notified, on August 11, the Centre told the SC that 4G telecom services (including mobile internet) would be restored in the newly formed Union territory in a staggered manner after August 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-s-dubey-asks-tharoor-to-cancel-i-t-panel-meeting/story-1YB2bgxgIcGWgQGqHNL8DJ.html
27-08-2020||India||Pak rejects Pulwama attack probe charge sheet, calls it an attempt to serve domestic interest||Pakistan has rejected the charge sheet filed in the Pulwama attack probe, claiming it to be a ‘mischievous attempt’ to implicate Islamabad for the attack. It said that India has failed to provide credible evidence to support its claim and that it is meant to serve ‘narrow and domestic political interests.’A statement issued on Wednesday by the Pakistan Foreign Office says that it “categorically rejects the so-called ‘charge sheet’ by India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA), which mischievously attempts to implicate Pakistan in the Pulwama attack in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IIOJK) last year. The fabrications in the reported ‘charge sheet’ are patently designed to further the BJP’s anti-Pakistan rhetoric and its narrow domestic political interests.”“At the outset, Pakistan had rejected India’s baseless allegations and expressed readiness to extend cooperation on the basis of any actionable information. India failed to provide any credible evidence for its invective and has instead been using the attack for its malicious propaganda campaign against Pakistan,” read the statement.The statement added, “It would be recalled that Indian military aircraft engaged in belligerent action against Pakistan on 26 February, 2019. The Indian misadventure was effectively countered by the Pakistan Air Force, which resulted in the downing of two Indian warplanes and capture of an Indian pilot. Despite India’s provocations, the Indian pilot was released by Pakistan as a peace gesture.”It concludes by saying that Pakistan has been forewarning the international community about India’s use of “false flag” operation and possible ill-conceived misadventure.GVL Narasimha Rao, spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party, said, “Pakistan has been a habitual liar and denied its culpability in all such terror crimes despite clinching evidence. In Pulwama, NIA has presented clinching forensically matched evidence to nail the role of Jaish-e-Mohammad and Pakistan. There will be no takers for Pak’s lies either in India or internationally.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/charge-sheet-an-attempt-to-serve-domestic-interest-claims-pakistan/story-K1sxXNHwKg8n7H1lCmMdSP.html
27-08-2020||India||Pulwama bombers had international media in sight: NIA||Jaish-e-Mohammad Chief Masood Azhar’s nephew Mohammad Umar Farooq, who executed the February 14, 2019 Pulwama attack, wanted to target a team of journalists working for BBC who had gone to the residence of suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar to interview his father Ghulam Hassan Dar, according to the chargesheet filed by National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday. The federal investigation agency has referred to a February 21, 2019 conversation between Umar Farooq and his Pakistan based uncle Ammar Alvi, in which he sought permission to target the BBC journalists who were in the valley. He believed that the attack would give JeM more international exposure. Also read: Pak rejects Pulwama attack probe charge sheet, calls it an attempt to serve domestic interestTo be sure, the NIA has gone by the conversation of the terrorists. It is unclear whether foreign journalists were present at the valley at that time.Alvi, however, denied the permission to attack the journalists asking Farooq to “cherish the success of Pulwama attack for now”, according to charge sheet, which has been reviewed by HT. The charge sheet doesn’t mention the names of the BBC journalists. Alvi (46) has been named as a key handler of the Pulwama attack in the charge sheet, along with Farooq, Azhar, Abdul Rouf Asghar, and 15 others. NIA has found pictures of Alvi dating back to 2016 , where he is seen with Farooq at a training camp in Sangin, Helmand province of Afghanistan. The charge sheet adds that Umar Farooq, who was still holed up in Kashmir after the Pulwama attack, was “worried” when Azhar, and Abdul Rouf Asghar, were among 44 terror suspects taken into custody by Pakistan under international pressure soon after the suicide bombing. Also read: Photos, chats and a phone: How NIA cracked the Pulwama case“A handler at one of the launch pads of JeM, with whom Farooq was in regular touch with, informed him that ISI (Pakistan’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence) told them that the arrest was just an eyewash and their leaders would be released soon”, said an officer investigating the case quoting details of the charge sheet. The NIA has attached a transcript of this conversation in the chargesheet. In another conversation with the Pakistan based JeM leadership, Farooq (killed in encounter with security forces on March 29, 2019) praises the role played by Shakir Bashir Magray, a Kashmiri collaborator. Farooq, according to details accessed by HT, informed the JeM leadership that Magray did what Afzal Guru did for the group in the Parliament attack in 2001. Magray (24), a resident of Kakapora in the valley, was the first person to be arrested by NIA in the case on February 28 this year. The 200 kg IED used in the Pulwama attack was assembled in his house and he also conducted reconnaissance of CRPF convoys, arranged explosives, helped fit the bomb in the car and drove the suicide bomber to the attack site. The agency has found hundreds of video clips, voice notes and WhatsApp messages from Farooq’s phone in which JeM terrorists are seen celebrating, training and practising before they are sent into India. Some videos also show them discussing plans, and transfer of funds. According to the NIA chargesheet, Farooq spent a total of Rs 5.7 lakh Pakistani rupees (roughly Rs 2.51 lakh at today’s exchange rate) in arranging explosives and other items for the Pulwama attack out of a total of 10 lakh Pakistani rupee transferred into his two bank accounts in Pakistan’s Allied Bank Ltd and Meezan Bank, located across the border. It is not clear how he withdrew the money.  The central agency, referring to a United Nations’ report dated May 2020, said that JeM has close ties with Taliban and Al-Qaeda. It adds that JeM and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) facilitate the trafficking of terrorist fighters into Afghanistan, who act as advisers, trainers and specialists in improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Farooq was also trained in Afghanistan in 2016-17. It added that LeT and JeM were stated to have approximately 800 and 200 armed fighters respectively, co-located with Taliban forces in Mohmand Darah, Dur Baba and Sherzad districts of Nangarhar province. They operate under the umbrella of Afghan Taliban. NIA Director General Y C Modi said: “Our charge sheet is based on fool-proof digital, forensic, documentary and oral evidence collected against the accused in this dastardly and barbaric attack. The charge-sheet has brought on record the all-out involvement of Pakistan-based entities to carry out terrorist strikes in India and to incite and provoke Kashmiri youth”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pulwama-bombers-had-int-l-media-in-sight-nia/story-vviIjA1O9yFAjUJaxSKXRP.html
27-08-2020||India||Opposition battle-ready to take on BJP over key issues in House||From the slowdown in the economy and job losses, to the alleged mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic and the standoff with China in eastern Ladakh, the Opposition is getting battle-ready to take on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the monsoon session of the Parliament, according to multiple members familiar with the matter. HT reported on Wednesday that a truncated session is set to run from September 14 to October 1, as per recommendations made by the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs. Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla has called a meeting on Thursday to finalise arrangements to conduct the session during the pandemic.This may include the use of at least 10 display screens for live proceedings, placards to indicate names of parties, and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation in the air conditioning system. While the BJP has prepared its own game plan to counter the Opposition offensive, the Congress and the Trinamool Congress will soon hold Parliamentary Party meetings to deliberate and strategise on how best to take on the ruling party. The Union government is looking to clear 11 ordinances, HT reported on Wednesday, that expire after six months if not replaced by Bills, which need to be passed in six weeks. “Before Parliament begins, the Congress Parliamentary Party will meet and have a threadbare discussion about the best strategy to counter the BJP,” said Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. Trinamool Congress MP and spokesperson, Derek O’Brien, too said that the party will deliberate and decide what subjects to take up. “The main assertion is that the Parliament belongs to the Opposition and an appropriate amount of time should be given so that all issues can be addressed,” O’Brien said. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam MP Sumathy Thamizhachi Thangapandian and Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Manoj Jha, too, said that an adequate amount of time should be made available for discussion on the floor of the House. According to Chowdhury, the claims that China has occupied Indian territory in Ladakh will be a central issue in the proceedings of the House. The Congress has been attacking the BJP for being in “denial” about the incursion. DMK MP Sumathy also said that the government will have to answer for the “loss of the life of 20 Indian soldiers” in the bloody face-off with China’s PLA, which also lost an unspecified number of soldiers.“The Chinese statement clearly shows that there has been an incursion,” said Jha. “Then why is the government in denial, why are they fixated on a trial balloon diplomacy.” The parties also contended that the government has failed to adequately address the Covid crisis, leading to job losses across the spectrum, and especially for migrant workers. “Unemployment is at an all time high,” said Chowdhary. “The government will have to explain why the youth do not have jobs anymore.” The leaders argued that the government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis has had a cascading effect on the economy and the country, and called for a road map to fix the economy, something it has failed to do till now. Two other issues set to come up are passing of executive orders to clear the National Education Policy (NEP), the draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), and setting up the PM-Cares fund, though the Supreme Court last week ruled that money from the fund does not need to be transferred to the National Disaster Response Fund.“Why are there 11 ordinances? Has India become an Ordinance Raj,” said a TMC MP who asked not to be named.The leaders said that the turning of Jammu & Kashmir into a “virtual prison” will also be taken up, along with the issue that several states are not getting Goods and Services Tax dues on time.The RJD’s Jha said that the truncated session may limit the Opposition’s ability to question the multiple executive decisions taken by the government, while Chowdhury said that the House must not be “disempowered”, pointing to the plan to do away with Question Hour, which he said was “integral to the functioning of the House”.BJP MP Rakesh Sinha said that in recent years obstructionism and cynicism acquired centrality of opposition ‘ politics. Narendra Modi’s popularity graph went up not only in India but also in international arena due to his role to manage crisis emanated from Covid 19. He succeeded in isolating China in international fora by aggressively questions its policy of Expansionism.Director CSDS Sanjay Kumar said that the time will be utilised by the government to try and push their legislations through, but there is host of issues that the opposition can pick up. “The issues are related,” said Kumar. “A discussion on the failure of the government to handle the Covid crisis can easily lead to a conversation about the economic slowdown and the plight of migrants. The opposition will try and corner the government over it but whether they will be successful or not, we will have to wait and see.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-battle-ready-to-take-on-bjp-over-key-issues-in-house/story-d81KCcUjbSYoqieJ8Z2U5J.html
27-08-2020||India||Kerala CM Vijayan gives Sonia-convened meeting of Opposition CMs a miss||Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday gave the meeting of Opposition CMs convened by Congress president Sonia Gandhi a miss as both Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Kerala Congress leaders were against his participation, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. According to two top-ranking leaders of the Congress and the CPI(M), an aide of Gandhi called upon CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury seeking Vijayan’s participation in the meeting. Yechury wanted that the meeting be headed by a chief minister instead of the Congress president to avoid political overtones. However, “ the Congress wanted to utilise the meeting to project and further consolidate Gandhi’s pivotal position in the Opposition space after that intense internal tussle inside the Congress,” said a senior leader alluding to the recent Congress Working Committee meeting that was held against the backdrop of 23 Congress leaders writing to Gandhi seeking organisational changes. The CPI(M) general secretary also told Gandhi’s aide to check with leaders of Congress’s Kerala unit if they were ready to accept the participation of Vijayan, who is heading the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in the southern state, in the meeting, the leader quoted earlier said. After a few minutes, the Congress emissary called back Yechury to inform that Kerala Congress leaders were opposed to Vijayan’s participation, the leader said. Another leader pointed out that the Kerala is going to poll next year and state Congress leaders don’t want the party to provide any coveted platform to Vijayan. Both sides, however, maintained that both the Left and Congress would be part of Opposition’s plans to counter the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Centre in the upcoming monsoon session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijayan-gives-sonia-convened-meeting-of-oppn-cms-a-miss/story-F0dxiVtOS2AmPoke3vU8yJ.html
27-08-2020||India||Silent majority of students want exams held: Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’||Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal “Nishank” spoke to Amandeep Shukla about the government’s decision to hold the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and Joint Entrance Examination (JEE-Main) next month, the view by students and parents concerned about the pandemic that these exams be postponed, why the government is not considered alternative methods, and the assertion by Opposition parties that they will move the Supreme Court to have the exams delayed or deferred. Edited Excerpts:There was major meeting of opposition chief ministers and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday. The decision to hold the NEET and JEE exams has clearly become a major political issue.It pains to see that education is becoming politicised. I request my colleagues across the political spectrum to abide by the orders of the honourable Supreme Court. Leaving the politics aside, I would like to share that, a total of 7.41 lakh candidates out of 8.58 lakh appearing for JEE have downloaded admit cards. Only 332 candidates have requested for change of their centre cities, which are being considered positively. In reference to NEET, a total of 6.84 lakh candidates (out of a total of 15.97 lakh) have downloaded the admit cards in the first five hours. West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has said that if you don’t understand students’ problems, and that they will approach the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court, while dismissing the writ petition regarding the postponement of these examinations, also observed, inter alia, the following: “Ultimately life has to go on, and the career of the students cannot be put on peril for long and a full academic year cannot be wasted”. I would like to state that Parliament will start functioning, offices are functioning. In my opinion we have to ensure that there is no zero academic year in the lives of students. Some students say that the government isn’t being considerate, and it isn’t responding to an unprecedented situation and the plight of students.I feel that this government is very empathetic and considerate to the cause of the students. Academic career is very important, and a zero academic year will cause tremendous loss to the students.Every day, I get innumerable mails from the silent majority . The parents and students say that they are under stress and preparing for exams for the last two to three years and that they don’t want a zero academic year. They have been seriously preparing for the exams since January and the past two years. My request to all parents and students is to have faith in us about the safety of the examination centres. Is it not possible to move the exams ahead by another 30 or 60 days? Are you considering any such move?There is no certainty about when the pandemic will. The solution therefore is to move on with precautions. Why is there no other alternative being considered -- online entrance examinations, or normalising of marks from different board exams to facilitate direct selection?We need to have a transparent system of selection of students into the higher education system. The most transparent system is an objective test, and this has evolved over the years. If we tinker with the system and selection process, it is going to cause irreparable damage to the careers of the students. I have always reiterated that safety first and then exams. But conducting these exams any time later might lead to a situation where the entire year could be lost, therefore conducting these exams in now with due precautions is a middle path. What about students who don’t get centres of their choice -- how will they travel to the exam centre with transport and travel restrictions in various places?In the best interest of students, NTA has ensured that more than 99% candidates get their first choice of centre and cities in of these examinations. The number of centres have been increased from 570 to 660 (in case of JEE Main) and 2,546 to 3,843 (in case of NEET). In case of JEE Main, the number of shifts has been increased from the earlier 8 to 12, and the number of candidates per shift has been reduced from earlier 1.32 lakh to 85,000.Can you give details of how these safety measures were arrived at?NTA has defined a SOP based on recommendations of a high-level committee of medical experts, along with in adherence to various Government directives and Guidelines issues from time to time by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/silent-majority-of-students-want-exams-held-ramesh-pokhriyal-nishank/story-rlyODHwJVjPFpbGCm1P5NL.html
27-08-2020||India||Govt gears up to conduct exams despite chorus against schedule||Even as a chorus grew from the Opposition against the Centre’s schedule to hold the NEET and JEE entrance exams in September, the Union education ministry and the National Testing Agency (NTA) on Wednesday continued to work towards what would be the biggest entrance test to be conducted during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.According to another government official, who asked not to be named, the education ministry is keen that the exams are held because it will help keep the academic year on track and not keep the students in “perpetual uncertainty”. The official said there was no alternative to these exams, especially because colleges such as IITs and AIIMS were highly coveted.For JEE (Main), a total of 741,000 candidates out of 858,000 have so far downloaded their admit cards. Only 332 candidates requested for a change of their centre cities, which was being considered, a government official said on condition of anonymity. For NEET, 684,000 candidates (out of a total of 1.59 million) downloaded the admit cards in first five hours, since start of the process at 11.55am, the official added.The JEE (Main) exam will be held at 660 centres across India from September 1 to 6, while NEET candidates will take the exam at 3,842 test centres on September 13.The National Testing Agency (NTA) has emphasised that it will hold the exams safely and a detailed protocol has been put in place. Among the states which have questioned the move to hold the NEET and JEE exams are West Bengal, Delhi, Odisha and Tamil Nadu. These are states from which a large number of candidates are going to appear for the two exams.IIT Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao said in a social media post that he was in favour of conducting the examinations by taking all precautions and following social distancing norms. “Lockdown is not a solution to COVID. Lockdown was needed to prepare ourselves better. We cannot be perpetually in lockdown mode. COVID is not going to go away for another 6 months to one year. We all need to get used to this new normal. The earlier we realize that, the better it is for all of us. The last postponement of exams definitely helped us prepare well now,” Rao said.Professor Ajit K Chaturvedi, director, IIT Roorkee, said: “The JEE exams should be held as per their schedule in September 2020. A large number of students and their parents want the exams to be conducted and looking forward to the wait to end now. The pandemic has already disrupted the academic plans of many students and institutions and we don’t see the pandemic going away anytime soon. We should not let this be a zero academic year as it might have consequences on the bright future of several students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-gears-up-to-conduct-exams-despite-chorus-against-schedule/story-mbmsRJnYx2cVUXZfaKnq4M.html
27-08-2020||India||5 reasons why Delhi’s Covid-19 cases spiked||From the mental fatigue of wearing masks, to opening of markets, and the threat of a second wave, several factors can be behind the resurgence of cases that Delhi has seen in the past few weeks. A look five key reasons that can be behind the spurt.1. POOR MASK DISCIPLINEExperts have repeatedly pointed out the laxity across the city when it comes to people wearing masks. While the police have started enforcement of masks inside cars, mask discipline and enforcement remains an area where the Capital leaves a lot of room for improvement. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageData accessed by HT shows that nearly 175,000 people have been fined by Delhi Police for not wearing masks till August 23. “It is good that the people of Delhi have become confident, but it shouldn’t lead to complacency. People should always wear masks,” Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Wednesday.During the Union health ministry briefing on Tuesday, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Balram Bhargava had blamed people who do not wear masks for driving the pandemic in India. “I would say irresponsible, less cautious people who are not wearing masks and not maintaining social distance are driving the pandemic in India,” he had said. What can be done: Enforcement of mask regulations, including proper use with both the nose and mouth covered,must further strengthened. More awareness campaigns needed to emphasise on the importance of wearing masks2. REOPENING OF THE CITYOn top of the list of guidelines by World Health Organization for control of Covid-19, is the request to people against going to crowded places. “Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has Covid-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre,” the advisory states. This formed the backbone of argument in favour of hundreds of lockdown enacted across the world.The rise in cases in Delhi has coincided with the gradual reopening of city -- workplaces, markets, malls, restaurants, hotels and weekly markets. The last two have been opened just last week. There are also talks underway to open the Delhi Metro, which carries around 2.5 million people every day.“As per the second sero survey report, nearly two-thirds of the city’s population is still unexposed (thus susceptible to Covid-19)... And if you create opportunities for people to mingle, then it will increase the chances of transmission of the infection,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at ICMR told HT.What we can do: The government needs to ensure that the city opens carefully, and that social distance is maintained in shops, markets and public transport, be it buses or Metro3. PLATEAU IN TESTINGThe rise in cases has corresponded with the number of daily tests being on a near-steady drop from peak levels. The seven-day average for tests stands at 17,924 — significantly off the peak of 21,660, which was for the week ending July 9. HT first reported this plateau in a report on August 15 when experts raised questions about whether the Capital is getting complacent in its testing strategy.This drop in testing was acknowledged during Wednesday’s press briefing by Kejriwal, who said there are plans to double the numbers in a week – from roughly 20,000 tests to 40,000 per day.Another issue with Delhi’s testing has been the heavy reliance on antigen, or rapid tests, which are not as reliable as the gold-standard RT-PCR tests. While ICMR says that at an average, around 30-40% of tests across India are antigen tests, which give out a higher number of false positives. In Delhi, this number has averaged around 70%.What can be done: The government must maintain a very steady rate of high testing for a prolonged period of time and ensure that the number RT-PCR tests are increased, and that they are used at full capacity.4. STATISTICAL VARIATIONA common occurrence among all Covid-19 statistical analysis across the world has been that infections can rise and drop in spurts. Several factors such as incubation period, delay/lag in test results, and age of infected patients can push heavily influence the daily (and by extension, weekly) numbers emerging out of any area. For instance, the incubation period for Covid-19 can vary between one to 12 days, so the same people who got infected on a day can test positive as much as 11 days apart. Such variations in case rates have been visible throughout the world with cases rising and dropping in cycles. Countries such as Brazil and the United States generally see massive variation in daily data. Delhi had been one of those regions that had not seen major variation in daily cases. Therefore Delhi’s recent spurt in cases may also be connected to recent statistical spurt which may have been influenced by multiple factors.What can be done: Statistical variation can be countered by closely monitoring any change in datasets from the city such as daily positivity rate, reproduction factor, and doubling rate 5. SECOND WAVE COMING?Although the government and experts still say there is no second wave Covid-19 in Delhi, the chances of that happening in the not-too-distant future remains high. Several countries, including those that have been lauded by global health experts for their handling of the disease, have seen a resurgence of cases after bringing the first wave under control. A large majority of countries in Europe such as Italy, Spain and Germany have all seen second waves. The positive news, though, is that the second wave has been milder than the first in terms of total cases and has generally caused far fewer fatalities. Experts have warned that the recent spike in cases may be the start of Delhi’s second wave of infections.What can be done: If data in Delhi points to a second wave, then the government should not hesitate in shutting down parts of the city a second time to contain cases again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/five-reasons-why-delhi-s-covid-19-cases-spiked/story-uvqYQX8q1KzgvKQGdqLQjO.html
27-08-2020||India||Delhi at an inflection point in Covid battle||The Capital is at a crucial stage where it needs to act swiftly before the growing number of Covid-19 cases builds into a second wave, top health experts in the country believe, identifying the period from now till the festive season in October as a crucial window for infection control measures. There were 1,693 new cases reported on Wednesday, taking the average number of new cases over the last seven days to 1,375 -- the highest since the seven-day period ending in July 15. The proportion of samples turning positive has also been the highest it has been since then.“Delhi is at the crux where the rise in the number of cases can be controlled, if it is not controlled now, we can enter a second wave in a few months. People are fed up, and have become casual about using masks and maintaining social distancing, and we have to factor this in when planning a response to prevent resurgence,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi.“I would say 3,000 cases daily will indicate resurgence, we have to keep the number of daily cases between 1,000 and 1,500. Delhi’s R-naught (R0) has gone up, which suggests the disease is spreading. R0 has increased to over 1 from a low of 0.71 on July 27, Delhi should focus on keeping the R0 below 1, anything approaching 2 is a huge concern,” he said.R0 is the reproduction number that indicates the number of people infected by a single person. If the number is above 1, it implies the outbreak is growing. Once it breaches 2, the growth can become exponential. “With opening up, cases will rise, this is the only way as life has to go on. Around 30% people have antibodies, which means 70% are still vulnerable, and the only protection is wearing a mask. There are no short cuts as we don’t know how protective these antibodies are as these are not neutralising, which offer longer protection,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi. “There is bound to be some daily fluctuation … but the positivity rate is also rising, which is a cause for concern,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India. REOPEN SLOWLYThe experts said that encouraging discipline during the festive season – a period when people socialise and shop – will be crucial. “We should bring the R0 down to 1 to have stable numbers. Delhi has certainly done well, but opening public transport will pose a huge challenge. We all have to assume that everyone is infected and can transmit to us, and we can transmit to others. Keeping that in mind, we must use universal precautions,” he added. The strategy must focus on addressing economic considerations as well. “We need to have a relook at the strategy keeping in mind human behaviour, economic activity, and newer interventions, including partial lockdown being implemented in many states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and West Bengal,” said Dr Guleria. He added that now is not the time to reopen schools and more public transport. “Opening public transport further is not a good idea as the festive season is about to begin, where people begin meeting family, friends and markets and public places; it is human nature. Much like Ganapati celebrations in Mumbai, public celebrations must be low key with restrictions on gatherings, crowding in marketplaces etc,” he said. Data from across the world suggests cases have spiked wherever schools have opened. “Children and young children can’t follow social-distancing norms, India doesn’t have the capacity to control large classrooms,” Dr Guleria added. Crowding must be stopped till there are clear reductions in daily cases, the experts said. “The government must forbid crowding, including in the festive season, till we see the last of the virus. In Europe, the virus appears to have got milder, with cases rising in the second wave but deaths not increasing correspondingly. Its evolutionary biology, but it takes several months. We have to slow infection by changing behaviour by avoiding crowds so we nudge the virus to a milder form, eve as more people recover from infection,” said Dr Reddy. IMPROVE TESTINGThe turnaround time of test results must be reduced to 24 hours or less as the utility of testing lies in results being quick, particularly for RT-PCR tests. “Delhi needs to do more RT-PCR (reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction) tests, which currently accounts for around 30 of the total tests, ratio of RT-PCR ad antigen testing should be reversed,” said Dr Guleria, adding: “antigen tests have higher positivity in symptomatic cases and does not pick up infection in close contacts, asymptomatic and mild cases. It’s useful for point-of-care testing and containment zones to quickly quarantine and isolate patients, but doing it on a large scale has limitations”.FIGHT FATIGUEExperts said the government response needs to focus on leading indicators, like identifying outbreaks early, than lagging indicators like death, which occurs after the epidemic has taken seed. Even the number of known cases is slightly lagging because people develop symptoms, get tested, and have the test reported to government, by when it is likely been a few days. “The leading indicator is symptoms. The minute you find lots of people reporting symptoms, such as loss of smell, in any part of Delhi even before the tests come positive, you know that something is happening in this area, all the people in that area can be warned,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (Council of Scientific and Industrial ResearchHe agreed that public fatigue was a worrying factor, and that officials should consider a “smart, guided precautions communicated via a tool people trust”. “The closest thing we have to that is Aarogya Setu. But it must be made stronger so it adds value to people’s lives. Simply telling people to wear a mask is weak messaging, you have to value add so people get into the habit of checking their Aarogya Setu every time they step out to identify safe areas and avoid unsafe ones to help maximise mobility and minimizing risk,” said Agrawal. FOCUS ON RESOURCESClinical preparedness must continue to manage cases and save lives, said ILBS’s Dr Sarin. “Our job is to ensure people know they have to go to the hospital first, where they must get treated. We have plasma bank facility and if applied early in first72 hours, then definitely it gives benefits. I have always said that we have another year before we will settle down,” he said. On a hopeful note, Dr Reddy added behaviour change may not be as tough as it appears. “We have been trained to work from home, now we must learn to socialise and pray from home,” Dr Reddy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-at-an-inflection-point-in-covid-battle/story-FUdPLimhBOidYoFkJR7lJL.html

27-08-2020||Editorials||The importance of the monsoon session||After a long hiatus, Parliament is set to reconvene in a truncated monsoon session from September 14 to October 1. This newspaper has consistently argued that the pandemic must not halt the functioning of India’s most important democratic institution — and with safeguards, public representatives must meet to discuss key issues facing the country, pass laws, and hold the executive accountable. The fact that both Houses will meet is positive.But the key is ensuring that the session is productive. The government hopes to clear 11 ordinances in the session. The Opposition plans to raise questions on Covid-19 management, the Chinese incursion, the economic crisis and job losses due to the lockdown, the PM-Cares fund, the draft Environmental Impact Assessment policy, and the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. All these issues — the ordinances, many of which are to do with economic policy reforms, and the more general political, economic, health, and foreign policy concerns — are critical for India’s future. It is the government’s right to introduce legislations, and while it is the Opposition’s duty to point out the loopholes in these laws, the arithmetic of the House indicates that they will get passed. For its part, it is the Opposition’s right to raise questions which may have undermined public welfare and national security, and the government’s duty to listen, respond, and refine its approach. This is the true spirit of parliamentary democracy. At a time when India is facing multiple crises, both the Treasury and Opposition benches must behave responsibly, be accommodative, and engage with each other constructively — Indian democracy deserves no less.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-importance-of-the-monsoon-session/story-T2ProiZHvS86p0BBgmjyHM.html
27-08-2020||Editorials||In praise of government school teachers||According to reports about Unlock 4.0, the Centre is unlikely to allow the reopening of schools. Covid-19 has had a catastrophic effect on the education systems across the world. According to a United Nations (UN) report, the closure of schools has affected 94% of the world’s student population and up to 99% students in low and lower-middle-income countries. The pandemic has exacerbated the existing challenge for India — of weak learning outcomes, especially in government and low-fee private schools. There is, however, some good news. To ensure learning continuity during the pandemic, many government school teachers have come up with innovative and low-cost ideas. In Jharkhand, a teacher has put up loudspeakers so that children can learn sitting outside their homes. In rural Sikkim, a teacher visits her students one by one and takes impromptu classes. In Karnataka, many teachers are using community and open spaces for teaching. In Chhattisgarh, they are using loudspeakers to teach English through Halbi, the tribal language.Government schools teachers — who are often asked to do several non-teaching jobs and don’t get adequate in-service training (leave alone online training) — are censured for being ineffective and apathetic. But Covid-19 shows that some are just the opposite; they can innovate. The efforts of these teachers should be acknowledged and shared among their peer groups, innovative steps fine-tuned, formalised, and scaled-up as both responses to sudden disruptions and as an alternative to online learning till the digital divide is truly bridged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/in-praise-of-government-school-teachers/story-xVQHeajOkzVNl6M5jWrqoO.html
