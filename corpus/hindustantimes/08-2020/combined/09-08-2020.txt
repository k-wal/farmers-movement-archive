His appointment is seen by many as being in keeping with the element of surprise that marks decisions taken by the current government. Has Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi taken a huge risk by delegating this responsibility to Sinha? Is Sinha up to the task of dealing with this very challenging responsibility?The future can often be deciphered by looking into the past. Sinha is known as a person who has learnt the art of surviving in politics. In 1980, he contested and lost the Banaras Hindu University Students’ Union election. He tried again over the next two years and succeeded in 1982. Similarly, even though he lost a few Lok Sabha elections, he is a three-time former Member of Parliament (MP). The PM made him minister of state for railways in 2014 and later gave him independent charge of the ministry of communications. He did reasonably well in both portfolios. Modi was satisfied with his hard work, honesty and dedication. When Modi spoke at a public meeting in Ghazipur (Uttar Pradesh) during the 2019 elections, in a somewhat unexpected gesture, he asked the audience to first applaud Sinha. Despite this, he lost the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. There were indications that the Ghazipur parliamentary constituency was no longer a safe seat for him, thanks to changing social equations. The BJP leadership offered him another seat, but he wanted to fight from Ghazipur which he did and lost. For some time now, there has been some talk in the corridors of power in Delhi that Sinha would be given a suitable berth somewhere. But what he got last Thursday must certainly have exceeded all his expectations. In his trademark manner, despite being pushed into the background for a while, he has made a somewhat spectacular comeback. How effective will he be in his new post? To arrive at an answer, one has to look at the unexpected departure of GC Murmu, the outgoing L-G of J&K. As the first L-G, he did a commendable job on the law and order front in the Valley. But his manner of functioning did not go down well with the bureaucracy in the Union Territory (UT). This is the reason he had to return to Delhi in 10 months. He will now take up the new constitutional responsibility as the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG). In a way, it can also be called a promotion. But there is a difference between Raj Bhavan in Srinagar and just another government bungalow in Delhi.Murmu, a bureaucrat, was given a number of tasks to execute in J&K. But given the nature of the political and social initiatives he was required to undertake, it was clear that only a politician could have carried them out successfully. The situation in Kashmir is complex. Many people, including political leaders such as former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, are still under house arrest or behind bars. Another former chief minister Omar Abdullah has announced that he will not contest the assembly elections until statehood is restored to J&K. These two families have so far dominated politics in Kashmir. The Centre believes that the era of the Abdullah and Mufti dynasties is over, and that J&K needs a new brand of politics and politicians. Sinha now has the onerous task of giving opportunities to a new set of politicians who can connect with the elders and bring all sections of society together. He is a veteran politician and has been non-controversial till now. It will be interesting to see how effective his political style will be in the Valley.Kashmir has been a victim of terrorism for years. The day Sinha’s appointment was being celebrated by his supporters, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sarpanch was shot dead by terrorists in Kashmir. In the past, there have been frequent killings of democratic leaders in the Valley. The security forces have been caught up in a bloody war with terrorists there. So far this year, 206 people have been killed in Kashmir, including 34 security personnel. The long curfew and shattering impact of the Covid-19 pandemic have also devastated the UT which is already facing a huge economic crisis. According to Sheikh Ashiq Ahmad, president of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry, businessmen have suffered a loss of ~40,000 crores and over half-a-million people in the Valley have become unemployed. Recently, the business community met the home minister and the finance minister to apprise them of their demands and their distress. Given this dire situation, Sinha has his task cut out for him. The new responsibility is, in effect, a crown of thorns for Sinha. All eyes are now on how he will deal with the fractious UT. Can he convert this crown of thorns into a feather in his cap?

09-08-2020||News||The Opposition enables Hindutva||On August 5, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi set the process of the construction of a Ram temple at Ayodhya in motion. This is a moment of political triumph for Hindutva politics. And the euphoria in the Hindutva camp, especially the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its political affiliate, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is not surprising.What is disappointing, however, is the reaction of the secular camp. Its response can be described as empty assertions against the victory of political Hindutva, wishful thinking about a closure of such politics, or, just opportunistic celebration. Rahul Gandhi’s tweet trying to seek some sort of self-righteous, even metaphysical, solace by portraying Ram as opposed to the politics of hate and injustice fits the first category. The Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s statement lamenting that the bhoomi pujan should not have been made into a political event fits the second category. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s statement, and the response of most other political leaders, which celebrated the act in the hope that it will be used as an occasion to promote harmony and cultural affinity, fits the third category.None of these positions will worry the BJP. It will celebrate, and rightly so, the construction of the temple as the biggest political success of its larger ideological project. It is also naive to expect that the BJP will not use the Ram temple issue for future political gains. The BJP is not concerned about whether its opponents think of its actions as justifiable or not. What matters for the BJP is the view of the majority, which as of now, appears firmly with the party.The fate of secular politics in India, today more than ever, depends on whether or not its practitioners can explain its raison d’être to the Hindus. None of the mainstream political players are even trying to do that.To be sure, there has been a fourth kind of reaction as well; largely from civil society voices. It paints August 5 as an apocalyptic event of sorts, when constitutional ideas have been destroyed forever. Irrespective of whether one agrees or disagrees with this assessment, such a position necessarily entails an abdication of politics per se. If there is nothing left to save, what’s the point of doing anything?The collective despondency, captured by all the positions described above, is an alibi for the lack of political imagination and will of those who claim to champion the politics of secularism.The Ram temple movement was the beginning of a political experiment to achieve a majoritarian political consolidation, which, in turn, was aimed at capturing power. It brought immense dividends initially. But it does not explain the current dominance of the BJP. Nor will it guarantee that its fortunes remain intact. Political Hindutva, like all political ideologies, will need to keep renewing its ideological hegemony. It has so far managed this: The Ram temple movement in the 1990s, politicisation of the surgical strikes and Balakot attacks against Pakistan before the 2019 polls, the politics around the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, and annulment of Article 370 under the second Modi government are examples of continuous efforts to ensure this.This macro-politics is accompanied with a continuous simmering of religious polarisation, something Sajjan Kumar and Sudha Pai have described in detail in their book, Everyday Communalism: Riots in Contemporary Uttar Pradesh. The BJP has been shrewd in utilising each of these issues to impart dynamism to political Hindutva, and prevent it from becoming an ossified project. The so-called love jihad and cow vigilantism are good tools in rural and semi-urban centres. The party believed that they need not be unleashed in more posh urban settings, lest the middle classes get alienated. Even on the contentious issue of beef-eating, the BJP has shown remarkable tactical flexibility in states such as Kerala, where a large number of Hindus are beef-eaters.The Opposition, meanwhile, has singularly failed to counter this politics because its methods are confused and half-hearted. For example, the secular camp could have resorted to an intelligent-yet-peaceful symbolism to organise a protest on August 5. Those who oppose the BJP are not an insignificant number. Contrast this with how the BJP cleverly called upon people to light lamps, which ensured mass participation even in the times of a pandemic. Similarly, no mass campaign has ever been undertaken to counter cow vigilantes, even though it is common knowledge that even Hindus in the livestock economy have suffered due to this menace.It is easier to ascribe these problems to personality-centric deficiencies. That, however, is only the surface of the problem. At the root of the present crisis of secularism is a lack of conviction among its so-called vanguards about its political prospects itself. This is what explains frequent “tactical” resorts of buying peace with Hindutva via the public display of Hindu beliefs by politicians. It is these acts which have given legitimacy to assertions from the Right that the Nehruvian secular consensus, and not Hindutva, was the political fringe in India.Interestingly, Jawaharlal Nehru himself never took this consensus for granted. In his preface to Ramdhari Singh Dinkar’s Sanskriti ke Char Adhyay, written in 1955, Nehru warns Indian intellectuals against aping their English counterparts. He could see the former losing touch with the people, who were untouched by modern western ideas. Secularism, especially the concept of separation of the State from religion, is one of the core ideas of western modernity.The prerequisite to strengthening any political project is to first identify its weaknesses, rather than pretend that all is well. This intellectual integrity must be complemented with political conviction to address these weaknesses. Secularism’s current defendants, unlike Nehru, have neither of these qualities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-opposition-enables-hindutva/story-IOmIUxd76dLmkwr50rZ3DP.html
09-08-2020||News||Covid-19: An opportunity to create a more equal world | Opinion||The health and socio-economic crisis triggered by Covid-19 has hit women and girls differentially and disproportionately. There is increased feminisation of poverty, domestic work and care burden and 33% rise in domestic violence. Marginalised women can’t access health care, family planning and education and millions have lost jobs and income.The calamity also presents an unmissable opportunity to tear down all structural barriers to gender equality. We can usher in the New Normal of Gender Equality and Women Empowerment (GEWE) that feminists have dreamt of, along with that of the post-pandemic future. Governments, businesses and civil society must awaken Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 5 based seven interrelated chakras or energy centres to transform the post- pandemic world into a gender equal one. The first chakra is to forge gender-responsive disaster management, humanitarian response strategies and institutions. They must incorporate women’s needs and perspectives and their participation and leadership in all aspects. They must finance, target and customise relief and mitigation measures and make their empowerment vital to recovery and reconstruction.The second chakra is addressing what the secretary general of the United Nations termed the “pandemic of inequality around the world” from an intersectional feminist prism. Women’s socio-economic identities--race, religion, caste, age, class, multidimensional poverty, rural/urban and migrant status intersect, compounding gender discrimination. Addressing these holistically will have a force multiplier effect on human rights. A universal social protection revolution based on a new social contract is key. The objective must be to leave no one — no woman or girl behind, as per sarvodaya /antodaya and SDGs. The third awakens women’s economic empowerment for and through a gender-responsive national economic renaissance. This includes rebuilding infrastructure, agriculture, manufacturing, services and local, national and global supply chains and climate-resilient, green production and consumption through Atmanirbhar Bharat. These must integrate, foster, value and even privilege women’s skills, labour, enterprise and leadership in all sectors. Targeted and mainstreamed measures, incentives and transformative investments by the government and private sector are required.The fourth chakra must enable technological empowerment of women and girls to benefit from and contribute to an equitable new normal of an accelerated fourth industrial revolution and digitised world. Governance, infrastructure and investment must close digital and technology gender gaps. Women must be enabled to adapt to and benefit from frontier technologies from 5G and information and communications technology, artificial intelligence, robotics, to digital work, learning, payments, health and commerce.The fifth must ensure universal access to affordable, accessible and quality health care for all women and girls-- SDG 4. A revamped and expanded health, medical and pharmaceutical infrastructure and services with enhanced three to five percentage of the Gross Domestic Product investment must be powered by women’s agency and employment. It must comprehensively serve women and girls health care and health security needs especially sexual and reproductive health and rights. The sixth is 21st century gender-responsive education systems that must enable women and girls to achieve SDG 4 on inclusive and equitable, quality education for all. The New Education Policy (NEP) must close the persisting literacy, numeracy, primary, secondary, tertiary, higher education and skills-related gender gaps. Online learning has to complement in class learning in terms of accessibility and affordability of quality education to millions of disadvantaged women and girls. They can leapfrog into acquiring 21st century capabilities if the NEP fosters their multi-sectoral knowledge, vocational skills, STEM talent and employability. The seventh chakra of transformation is normative, cultural, and behavioural change at individual, societal, national and global levels. SDG 5 must be the template for overhauling and implementing post-pandemic policies and laws and for embracing new social and cultural norms based on progressive global women’s human rights norms. Gender equality is a proven public good and India’s gender equality dividend alone could add a trillion dollars to GDP by 2025.The case for invoking the Rig Vedic union of Prakriti and Purusha — Nature, Power and Will — for Shristii or Creation of a gender equal universe has never been more compelling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-an-opportunity-to-create-a-more-equal-world/story-kEEZeFa16MQgtAIxTZgE6L.html

In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, schools that used to invite parents to see how classes are conducted in person are now taking to virtual tours. The tours also give parents an idea about the sanitization procedures that schools are adopting to check the spread of the coronavirus. Some are also planning to complement these tours with physical tours with social distance measures post-admission.Admissions to private schools in Gurugram usually take place between July and October every year in a staggered manner with most deciding their own schedule and criteria. The new session usually starts between March and April of the following year. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, schools are exploring ways of conducting the admission process entirely online.Suncity School in sector 54 conducted its first virtual tour and virtual curriculum desk on Saturday. As part of the tour, around 100 parents were informed about various aspects pertaining to admission, school pedagogy, and the procedures it was adopting in view of the pandemic. “During the interaction, parents got the chance to send in their questions which were responded to,” said Rupa Chakravarty, director, Suncity School. “We have shared our safety guidelines. Once the admission is done, we will allow two parents to visit the school.”Manav Rachna International School, Sector 46, shows parents how it holds online classes. The school provides parents with a unique identification number through which they can access an online class and observe the activities on mute, said Dhriti Malhotra, school principal. MatriKiran School in sector 83 is also giving parents the option to choose from physical and virtual tours. “We are doing physical tours for interested parents one at a time only, and virtual tours for those wanting to avoid coming to the campus,” a school spokesperson said. Kunskapsskolan School is also exploring the possibility of providing both virtual and physical tours to parents applying for admission. “We are trying to facilitate school tours in a meaningful way. Parents will get the chance to opt for a physical school tour followed by a virtual interaction or a virtual tour of the school,” said Kunal Bhadoo, director of Kunskapsskolan Schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nursery-admissions-schools-complement-virtual-tours-with-physical-tours-for-parents/story-C5j3Sh6bmATdhB0UduL1QI.html

This is down from 883 patients a week ago, on August 2. At that time, Gurugram’s total reported infections stood at 9,245, indicating an average growth of 67 cases per day for the past seven daysHealth department officials confirmed that data now indicates a continued slowdown in new infections. Between July 26 and August 2, the district saw an average of 90 new cases of Covid-19 every day.“Week on week, we are seeing the growth rate come down. It is currently under one percent,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s (IDSP) district surveillance officer (DSO) in Gurugram.State health department data show the district’s daily growth rate to be 0.7 percent, which is the lowest in Haryana. Data also shows Gurugram to be one of just two districts in the state with a growth rate under one percent (the other being Jind, which is adding new Covid-19 cases at a daily growth rate of 0.9 percent).Gurugram’s daily test-posivity rate -- or ratio of new positives to new samples tested -- stood at 3.5 percent on Sunday, which is within the World Health Organisation’s recommended positivity rate of 5 percent or less. “We have sustained a TPR of below five percent for over two weeks now,” Sharma said.The WHO’s recommendation for lifting curbs on public mobility is a daily TPR of five percent or less, over a period of at least two weeks. Health department officials said that, over the past week, Gurugram’s TPR has been consistently recorded below 5 percent, and that it would likely remain thereabouts in coming days.Of the current tally of 663 active patients, 65 are hospitalised, while a majority (523 people) are under home isolation. This is down from 685 people under home isolation a week ago. Another 73 patients (down from 109 on August 2) are under observation at the district covid centre centres). In the past week, Gurugram reduced its burden of active patients by close to 24 percent.Gurugram on Sunday also recorded 100 new recoveries (down from 114 the previous day), taking the district’s cumulative recovery rate to 91 percent (from 89 percent a week ago). Sunday marked the ninth straight day when daily recoveries exceeded new positive cases.The district recorded no new deaths on Sunday. The mortality rate in the district, thus far, is 1.2 percent (down from 1.34 percent a week ago), with 125 fatalities.Gurugram on Sunday also collected 2007 new samples for testing, down from 2314 samples collected on Saturday. Of these, 338 samples were taken by private labs for RT-PCR tests, while the majority of remaining samples are those of RT-PCR and antigen tests by the health department.The doubling-rate stands at 84 days (up from 74 days a week ago), while active cases make up only seven percent of the reported case load (down from 9.5 percent a week ago).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-records-fewer-than-100-new-covid-19-cases-for-ninth-consecutive-day/story-EC5qhA2SJ14bTB5WR1jbwN.html
09-08-2020||City||Kejriwal inaugurates new 200-bed hospital, to be a dedicated Covid facility||New Delhi: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday inaugurated a 200-bed hospital in south-east Delhi’s Ambedkar Nagar, which would currently operate as a dedicated Covid facility.Currently, all 200 beds in the hospital are fitted with oxygen concentration system but it has no intensive care unit (ICU). The chief minister said that more beds and ICU facilities in the hospital would be added at the earliest.The hospital – which goes operational from Sunday – is the first public hospital in close vicinity of several localities other than Ambedkar Nagar which includes Dakshinpuri, Khanpur, Madangir, Tigri and large parts of Sangam Vihar. These are all densely populated localities -- mostly comprising unauthorised colonies with a mix of pockets of small apartments for the economically weak and scores of slum clusters.“There was no big hospital in this area and the nearby constituencies. And the idea of the construction of this hospital was conceived in 2013. I am happy that after many years, this hospital will be inaugurated today. 200 beds will be made operational today, and this hospital has a capacity of 600 beds. The hospital will further become operational in its full bed capacity and ICUs in the coming days. The 200 beds which will be made operational from today will be a huge aid in the treatment of covid patients. Oxygen is available on all the 200 beds, as oxygen is the primary requirement in the treatment of covid patients,” said Kejriwal. Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain was also present on the occasion.The new hospital took the Covid bed capacity in Delhi to 13,717, of which 3,061 were occupied as on Sunday evening, government records showed.“The Covid situation in Delhi is under control up to a great extent. The parameters in Delhi are good, the recovery rate is improving, the positivity ratio and death rate are decreasing. There are fewer patients who require hospitalisation. I hope that the 200 beds that have begun here in the hospital today are not needed in the future, but we have to be fully prepared. Everyone says that Corona is an unpredictable pandemic and no one knows what might happen tomorrow. Even though our situation is under control, but if the situation goes out of control again, the Delhi government is fully prepared to deal with the situation,” Kejriwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-inaugurates-new-200-bed-hospital-to-be-a-dedicated-covid-facility/story-yZSp3ayFCzu5G5Dj28e4pJ.html

Out of nowhere and without any provocation, they were attacked by around 25-30 locals from behind. They started hurling stones and bricks towards them, which resulted in a few of our workers getting injured, while some vehicles were also damaged. Later, a bunch of men armed with sticks and iron rods cornered one of our workers and started beating him up. We have been able to identify a few locals and have given their names to the police,” said Hariom Attri, joint commissioner, MCG. He further said that MCG will be clearing the remaining C&D waste from the site on Monday. In the same incident, a second FIR was lodged by Ajane Hiramani, a resident of Sikanderpur village.As per her son, Raja Singh, Hiramani was present at the site from which MCG officials were clearing waste and was leaning against one of MCG’s tractors when the stone pelting started.When the violence began, an MCG worker suddenly started his tractor and as the vehicle moved forward, the woman lost her balance and fell on the ground, sustaining injuries.In the FIR, Hiramani has further alleged that had she had seen four-five MCG workers beating up a local, and when people from the colony came to save them, the MCG officials fled the spot after threatening the locals.”“We are working on both the cases simultaneously. Based on MCG’s information, we have some leads and are investigating the matter,” said KK Rao, commissioner, Gurugram police.Thursday’s incident was the third time in the last two months that MCG officials had been attacked.Last month, MCG officials were thrashed by a group of people in Sector 70A when they had gone to take action against people who were illegally dumping sewage in the open.On June 1, two MCG officials were thrashed by two locals during a stray animal drive in Sector 52.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-sanitation-team-attacked-by-locals-in-sikanderpur-case-lodged/story-SvUskkM9Yh0La5flO3OXEI.html
09-08-2020||City||Delhi’s education board to be operational by next year; not to be imposed on govt schools: Sisodia||New Delhi: A new board of education for Delhi is expected to be operational by next year, however, unlike other states it will not be imposed on government schools, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Sunday.Sisodia said the board will be in sync with the reforms proposed in the new National Education Policy (NEP) and the focus will be on continuous evaluation and not year-end exams. “We have recently set up two committees for working on the proposed board as well as curriculum reforms. An ideal situation would be that we make it operational by next year. Initially, around 40 schools will be affiliated to the board, which could be either government or private,” said Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s education minister, in an interview to PTI.“What happens in other state boards is that the private schools are free to make their choice whether they want to opt for CBSE, ICSE or state board, while government schools follow the state board. We will not impose anything. Affiliation to the state board would be optional for both government and private schools. We want to make the board so enriching and useful, that there is demand for it,” he added.On July 15, the Delhi government had constituted two committees — Delhi Education Board Committee and Delhi Curriculum Reform Committee — to work on setting up the state’s own education board. In a statement, the government had said that the first committee will study global best practices in learning assessment, re-imagine current assessment practices and provide a roadmap for an innovative, student-friendly scheme of assessment to be followed by the new board. The second panel will study globally renowned best practices in curriculum and reforms and recommend what is best suited for Delhi.Sisodia said the Delhi government is studying the new education policy in detail. “We have already been working on some of the reforms proposed in it. There are a few anomalies but there are a few good things too. I have told the two committees that our board will be in sync with the NEP because as a nation we are together but the focus will not be on evaluating students once a year and discouraging rote learning in process,” he said.Asked about teaching in mother tongue or regional language as proposed by the NEP, Sisodia said, “I totally agree that the medium of instruction should be the home langauge in the initial years so that foundation is strong but I believe it should be limited to foundation years or pre primary stage. Taking it up to Class 5 is not a good idea.” Sisodia also came down heavily on the proposal of a common entrance exam for universities to be conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA).“Why do we need this duplication? We already have so much focus on board exams and immediately after that we will have another exam? The focus only on exams will no way take the emphasis away from the rote learning. In my view, it has to be either of the exams,” he said.The NEP approved by the Union Cabinet last month replaces the 34-year-old National Policy on Education framed in 1986 and is aimed at paving the way for transformational reforms in school and higher education systems to make India a global knowledge superpower.In its Budget 2020-21, the Delhi government had announced plans for curriculum reforms and creating a new board of education for the national capital.In his book ‘Shiksha: My Experiments as an Education Minister’, which was released in September 2019, Sisodia wrote that the current CBSE board syllabus is only “10% helpful” for students preparing for competitive exams. “The truth is that for students preparing for IITs and NEET, the syllabus of the Central board is only about 10 per cent helpful. The remaining is for students to navigate…Why can’t our school boards fill the gaps that coaching institutions are filling up? Why is there such a huge difference in the preparation for boards and entrance exams?” Sisodia says in the book.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-s-education-board-to-be-operational-by-next-year-not-to-be-imposed-on-govt-schools-sisodia/story-Y8aR9Fjkb6Kjc5Nw96nneK.html
09-08-2020||Gurugram||Workers protest against Centre’s move to change labour laws||A large number of trade union workers protested on Sunday against the Union government’s move to change labour laws and to the privatization of public sector units like railways, Air India, coal mines and several other sectors. The day was observed as ‘Satyagrah and jail bharo divas’ and workers marched from Civil Hospital near Sadar Bazar to Mini Secretariat in the city. They carried banners, placards criticising government and shouted slogans during the protest. Workers from a number of private companies based in the city joined in the protest.Anil Pawar, a senior leader of the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) alleged that policies of the present government had a very negative impact on the livelihood of workers who had lost jobs and were forced to migrate in large number to their home towns villages during the Covid-19 induced lockdown. Kumar said that privatization of PSUs, liberalization and similar measures were in favour of large industrial groups and capitalists at the cost of workers.“All trade unions participated in the march jointly to protest against the failure of the government in providing relief to workers and taking decisions in the pandemic that were drastic,” said Pawar.The workers also protested against the decisions of the government taken during the lockdown such suspension of labour laws, increasing the timing of work from eight to 12 hours, changes in labour rules, and making the essential services maintenance act more stringent. Shravan Kumar, district president of AITUC said that policies of the government were anti-workers and if it continues then a movement across the country will be started to oppose such decisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/workers-protest-against-centre-s-move-to-change-labour-laws/story-oCHiUw24lY9EMTMaqxIIVN.html
09-08-2020||City||In Nuh, students find digital divide a barrier too hard to cross||For the past four months, 9-year-old Neha has not been able to attend classes. The Class-6 student has been deprived of learning ever since a nationwide lockdown was imposed to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Her family neither has a smartphone nor a functional television set at home. In the absence of both these tools, she has been unable to access remote lessons amid the continued physical closure of schools. She now prays for the schools to reopen. “I haven’t been to school in four months. Ever since the lockdown was imposed, no teacher has called or taught me. A while ago, we were called to the school and handed over books for the new class. I go through the books and study on my own,” said Neha. She has three siblings studying in various primary classes in the neighbourhood government school in her village, Kheri Kalan. None of them has had any interaction with books or teachers in the past four months. With no access to smartphones, Neha’s family is pinning their hopes on the reopening of schools — the only seemingly plausible option for the family that struggles to make ends meet amid the growing financial uncertainty unleashed by the pandemic. Neha is among the hundreds of children in Nuh who have been left behind with schools taking the online route for teaching. While the pandemic has laid bare deep economic faultlines that run across the country, the impact of such disparities is almost universal in Nuh, which the NITI Aayog had ranked as one of the most backward districts in India in 2018. In an assessment based on multiple parameters such as education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, skill development, and infrastructure, Nuh, earlier known as Mewat, scored 26% — the lowest across the country. Currently, there are roughly 4,500 vacancies for teachers in the district and a serious shortage of local teachers. Taking cognisance of all these shortcomings, the district education department has started neighbourhood schools in various villages and also plans to use loudspeakers for relaying lessons in the coming days. Hindustan Times visited three villages across Nuh and spoke to students, parents, and teachers who are struggling to keep pace with the newer ways of learning, while coping with issues of economic uncertainty and poor internet connectivity.Smartphones remain a distant dream“My father has a small phone but it can only be used for making calls. One can’t study with a phone such as this one,” says Neha, pointing to a low-end Nokia phone with a broken screen. The family has a television set at home but that too is not in a working condition. Both her parents work at the brick kilns during the winter months and do odd labour jobs during the remaining part of the year. Neha’s mother, Sushma, said that the family can’t afford to buy a smartphone, as it was barely managing to survive. During the pandemic, the family has been managing with the meagre earnings that Neha’s father makes by working as a manual labourer in villages. “We don’t have the kind of phone that is needed for online learning. There is a TV set at home but we don’t have the money to get it repaired,” said Sushma, who goes by her first nameDespite the threat of the pandemic, she said that she would happily send her daughter to school if the government were to reopen learning institutions. “How many more months can she go without learning? If such a state of affairs continues, it will put an end to her dreams of getting educated,” said Sushma. Neha’s neighbour Manisha is among the rare few in the village who are able to attend school. The access has been made possible by a smartphone that was recently purchased by the Class-10 student’s father in a desperate bid to ensure that Manisha is able to continue with her education. It took a down payment of ₹500 for the family to purchase the phone that roughly costs ₹5,000. “Our teachers told us that classes will take place online and through WhatsApp till the time schools are closed. After waiting for a long time, my father decided to purchase the phone,” said Manisha, who studies in Government Girls School in Pinangwan, a few kilometres away from the village. Her father works as a construction labourer and heads out for work early in the morning, returning only in the evening. With only one phone in the family, Manisha only gets a chance to study after 7pm, once her father returns from work. Till midnight, she catches up on the lessons shared on the WhatsApp group of the class, completes her assignments, and sends it back to the teacher for review The family avails a data pack for ₹199 that lasts a month. However, more than the added costs of the data packs, the lack of electricity in the village is a bigger impediment. On the day that Hindustan Times visited the village, electricity had been missing for the past few days, said villagers. “Due to the erratic supply of electricity, keeping the phone charged becomes a challenge. Since the internet is being used on the phone, the phone runs out of charge frequently and we struggle a lot to get it charged once again. We go to houses that have electricity and request them to allow us to charge the phone,” said Geeta. Poor internet connectivityFamous for its historical mosque and fort, the picturesque village of Kotla village, flanked by the Aravallis, has many wonders but falls short when it comes to basics such as internet connectivity. With the terrain being rugged and mountainous, there are areas within the village where internet connectivity is erratic or missing altogether. Home to many low-income families, online lessons in the village have been undermined by the twin perils of affordability and connectivity. “Internet connectivity gets patchy as one goes further inside the village. People move out of the village or to some hilly terrain where network connectivity is better,” said Jan Mohammad, a village resident, who owns a smartphone. His younger brother, a school-going student, is among the many children who have not been able to access online learning in the past four months. “I gave my number to the school but we were never added to the WhatsApp group. My brother did not receive any notes in the past four months,” said Jan Mohammad. In the absence of classes, all that children do throughout the day is loiter, says Mohammad. “They loiter all around the village,” he says, as a group of children nods in agreement. Sitting under a tree, opposite the mosque, children murmur about classes or the lack thereof. “We are not going,” the 10-15 strong crowd says, when asked if they have been taking online classes. “We don’t have phones,” they respond in unison when asked to explain the absence from online classes. “What else do we do if not loiter around? Is it our fault that only those who have phones are being taught?” asks Parvez Khan, a Class-10 student of a government school. Like most children from the village, Parvez has remained disconnected from the school for the past four months. His father works as a truck driver and has been out of work for the most part of the pandemic.“I got a call from the school a few weeks after the lockdown was imposed. The teacher said that a WhatsApp group had been formed for the lesson and that I should join it for classes. But how could I join? I don’t have a smartphone that is needed for these online classes,” said Parvez. When asked whether he was worried about missing out on lessons in a crucial board year, Parvez said that he was helpless. “I haven’t seen books since the lockdown was imposed. Is it my fault that I am unable to study? Why is learning only reserved for those who have smartphones? Half the people in our village don’t have a phone,” says Parvez, as he looks around hoping to get an answer to the volley of questions he had raised. Community classes to the rescueTaking cognisance of the challenges of poverty and internet connectivity in the region, the district education department has started neighbourhood schools in various villages where local teachers are being asked to teach a small set of children while complying with physical distancing norms. Outlining the reasons behind the disruption of teaching in the region, district education officer (DEO) Anup Singh Jakhar said, “Education, the way it should happen, is not taking place. People do not have smartphones that are needed for the seamless delivery of online classes. In case families have a phone, they don’t have the money to invest in data packs for internet connectivity. There are some hilly areas where there is no internet connectivity,” said Jakhar. He said that since there were roughly 4,500 vacancies for teachers in the district, the department has reached out to educated persons in the neighbourhood apart from the local school teachers. Recognised as Shiksha Doots, these educated individuals are also being encouraged to take classes of children in batches of 15-20. “Private school teachers who are unemployed or students with Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees are being encouraged to take classes in their neighbourhoods during the pandemic,” said Jakhar. As per data shared by the department, there are 84 mohalla pathshalas and 104 Shiksha Doots across the district at present. The department also has plans to start teaching via loudspeakers in villages, where reaching out to children has been particularly tough. Local teachers lend a helping handEvery morning, at around 7 am, school-going children from the neighbourhood head to a makeshift classroom that has been running from the courtyard of Safi Mohammad’s house in Asaisika for roughly a month now. Mohammad, a government school social science teacher, rolls out the mats, cleans the blackboard, and places a sanitizer bottle at the entrance as he prepares for the class.One after another, children of various grades start trickling in and sit on the rolled out carpet at a considerable distance from one other. The walls of the makeshift classroom are adorned with different charts depicting the English alphabets, Hindi alphabets, numbers from 1 to 100, various fruits and vegetables, and a map of India. Mohammad starts with the lesson for the day, only to be interrupted by a phone call. “Yes, your son has reached the class,” he assures a worried parent on the phone before going back to the class. Sitting at a distance from one another, the students dutifully take notes while Mohammad scribbles on the board after every few minutes. The session lasts for two hours after which the second batch of students arrives for classes. Explaining the idea behind these community classes, he said that the initiative was started to make up for the loss of learning that students were facing due to various factors. “We are trying to cover as many children as we can but roughly 20% of children are able to take online lessons regularly. Most families do not have smartphones. We share notes but they don’t reach children due to which the results of online classes have not been very uplifting,” said Mohammad. These community classes have a strength of 12-15 students, who go to both private and government schools. While those who are connected to online classes in some way attend these classes for better comprehension and learning, for others these classes are the only connection with lessons. Apart from the community classes started by the government, educated individuals are also taking up the baton willingly in their respective villages. Arshad, a college teacher, who recently started taking classes for children in his village Kheri Kalan, said that children in his village were first-generation learners whose education had gone off the track due to the pandemic. “Children have been at home for months. Many of them can’t even hold a pencil properly. How will they keep pace with online classes? Most parents in the village are illiterate and can’t teach their children. I started these classes to extend support in some capacity,” he said. While children from the village have started joining these classes, the need for structured learning is felt heavily by the participants. Neha, who started attending these sessions last week said, “I have just started coming here and if there are doubts, I try to ask. I miss school and my friends though. Who knows where they are. It would be so wonderful if schools were to open. I will study and become a doctor when I grow up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-nuh-students-find-digital-divide-a-barrier-too-hard-to-cross/story-gQhg0xwiUelkkHuX6rpoYN.html
09-08-2020||Mumbai||Leopard spotted near Andheri society, forest department sets up trap cages||After a leopard was spotted along the boundary of a residential area, near JB Nagar in Andheri-MIDC area (East), the forest department has now placed three trap cages at an abandoned factory, adjacent to the society on Sunday.According to the forest department, the local security staff of Kanakia Atrium-2, spotted a leopard between 7.30 and 8am moving along the boundary wall of the residential complex. The complex is adjacent to an approximately 20-acre area that houses an abandoned factory - Vazir Glass Factory - where forest officials believe the leopard could be hiding.“The security staff informed the local police that further called upon the forest department. With our teams on the spot since Sunday morning, the leopard has not been seen so far. If the animal is in the same location, it will be trapped within the next two to three days,” Jitendra Ramgaokar, deputy conservator of forest, Thane.Teams from the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, Mumbai and Thane forest range, and animal rescue groups were at the spot during the day, while two officers from Mumbai Police patrolled during the night. Three trap cages have been installed and 10-12 camera traps are placed across the abandoned warehouse to track the animal’s movement. A team of forest guards have been deputed at the residential complex while the area has been sealed.Ramgaokar said that factory premises had a dense green cover and thus the trap cages had been strategically placed. “However, since no movement has been noticed, it could be possible that the animal may have left the area in the morning itself. We have to wait and see,” he said.Another forest official said the society’s CCTV cameras were not working. “An animal’s pug mark was spotted on the society’s wall towards the factory side. However, the footage could have helped us understand its probable movement. The factory premise has been shut for over two decades and there are several areas covered by vegetation where the leopard can take shelter through the day. If there is any movement, it will happen only during the night,” the forest officer said.Last year in April, a leopard was rescued at the end of a three-hour-long operation after the animal entered a residential area in Marol, Andheri (East). Since 2017, there have been six such instances of leopard rescues from residential areas in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). SGNP and surrounding areas including Aarey Colony are home to an estimated 47 leopards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/leopard-spotted-near-andheri-society-forest-department-sets-up-trap-cages/story-Hnn0M1XrSEtAzkjN9RWhLJ.html

Orange and yellow alert for the state for August 9-10 respectively by IMD. On Monday, the MeT department predicted that light to moderate rainfall or thunderstorm is likely to occur at most places in Pithoragarh, Bageshwar, Nainital, Champawat, Pauri, Dehradun, Haridwar and Tehri districts and many places in Almora, Udham Singh Nagar, Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Uttarkashi districts of Uttarakhand. In Uttarkashi district five villages of Mori block have been cut off since past ten days after connecting bridges broke due to heavy rainfall. The five villages; Osla, Gangad, Pawani, Dhatmir and Srigad in Mori block are located about 220 km away from the district headquarters. The villages were connected through a bridge over a stream. The villagers have since been commuting using broken logs as a makeshift bridge. Sohan Singh Saini, sub-divisional magistrate of Purola under which the area falls said that concerned officials have been asked to look into the matter and repair the bridge at the earliest. On Sunday afternoon, the Badrinath highway was also blocked after a landslide was triggered by rainfall at Lambagad region, a landslide-prone area. Till Sunday afternoon, around 12 roads were blocked in the Chamoli district, where work was underway to open them. Due to the intense rain, a large tree uprooted and fell on the road near the kindergarten on Lal Bahadur Shastri Administrative Academy Road, blocking the road in Mussoorie. A mild landslide was also reported from the Mussoorie-Dehradun highway on Sunday.

The incident became one of the talking points in Malda district on Sunday. Jayanta Pramanik, the contractor who hails from the Pandalpara area of Chanchol sub-division in Malda, said, “In 2015-16, I constructed the bungalow of the sub-divisional officer of Chanchol. Later, I carried out several other construction works at the same site. The executive engineer’s office took Rs 10 lakh from me as security deposit. The PWD office neither paid me for the work, nor has released the security deposit.” That’s not all; he added that bills for work done in 2019 were also unpaid.“Around the Lok Sabha election in 2019, I carried out some infrastructure development projects but till now, the SDO’s office has not cleared the bills which amount to Rs 45 lakh,” Pramanik said. The contractor claimed that he had to borrow money at high interest rates to carry out the projects. “The lenders are pressuring me to repay. I have already sold my wife’s jewelry to raise money. I cannot even provide two square meals a day to my two daughters, my wife and my elder brother. I can’t bear their pain anymore and have appealed to the President and the CM to let us end our lives.” Pramanik alleged that on July 7, the SDO seized his car when he went to the latter’s office and insisted that his dues be cleared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/let-me-die-with-family-contractor-awaiting-dues-from-bengal-govt-writes-to-president-cm/story-2pR5fl2GaSm0LSoxlsXzCM.html
09-08-2020||Mumbai||140 species of butterflies recorded at Matheran, almost twice as many after 125 years: Study||Researchers have identified 140 species of butterflies from Matheran, over 80km from Mumbai, during an eight-year-long study.This is the first dedicated checklist of butterflies after 125 years, at the only pedestrian hill station in Asia that documented twice as many species. The last checklist was by British researcher JA Betham who documented 78 butterfly species in 1894-95.The latest findings were published in a research paper - Finding the Forgotten Gems - in the Biodiversity Data Journal published from Bulgaria, on Saturday. The study was carried out by Mandar Sawant and Nikhil Modak from Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) along with Sagar Sarang from Somaiya College, Vidyavihar.With 140 species belonging to six families, the current list includes 15 species protected under various schedules of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, including crimson rose, orchid tit, and Daniad eggfly listed under schedule I (protection akin to a tiger or leopard). Additionally, 16 locally very rare species, 11 rare, 20 uncommon, 49 common and 44 very common species were identified. The top 10 very rare species include - orange-tailed awlet, orange awlet, Tamil spotted flat, plain banded awl, common sergeant, rustic, double branded crow, orchid tit, plain puffin, and large oakblue. Among these, the double branded crow was identified for the first time and there has only been a single sighting so far in March 2019.Matheran covers an area of 214.73sqkm and has a buffer area (eco-sensitive zone) ranging from 0 to 200m. Its resident population is 4,393, according to the 2011 census.Carried out between 2011 and 2019, the researchers studied butterfly distribution across 7sqkm of Matheran covering forest areas, hill slopes, mud patches and other habitats. “Rising tourism at this hill station threatens the local biodiversity and has already led to habitat fragmentation,” said Sawant adding, “Concretisation in the form of paving of roads, building resorts and other development associated with tourism combined with littering of waste such as plastic and alcohol bottles by tourists is a concern.”Sawant added that it had begun affecting mud-puddling, a behaviour associated with insects that suck nutrients from wet or moist soil as well as natural organic matter including rotting plant or animal carcasses. “Littering is leading to water pollution and during the months of January to March, the polluted water is making the soil hard altering the puddling behaviour,” he said.Meanwhile, the study broke down findings into seasonal patterns for butterfly species composition and their activities. A novel coloured barcode system representing data, seasons and activities along with photographs was developed. “Anyone intending on visiting Matheran during any season will be able to identify species they spot using this checklist,” said Sawant.Eminent conservationist and chairman, iNature Foundation Isaac Kehimkar lauded efforts by the researchers. “By saving their pocket money and surviving on snacks, these youngsters have brought out an elaborate checklist and getting it published. Their efforts are inspiring and stand testimony of dedication over eight years. These studies highlight the need to preserve such eco-sensitive areas while ensuring sustainable tourism with local people involved,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/researchers-record-140-species-of-butterflies-at-matheran/story-ZW8hIcWCSV5UGi6oPN88kJ.html

The positivity rate determines how many people are turning out to be positive out of those tested for Covid. ”The local administration has been asked to take appropriate steps,” said Tope. The district till August 8 has reported 9,991 total Covid positive cases.Tope along with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief was in Karad on Sunday to review the pandemic situation in Satara and Kolhapur districts. “We reviewed the situation in both districts, where the Covid cases are growing rapidly and as a result the doubling rate is low. As far as Kolhapur is concerned, the positivity rate is 35 per cent which is highest in Maharashtra,” said Tope while stressing that administration needs to increase contact tracing and testing of people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolhapur-s-positivity-rate-highest-in-state/story-YoGYPftyI3hzwZuhyDAWfK.html
09-08-2020||City||Noida begins treatment of sewage generated in low-lying sectors||NOIDA The Noida authority has started treating of sewage collected from the city’s low-lying residential sectors. The move comes months after the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) directives on the disposal of sewage in the city.The NGT, in an order dated February 25, had directed the Noida authority not to discharge waste water into drains as it pollutes the Yamuna river. Since then, the Noida authority started taking effective measures to treat the waste water, said officials of the authority. Using sledge sucking machines, either the sewer is dumped into nearby master sewer line or transported to a sewage treatment plant (STP), said the officials. The authority has a total of six STPs -- two each in sectors 50 and 54, and one each in sectors 168 and 123.“With an aim to ensure that no untreated sewer is dumped into any stormwater drains, the authority has started taking adequate measures. We have connected community toilets and individual rest rooms built by us with master sewer line so that the sewage is treated properly. Since February this year, we started trapping the sewer from low-lying areas, treating the same and then dumping it into drains or using for irrigation purposes,” said Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty, Noida authority.According to the officials, the authority has 22 sewage pumping stations to pump out the sewer from residential areas. The pumping stations are installed in low-lying areas such as sectors 14, 14A, 15, 15A, 16A, 34, 35, and 1, among others, where gradient of the existing sewer line is such that it cannot be connected to master sewer line. Earlier, the authority used to pump out this sewer into nearby drains, which are connected with irrigation drain that is emptied into Yamuna, thereby causing pollution.“But now, we have taken steps to transport this sewer to nearby master sewer line for proper treatment,” said Tripathi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-begins-treatment-of-sewage-generated-in-low-lying-sectors/story-UAq9Bqo8y73unmPTo26wZK.html
09-08-2020||Noida||Intense rainfall expected in Noida on Monday||According to the predictions of the weather department, Noida and Ghaziabad will experience moderate to heavy spells of rain from Monday to Wednesday.The maximum rainfall is expected on Monday and Wednesday. “Moderate or heavy rainfall of high-intensity (long durations) is likely to be witnessed across NCR region and western Uttar Pradesh, including Noida and Ghaziabad, on Monday. The intensity may drop on Tuesday, but the rains will be in the moderate category. The mercury levels will drop as well,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting center, India Meteorological Department.Rainfall below 15mm is considered light, and between 15 and 64.5 mm is categorised as moderate, and above 64.5mm is heavy rain.Weather analysts have asserted that the monsoon line of trough – a low-pressure line that oscillates around Delhi and brings rains to the regions – has shifted back towards the Delhi-NCR region bringing chances of heavy rainfall.The Noida district has recorded a deficit of 93 percent in rainfall this year. Since June, it has received only 19.5mm rainfall against the expected 291.6 mm. Neighbouring Ghaziabad district too saw a deficit of 73 percent, and has received 78.4 mm rainfall against expected 291.6 mm.With the predicted rainfall, the maximum temperature is likely to fall over the next three days, and is expected to hover around 33 degrees Celsius on Monday. On Sunday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 37.6 degrees Celsius, a notch above the season’s average, against 35.7 degrees a day earlier.Sunday remained to be highly humid, with parts of NCR seeing patchy rains with an average rainfall recorded at 1 mm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/intense-rainfall-expected-in-noida-on-monday/story-jJzVEfEAwHYoA3RuNVhKIM.html
09-08-2020||City||Hindon water quality deteriorated during the lockdown period, reveals data||Ghaziabad: While the water quality of rivers like the Yamuna improved during the lockdown period, the situation with its tributary – the Hindon – was somewhat different. Data of the Uttar Pradesh pollution control board (UPPCB) revealed that although levels of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the river were high during the first three months of the year, they deteriorated during the months of April, May and June.According to the official figures of the UPPCB, DO levels in the river at a monitoring location at Karhera in Ghaziabad stood at 2.0 milligrams per litre (mg/l), 2.4 mg/l and 2.0 mg/l in January, February and March, respectively. However, DO levels deteriorated to .62 mg/l, .8 mg/l and .73 mg/l in April, May and June, respectively. The biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) at Karhera stood in the range of 9.0 mg/l to 19 mg/l between January and June.According to officials, DO is one of the vital parameters to assess the health of a river and should be higher than the BOD. They added that DO levels of 4 mg/l or more is suitable for propagation of life in the river, while BOD is the amount of dissolved oxygen needed for organisms to break down organic material present in water. At the other downstream location – Mohan Nagar – the DO levels ranged between 1.5 mg/l to 1.87 mg/l from January to March while the levels deteriorated and stood between .48 mg/l to .9 mg/l from April to June. The BOD at this location however was higher than that recorded at Karhera and ranged from 12 mg/l to 25.3 mg/l during the six months. Further, the DO levels were zero at the downstream location of Chijrarsi during January, February, May and June, barring presence of 1.7 mg/l found only in the month of April. The BOD, on the other hand, went further high and ranged between 20 mg/l to 45 mg/l, therefore bringing down the dissolved oxygen levels.“It is ideal that BOD should be low and it will help in getting higher levels of DO. Higher DO levels indicate better river health. The lower levels of DO during the lockdown period is due to the fact that the river Hindon has no ecological flow of water of its own and is primarily dependent on rainfall or water flow from other sources like canals,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UPPCB. “During the lockdown period in April and May, majority of industrial units and commercial activities were closed but the untapped drains in Ghaziabad continued to pour in discharge. So, the DO levels were low with no fresh flow of water in the river. The increasing trend of high BOD levels starting at Karhera to Chijarsi also lowered the DO levels. It could be possible that the DO increased infrequently in between (like at Chhijarsi in the month of April) due to some rainfall activity,” he added. The experts on the other hand expressed surprise over the scenario. “While the rivers across the country showed improvement in water quality, the deterioration in the water quality of river Hindon is surprising. The figures indicate diminishing DO levels with increase in BOD levels. The figures, however, do not show the chemical oxygen demand (COD) which is generated from chemical effluents, etc. It is a thumb rule that COD will always be higher than BOD, about 2.5 times or higher,” said Dr Chandravir Singh, a retired scientist of the Haryana pollution board. COD is a measurement of oxygen required to oxidize soluble and particulate organic matter in water Singh, the convener of Doaba Paryavaran Samiti, in 2014 and 2015 filed two petitions with the National Green Tribunal and raised the issue of contamination of river Hindon water due to effluents discharge by industrial units, and about the contamination of groundwater in catchment areas. “The figures show that the DO levels remained high in the upstream location of Meerut during the lockdown months of April, May and June while the DO levels deteriorated in Ghaziabad stretch (downstream). With the figures of the UPPCB, it seems that despite the closure, there was water discharge in river Hindon and probably the industrial units were also running in Ghaziabad. Together, the higher COD and BOD lessened the DO levels as a result,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hindon-water-quality-deteriorated-during-the-lockdown-period-reveals-data/story-9kWBVUfcVBqhHrKqdcmEYP.html
09-08-2020||City||Ganga canal mishap: Trying to help victims, man loses ailing infant daughter||Ghaziabad A family from Masuri, who was on the way to get their ailing baby girl admitted to a hospital in Delhi on Friday night, spotted the car that plunged into the upper Ganga canal at Masuri in Ghaziabad. Salman Qureshi and his family soon decided to help out the car’s passengers, but in turn lost his infant daughter. Salman, 26, helps out his elder brother Ashim Qureshi who operates a hotel in Masuri. Salman’s six months old daughter was down with high fever and a hospital in Ghaziabad asked them to take her to Hapur. The family, including Salman and his wife, his brother, an aunt and a nephew, headed to Hapur in their SUV, a white Scorpio, around 10.30pm on Friday. “In Hapur, a doctor told us to go to Meerut. In between, my sister-in-law called and advised that we should take the child to Delhi. From Hapur, we headed to Delhi. It was around midnight when we reached the Ganga canal. My nephew, Shadab, who was in the rear seat, shouted that he had spotted a car in the canal. I stopped my car and came out to have a look. The tail-light of the car in the canal was still on. We tried calling police control room number but it did not connect. Then we looked for a PCR van but could not locate any. Thereafter we turned the SUV back and headed to the police station,” Salman said. At the Masuri police station, the cops upon information by the family sent out a wireless message to the PCR vans to check the incident site. “From the police station we drove back to the canal in order to find if anyone was still alive. By then, the car had plunged completely into water. Soon, a police team arrived and was not satisfied with what we had said about the incident. Suddenly, we spotted a man near the banks. The cops pulled him out. The man said that there were three others with him and two had managed to climb onto the car, but could not recall anything thereafter,” Salman added. While the two brothers also moved along the canal to find out three others, they ended up losing precious time in getting the infant child to a hospital in Delhi. “We lost about one hour to the incident. But I thought that helping out others was worth and the almighty may help my ailing daughter. Then I sped the car to a hospital in Ghaziabad and later to Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya at Geeta Colony in Delhi. While I got the documents prepared, my wife came running and told me that our daughter was not responding. She had succumbed,” Salman said. The child was second daughter of Salman who got married four years ago. Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural), said, “Qureshi’s family had come in their car to the police station and informed us about the incident at the canal. They had also said that they were on way to get treatment for their daughter but stopped to help the four men. As a result, we could save one of the four on the spot. Unfortunately, Qureshi’s daughter died when the family reached the hospital in Delhi. Without his help, we may have not got clues to the accident as there is heavy flow of water in the canal.” Two bodies recovered from canalThree persons had gone missing when their Swift Dzire car carrying four men plunged into the canal at Masuri on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday. The four men from Bareilly were on the way to Chandigarh for their work. The one survivor who was saved with efforts of Salman and the local police was identified as Paramvir Singh, 28, while three others, Ashish Dhyani, 30, Sanjeev Kumar, 44, and Vinod Kumar, 30, had gone missing. The police continued with the search operation for the three missing men on Sunday, and said that they recovered two bodies from the canal. “The bodies of Ashish Dhyani and Vinod Kumar have been recovered. Both were found about 500 metres away from the incident site. We are still trying to trace the third missing person,” Jadaun added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ganga-canal-mishap-trying-to-help-victims-man-loses-ailing-infant-daughter/story-EUYNNQIoWC0oZJwKOB9VAP.html

09-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Zonal centres to come up for Covid patients in home isolation||Ghaziabad: In order to deal with the rising number of Covid-19 cases, the Uttar Pradesh government has sent revised guidelines to the Ghaziabad district, directing setting up zonal centres to cater to asymptomatic patients in home isolation. At present, the assessment, monitoring and referral of the patients who opt for home isolation is done through the Integrated Covid Command and Control Centres (ICCC) which have come up in districts across the state.According to figures of the state health department, about 18,412 out of the 47,890 active patients in UP are under home isolation while 155 have opted for semi-paid isolation in hotels and 1,373 are in paid private facilities. In Ghaziabad, 410 patients have applied for home isolation since July 21 and 377 were allowed after assessment of conditions, till August 8. About 118 of them have completed their 10-day home isolation period while 236 people are still in isolation and 23 were referred to Covid facilities.Semi-paid facilities refer to hotel isolation facilities which is available at nominal rates on the basis of single occupancy and double occupancy, in which government healthcare staff provides care to the patient. “In order to better monitor the rising number of patients in home isolation, the districts will set up zonal offices where a team of doctors and staff along with a rapid response team will be stationed and work in two shifts from 7am to 11pm. Upon information of positive patients from the ICCC, the zonal offices will make assessment over phone whether the patient needs home isolation or needs to be sent to a Covid facility,” the order by Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health), said.The new directions mandate that the zonal centres will assess patients, inspect whether their houses fulfil criteria for home isolation and teams from the zonal centres will also maintain the daily health status of the patients and also upload it to the state portal.Till now, the coordinated works were done through ICCC but are now decentralised. Even the rapid response teams were sent to the patient’s house through ICCC while another set of doctors taking daily health status of the patients were also stationed at the ICCC.The new directions have, however, not undermined the role of the ICCC which is operational round the clock. The ambulance booking facility will be taken care of by the ICCC. The directions said that it can also intervene in case of emergency situations. The zonal offices will also keep ICCC posted about the daily developments. In case any home isolated patient develops health complications, the zonal offices will immediately inform the ICCC so that their referral to a Covid facility is ensured. “We will come up with the zonal offices at different locations and they will work in complete coordination with the ICCC which is setup at the district headquarter. We have defined the zonal areas with the help of three police stations each under one zone. In all, we have divided the district under six zones. The role of the ICCC is to centrally supervise different activities like surveillance, patient referral, home isolation and supervising functioning of survey teams, among other activities,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Home isolation was allowed by the UP government through an order on July 20 which based the facility on the basis of certain criteria. The conditions for home isolation include an undertaking from the patient, a consulting doctor to declare the patient asymptomatic, round-the-clock availability of a caregiver for the patient, a minimum of two toilets at home and a separate isolation room. Patients are also required to purchase pulse oximeter, thermometer, mask and gloves, among others. The new directions have also fine-tuned the ambulance facility. The order said that one house should be treated as one unit and any number of Covid-19 patients from one house should be taken to Covid facility in the same ambulance. The order said that there was time delay in picking up several patients from nearby houses and such arrangement is not feasible. Earlier in last week of June, the state government had issued directions that no ambulances will be provided to the patients for home drop after they get discharged from Covid hospitals. The government had earlier directed that ambulances will ferry only patients and not to be used by healthcare staff for field duties. Officials said that to facilitate the referrals, Ghaziabad district has 19 dedicated ambulances, including two life-support ambulances, which are running round the clock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-zonal-centres-to-come-up-for-covid-patients-in-home-isolation/story-NEi3skB3QC4r0YTYGtb2pK.html

As per the building bylaws-2010 of the Noida authority, each group housing complex must set up a sewage treatment plant (STP) on its premises to treat the waste water before being disposed of. “In violation of norms, many group housing complexes are dumping their sewer into drains that empty into the Noida’s biggest drain, irrigation drain, which meets Yamuna. In our inspection, we found that five housing complexes did not even set up the STP and the remaining societies, out of 33 under scanner, were having technical violations,” said Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty, Noida authority.From August 2 to August 6, the authority’s three teams -- each consisting of a senior project engineer, a project engineer and a junior engineer -- conducted inspections at the 33 housing complexes in sectors 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 and 79, among others, officials said, adding that most of these societies either did not have functional STPs or partially treated sewage.“The teams found out that 28 societies had STPs, but they were not functioning as per rules. We have started the process to calculate the penalty against those engaged in violations of the directions of the National Green Tribunal. We will calculate the penalty on the basis of scale of violations,” said Tripathi.Apart from this, the authority will also write to the UP Pollution Control Board, Central Pollution Control Board and the NGT about these societies for further action, the officials said.There are a total of 130 housing complexes, which got occupancy certificate from the Noida authority. The officials said that there is a need to inspect all the societies if they are using STP to handle waste water or not.“We aim to finish inspection of remaining societies in the next two months. Our objective is to ensure that the city’s untreated waste water is not dumped into drains, which empty into the Yamuna river,” said Tripathi.In its February 25 order, NGT had directed the Noida authority not to discharge the untreated water into drains as it pollutes the river.The residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) have welcomed the authority’s action against the violators. “The Noida authority must take strict action now to ensure that all housing societies adhere to norms and make their sewage treatment plants functional, as non-compliance is polluting drains and the Yamuna. Housing complexes are flouting the rules for long,” said PS Jain, president of Confederation of NCR RWAs, an umbrella body of RWAs.Vikrant Togad, an environmental activist from Greater Noida, said, “The Noida authority must carry out regular inspection and ensure compliance because dumping of untreated sewer water into drains is causing huge pollution not only to the river but also to the groundwater.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-over-30-housing-societies-face-action-for-disposing-of-untreated-sewage-into-drains/story-ICYAsKTNQLU01VAxVC2Y3L.html

09-08-2020||Chandigarh||Labour shortage hits work, Kharar flyover deadline pushed to December||The much-delayed Kharar flyover now has an eighth deadline of December 2020 as shortage of skilled labour due to the lockdown following the Covid-19 outbreak has hit work and impacted the previous time limit of November.The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had handed over the Rs 368-crore project to Larsen & Toubro (L&T), which began construction in November 2015 with completion planned in three years by December 2018. Over five years however, only 76% of the work was done even as seven deadlines expired from December 2018 to January 2020, then March and on to June, July, September, November and now December 2020. “We are trying our best but face labour shortage,” says Bhavnesh Kumar, manager, NHAI. “From 300 labourers earlier we are now left with only 200 as most of them have gone back to their native places and are unable to return due to the lockdown. Construction of the bridge at Khanpur will take some time and we are expecting the work to finish by the year-end,” said an L&T official not wishing to be named. Work on the flyover was suspended on March 22 after the lockdown, but resumed from April 20, with authorities hoping to finish it by September amid restrictions on movement of traffic. Kharar sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Himanshu Jain, who is supervising the project, said he had issued several deadlines for various works on the flyover, but labour shortage was a problem. “We are hopeful that the project will be completed by the year end,” he added. The national highway where the flyover is coming up connects Chandigarh to parts of Punjab, besides Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. This leaves Kharar as a major bottleneck. About 50,000 vehicles were crossing the stretch on an average before the lockdown. Among disgruntled locals, Kartar Grewal, a resident of Kharar, says, “The delays are endless and it has become a challenge to cross the stretch. Often ambulances are held up. I request the state government to intervene and expedite the project.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/labour-shortage-hits-work-kharar-flyover-deadline-pushed-to-december/story-s6bg8yKMiMr4JrKjkI7RIJ.html

Barricades were installed near the office and workers sat there and protested for two hours.Subhash Rani, general secretary of Anganwadi Mulazam Union, said, “We have been working as Covid-19 warriors since March, but no benefits have been provided to helpers and workers. The government must increase honorarium of workers to Rs 25,000 and provide health care insurance benefits to anganwadi and ASHA workers.”“The state government assured workers that children between the age of three to six years will be admitted to Anganwadi centres, but this year too, they have been enrolled in government schools. If this continues, anganwadi centres will close down and all workers and helpers will become jobless,” she said.Meanwhile, Karkhana Mazdoor Union, Ludhiana, protested at Focal Point and textile workers union raised slogans at Tajpur Road against the centre government for changing labour laws.

09-08-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC likely to allot road recarpeting works in two weeks||With the Municipal Corporation finally getting a positive response for its tenders, the allotment of road repair and recarpeting works for the current financial year is expected to happen within two weeks. The work will be started in a month’s time.The MC had in June had floated 13 tenders worth ₹40 crore. But, it failed to get any bidders. It re-invited the applications by floating the tenders again in July.“This time, we have got positive response for every tender we floated. These range from two to five bidders per tender. After scrutiny of the bids, we expect to allot the work within two weeks,” said MC chief engineer Shailender Singh.However, the long-awaited road recarpeting isn’t likely to start before mid-September. “Even if the allotment is done in the next two weeks, we will not start the work during the rainy season. The monsoon is expected to end on September 15, and recarpeting will start thereafter,” said Singh.The road recarpeting in the city has been long overdue as the MC was struggling with paucity of funds. Even after the UT administration sanctioned special grant for road recarpeting, the work couldn’t be started because of the Covid-19 lockdown.The MC has also faced severe criticism over the poor quality of roads. Consequently, it introduced the clause of 5-year mandatory maintenance. As per the clause, the firm which gets the contract for road recarpeting has to maintain it for five years.“The bank guarantee deposited by the contractor will be forfeited if he/she fails to maintain the road for five years,” Singh added.105 ROADS TO GET ATTENTIONIn the current financial year, as many as 105 major and minor city roads will get the MC’s attention. On 61 roads, major recarpeting will be undertaken, while 44 roads will undergo repair and maintenance. Widening of some existing roads will also be carried out.Roads to be up for recarpeting include v-6 road of phases 1 and 2 in Ram Darbar, v-5 road in Sector 56, v-3 road in sectors 55/56, v-3 road in sectors 53/54, v-3, v-4, v-6 roads and parking of sectors 34, 35, 44 and 45; v-3, v-4,v-5, v-6 roads and parking of sectors 37, 38, 39 and 40; v-6 roads of rehabilitation colony, housing board and electricity board colony in Sector 52; v-6 roads of housing board colony in Sector 61, v-6 road in Sector 42-B, v-4 and v5 roads of Sector 49.50% WORKS PENDING FROM LAST YEARWith the old works still pending, the road recarpeting planned by MC is expected to get delayed. The civic body is yet to complete 50% of its pending road works from the 2019-2020 financial year. Though it had started the works immediately after the lifting of lockdown restrictions, the same were discontinued because of monsoon. “We will start the works for the current financial year only after the pending projects from last year are finished,” said Singh. Works worth ₹25 crore are pending from last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-likely-to-allot-road-recarpeting-works-in-two-weeks/story-qzJLobMUUKpDfqKHdDSJ5M.html

Also, the AAP government had denied treatment for people from other states, while the Modi government had ensured treatment for them,” Gupta claimed.Talking to reporters, Jain said, “Many patients from outside Delhi are getting tested here, hence the rise in the number of cases. There is otherwise a decline in cases here”. Jain said the hospital admissions have also increased due to the patients coming from outside Delhi.  “Such statements show that the Delhi government is running away from its responsibilities and diverting the attention of the people,” Gupta said.He said the Kejriwal government should help the people. “It still needs to work very carefully in view of the Covid-19,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-bjp-hits-out-at-aap-govt-for-running-away-from-responsibility/story-CZKtkpoFGuC1taURwJxWxM.html
09-08-2020||Chandigarh||Strict Covid-19 curfew gave Chandigarh cleaner air||While the lockdown between March and May restricted people indoors, this brought about a positive – a major decrease in the city’s air pollution levels compared to last few years.From the ‘satisfactory’ to ‘moderate’ air quality in the same period last year and in 2018, the level remained ‘good’ this year (see box), as per figures shared by the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) recently.This is good news for Chandigarh amid the Covid-19 pandemic when scientists have contended that prolonged exposure to air pollution leads to a chronic inflammatory response even among the young and healthy, which may translate into higher Covid death rates in cities with more pollution, as seen in north Italy. On the flip side, on June 1, when most of the curfew restrictions were lifted in Chandigarh, the AQI jumped to the ‘satisfactory’ level at 56, while a day before on May 31, the air quality was ‘good’ with an AQI of 35. The average AQI for June hovered around 57. The air quality is measured through the air quality index (AQI). Lesser the AQI count, better the air quality. An AQI between 0-50 is considered good, 51-100 satisfactory, 101-200 moderate, 201-300 poor, 301-400 very poor and 401-500 severe.The average AQI in March during the lockdown was 51 (34 during the lockdown period). But, last year during the same period, it was nearly double at 83. In comparison to April 2019, when AQI was 91, this year, the air quality improved greatly with an average of 42. Similarly, AQI in May this year was 66 against 113 last year.“Owing to the lockdown period imposed from March 24 to May 30, major air pollutants have been restricted. There was progressive improvement in overall air quality during the lockdown period,” the CPCC report states.“This change can be attributed to restricted industrial and commercial activities, minimum vehicular congestion and zero construction activities,” it adds.Right before the lockdown started, the AQI was largely under the ‘satisfactory’ category and shifted to ‘good’ category as the curfew period progressed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/strict-covid-19-curfew-gave-chandigarh-cleaner-air/story-Wx0UaX9H2vekgHAGeqyMcP.html

He was supposed to be shifted from Sood Dharamshala to the Covid centre set up at Panjab University on Saturday morning, but he was nowhere to be found.Arif’s roommate said when he didn’t see him there at night, he assumed that he (Arif) had been shifted to the PU Covid centre.Officials said Arif’s wife had recently delivered a baby who was sick, so Arif escaped the quarantine facility and travelled all the way to Uttarakhand to see his child at the Roorkee civil hospital. Arif has now been quarantined there as per the protocol.Police said a team has left for Roorkee to examine how Arif had been able to break out of the Covid centre. A case has been registered under sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code at Sector 17 police station.Earlier on May 5, a Covid patient in Sector 56 had got out of self-isolation and rode to his village in Uttar Pradesh on a motorcycle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-covid-patient-jumps-quarantine-to-meet-newborn-child-in-uttarakhand/story-YOFC78DgzI2CfeZkV3iaJL.html

They were not only fined by the police but also made to stand at one place for an hour as punishment.The police, who are issuing nearly 900 challans every day, also gave free washable masks to the violators.The initiative has come following verbal orders from chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who during a live session on social media on Saturday, was suggested by his web audience to start time penalty for those who go out without masks.Police commissioner Rakesh Kumar Agrawal said the CM’s orders have been implemented as the violators are being made to stand for up to one hour after issuing challans to them. The police on Sunday also provided washable masks to the violators and gave them a warning too.Agrawal said people usually pay the fine on the spot.

The district health department, however, has not taken his pre-death or posthumous sample for covid-19. He was refused admission at civil hospitals in Patti and Tarn Taran, ultimately breathing his last on way to Guru Nanak Dev Hospital (GNDH), Amritsar, on Saturday night. For the family, which is alleging negligence from hospitals and the health department, the ordeal started on Saturday evening. The victim’s cousin brother Kuldeep Singh, 32, said, “On Saturday, about 6pm, my brother Sardool Singh, 38, who had been suffering from piles, complained of weakness. We took him to Sandhu Hospital, where he was given first-aid. They asked us to take him to the Patti civil hospital, due to the pandemic.” “About 7pm, we reached Patti civil hospital, where doctors asked us to call 108 ambulance service, and take the patient to the Tarn Taran civil hospital. At Tarn Taran hospital, they asked us to take him to Amritsar’s GNDH hospital,” Kuldeep said, adding when they reached GNDH around 9pm, doctors declared Sardool brought dead. “Why has the government opened hospitals in Patti and Tarn Taran, if there is no treatment of patients?” Kuldeep added.Patti civil hospital senior medical officer Dr Birinder Kaur said, “The patient had come to us and his condition was serious. He had symptoms of covid-19 and was referred to Tarn Taran civil hospital.”She added samples for covid-19 were not taken as he was ‘critically ill’. “We did not take posthumous samples of the victim as the family didn’t inform health authorities about his death in timely manner. We will conduct the testing of the victim’s family members once they come out of the grief,” she added.Tarn Taran civil surgeon Dr Anoop Singh said they considered the patient positive and he was cremated after following covid guidelines. He said the patient had been unwell for around a year.Patti sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Rajesh Sharma said, “If the health department was aware that the patient was a covid suspect, it should have informed us, so that follow-up could have been done. I will direct health authorities to provide details.”The victim’s father Pyara Singh said if his son was a covid suspect, then why were other family members not quarantined. “First, they killed my son and then they played with our sentiments. My son just needed timely treatment as he was only suffering weakness, because of piles. He had no other disease,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-civil-hospitals-refuse-admission-tarn-taran-man-dies-cremated-as-covid-suspect/story-923RVnjOaU72XjWQocxyNI.html

Bains said if the cops fail to act, the LIP will gherao the office of Commissioner of Police on Tuesday. The LIP workers led by Gagandeep Singh alias Sunny Kainth were staging a symbolic protest against the shortage of ventilators at the civil hospital. The LIP leader had collected money at Bharat Nagar Chowk and went to the MP’s residence to hand over the collected amount when the clashes occurred. Gagandeep Singh accused the Congress workers of tossing his turban as well as those of his aides.While showing the audio and video recording of the incident, Balwinder Singh Bains said that Kainth had followed the government protocol and visited the MP’s house after taking due permission. “It is sad that instead of addressing the issue, the goons of MP attacked Kainth and tossed the latter’s turban. Sadly, the police acted as a mute spectator to the incident and later booked Kainth in a cross FIR. It is a gross misuse of police power,” said Bains. The purpose of the attack was just to toss the turban of Sunny Kainth, “It is a sin. We will not stop the agitation until we get justice,” said Bains. The absence of LIP supremo Simarjeet Singh Bains was conspicuous during the occasion who is stated to be unwell for the past couple of days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lip-team-attacked-party-threatens-to-gherao-cp-s-office/story-0e74SFwNJS6qYV2HdzyrjL.html

Taking a dig, Jakhar, who sought Bajwa’s expulsion from the party for speaking out against the Amarinder Singh government, accused him of using foul language. “To Bajwa ji and also to my friends who want me to respond to his vitriolic and foul raving and ranting – all I want to say is – Enjoy this nazam (poetry),” he wrote in a tongue-in-cheek tweet with the video of ‘Jo Khandaani Raees Hain Woh Mizaj Rakhte Hain Narm Apna’. The Punjab Congress chief’s tweet came after Bajwa’s continued diatribe against him and chief minister Amarinder over the hooch tragedy in Tarn Taran, Amritsar and Gurdaspur districts. He had, in a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi last week, demanded the expulsion of Bajwa and another party MP Shamsher Singh Dullo after they went to Governor VP Singh Badnore last week to seek CBI and ED probes into liquor deaths in the state. Jakhar, who has also sought an audience with Sonia Gandhi, said the party should immediately act against the duo for their “brazen” attacks against the Congress government in Punjab to ensure discipline in the party. “We have to take action now to send a strong message of zero tolerance for indiscipline. I have made a strong case for action against them for the sake of the party,” he said. However, there has been no word from the party high command on the stand-off so far. Bajwa and Dullo are both former presidents of the state Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jakhar-refuses-to-get-into-slanging-match-with-bajwa/story-vr1RPgebmCaznsbZdaU1CO.html

09-08-2020||Chandigarh||No incentives, long duty hours, say nurses as 60 SPS Hospital staffers go on strike||Over a 60 staffers, including ward boys and nursing attendants of SPS Hospital here went on strike on Sunday to protest against long working hours and non-payment of incentives for Covid duty and raised slogans against the hospital authorities. Even as patients were inconvenienced, hospital authorities said they were following government orders and had informed the district authorities about the matter.The employees accused the human resource (HR) department of the hospital for violating labour rights and alleged that they are being made to work for over 12 hours wearing Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kits during which they could not use the toilet or drink water. They said promises to pay each nurse Rs200 extra for Covid-19 duty had not been honoured. Not just that, “Our carry home salary, which is a mere Rs 13,000 after deduction, is getting delayed,” said Jaipreet, one of the protesting nurses. A majority of nurses were working in double shifts. At times just two nurses were handling nearly 15 patients, many of them on ventilators. Many nurses have tested positive while treating the patients, claimed Jaipreet. The change of duty roster proved to be the latest trigger as nurses were asked to perform two morning, two evening and two night duties in a week. When the nurses did not want the changes incorporated they were “ made to go from one department to another. After no one listened to our demand we were left with no option but stage a protest,” said two other nurses Gurpreet and Harpreet Kaur. ‘No talks with authorities’When asked to comment, medical superintendent Dr Rajiv Kundra said that instead of talking to the authorities and trying to resolve the issue, the nursing staff went on strike. “No one approached us and tried to resolve the issue,” he added, saying the roster had been changed following government directions. “The authorities have directed us to accommodate more Covid patients. So we made changes in the roster and used the staff deployed on non- productive duties for the treatment of Covid patients. As nurses have gone on strike against the new arrangement, we have informed the officials of the district administration to look into the matter,” said Dr Kundra. Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said as staging a protest violated the Epidemic Act, “I urge the staff and hospital authorities to resolve the matter amicably.” A number of patients, meanwhile, were inconvenienced due to the strike.Kulwinder Kaur said her father-in-law who suffered from renal problems could not get his regular dialysis at the hospital. “ My father- in- law was not feeling well today so we rushed him to the hospital, but the hospital authorities refused to admit him and asked us to take him to another hospital. Even the doctor is not answering our call. In such a situation where shall we go?” she asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-incentives-long-duty-hours-say-nurses-as-100-sps-hospital-staffers-go-on-strike/story-0cklkmZxcdFChnAqGRKkFM.html

The accused made money by charging the applicants between ₹1,000 and ₹1,500 for their illegal services.The accused duo, identified as Navnath Dabde, 37, and Ishwar Shinde, 30, had been applying for passes since the start of the Covid-19 lockdown in March. In the last four months, they applied for around 40 e-passes, the police suspect.Dabde, a driver, was rendered jobless during the lockdown. He decided to partner with Shinde, a real estate agent to commit the forgeries. The duo started getting clients through word of mouth after they successfully tricked the system early in April. Prior to the relaxation of lockdown rules, passes of those residing outside Navi Mumbai were not approved by the city police as local address proof was essential. “The duo used to forge the address on the Aadhaar card of applicants from outside Navi Mumbai. Using a made-up reason, they would apply for the pass and get it approved,” said NB Kolhatkar, senior inspector, central unit.After police received a tip-off, they set up a sting operation with a dummy customer and contacted the accused. The men were called to meet in Belapur, near the police commissioner’s office on Friday, where they were taken into custody after they told the dummy customer how they would get the e-pass approval. So far, police have found 15 persons who paid the men for the passes. An investigation is on to find out how many other passes were issued using fake documents. Officers said that not all the passes applied for by the duo were approved.Dabde and Shinde do not have a prior criminal history. They have been remanded in police custody till Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-arrested-for-forging-documents-for-e-passes/story-q9Z0ZxaMusVlQA6PijLpkI.html

The university had allegedly sold fake degrees to scores of people in different states and many of them secured jobs in government departments as well as private companies.Last month, the crime branch had registered a case of forgery against the university after its special investigation team found that more than 200 degrees issued by the university were fake.A case was registered under Sections 465, 467, 471 of the Indian Penal Code at the CID police station in Shimla. The investigation agency found that the university had issued the degrees without relevant records. Authorities had failed to provide satisfactory reply to repeated queries made by the sleuths. “Now, we have sought fresh records from the university pertaining to admissions and degrees issued by them, which will be analyzed and investigated thoroughly, “ said a high rank police officer, requesting anonymity.The university had been maintaining that it was not able to provide the records due to the Covid-19 lockdown. However, amidst the lockdown, the university had organised various webinars. CONGRESS DEMANDS CBI PROBECongress legislator Rajendra Rana on Sunday asked the state government to explain the reason for hesitation to hand over the investigation of fake degrees scam in Manav Bharati University to the CBI. Rana alleged that the arrest of the king pin has proved that more than six lakh degrees were sold in India and in foreign countries and that many lawyers are practicing on the basis of fake LLB degrees.He said the rates of fake degrees varied from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh and alleged that there was a nexus between the private universities and then government officials.THE CASEThe fake degree scam, which was unearthed in February this year, after the University Grants Commission (UGC) received an anonymous complaint, involves the alleged sale of more than five lakh degrees by two private universities in Himachal, including MBU, Solan and APG University, Shimla.The UGC had informed the state government about the alleged sale of fake degrees by the two universities seeking an appropriate action. A SIT was constituted to probe the fake degrees issued by the Manav Bharti University in Solan. The CID had filed its report revealing forgery in documents. In mid June, the police arrested the chairman of Manav Bharti University (MBU), Raj Kumar Rana, after the Himachal Pradesh high court refused to grant him an anticipatory bail. Earlier, the police had arrested KK Singh, former registrar of the university. Two university officials—registrar Anupama Thakur and assistant registrar Munish Goel—were also arrested in March.The investigation revealed that MBU had issued several fake degrees to students. It also revealed that Rana and his family also possessed fake degrees. Since then, cases have been filed against MBU at various places, including Datia in Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Lucknow, Bilaspur and Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fake-degree-scam-sit-seeks-records-from-private-varsities-in-shimla/story-eH1YYiknXC0Xl2ni58wPPI.html

09-08-2020||City||Punjab orders social audit of stubble management scheme||Chandigarh Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday ordered a social pre-audit of the crop residue management (CRM) scheme in supplying farm equipment and machinery on subsidy to farmers to prepare for paddy harvest. The first-of-its kind audit was recommended after allegations surfaced that certain manufacturers were being favoured. “The audit by the agriculture department will nail the lies being propagated by certain vested political interests,” said the CM, adding that not a single farmer had questioned the quality of the machines and equipment supplied in the past. The scheme was started on the intervention of the National green tribunal (NGT) and the Prime Minister’s office in 2018 for distributing farm machinery among farmers and cooperative societies for in-situ management of the paddy straw. Under the scheme, farmers from Punjab were given subsidy of nearly Rs 460 crore on 50,815 farm machines. The Centre has already listed around 180 manufacturers from Punjab to ensure supply of farm equipment and machinery. This year, the Centre has sanctioned a subsidy of Rs 300 crore to give at least 23,500 such machines on subsidy. A spokesperson added that CM has directed additional chief secretary (development) Anirudh Tiwari to provide these machines to farmers and societies only after the completion of the audit. Tiwari added the social pre-audit would be completed before the distribution of farm machinery and 7,000 individual farmers are expected to get machines at 50% subsidy, while 5,000 cooperative societies, panchayats and farmers’ groups would be given these machines at 80% subsidy. These machines include super straw management system fixed on combine harvesters, happy seeder, paddy straw chopper-cum-shredder, mulcher, reverse plough, zero till drill and super seeder to ensure zero burning of paddy residue in open fields. The agriculture department has also decided to provide to farmers and coop societies mechanised equipment, needed for ex-situ management of paddy straw, such as balers and rakes, on subsidy, the ACS added.Agriculture secretary KS Pannu has urged all farmers, farmer organizations, political parties, machine manufacturers and NGOs to give suggestions and objections. He added that suggestions or objections can be submitted till August 17 to the director, agriculture and farmers welfare department, Punjab by post or via email at directoragriculturalpunjab@gmail.com.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-orders-social-audit-of-stubble-management-scheme/story-VKDzKwxcq4iD02M7Vqx4VM.html

The party also appointed new office bearers including Lok Sabha district presidents, district communication in charge and observers for 70 assembly constituencies in the city-state with a view on the MCD polls.“Three lakh children study in schools run by BJP ruled North MCD, where the new session has begun in April but the kids have not been given books yet. This is about children’s future. How will they study in the absence of books? This is sad and therefore we plead with the North MCD to provide books to children as soon as possible,” AAP leader Durgesh Pathak said.The party led by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also announced the reorganization of the Delhi unit from the top to the bottom, up to the booth level ahead of the MCD polls in the capital.Also Read: Delhi CM Kejriwal asks NDMC to fix stench from compost pit in Gol Market areaThe reorganization has taken into account the hard work put in by volunteers and party workers in the last Delhi assembly elections that was swept by the Aam Aadmi Party. The names of new office bearers will be announced in three phases, said senior party leader Gopal Rai. He added that the party aims to complete the process by 20th of September. The first set of names for Lok Sabha district presidents, district communication in charge and observers for 70 assembly constituencies were announced on Sunday.The second round will see the announcement of organization presidents for all assembly constituencies and names of 272 ward presidents will be announced in the third phase, Rai added.After winning the Delhi assembly polls in 2019, party had said it would focus on cleanliness and sanitation as the government’s top priorities during its third term.Also Read: Covid-19 situation in Delhi under control, recovery rate improving: CM KejriwalThe AAP has previously described MCD as the “den of corruption” but CM Kejriwal had said that he would look to cooperate with the civic agencies instead of following a path of confrontation.The east, south, and north Delhi municipal corporations (EDMC, SMDC and North MCD) are ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won 181 of the 272 wards in the April 2017 MCD elections. The AAP was a distant second, winning 49 wards, and the Congress was pushed to third position with 31 wards.2022 MCD elections will be AAP’s second attempt to dethrone the BJP. The civic agencies in Delhi are considered flush with money and are largely responsible for cleanliness apart from running some schools, parking lots and maintaining streetlights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/eye-on-mcd-polls-aap-names-new-office-bearers-attacks-bjp-run-civic-agencies/story-okHBRNB4oRyFs53q4XAT5I.html

The dead have been identified as Brajesh Chandra Barnwal, 50, Mithilesh Chandra Burnwal, 40, Govind Manjhi, 50, Bablu Manjhi, 30, Lalu Manjhi, 25, and Leelu Murmu, 30. The accident took place at Devipur market area under Devipur police station where Barnwal had constructed a new septic chamber, about 20 feet deep and 7 feet wide. “All the six people were rushed to the Sadar Hospital but they were declared brought dead by doctors. Prima facie, it seems that they died of suffocation due to possible accumulation of lethal gases such as carbon dioxide or monoxide in the septic tank,” Kamleshwar Prasad Singh, Deoghar’s deputy commissioner (DC), said. Construction labourer Leelu Murmu was the first to go inside the chamber after removing the tank cover as per the scheduled work.“The casting of the tank was completed around a fortnight ago. On Sunday, centering materials were to be removed from inside the tank,” Manish Kumar, a neighbour of Barnwal, said. “However, neither any sound of removing centering material was coming nor he was replying to anything. To check on the labourer, the contractor of the septic tank, Govind Manjhi, entered the tank but he also did not come out. One by one, Govind’s two sons Bablu and Lalu went inside the tank but they also did not come up,” Kumar said.Barnwal entered the tank when the four men did not respond and he too did not come out, Kumar said. “In a bid to rescue his elder brother and the other four people, Mithilesh went into the tank but he met the similar fate,” Kumar said, adding they immediately informed the administration and brought an excavator to destroy the tank to rescue the men. Sunil Kumar, the circle officer (CO) of Devipur, said when the tank was broken all six the men were found lying on the ground unconscious. “They were immediately rushed to Sadar hospital where they were declared brought dead,” he said. The official also said that the autopsy of the bodies was being conducted. “After the postmortem, the actual reason of the deaths could be ascertained,” he said. Kumar said they would try for a widow pension for Barnwal’s and the wives of other men and Rs 20,000 to the labourer. “Besides, 10kg of food grain would be provided to the victims’ families,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/6-die-after-inhaling-toxic-gas-inside-septic-tank-in-jharkhand-s-deoghar/story-O9yZRyWLazPZzEUBymmQQL.html

This paved the way for the HCL-ICC management to submit the same to the expert appraisal committee of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (UMoEFCC) during the video-hearing for environment clearance held on Thursday itself,” Mahato said Friday.The letter of intent, issued on Thursday, has paved the way for early ministerial approval and reopening of the Surda mine that will benefit 1,500 workers, who are currently unemployed.The MP said the state government’s letter of intent was the basic requirement for environment clearance by UMoEFCC for HCL-ICC request to mine 9 lakh tonnes of copper annually from Surda mine.“This will pave the way for environment clearance by the UMoEFCC and subsequently expedite the process of lease renewal of the Surda copper mine by the state government shortly. This will directly benefit 1500 workers rendered jobless because of the closure of Surda mine. My next objective is to reopen Rakha-Chapri mines which will provide jobs to thousands more,” said Mahato.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/hope-for-hcl-s-surda-mine-reopening-as-state-issues-letter-of-intent/story-qpkJxQAo8TOEze5ZB7f4wM.html

The Vashi GRP returned Rs 300 to me. They deducted Rs 100 for stamp paper work and said the remaining Rs 500 would be returned after exchanging the scrapped currency note with a new one,” Padalkar told PTI.He said when he went to the GRP office, there were many who had come to collect their stolen money, amounting into several thousands in demonetised currency, and wondered how they would get it back.Padalkar said he was happy to get his money back.A GRP official said those who stole Padalkar’s wallet were arrested sometime back.“We recovered Padalkar’s wallet containing Rs 900 from the accused. We handed over Rs 300 to Padalkar and the remaining Rs 500 would be returned to him after the currency note is exchanged with a new one,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/man-s-wallet-lost-in-local-train-found-by-cops-after-14-years-in-mumbai/story-EwOHsIxWLToE4Vk5OaH5xN.html

Our patron, Texas-based Mridul Pathak, came up with this drive-in concept during a video conference. Shortly after, we set the ball rolling,” Kapil Dev Pathak, an officer-bearer of Badamtala pujo committee, said.Sanitiser will be sprayed on the cars before every puja pandal, he said.“The drive-in route has been mapped in a certain way... Revellers will get to catch a glimpse of the Badamtala puja decoration, before proceeding westwards to 66 Pally, and finally the Nepal Bhattacharya Street Durga Puja at the end of the trail,” Pathak explained.The organisers have decided to pay tribute to auteur Satyajit Ray this time, he said.“As this year marks Ray’s birth centenary, we chose Apu trilogy as the theme for the three marquees. Badamtala will portray scenes of ‘Pather Panchali’, 66 Pally of ‘Aparajito’ and Nepal Bhattachaya Street Pujo will depict ‘Apur Sansar’,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/3-kolkata-durga-puja-committees-to-offer-drive-in-viewing-of-pandals-to-tackle-covid-19-crisis/story-2nnK3qEZtnSQwegyBNC6IM.html

Ansari was accused of hatching a conspiracy to kill Rai, who was an MLA from Mohammadabad assembly constituency in Ghazipur, while in jail but was acquitted during the trial at a lower court.Prem Prakash Singh alias Munna Bajrangi was shot dead by another gangster Sunil Rathi inside Baghpat jail on July 9, 2018.Amitabh Yash, STF’s inspector general (IG) of police, said a team was continuously trying to track him for the past many months. Yash said he was gunned down in retaliatory firing while the team was trying to arrest him when he had come to meet one of his accomplices on Kanpur Rad under Sarojini Nagar police station limits.Yash said Pandey had at least 10 criminal cases registered against him between 1993 and 2010.

09-08-2020||Chandigarh||‘Security withdrawn as I spoke against administration’: Cong Rajya Sabha MP||Congress MP Pratap Singh Bajwa has alleged that the Punjab government has decided to withdraw state police security provided to him as he had spoken against the failure of administration and improper functioning of Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh.In response to the withdrawal of state police security by the Punjab Government, Bajwa in a statement said, “I had spoken openly against the failure of administration in Punjab and improper functioning of Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh. Obviously, in his usual manner, he had to resort to hitting below the belt by withdrawing my security and exposing my whole family to risk.” The Punjab government has decided to withdraw the state police security provided to Bajwa after an assessment showed that he had virtually no threat perception and was, in any case, now getting central security directly from the Union Home Ministry.A state government official spokesperson said the state police security provided to Bajwa had become redundant since he had procured personal security directly from Home Minister Amit Shah.According to the spokesperson, the central security Bajwa had got was not at the behest of the Congress leadership. “In fact, the Union Home Ministry had not even consulted the state government to gauge the threat perception, which is usually done before providing central security to any person,” he added.“Bajwa, as Rajya Sabha MP, may have simply approached the party’s leader in the House, Ghulam Nabi Azad, to seek central security, and as is the norm, the latter could have simply sent his request to the Union Home Ministry. However, for some reason, the Home Ministry chose not to discuss the matter of Bajwa’s threat perception with the state government in this case, which was a clear deviation from the norm followed in such cases,” the spokesperson said.The spokesperson said Bajwa has actually been getting enhanced security from Punjab Police, way beyond what he was entitled to as Rajya Sabha MP.“Bajwa was given Z Category security cover by the MHA on March 19 and as of date has 25 CISF personnel for personal security, house protection and escort, besides two escort drivers. Till March 23, he also had 14 Punjab Police personnel deployed with him but a few were withdrawn for COVID-19 duties. He currently has 6 Punjab Police personnel and an escort with a driver, which are now being withdrawn,” said the spokesperson. Earlier on Thursday, the Punjab cabinet demanded immediate expulsion of Congress MPs Pratap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo for attacking their own Congress government in the state over the hooch tragedy, the chief minister’s office had said in a statement.Recently, close to 110 people had died after consuming illicit liquor in three districts of the state.While on Saturday, Bajwa said that mining, liquor, cable, drugs and transport mafias which state Chief Minister promised to end are thriving under his rule. “Captain Amarinder Singh promised to end the rule of mining, liquor, cable, drugs and transport mafias within four weeks if he came to power, but now even after four years of his rule, these mafias are thriving,” Bajwa told ANI.He said, “If the Congress has to be saved, then we need to change the leadership in the state.”Bajwa said many party members have repeatedly requested the Chief Minister to sanction a probe into the big distilleries which illegally sold the liquor during lockdown to other states.Talking about the hooch tragedy, Bajwa said that excise, taxation department along with police and politicians are involved in the illicit liquor trade, and investigation by state authorities can be influenced and so he is demanding a CBI probe.“CM Captain Amarinder Singh has excise and taxation, home department and police under him. All fingers are being raised at the excise department. No state official has enough power to investigate the Chief Minister’s office. If justice has to be given to 121 people who died in the hooch tragedy, then an investigation should be done by CBI or ED,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/security-withdrawn-as-i-spoke-against-administration-cong-rajya-sabha-mp/story-CDElUMvbOQb9GTWHFbdoZK.html

According to the parents, the school decided to impose the fee hike despite the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) opposing the move. In a letter sent on Thursday, the parents of Sane Guruji English Medium School said the members of the PTA had disagreed on the 12% fee hike proposed by the school for Class 1. “The fee went up from ₹2,400 to ₹3,200 per month for Class 1 students. This is a big hike and parents had clearly mentioned that it is unacceptable. Despite that, the school has gone ahead with the hike,” stated the letter to the education department. However, Mohan Mohadikar, the school’s trustee, said that only the entry-level fee has been hiked. “Parents whose children were in Senior KG last year, have to pay the same fees for Class 1 this year. So as such, there will be no difference for those parents. Besides, we have also waived off the term fees for this term, considering the fact that school activities won’t happen owing to the Covid-19 situation. We have also allowed parents to pay in installments and have not discontinued classes even if parents have pending payments,” he added. However, parents have alleged that the school was violating the terms of the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fees Act) 2011. “For Class 1, the school should charge the amount which was the same for the class last year. Any addition to it will be considered a hike,” said a parent, who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-school-increases-fees-for-class-1-hike-amounts-to-what-parents-paid-previous-year-claims-trustee/story-uZD1hgtH2yndV4ZDIVBG6K.html

Gym owners say that they getting only about 15 to 20% response even though they have ensured all precautions.CAN’T EVEN MEET FIXED EXPENSES: OWNERSPunjabi Gym Welfare Society president Nanveet Singh says, “It was a major relief for us when the government allowed gyms to open after four months of lockdown, but the present conditions are not favourable as we are getting only 15% of our normal turnout. With this, we can’t meet even our fixed expenses.” He adds, “There are over 700 gyms in the city and all are taking necessary precautions. In fact, we have not even started our high-intensity group classes. But still, the response has been tepid. Our future seems gloomy.”‘TAKING EXTRA PRECAUTIONS’Gym Ekta Welfare Association director Ramesh Bangar says, “In some ways, the government is responsible for this situation. As the gyms were closed for four months, people think that there is some risk here.”Bangar adds, “The government is allowing 25 persons in a 100-yard gym at a time, but we are taking extra precautions and allowing only around 10-12 persons at a time.” ‘BATCHES PREPARED FOR ENTRY’Simardeep Singh, owner of Concept Fitness gyms, says, “We are preparing batches to avoid overcrowding. Residents need to be aware that only strong immunity can save us from Covid-19. Recent studies have also shown that the virus is more likely to affect obese persons.”Though most gyms were scanning visitors thoroughly before allowing them entry, at some small gyms, thermal scanners and oximeters were missing.FITNESS ENTHUSIASTS’ TAKE Meanwhile, residents who have rejoined the gyms say that they are happy to back to their routine after four months. Earnest Paul, 55, who was exercising at a gym near Issa Nagari Pull, said, “It is a completely different experience as the crowd is missing now. My health was deteriorating during the lockdown as I was not able to exercise.”Gurjit Singh, 38, another fitness enthusiast, said, “Exercising is necessary to keep yourself fit. If everyone follows the guidelines, there is nothing to worry and one can remain fit and healthy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gyms-open-to-tepid-response-in-city/story-cCbqhD7lodkPknLaTRn6FP.html
09-08-2020||City||Liquor theft probe: Dushyant’s defence of excise department needs more answers||Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala’s defence of excise and taxation department in wake of adverse findings by a special enquiry team (SET) seems to be on a weak footing. In fact, his Friday remarks–rejecting allegations against excise and taxation commissioner (ETC), Shekhar Vidyarthi, justifying decision to not facilitate the visit of SET to a distillery and his own disagreement with the inquiry findings—left a lot to be answered. 29 permits, 90 passes issued to move liquor The excise and taxation minister defended the move to successfully close down the liquor vends during lockdown without issuing written instructions after the SET had blamed the ETC for not issuing written orders. Information sent by department to SET, however, showed that 29 permits authorising contractors to procure supplies from wholesale Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) and country liquor godowns and 90 passes for transporting liquor were issued online by the officials in several districts during lockdown. Officials said more than one pass to transport liquor supplies can be issued against a permit. Data shows that a total of 67,035 proof litres of IMFL, 11,404 proof litres of country liquor and 48570 bulk litres of beer, ready to drink beverages and wine were procured by the liquor contractors from the wholesale godowns during the lockdown. Similarly, 90 passes for transporting liquor were issued online during the lockdown period facilitating the movement of 89,983 proof litres of IMFL, 49,225 proof litres of country liquor, 151969 bulk litres of beer, ready to drink beverages and wine and 474 proof litres of imported foreign liquor (from Gurgaon east only). “ There was no rationale for physical movement of stocks during lockdown… it is evident that there was huge unauthorized movement of liquor. The complicity of excise, police officials cannot be ruled out. Probe needed as movement of not a single soul except those involved in essential duties was permitted during lockdown,’’ said the inquiry report. ‘Why three distilleries produced liquor during lockdown?’ The SET also questioned why ADS Spirits, Jhajjar, Piccadily Agro Industries, Karnal and Frost Falcon distillery in Panipat produced liquor during lockdown even as others showed zero production. The department also did not provide information pertaining to movement of liquor from wholesale IMFL and CL godowns to retail outlets between March 1 to March 31 despite the orders of the Chief Minister. The information was vital to compare the availability of the liquor stocks till March 31 and after. ‘No bar in the excise act and distillery rules on visits’ While the SET said the department hampered their visit to a distillery, Chautala on Friday defended the move saying since no officer was allowed to visit a distillery as per the Punjab Excise Act, such a demand could not be considered. Excise law experts however said that there was nothing in the Act to prevent visit of officials to a distillery. Former Haryana advocate general, Mohan Jain said that clause 12 of the Punjab distillery rules allowed Financial Commissioner or Collector or any officer authorized by them to inspect and examine a licensed distillery, its premises and warehouses connected therewith. Jain, an excise law expert said distilleries are mandated to render all assistance to officers in making inspection. Chautala’s response 1. Permits, passes got issued as the software was designed to be operational till March 31 and cannot be interfered with for security reasons. No vehicle left distillery, explanation of officials sought. 2. Three distilleries were allowed to bottle available raw material in form of mixed chemicals to avoid being wasted. No distillery supplied bottled liquor during lockdown. 3. All information sought by SET for its three objectives was provided. 4. As per distillery rules, no third person can visit a distillery without written permission. Since SET didn’t seek permission for any specific distillery, it could not be given.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/liquor-theft-probe-dushyant-s-defence-of-excise-department-needs-more-answers/story-2FiwND7YPP5SNbBLPnsRVP.html

The LIP leaders were staging a symbolic protest against the shortage of ventilators at the civil hospital when the incident took place. LIP chief spokesperson Gagandeep Singh Sunny Kainth, who was leading the protest, said, “When we reached the MP’s house, over 200 Congress supporters had already gathered there. They attacked us when we questioned the failure of government and the MP. In the melee, some of our supporters’ turbans were also tossed in the air. The police, including the SHO remained a mute spectator.”Following the incident, LIP leaders, including MLA Balvinder Singh Bains, staged a protest outside the office of police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal, seeking suspension of Division Number 8 station house officer Jarnail Singh, alleging inaction.MP Ravneet Bittu said, “It is a condemnable incident and it should not have taken place. The incident took place due to an old enmity between the two groups as Kainth was also a part of the Congress once. A video has also surfaced wherein a LIP supporter is trying to attack Congress supporters with a ‘kirpan’. Doing politics at this time of crisis is also not good. I was not aware that so many Congress workers had gathered outside my house as I was not in the city. If I had known, I would have sent my representative or any officer to collect the LIP’s memorandum.” Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP) Sameer Verma said, “We have received complaints from both parties. The LIP leaders have not mentioned anything about the SHO’s role in their complaint but we will still verify the allegations.”SHO Jarnail Singh said that FIRs have been registered against supporters of both the parties. Former district president of Youth Congress, Rajiv Raja, Congress supporter Abbas Raja and others have been booked on the complaint of Kainth.LIP’s Sunny Kainth and others have been booked on the complaint of Congress supporter Tarwinder Singh. The FIRs have been lodged under Section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (likely to spread the infection), 323 ( voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 148 (Rioting, armed with deadly weapon) and 149 (unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cross-firs-lodged-after-youth-cong-lip-supporters-clash-outside-mp-ravneet-bittu-s-residence/story-tWfn5gYFGZgavanv9O3xII.html

Owner of Basant restaurants, Bhupinder Basant, said, “Only 25% restaurants had reopened so far due to low footfall and high expenses. Businesses had slowly started to come back on track after the government allowed the restaurants to open till 10 pm, but the new decision to shut down the units at 9pm will further hit the business. The government should at least allow home delivery till 10pm, so that owners can at least bear the expenses to run the restaurant.” Owner of Hawai Adda restaurant, Prince Makkar, said, “We haven’t opened the restaurant since the lockdown was announced in March. After the government allowed restaurants to operate till 10pm from August 1, we felt relieved and were planning to reopen. But with these new conditions of allowing restaurants to operate at only 50% capacity and only till 9pm, we have decided to further delay the opening.”The office bearers of the Hotel and Restaurant Association rued that the government was not bothered about the hospitality sector and hoteliers were muling shutting down due to their negligent behaviour. President of the Hotel and Restaurant Association Amarvir Singh said, “It is high time that the government provides relief to the sector otherwise the businesses will collapse and many owners will be forced to shut their establishments permanently.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/night-curfew-strikes-another-blow-to-ludhiana-s-already-struggling-restaurant-sector/story-wug6KOzUNi4uiVgBqjKgxL.html

Three-four labourers present in the factory at the time of the incident escaped unhurt. The blast that took place around 9am was so powerful that it ripped apart some walls of the factory. The fire broke out in the unit due to short circuit, police said. It took nearly two hours for four fire tenders to douse the flames.Police officials said their preliminary investigation suggested that the factory was legal as its owner Tarwinder Singh has the licence to run it. “Four of our fire tenders reached the spot within 15 minutes of getting information. The fire was doused by 11am,” said fire officer Lovepreet Singh.Chatiwind police station in-charge Kashmir Singh said, “As per the statements of the labourers, the fire broke out due to a short circuit that took place while switching on a tubewell motor. Though factory owner Tarwinder Singh of East Mohan Nagar in Amritsar has produced the licence , we are registering a case of negligence against him.”Sub-divisional magistrate (Amritsar-2 SDM) Shiv Raj Singh Ball said, “We will investigate the records of the factory.

09-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai wins Covid fights, battle goes on||On the day Maharashtra crossed 500,000 Covid-19 cases, Mumbai recorded 1,304 fresh infections – highest 24-hour spike in August so far. The city on average has reported around 900 cases in the first eight days of this month, down from 1,133 in July. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), however, is still in a ‘wait-and-watch’ mode, as the government has been lifting restrictions as part of its Mission Begin Again. “Saturday has more cases in comparison to other days in August, but if we compare today’s [Saturday] situation to earlier days when Mumbai got similar number of cases [1,300-1,400], we were conducting 5,000 or 6,000 Covid-19 tests a day. Now we are conducting 9,000 to 10,000 tests a day. So Saturday’s number cannot be termed as a spike,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of the health department in BMC. Kakani, however, sounded a word of caution too. “We are preparing and are equipped to handle cases shooting up to 2,000 or more, too. As Mumbai opens up, the cases may increase. Even when you go out on the road, you see a lot of traffic these days, mobility is high, people-to-people interaction is high and it will further increase. We are ready for a possible spike,” he said. Mumbai on Saturday reported 58 fatalities, taking the city’s toll up to 6,751. The city’s fatalities are 38.87% of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 toll as on Saturday. This is a significant drop from more than 60% in March and April.While there are 19,914 active cases in the city that translate into 13.54% of Maharashtra’s active cases, Mumbai’s recovery rate is 77%, growth rate 0.78%, and doubling rate is 89 days.The city’s case fatality rate (CFR) stands at 5.5%, higher than Maharashtra’s 3.45%. Reducing number of deaths remains a challenge. The rate, however, has reduced from 5.8% and 5.9% in June and the beginning of July.The turnaroundSince the first two weeks of July, when the average number of daily cases in the city stood at 1,300, to the first week of August, the city has witnessed a significant dip in the number of cases per day, with a few exceptions. The dip is despite Mumbai liberalising its testing on July 7, allowing any person to approach a laboratory and get tested for Covid-19 without a doctor’s prescription. BMC expected Covid-19 cases to increase after this, but that did not happen. As of August 7, Mumbai has conducted 592,230 tests, with a positivity rate of 20.44%.The strategyWhen BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on June 22 launched ‘Mission Zero’ – drawn up based on the success of models implemented in slums such as Dharavi, Mankhurd, and the settlement of Worli Koliwada – to reduce surge of cases in high-rise buildings in the western suburbs, he attributed the success of these models to the 4T formula – testing, tracing, tracking of high-risk contacts and treating patients. BMC used mobile ambulances that went door-to-door to screen patients. Watertight containment zones and institutional quarantining of many high-risk contacts to break their interaction with the community, and stop further spread of the virus, also helped, Chahal had said. Road aheadAs Covid-19 cases moved from slums to high-rises after the government lifted lockdown restrictions on June 5, BMC had launched the 35-day ‘Mission Zero’ plan. The civic body, however, now plans to extend the plan indefinitely.R-Central ward (Borivli West) has the highest growth rate of 1.37%, with a doubling rate of 51. Other suburban wards – R-South (Kandivli), R-North (Borivli), P-South (Goregaon) and T (Mulund) – have a growth rate of 0.9%, above the city’s average. Similarly, D ward (Malabar Hill, parts of Pedder Road, Mahalaxmi and Girgaum) has a growth rate of 1.3%, and a doubling rate of 59 days. “Cases in the suburbs are fluctuating, so there are some days where number of cases is low, and some days where they shoot up. So we have decided to continue with Mission Zero,” said Vishawas Shankarwar, deputy municipal commissioner in-charge of Borivli, Kandivli, Dahisar, and parts of Goregaon.Kakani said BMC has noticed that whatever strategies they have been using are working, whether it is ‘Chase the Virus’ or ‘Mission Zero’. “But we can’t be complacent because of the trend in cases and are alert,” he said. BMC is also focusing on reducing the number of deaths. “Our aim is to reduce the number of deaths. We have managed to bring down fatality due to ‘Mission Save Lives’, but we need to focus on it even more,” said Kakani. ‘Mission Save Lives’, a nine-point strategy to reduce fatalities includes video surveillance of each patient, mandatory audit of every death and giving bedpans to serious patients. It was launched on June 30. “The situation has improved, and cases are not increasing at an alarming pace as we saw earlier. But we will know if we are really in control of the situation when the lockdown eases substantially. Mumbai needs to bring down its fatalities,” said Brinelle D’Souza co-convener of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-wins-covid-fights-battle-goes-on/story-kCv7WGSsQDcl7rrjI4BWlI.html
09-08-2020||City||Palghar mob lynching case: Maharashtra CID files third charge sheet||The Maharashtra Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Friday filed a third charge sheet as part of its probe into the mob lynching from April 2020 in which three were killed. The state CID also submitted a charge sheet against two minor accused before the Juvenile Justice Board in Bhiwandi. On April 16, Chikne Maharaj Kalpavrukshagiri, 70, Sushilgiri Maharaj, 35, and Nilesh Telgade, 30, were killed when a mob of locals attacked them at Gadhchinchale, approximately 140 kilometres from Mumbai. The trio were on their way to Surat and Telgade had been driving the car. Five police personnel were also injured in the attack. According to CID, the lynching was caused by rumours that were circulated using Whatsapp, which warned against a group of organ and child traffickers passing through the area. The gathered mob had mistaken the two travellers and their driver to be the traffickers. In July, CID filed two charge sheets in the case and 226 witnesses have been examined as part of the investigation. So far, 154 people and 11 juveniles have been arrested. On Friday, the state CID charged two juveniles who are directly involved in the lynching, according to the police. Additional director general, CID, Atulchandra Kulkarni said, “Though there are 11 juveniles involved in the case, we have filed against only two of them. Another chargesheet will be filed against the remaining nine after collecting all evidences.” The charges against the accused include murder, attempted murder, rioting, and violations of the Disaster Management Act, the Epidemic Diseases Act, and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. The third charge sheet, filed before a Dahanu court on Friday, is related to an incident of a police officer opening fire on April 17, the first information report (FIR) for which was filed in Kasa police station, in Palghar. This charge sheet charges 47 people with obstructing the police, rioting and attempted murder. “When the police had gone to arrest them [in connection with the lynching case], they [the accused] had pelted stones and used catapults against the police. A firing was ordered by by deputy superintendent of police, Jawhar, Bhagwat Sonawane,” said Amrut Adhikari, who is the counsel for some of the accused. The 47 accused were later arrested on May 13. Of those currently in judicial custody, 28 have applied for bail on the grounds that CID has not collected any evidence against them. Adhikari said, “CID is still collecting evidence against the 28 accused even though they have been arrested. We have the right to apply for bail as it is a case of illegal detention.” The bail plea will be heard on Monday. Meanwhile, the state is preparing a report on the action taken against police personnel from Kasa police station following the mob lynching. Over 35 police constables and other personnel were transferred the then Palghar district police chief, Gaurav Singh, was sent on compulsory leave. On Thursday, the Supreme Court asked the state to submit a report on the actions taken against the errant police personnel. The bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy will also examine the charge sheets that have been filed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/palghar-mob-lynching-case-maharashtra-cid-files-third-charge-sheet/story-sUdX76VIgXyKcvgT34pfoJ.html

09-08-2020||City||Financial woes among parents impact college admissions in Ludhiana||The Covid-19 pandemic has induced a financial crisis, which has put adversely impacted college admissions in the city.Facing financial constraints due to job losses, pay cuts, losses in businesses, many parents have requested college principals to provide them more time to pay the fees. Principals of colleges affiliated with Panjab University stated that students were visiting colleges to buy forms, but a majority of them were not turning up to submit the forms citing financial problems at home. The percentage of students citing such reasons has increased from 10% earlier to 50% this year, said many principals.At SCD Government College, the authorities are receiving 150 queries daily from students that are related to the admission process. Nearly 80% students are sending emails to the college stating that they are facing a financial crisis at home due to which they will not be able to submit the entire fee of their respective semesters. The situation is the same in other colleges.OPTION TO PAY IN INSTALMENTS OFFEREDPrincipals are worried as fee-related issues will take a toll on the admission process and seats will also be left vacant. Kirandeep Kaur, principal of Master Tara Singh Memorial College for Women, said, “Parents and students are inquiring regarding the admission process, but due to financial problems, many are not turning for counselling. Parents are visiting the college and sharing their monetary problems. To provide them some relief, we have asked them to deposit the fee in three instalments.”Principal of Mata Khalsa College, Kottan, Kuldeep Kaur Dhaliwal, said, “Students of 161 villages normally take admission here, but due to the pandemic, the process has been impacted. The major issue we are facing is parents have no funds, so the admission process has slowed down. When teachers contact students of second and final years regarding fees, many of them express inability and demand time. There is not much demand for BA, and BCom is still students’ first preference.”For BCom and BA courses, SCD College charges approximately ₹7,600- ₹8,700; Government College for Girls charges ₹9,200 without practical, ₹10,000 with practical and ₹11,000 for BCom (first semester). However, for both the courses, private colleges are charging ₹16,000- ₹18,000 for BA and ₹18,000-₹21,000 for BCom. Dharam Singh Sandhu, principal at SCD Government College, said, “Being a government college, the fee structure is already low and ranges between ₹5,000 to ₹12,000 which includes the examination fee. The charges differ from course to course.”At Arya College, the authorities have already started with the counseling process for BCom, first semester. More than 100 students took admission in BCom on Friday, among which 50% students have opted for fee payment through instalments. GOVT COLLEGES PREFERREDRamanpreet Kaur, a student from Mangli Uchi village, said, “I scored 92% marks in Class 12 and applied for admission in two girls colleges. My father runs a cloth shop and due to Covid -19, the shop remained closed for three months and we used the savings to survive. I am hopeful that I will get admission in BCom in a government college. I will request the authorities to allow my parents to pay the fee in instalments.” Suresh Kumar, who hails from Doraha, said, “I have registered online for BA, first semester, in SCD college and Karamsar government college because of lower fee structure. My father was out of work for three months. I have decided to pay the fee in instalments and have submitted a letter to the college authorities to allow me.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/financial-woes-among-parents-impact-college-admissions-in-ludhiana/story-mTrfVPBns0cYA8OgWXKXFM.html
09-08-2020||Chandigarh||Ex-Punjab IPS woman officer booked for cheating to claim family property||A retired Punjab woman Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Amrit Kaur Brar has been booked for cheating by allegedly concealing the will of her late father to gain property rights of her widow sister-in-law and her children.A case under Section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was lodged at the NRI police station here on Friday, after a preliminary police investigation.Patiala division assistant inspector general (AIG) for NRI cell Balraj Singh said the case is being investigated.The complainant Sukhdeep Kaur Brar, a retired IAS officer currently residing in the US, is the widow of an IPS officer Avinder Singh Brar who was shot dead by terrorists in Patiala in 1987. He was then senior superintendent of police of Patiala district.The accused Amrit is the younger sister of the slain officer. She was given a compassionate appointment as an assistant commandant in the Central Reserve Police Force. In 1993, she was taken on deputation in the Punjab Police and, five years later, absorbed as DSP in Punjab police. She retired as AIG last year.Amrit could not be reached immediately for her comment on the FIR against her.According to the FIR, accessed by HT, Avinder’s father Gurdarshan Singh had properties in Punjab and Delhi.In 2001, Gurdarshan had registered a will for distribution of properties among his family members.A preliminary police investigation found that as per the will of 2001, if Amrit Kaur gets married, she will get property only in Delhi whereas rest of the assets will go to Sukhdeep, her two children and Gurdarshan’s wife.After her father’s demise in 2013, Amrit allegedly secured a share in her paternal properties located at Abulkhurana in Muktsar and Fazilka through a natural succession right.In 2018, Sukhdeep filed a case in a Delhi high court to claim her share in the Delhi properties. According to a legal document submitted by Amrit in the court, she got married in 2009 and sold her inherited Delhi property.The Delhi case is sub judice, according to the police report.Officials of state police’s NRI wing found that Amrit secured the Delhi properties through the will but the same will (that states she will lose property rights in other than Delhi assets after marriage) was concealed from all while claiming her share for properties in two locations in Punjab.The police probe has found that Amrit had submitted only a death certificate to get a share of her father’s property in Punjab whereas she had produced will, that otherwise restricts her claim on the inherited properties, to the Delhi authorities to secure valuable assets there.The FIR says that prima facie, Amrit had wrongfully secured ancestral property shares in Punjab. The FIR was registered after the prosecution and litigation division of the NRI police cell gave the go-ahead on the basis of the investigation conducted by the AIG office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ex-punjab-ips-woman-officer-booked-for-cheating-to-claim-family-property/story-CDuGmOBB58zGcC0cmd1UOK.html
09-08-2020||Mumbai||As Maharashtra crosses 5-lakh Covid case milestone, ‘worst not over yet’||Maharashtra crossed the grim 500,000 Covid-19 cases milestone on Saturday, 153 days after reporting the first case in Pune, and health department officials said “the worst is not over yet”, as the state has not reached the peak of infections. The officials said Maharashtra is also witnessing “early signs of community transmission”, but it is not a cause for concern as the spread would remain “local”. Health experts and state officials said Maharashtra could continue to witness a rise in the number of daily Covid cases till next month, but the growth rate of transmission will remain low.September is crucial A senior health department official said while the state will continue to see higher number of cases as testing, too, has increased, the downward curve of Covid-19 infections will begin by September-end. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said although the absolute number of cases is increasing, the growth rate is not high. “There are indicators that suggest the outbreak is under control. It also suggests transmission is not happening rapidly. The doubling rate has improved. The overall growth rate is 3%, and in some cities, it’s fewer than 2%. The positivity rate, too, is much lower now despite the increase in daily testing. On Friday, we tested 81,655 samples and the positivity rate was around 12%,” Awate said.In the past seven days, the state has averaged 9,735 cases daily. From August 1 to August 7, the state added 68,144 cases to its tally. “We have not reached the peak yet; we are still getting there. The absolute cases are expected to increase for some more weeks. We could see the decline in cases by September-end or early October,” said Awate. “But the virus will not vanish. There will be scattered cases coming in from areas as we had seen in the case of H1N1 (swine flu). When H1N1 outbreak happened in 2009, we thought it would go away the next year, but even today cases are reported every alternate year.”Warning signs?Kerala was the first state in India to announce that two coastal towns had reached community transmission stage. Community transmission is when the index case from where a person contracted the virus is not traced. State health minister Rajesh Tope had recently denied that the state has entered the transmission stage. However, Awate said the state is “showing early signs” of having reached the stage. A senior health department official, who did not wish to be named, said, “The ICMR has a parameter for community transmission stage – when 20% of cases cannot be traced back to the source. Therefore, it is a contentious issue because no local body or district administration has followed the process to trace the index cases. For instance, if a city like Pune is reporting 1,500 cases daily, it does not have the manpower to do the tracing. Whether or not Maharashtra has reached the stage can only be announced after a go-ahead from ICMR.”Awate, who is also an epidemiologist, said, “We are seeing signs of community transmission. There have been cases where source of the infection has not been traced.”Deaths a concernThe case fatality rate (CFR) of the state stands at 3.49%, second only to Gujarat’s 3.82%, as of Friday. The national CFR is 2.04%. The absolute number of Covid-19 deaths, too, is a worry for the state government. Between July 7 and August 7, 8,066 fatalities were reported in the state. These constitute 47.19% of the total deaths in the state due to coronavirus.The Central government has also expressed concern over the high number of Covid-19 deaths in Maharashtra and has listed 10 districts that need to do more to tackle the crisis. These districts are Pune, Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon, Sangli and Nagpur.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday directed the district and municipal officials to work on lowering fatalities on priority. A state health department official said, “Districts have been asked to ramp up tracing and testing. Densely populated areas are being looked at.”“Death rate is a concern and we have been modifying our standard operating procedure. Drugs like hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, etc, are being used extensively,” Awate said.Unlocking the stateThe state has been cautious in announcing the lifting of lockdown restrictions. Several civic bodies have been announcing their own versions of lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus. Earlier this month, the government announced opening of malls and market complexes, but food courts, cinema halls and gymnasiums have been kept shut. “Initially, industries, factories, shops were allowed. Now, further relaxations were provided to start the cycle of economic activities. We wanted to give these relaxations in July, but in view of the rising cases in the MMR, the state did not go ahead. Cases in Mumbai have now stabilised. The government will gradually see how things are going and ease restrictions further,” said a bureaucrat. Dr Lancelot Pinto, Mumbai-based pulmonologist and epidemiologist, said the number of cases going up is a “price to be paid for opening up”. “Looking at the situation from the point of view of cases rising wouldn’t necessarily give a complete picture. One has to check the severe cases, ICU beds occupied, etc. Mumbai has certainly improved in terms of availability of beds. Testing has been made easier, therefore, we are picking up cases that we did not earlier. All centres need to learn from what Mumbai learnt after initial days. Everywhere the cases will start and peak; all the cities will go through this cycle,” said Pinto.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/as-maharashtra-crosses-5-lakh-covid-case-milestone-worst-not-over-yet/story-wmgciWRaJThvDdVzlMWOIN.html
09-08-2020||Lucknow||Will take all Covid precautions for monsoon session of legislature, says UP minister||The Uttar Pradesh legislature’s monsoon session is scheduled to begin on August 20 amid the fight against Covid-19. Adhering to social distancing norms during the session will be a big challenge as the space for seating the members is limited. For the first time, the members will be adjusted in the lobbies and, possibly, in the galleries so that at least one seat between two members remains vacant. Uttar Pradesh minister for finance, medical education and parliamentary affairs Suresh Khanna spoke about the ongoing preparations for the monsoon session. Excerpts:Are you ready for the monsoon session?  Yes, we are getting ready for the monsoon session of the state legislature commencing on August 20. We will follow the government’s directions and take all precautions for protection from Covid-19. Use of masks and following social distancing norms will be mandatory. How will you follow social distancing norms? We will use lobbies on both sides (treasury benches and the opposition) of the House. If necessary, the viewers’ galleries will also be used for members. Will you have a sound system installed for members sitting in the lobbies/galleries? Yes. We will have a sound system for the members sitting in lobbies/galleries. How long will this session be? We can’t say anything at this stage. But I don’t think there can be a longer session in the prevailing conditions.Will the state government table the first supplementary demands for grants? Yes, the state government may bring the supplementary demands for grants for 2020-2021.Covid-19 has adversely affected revenue. How will you meet this challenge?  We have explored all the possibilities. Covid-19 has stalled economic activities and this has had an adverse impact on the state government’s revenue. We hope our economic condition will improve when the Covid-19 pandemic ends. Is there any improvement?There has been a gradual improvement in the collection of revenue in the past few months. Recovery of revenue realisation has improved every month. Will the state government propose any new taxes? We have taken steps in accordance with the situation. We have suspended the Vidhayak Nidhi (local area development fund) for the legislators. We have cut down the salaries and emoluments of legislators by about 30%. We have taken a number of other steps to increase our income and cut wasteful expenditure. We have tried to maintain financial discipline. In April, we realised less than 10% of the targeted revenue. We improved a bit in May 2020. We, however, touched 61% revenue against targets in June 2020. Will there be an emphasis on e-office? Yes, the e-office system will be encouraged. But switching over to the e-office system completely will take some time. Those belonging to the old generation are not comfortable with using the new technology. But the young generation uses the new technology with much ease. Some departments have implemented e-office and more will do so in the coming months. How is the state government doing in the fight against Covid-19? We have less positive cases vis-à-vis other states. In smaller states, the number of cases and deaths is much higher than UP. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi have more deaths. We have tried to check the spread of Covid-19. We have been successful in keeping a low mortality rate. We have 25 government labs and 30 labs in the private sector for Covid-19 testing. We have increased the number of Covid-19 tests being carried out in the state. Uttar Pradesh was able to do only 100 tests in April. But we are now carrying out 34,000-35,000 tests per day by RT-PCR. We are also conducting rapid antigen tests and using the TrueNat machines too. We conducted about 1,15,000 tests on Saturday. We have worked really hard to build testing capacity and achieve these testing figures. How are you protecting yourself? I don’t take any medicines for this. But I follow the steps that have been suggested for protection from Covid-19 from time to time. Covid-19 can infect anybody. Those who do not adhere to the government guidelines of using mask or follow social distancing may face problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/will-take-all-covid-precautions-for-monsoon-session-of-legislature-says-up-minister/story-WfQFoMDefG6Oejz0rE9K2H.html

Around 11am, the complainant, Narayan Vhatkar, was on his way to pay the electricity bill. While walking at Bonkode Road in Sector 12, Vhatkar noticed two men standing by the footpath. “The men wear wearing white shirts and approached Vhatkar and claimed that they were police officers. One of them asked Vhatkar to wear the mask properly. The accused then asked him what he was carrying in his pockets after noticing fgold rings on his fingers,” an officer from Koparkhairane police station said. The accused allegedly told Vhatkar that there is a police checkpoint ahead and that he should not wear gold jewellery in public. They then asked him to wrap the rings in a piece of paper and keep them in his pocket. “Vhatkar put the rings in his pocket and asked the two men to show him their police identification cards. But the duo kept him engaged in the conversation, distracted him and walked away with the rings,” the officer said. After walking a little further, Vhatkar did not find any uniformed police personnel and checked his pocket for the rings. When he opened the piece of paper in which he kept the rings, he realised they were missing. The rings collectively weighed 32.5 grams, said the police. Vhatkar then approached the police, following which a case of cheating was registered against the two unidentified accused. The police are checking the CCTV footage of the nearby areas to verify their identities and are probing the case further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-men-pose-as-cops-steal-4-rings-worth-1-lakh-from-75-year-old-in-navi-mumbai/story-MQJ2vFVPZgXpc8SOCLO7eO.html
09-08-2020||Mumbai||Social impact of crimes against women call for exemplary treatment to accused: Bombay HC||Social impact of any crime against women requires exemplary treatment to be meted out to the accused,the Bombay high court (HC) said on Friday, while refusing to let off a city resident who is sentenced for six years by a sessions court for attempting to murder his girlfriend, after she refused to marry him. “We are conscious that social impact of the crimes against women cannot be lost sight of and per se require exemplary treatment,” said the bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik, while rejecting the prayer of the convict, Arumugum Arundatiyar. According to the prosecution, Arundatiyar and the woman were in a relationship for two years and he wanted to marry her. The woman, who worked as a babysitter, refused to marry him, as her family opposed their relationship. After she refused his proposal, Arundatiyar assaulted her twice. On May 8, 2014, when the woman was returning home from work, the accused barged into the rickshaw in which she was seated and threatened the auto driver with a knife and pulled her out of the vehicle. Arundatiyar then attacked her with the knife in front of the people nearby. He stabbed her on her neck and also threatened to attack the eyewitnesses who tried to save her. He then fled the spot after a police vehicle reached there, but was arrested some time later. After the sessions court convicted him for attempted murder of his girlfriend, Arundatiyar moved HC to appeal against the sentencing. His counsel advocate Aniket Vagal primarily stressed before the HC that the injuries caused to the woman not grievous in nature, and the incident took place mainly because the victim refused to marry the convict after two years of their relationship. Vagal also sought sympathy for his client on the ground that he was a young man, of about 25 years at the time of the incident, and came from a very poor background. Claiming that the sentence was grossly disproportionate to the crime, especially when the injuries were not grievous, he urged the court to let the convict off with six years, improving which he already served as an undertrial. The HC, however, refused to show any undue sympathy for the convict. The bench said any liberal approach by imposing meager sentences or taking too sympathetic view of crimes against women will be result-wise counter-productive in the long run and against societal interests. But the court found that life imprisonment was an excessive punishment for the crime, as the injuries inflicted on the woman were not life-threatening, and reduced the convict’s sentence to 10 years imprisonment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/social-impact-of-crimes-against-women-call-for-exemplary-treatment-to-accused-bombay-hc/story-swl49mHKJZ1EKktoazHgJL.html

09-08-2020||Mumbai||24.6% of state’s cases from Mumbai; Thane, Pune emerge as new hot spots||The Covid-19 case curve of Mumbai has plateaued, which in turn has brought down the city’s share of infections in Maharashtra to 24.31%. This is a significant drop from 54.82% on June 12, when the state reached its first 100,000 Covid-19 cases. Currently, Thane and Pune have emerged as hot spots, with 20.60% (103,642) and 21.86% (109,988) of Maharashtra’s 503,084 cases in these two districts. Thane and Pune had 11% and 16% of the state’s cases on June 12. State health minister Rajesh Tope said these two regions will reach their peak in the next two weeks, after which cases will dip. “We are expecting that either these two regions are already in the middle of the peak or will reach there within two weeks. Then we can expect a drop in the cases graph, as we have witnessed in Mumbai,” said Tope.Mumbai’s share in Maharashtra’s Covid cases dropped gradually over a period of two months. On July 12, when the state had 254,427 infections, Mumbai’s share was 36.55% (92,988). This further came down to 33.34% (100,350) on July 18, when Maharashtra had 300,937 cases.Officials from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) predict that by August-end, the city’s share of cases will drop even further. “It has been almost two months since we have noticed any sudden spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai. The slums have recovered. Dharavi, which was our main concern due to the huge population, is recording cases below two digits on an average,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.The number of active cases in the city is also lower than in Pune and Thane. On Saturday, the city had 19,914 active cases, while Thane reported 22,943 active patients. Pune, meanwhile, had 41,266 active cases —highest in the state. “Due to their connectivity with satellite towns, numbers in these two regions have jumped. Detection of cases has also risen due to an increase in testing using antigen kits,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer. Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, a public health expert, said, “As Mumbai and MMR (Mumbai Metropolitan Region) are interconnected, we have to be careful before opening up transportation or local trains which can bring the second wave of pandemic. Just like in Mumbai, the curve is expected to come down in Pune and Thane also.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/24-6-of-state-s-cases-from-mumbai-thane-pune-emerge-as-new-hot-spots/story-zZDzScesCxw244swC8gdTP.html

The 23-year-old, whose father is a colonel in the Army, lives with her family at Army Officer’s Colony in Colaba. In her complaint, she said on August 5, while speaking to a journalist for an interview, she was informed that there were multiple social media accounts in her name. She told the journalist that she has no account on the app.Later, she asked her brother to check the app and they found 16 fake accounts in her name, featuring photos and videos of her. “We don’t know how the accused may misuse these 20 fake accounts. He may misuse my sister’s name and photos for illegal monetary gain, hence we decided to report the matter to the police,” said Sheoran’s brother, Aman.On Thursday, Sheoran filed a complaint with the Colaba police. A first information report (FIR) has been registered under section 66C (identity theft) of the Information Technology (IT) Act.“The accused person has created accounts using her photos without her permission. We have registered a case of identity theft and have started an investigation.

09-08-2020||Chandigarh||Capt as usual hit below the belt, won’t be cowed down: Bajwa||Congress’ Rajya Sabha member Partap Bajwa on Saturday hit back at chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh over withdrawing security cover given to him by Punjab Police, saying the CM as usual has resorted to hitting below the belt and has exposed his family to risk. “Security is given to a person for protection of their life and should not be a tool to browbeat them into submission. In any case, this trick will not work on me,” said Bajwa.“Why had the Punjab government given me police security cover if my threat perception was zero? My father was martyred in the fight against terrorism in Punjab. I survived a bomb attack in 1990 and was given security for decades due to high threat perception. Now suddenly, my threat perception becomes zero,” the Rajya Sabha MP said. “I was not aware that the Punjab Police had become so spineless that they would withdraw security to a person having a genuine threat perception only because he has spoken against their political boss,” said Bajwa. The senior Congress leader said granting security involves intelligence inputs from ADGP (intelligence) with consent of the ADGP (security) and the DGP. “Obviously, all these three officers have intentionally chosen to prepare a fabricated threat perception. Preparing false intelligence inputs is evidently a violation of the service law and a punishable offence,” he said.“If the Centre has granted me Z security it clearly shows the actual threat perception I have. This security was provided to me by the UPA government in 2013 in addition to the security cover by the Punjab Police,” Said Bajwa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/capt-as-usual-hit-below-the-belt-won-t-be-cowed-down-bajwa/story-fTFtLKAW0a0QESgGYT4cLL.html

The house will be open for the public after three months.His tryst with heritage and conservation came in the form of restoration and conservation work on the Vishrambaug Wada in 2001 when he took up the post of head of heritage cell, PMC. “I was on the verge of quitting my job with the PMC, where I had worked for 20 years in the garden department, water supply and as ward officer when I got this opportunity,” said Dhavalaey who is a civil engineer by profession.“I was always attracted towards art and this was an opportunity for me to delve further into this world,” he said.Attraction When you see the pastel pink house, its traditional doors, windows and shingles, all made of wood, draw you in. Dhavalaey began collecting antique doors, hinges, window panes from Juna Bazaar, or during his trips to different parts of Maharashtra, whereupon, simplicity of the forms of the ‘Uhkhal’ (grain husker), stone vessels and stone bearings attracted him, enough to start his collection.His interest in conserving heritage and antiques also made him study Indology at the Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapeeth and also get a post graduate degree in Archaeology and heritage management, which helped him in his work on various heritage sites like Lal Mahal, Nana Wada and Mahatma Phule Mandai in the city.How the journey startedAfter retirement, Dhavalaey realised that the ‘treasure’ he had collected over 20 years at his old house in Parvati, had to be showcased. He thought of creating a special place to curate and showcase the treasure for the new generation to know more about our rich heritage and culture. Thus in 2017, he began laying the foundation of his dream and built a house which is completely made out of antique doors, window panels, even the electric switches are all of the old styles – black switches mounted on wooden boards.Recycle and reuseDhavalaey has recycled a lot of the old stone plinths to build this historic house. “My work during the restoration and conservation of heritage buildings taught me that there is a lot of history in the pots, pans and even in traditional architecture which I have tried to recreate in this house,” he said.All of the collection, right from a wooden desk to the ‘khunti’ (wooden hangers), ‘kerosene diyas have been recycled from parts, if not found. “Many of these objects emphasise the importance of art and tradition, heritage has been permanently preserved in the form. This project has been set up not only to preserve the invaluable heritage that our forefathers, past generations have given us, but also to create something for the future generations,” added Dhavalaey.He has spent Rs 8 lakh till date on building the house. He plans to hold art and craft workshops, lectures, and demonstrations in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/passion-for-heritage-former-civic-executive-engineer-turns-house-into-heritage-complex/story-W7in4gNAZ29s5NRzg7yh1M.html

In the letter to Deshmukh, Sarnaik wrote that the police should actively work to solve the suicide case of a “common man” just like it is working in the Sushant Singh Rajput case. Naik, 53, and his mother Kumud, died by suicide in Alibaug two years ago. A suicide note, purportedly written by Naik, the managing director of Concorde Designs, said that a news channel editor and two others owed him ₹5.40 crore for some services rendered by the victim’s firm, and as they failed to repay him, he was compelled to take the extreme step. In May, the state announced that the abetment to suicide case registered against the three people named in the note will be inquired into again by the state criminal investigation department (CID). Sarnaik demanded that the prime accused in the case should be called for an inquiry and booked if there is any suspicion against him. “The accused in the case is allegedly being protected by the police. Therefore, there should be complete transparency in the case and all information should be put before the people,” Sarnaik wrote. “The government should act to give justice to architect Anvay Naik, who is a native of the state. Two months after announcing a CID probe, the government should give details of the development in the case to the family members of the victims. Like the developments in the Sushant Singh Rajput case are shared with the people through the media, I wish that as the home minister, you would do the same in this case too,” the Sena legislator wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/act-against-accused-in-anvay-naik-abetment-to-suicide-case-shiv-sena-mla-writes-to-maharashtra-home-minister/story-UKkAotqeHFNl6JFuqmzxII.html

Action is likely against the police personnel, it is learnt. The police had started the drive against illicit liquor under ‘Operation Red Rose’ in the wake of the hooch tragedy in Tarn Taran, Amritsar and Gurdaspur districts that has claimed at least 121 lives.A significant amount of hooch was recovered from Ludhiana’s Rajapur and Bholewal Jadid villages that are located near the Sutlej. The hooch was kept in large polythene tubes hidden in water or on the river banks. The police instead of destroying the illicit liquor in a controlled environment dumped in the river itself.The police without realizing the fact that they were actually polluting the river had videographed the process and shared it on their official Facebook page, which triggered reaction. PPCB chief engineer Gulshan Rai said they have started investigation into the matter after they came to know that the police dumped hooch into the river.“This is harmful for humans as well as animals. Reports of samples are awaited and we will take appropriate action accordingly.“Polluting water bodies is a crime. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had earlier slapped a fine of Rs 2.28 crore on skinners for polluting the water body and soil by dumping remains of dead animals on the river banks,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-cops-dump-8-64-lakh-litre-hooch-in-sutlej-stir-up-row/story-BEj0bWSRiigXf9lYNR4NaO.html

After the structure is removed in entirety, the road will be opened up for commuters. “80 per cent of the demolition work of the university chowk flyover has been completed and in the next three days the remaining 20 per cent will be demolished,” said Vivek Kharwadkar, metropolitan planner, Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA). The demolition of the arm of the flyover in front of E-square will take a few more weeks to be completed, said Kharwadkar. “40 per cent demolition work of the flyover in front of Esquare has been completed. The work will be expedited in the coming days,” added Kharwadkar. However, a PMRDA official has confirmed that metro line work will only begin after six months. “It will still take time, around six months to start work on the two tier flyover for Hinjewadi-Shivaji nagar metro rail corridor. First, let’s focus on demolishing the two flyovers properly,” said a junior engineer at the site requesting anonymity. The new flyover will cost around Rs 240 crore, and PMRDA will be discussing funding options with the state government as the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has refused to share the cost. The demolition of the flyover was expected to get over at the end of July but it got delayed due to traffic.The demolition is causing a big trouble to commuters as they have to take internal roads to commute which is causing traffic congestion. “It takes me extra 30 minutes to reach Shivajinagar as I have to go from Model colony,” said Akshay Kaipiwar, who works at a private company in Shivajinagar. The demolition work of the flyover began on July 14. The traffic was diverted to the portion of the Savitribai Phule Pune University campus and Model colony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/university-flyover-will-take-three-more-days-to-demolish/story-dCh3resF9FHqi6NLsl3fPK.html

Pune has two defense airports, one at Lohegaon and the other one at the National Defence Academy (NDA).Pune city engineer Prashant Waghmare said, “We got a great relief from the new notification which was issued by the Indian Air Force (IAF). Around 90 per cent projects will get relief now. We gave various recommendations to the MoD which were accepted. Even the elected members, MP Supriya Sule, MP Girish Bapat and other leaders had also given letters and requested for a relief to Pune.” Waghmare said earlier the red zone extended to a six kilometre stretch on both sides of the airstrip at Lohegaon and the NDA. There was a funnel zone restriction of six to 18 kilometres near the airfield. As most parts of the city were falling under these guidelines, almost all projects were going to the MoD for obtaining a NOC.“We conducted various meetings with the officials of MoD and requested them to make changes in the colour coded maps but as Pune has many defence establishments, they were strict on their stand. We requested them to make some changes. The MoD suggested giving concrete suggestions to sort out the problem,” Waghmare added. Acccording to Waghmare, many PMC projects were also tucked as the PMC too needed to submit their proposals for getting a NOC from the MoD. Since the MoD receives proposals from across the country, the city projects were delayed. “We had given various suggestions which were as per their original notifications and later they got sorted out,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/mod-revises-height-restrictions-norms-in-big-relief-to-pmc/story-1w4YQfh5zHPx08H4qgwzZJ.html

09-08-2020||Pune||Stock at human milk bank hit amid pandemic||The rise in Covid-19 positive cases has caused a sharp decline in storage of human milk bank since March, say officials. The human milk bank at Sassoon General hospital that stores four-five litres of milk per month is left with one-two litres. “We have seen a few donors since March. We are not allowing Covid-19 positive mothers to become donors,” said Dr Aarti Kinikar, head of paediatric department, BJ Government Medical College, Sassoon. In a deep freezer, a mother’s milk can be stored for six months, say doctors. Amid the pandemic, the human milk bank has played an important role in saving newborns’ life. “If the mother is tested positive for Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19 and the child is tested negative, we wouldn’t advise her to breastfeed the baby. But now, according to the norms of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), a Covid-19 positive mother is allowed to breastfeed,” Kinikar said. “While breastfeeding, wearing a mask, washing hands and other preventive norms are a must for mothers. Also, in case if the health of the mother is serious due to Covid-19, we keep the baby in a separate area,” she said. The bank began operations in Sassoon from 2013 and gets milk from mothers from two other hospitals, besides Sassoon. “After ICMR has allowed Covid-19 positive mothers to breastfeed, the demand for human milk has gone down at the bank,” Kinikar said. “Many babies have benefitted from human milk bank and lactating mothers should come forward to donate. I hope the storage rate will improve soon,” Kinikar said. Procedure for donating milk A consent form is filled Donor should fit the criteria set by authorities Milk undergoes tests and procedures Feeding happens through the hospital staff - nurses and doctors - with the consent of mother and family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stock-at-human-milk-bank-hit-amid-pandemic/story-Gr0im9agD82KNRm0XecV1L.html

As per data from worldometers.info, Maharashtra’s tally surpassed sixth-placed Mexico’s count of 469,407 cases.The state’s first lakh cases took 96 days, the second took 22 days, third 14 days, fourth 11 days, while the fifth lakh took just 10 days, indicating a surge in daily caseload.As of Saturday, active cases in the state stood at 147,048 cases, accounting for 29.69% of the total infections. The state’s death toll went up to 17,367 after 275 more fatalities were reported, of which 222 happened in the past 48 hours, another 28 deaths were from the past week, while the rest 25 deaths were from the period before past week, state health officials said. Why the surge?The major reason for the surge is that more cases have started coming from semi-urban and rural areas. Two months ago, majority of the cases were coming from 19 cities declared as red zones, but the situation started changing ever since the state decided to ease lockdown restrictions with its ‘Mission Begin Again’ from June 3. The 19 cities were Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Panvel, Kalyan-Dombivli, Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Mira-Bhayander, Vasai-Virar, Pune, Solapur, Aurangabad, Nashik, Malegaon, Dhule, Jalgaon, Akola, Amravati and Nagpur.On June 3, the 19 cities had 67,885 cases, which accounted for 90.68% of the total cases (74,860). On August 8, they have reported 348,778 cases, 69.32% of the total cases (503,084), meaning that the rest of the areas, including semi-urban and rural areas, are contributing more cases than earlier.This can be further understood as all the 34 districts had contributed only 6,165 cases on June 3 (8.23% of the total cases), which has increased to 115,303 cases (22.91% of the total cases) on August 8.Raigad district collector Nidhi Choudhari said with unlocking of restrictions, they were expecting a rise in cases and preparing accordingly. “For five months, we have kept new cases in check, but with the relaxations, rise in cases was expected because lots of people travel to and from Mumbai and surrounding cities,” Choudhari said.“In tehsils like Roha, Mahad and Mandgaon, most cases are detected in industrial employees as industries have opened up there. The rise is also proportionate to the number of tests that has been increased to 1,700 per day, from 400 previously,” Chaudhari added. Raigad is one of the ten districts contributing heavily to the daily figures, according to the observations made by Lav Agrawal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, in a review meeting called by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday.He has said that ten districts have contributed 79% of the total cases detected in the past one week. Their case fatality rate (CFR) was also higher that the state’s average and asked the state to focus more on them.The list also included Pune, Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon, Sangli and Nagpur. On Saturday, Raigad recorded 237 cases, taking its tally to 11,297 cases. Active cases in the district are 4,335.The surge in small cities and rural areas is a cause for concern for the state, given the limited capacity of existing health infrastructure. “It is concerning that the cases are increasing in rural and small cities because they don’t have adequate infrastructure to cope the load on the healthcare system. Even our major cities were not in a position to deal with such a health crisis. The state government is now augmenting health infrastructure in each and every district, along with the cities,” said an official from the state health department.It has developed field hospitals in Mumbai and similar field hospitals are now coming up in other eight satellite cities — Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli, Mira-Bhayander, Ulhasnagar, Panvel, Vasai-Virar and Bhiwandi-Nizampur — of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).On Friday, chief minister directed to develop field hospitals in all major cities of the state. “We want to be prepared if cases further rise as the existing health infrastructure is already overburdened,” said another official privy to the development.The state is also facing shortage of health staff, that includes doctors, nurses, para medical staff etc. the officials said.Pune still leadsMumbai seemed to have maintained sort of stability in daily cases with 1,304 cases reported on Saturday. Its case count stood at 122,316, of which active cases were 19,914.On June 27, Mumbai had reported its highest single-day spike of 2,077 cases. The city’s toll stood at 6,751, after 58 deaths were reported in a day.But Pune continued to contribute maximum infections in the daily caseload as it recorded 1,457 cases on Saturday. Its tally stood at 69,500 cases. Pimpri Chinchwad, satellite city in Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR), recorded 890 cases, third-highest contributor in the state. Its tally went up to 27,463.Rise in deaths a major issueRise in death figures is another cause of concern that the state is struggling with. Maharashtra still has highest number of deaths across states in the country.As many as 2,373 deaths have been reported in the last eight days of this month, as against 6,988 deaths in July, 5,638 in June, 2,286 deaths in May, 449 in April and 10 deaths in March, when the pandemic had started.With 17,367 deaths, the CFR of the state was recorded 3.45% on Saturday. It continued to be second highest in the country after Gujarat, where CFR was 3.79%, with 2,605 deaths (68,768 cases) till Friday, according to the statistics shared by the state medical education department.Dr Om Shrivastava, infectious diseases specialist and member of the 11-member task force appointed by the state government for clinically ill patients, said there may be many reasons behind large number of deaths. “One part is to do with the basics of infection-control properly. It is also to do with large part of immunity of Indians and there may be other genetic factors and all of that may be coming in to play. I don’t think we know enough about the virus at this time. For all of us, it is also a learning experience,” he said.As many as 338,262 infected patients have recovered and discharged from various hospitals across the state till date. On Saturday alone, 11,081 have recovered, taking the recovery rate of the state to 67.26%, against the national average of 68.32%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-covid-19-count-goes-over-500k-with-sharpest-1-day-spike/story-sexCyB0N2zwshlG8FM578O.html
09-08-2020||Delhi||Disabled students denied entry to JNU campus, alleged students’ union||Students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Saturday said the administration did not allow a second-year undergraduate student, who is 80% physically disabled, to enter the campus to appear for online exams. The JNU students’ union (JNUSU) said the student was made to wait for eight hours at the varsity gate and turned away. “He [the student] had been informed that his exams were starting from August 10. As he could not access internet at home and could not concentrate on his studies, due to pre-existing issues at home, he decided to return to his hostel on the JNU campus,” the JNUSU said in a statement. The union said the student waited outside the gate from 6am for around eight hours and was forced to return disappointed. “He was even denied permission to use the washroom,” the union alleged. In response, registrar Pramod Kumar said the university has formulated clear guidelines about the entry into the campus. “So many students have left their belongings behind and we can’t allow them to enter the campus to even collect it because that holds a two-way threat -- either they can get infected or infect others,” he said. There have been 46 cases of Covid-19 in the JNU so far. “We don’t have quarantine or isolation facilities. We have a responsibility towards those residing on the campus. If we allow people to move in and out of the campus and that leads to more cases, who will bear the responsibility for it?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/disabled-students-denied-entry-to-jnu-campus-alleged-students-union/story-yrA3S7sm1NPXsWdOcSIsnK.html
09-08-2020||Delhi||How Covid-19 killed the economy of Delhi’s ‘coaching colonies’||Two years ago, Prateek Vats, 25, quit his job as a digital marketer to start Timple Tiffin Services in east Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar, a hub of coaching institutes for chartered accountancy and banking exams. He rented a place, hired four female cooks, and a delivery boy. Within a couple of months, business picked up, and he was delivering 300 tiffins every day, mostly to students living in hundreds of PG accommodations in the area. In March, he was planning expansion when the Coronavirus disease broke out, leading to lockdowns. In April, he folded up his business. “The students were suddenly afraid of ordering food from outside. By April, orders came down from 300 tiffins a day to just 10 tiffins. The Coronavirus has killed the economy of this student hub,” Vats says. Vats is not exaggerating. A committee set up by the HRD ministry (now called education ministry) in 2015 pegged the annual turnover of the coaching industry at Rs 24,000 crore, and while Kota may be the coaching capital of the country—Delhi is not far behind. Delhi has hundreds of institutes providing coaching for IAS, engineering, medical and a host of other competitive exams in places such as central Delhi’s Old Rajender Nagar, north Delhi’s Mukherjee Nagar, Laxmi Nagar, and Jia Serai and Ber Serai in south Delhi, which together are home to about 1 lakh students. The economies of these areas have, over the years, come to depend on the mushrooming coaching centres, which have led to many ancillary businesses such as bookshops, PG guest houses, study libraries, binders, photocopiers, and students mess and tiffin services. With coaching centres remaining shut, the streets that were swarming with students not so long ago are now emptier than ever before. While many businesses have shut down, others are struggling for survival. “I had to permanently close one of my three study libraries as I was unable to pay rent,” says Rajeev Nathani, who co-founded Tranquil Reading Zone in 2015 in Old Rajender Nagar, a resettlement colony, which transformed into a hub for IAS coaching in the past decade. A ‘study library’ is a large air-conditioned reading room divided into small cubicles for students, with a hotel-like reception area. Over 200 such 24/7 facilities had come up in Old Rajender Nagar and other student hubs where one could see students, their heads buried in the books, till late into the night. Almost all of 15,000 students who lived in the colony have gone back. “My daily sale was about Rs 80,000 per day; now it is down to Rs 8,000. About 20 book shops came up in the area in the past few years, and about four have shut as they were unable to pay rent. Even I had to close one of my two shops,” says Anil Kumar, who opened his first bookshop 10 years ago in Old Rajender Nagar, which has about 60 IAS coaching institutes. Kumar’s first was an instant success, encouraging him to open another in the same area. With the continuing uncertainty about when they will be allowed to reopen, most IAS coaching centres have not started admissions, which in normal times take place between May and July for a nine-month course. “We have been treated like any school and college by the government. The civil services is a syllabus-heavy exam and online education is not effective. We expect the government to find a way to enable in-class coaching,” says Arjun Ravindran, director, Vajiram & Ravi, one of Delhi’s oldest and much sought-after IAS coaching institutes. The institute, the first to arrive in Old Rajender Nagar in 1996, is credited with transforming the resettlement colony into a vibrant students’ hub. Many coaching institutes across the city had to shed staff, including teachers. For example, ALS IAS Coaching Institute, in Mukherjee Nagar, reduced staff by 50%. “With no new admissions, and revenue falling to zero, we did not have a choice,” says Jojo Mathew, chief executive director, ALS, which had about 2,000 students at its Mukherjee Nagar branch and charged about Rs 75,000 for the course. In Old Rajender Nagar, which is preferred by English medium IAS aspirants, the fee in various institutes varied from 1 lakh to 1.5 lakh. Hundreds of teachers in these institutes, who charged anything between Rs10,000 and Rs20,000 per hour, depending on their reputation, too, have lost income. Interestingly, most coaching centres were started by former IAS aspirants. Mathew, who hails from Kochi, came to Delhi in 1994 to prepare for the Civil Services Examination. Having failed to make it to IAS, he turned a teacher and started ALS in 1998 in Mukherjee Nagar. “I had no intention of going back to my home town, defeated. I had cleared the Mains, and I thought I could as well teach. There were only a few IAS coaching institute in the area those days,” says Mathew. Today, Mukherjee Nagar has about 100 small and big Civil Services coaching institutes catering to Hindi-medium IAS aspirants, mostly from UP and Bihar. With a constant flow of students—IAS aspirants as well those studying in DU—from all parts of the country, Mukherjee Nagar, along with adjoining colonies such as Nehru Vihar and Gandhi Vihar, became the city’s biggest hub of students, home to about 70,000 of them. Almost 60% of the houses in the resettlement colony were serving as PG accommodations or student guest houses—houses with single rooms, sharing rooms on different floors, with a bed, a table, a cooler or an AC. While a double room would cost about Rs 12,000 each in Old Rajender Nagar, in Mukherjee Nagar and Laxmi Nagar it would cost about Rs 8,000 each.Today, almost all of them are empty.“All 25 rooms in my guest house have remained unoccupied since May. My owner is demanding rent. Besides, I have to pay fixed electricity charges. I am not sure whether I should hand over the property to the owner, or wait for the students to come back. The problem is I have spent lakhs on furniture, and I do not know what to do with that,” says Rohit Tomar , who runs Tomar Luxury PG in Mukherjee Nagar. Rajesh Tiwari, who runs MP Galaxy PG Boys hostel in Laxmi Nagar, faces a similar dilemma. “Today my 50-room guest house looks haunted. I have massive debts,” he says. Jagdish Chandra Gosain, chairman of Mukherjee Nagar Niwasi Manch, an RWA in the neighbourhood, says the collapse of the coaching industry in the colony has created a livelihood crisis for a large number of people who were dependant on rent. “About 50% house owners in the colony were dependent on rental income, and many of them moved to neighbouring colonies on rent after renting out their own houses to students,” says Gosain, adding most of those who operate student guest houses are from outside Delhi. “They locked the premises and moved to their native places. Property owners do not know what to do.” Things are no better in south Delhi villages such as Ber Sarai and Jiya Sarai, other thriving student hubs in the capital. Their close proximity to IIT and JNU turned them into havens for students studying for various competitive examinations such as JEE ( Mains), CSIR NET, Jam , among others. Like elsewhere, most businesses catering to students are facing tough times.“Earlier, my machines never stopped, and students had to wait. Now I am waiting for students. I thought mine was a recession-proof business, but now I have learnt my lessons,” says Shaan ( he uses one name) who started New Star Binding House five years ago in Ber Sarai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/how-coronavirus-killed-the-economy-of-delhi-s-coaching-colonies/story-6Tzovzx4VhR94GZ0emD3vJ.html
09-08-2020||Delhi||Man held for stalking, threatening Telugu cinema actor||A 26-year-old pharmacist with a private firm in Gurugram was arrested Friday for stalking a prominent Telegu cinema woman actor, sending her lewd messages, threatening her with images of guns, and finally landing outside her home in Delhi’s Rohini, the police said on Saturday. Investigators said the suspect, Nikhil Gangwar, was “obsessed” with the woman and was angry with her for repeatedly ignoring his social media proposals for marriage. “While the stalking dates back to as early as 2016, it began to take the form of threats and lewd messages about a year ago. The woman ignored him for a long time believing him to be an obsessed fan, but she decided to approach the police after he revealed to her on social media that he had tracked down her Delhi home address,” a senior police investigator, who didn’t want to be identified, said. PK Mishra, deputy commissioner of police (Rohini), confirmed the incident and said Gangwar has been arrested and booked for stalking and criminal intimidation. The suspect, who belongs to Jharkhand and holds an MSc degree from a reputed college, was working as a pharmacist with a private firm in Gurugram. He lived alone in a rented flat in Rohini, police said. The woman actor has had a successful career as a model and has been working in the Telugu film industry of late. She has over 1.5 million followers on social media sites such as Instagram and Facebook, police said. “Her family lives in Delhi while she shuttles between Mumbai and Hyderabad for work,” another investigator said. The first time the actor recalls noticing Gangwar was in 2016 when he allegedly began posting multiple comments on her social media posts. “She just saw him as a fan at that time,” the investigator said. “But, last year, he began posting marriage proposals on her social media posts. Such comments went unnoticed until their frequency increased. The actor finally blocked his account,” the first officer said. But Gangwar allegedly went on to create other profiles to continue stalking her. “When she realised that these profiles belonged to the same man, she began blocking all those accounts until she tired of it,” the officer said. “Gangwar, meanwhile, was angry at not receiving any response from her and began sending her lewd messages. In early 2020, the messages turned into threats warning her of physical harm. At one point, he even sent her images of guns to frighten her,” the officer said. The actor finally decided to seek police help late last month after he turned up outside her house.”She had come to her Delhi home to visit her parents in March and hadn’t been able to return due to the lockdown. It was during this period that Gangwar managed to procure her Delhi address,” the officer said. In July, he allegedly visited her neighbourhood, but found her house locked. “So, he took photos of her house and sent them to her on social media as evidence that he had tracked her down. It was then that she decided to file a police complaint,” the officer said. The FIR was registered at Rohini (North) police station based on her statement. “We then procured details of all the accounts he had used to harass the woman. That led us to Gangwar’s home in Gurugram and wee arrested him on Friday,” the investigator said.The actor refused to speak to HT about the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-held-for-stalking-threatening-telugu-cinema-woman-actor/story-4IPIIGN7gd9tYTn5tFMXeJ.html
09-08-2020||Delhi||Commuters hassled as Noida shuts Kalindi Kunj border for CM Yogi’s Noida visit||Saturday morning turned into a nightmare for commuters between Delhi and Noida with the Noida police shutting the Kalindi Kunj border and placing barricades to check vehicles at the other entry points to Noida -- on Noida Link Road, Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway, and Mayur Vihar Phase-2 -- as well as the entry points to Ghaziabad. The Noida traffic police said the restrictions were part of heightened security on account of a visit by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who was in Noida’s Sector 39 to inaugurate a hospital. He later visited Sector 59 to inspect a Covid-19 management control room. Commuters complained about the “unannounced” border closure, which led to serpentine traffic queues at the Delhi-Noida borders. The situation was particularly bad at Kalindi Kunj, where vehicles were being turned back by the police. “I was on my way from Sarita Vihar to Noida. At Kalindi Kunj, police had put up barricades stopping vehicular entry from the Delhi side. I was left waiting for an hour, before traffic cops told us that the restrictions will be removed only by afternoon,” Saurav Kumar, a commuter, said. The Kalindi Kunj border closure had a cascading effect on the traffic on Delhi-Mathura Road, which became choked. Many said the chaos on the stretch was also aggravated by drivers reversing their vehicles on seeing the barricades and trying to make their way back against the flow of traffic. In a series of advisories issued on Saturday through their social media accounts, the Delhi traffic police informed commuters from Delhi about the barricading on the Noida borders and suggested that they take alternative routes. “Traffic movement is very slow from Delhi towards NOIDA on Kalindi Kunj Flyover due to very tight barricading/checking by NOIDA Police. Motorists are advised to use DND,” read the first advisory, issued at 10am. However, a while later, the high traffic volume on the DND Flyway route brought vehicles to a standstill. “Being the weekend, the traffic was still under control. We were issuing regular advisories but the closure of borders was a call taken by the Noida police on account of VVIP movement. By evening, the traffic had eased,” a senior Delhi traffic police officer said. A large number of trucks and bikers were also stranded. Noida traffic police said vehicles attached to essential services were allowed to proceed and others were requested to take the DND Flyway. “We reinforced the border restrictions today (Saturday) morning which led to slow movement of traffic. The traffic on Kalindi Kunj route was stopped for less than 10 minutes due to the CM’s visit and it did not cause any major snarls. However, for threat assessment, some vehicles were being checked and necessary documents verified,” deputy commissioner of police, zone 1 (Noida), Sankalp Sharma said.Frustrated commuters took to social media to vent their anger. Many posted pictures and videos of the stagnant traffic, while others complained about the lack of prior information and absence of traffic personnel to redirect vehicles. Devendra Mawai, a commuter, tweeted, “Whole Noida and Delhi border is blocked for last four hours without any prior information, it’s absolutely chaotic and there is a terrible jam on the Delhi-Noida border; I’m on the Yamuna bridge for last three hours . Please allow smooth traffic. (sic)” Noida also has weekend restrictions on account of the “mini lockdown” in place to help with Covid-19 social distancing norms. Police said the borders will be monitored as long as these lockdowns continue in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/commuters-hassled-as-noida-shuts-kalindi-kunj-border-for-cm-yogi-s-noida-visit/story-o2QZxPLCsQexjKfE6EHeJP.html
09-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi to soon get startup policy, CM Kejriwal meets stakeholders||Delhi will soon have its own start-up policy, aimed at supporting entrepreneurs and generating employment, spokespersons from chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office said on Saturday.To kick-start the consultation process to draft the policy and discuss ideas to develop Delhi as a leading choice for start-ups, Kejriwal on Saturday convened a meeting with industry leaders and young entrepreneurs, who joined hands with the government to advance its plans in the sector.Among those who attended the Saturday meeting include Ajai Chowdhry (co-founder, HCL), Padmaja Ruparel (co-founder, Indian Angel Network) and young leaders like Sriharsha Majety (co-founder and CEO, Swiggy), Farid Ahsan (co-founder, ShareChat), Suchita Salwan (founder and CEO, Little Black Book), Riyaaz Amlani, CEO and MD, Impresario Handmade Restaurants. The national capital is a hub of students, industries, and several prestigious institutions, and over the last few years, the start-up ecosystem here has amassed a plethora of opportunities for budding entrepreneurs.At the launch of the policy consultation process, Kejriwal said, “Since my IIT days, I have seen some of the most brilliant minds from India go abroad looking for better opportunities. I believe Indians are the smartest entrepreneurs in the world and all they need are the right opportunity and the right conditions to help them thrive. With this start-up policy, we aim to make Delhi one of the top five global destinations for start-ups.”Kejriwal is a student of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.According to a September 2019 report by TiE, sections of which Kejriwal quoted on Saturday, Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) house over 7,000 start-ups. As per the report, the region has the highest number of active start-ups in the country as well, and has a 23% share of all start-ups in the country. The report states that Delhi-NCR is set to become one of the top five global start-up hubs by 2025 with 12,000 start-ups, 30 unicorns, and a cumulative valuation of about $150 billion. A unicorn is a start-up firm with a valuation above $1 billion.The objective of the draft policy is to support entrepreneurs and build a robust economic and policy infrastructure that will create new jobs and bring new competitive dynamics into the current economic system, Kejriwal said.The government in a statement said policy consultations will be held over two stages.“Firstly, in the spirit of the Delhi model of teamwork, the Delhi government on Saturday invited industry leaders, entrepreneurs, and policy experts from various sectors to provide inputs in drafting the new start-up policy. Following this, the Delhi government will soon release a draft start-up policy and launch an online forum to seek inputs from the general public on the start-up policy,” the government said.Industry stakeholders, meanwhile, welcomed the initiative.Rajan Anandan, managing director, Sequoia Capital, said, “NCR is already the largest start-up region in India and within NCR, Delhi has the most start-ups. We were honoured to be invited by the chief minister of Delhi to provide suggestions on how to make Delhi one of the world’s top five start-up destinations. The discussion was very good with many ideas on what it will take Delhi’s startup ecosystem to the next level.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-to-soon-get-startup-policy-cm-meets-stakeholders/story-WtXZmwGYcgkzkZW8btfuMI.html
09-08-2020||Delhi||As Delhi testing hits high, 1,404 Covid-19 infections added||Delhi reported 1,404 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, the highest single-day increase since July 18, according to data from the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin. Till Friday, the Capital had recorded a weekly average of 1,018 cases.However, the increase in the number of detected cases is likely due to an increase in testing. In fact, Friday’s testing numbers were the highest in the Capital since the Covid-19 crisis began, with over 24,500 samples collected.The positivity rate — the percentage of people who test positive among those tested, at 5.7%, was lower than the week’s average of 6.6%.The number of tests being conducted during the week had been low – dipping to 9,295 in the bulletin released on August 4, and the positivity rate for the day had touched 7.25%.The number of tests for the viral infection being conducted in Delhi had shot up in the third week of June after rapid antigen testing was rolled out.More than three in four of the 24,592 tests reported in Saturday’s bulletin were conducted using these rapid test kits. A person testing positive on the kit, is considered to be a “true positive” or truly having the infection. However, due to low sensitivity, the test tends to throw false negatives. Hence, the government tests the symptomatic people who have tested negative with the rapid kit using RT-PCR again.The “slight increase” in the number of cases should not be a cause of concern, say experts.Dr Puneet Mishra, professor in the department of community medicine at All India Institute of Medical Sciences said, “A jump from 1,200 cases to 1,400 cases just for a day is not a cause for worry. It could be because of the increased testing. If we compare the number of cases now to what was being reported daily in Delhi just two months back, the difference is huge. For now, we need to observe the trend. Ups and downs are okay, unless the numbers keep increasing consistently over the next week or two.”A high prevalence of antibodies in the population could also be the reason for transmission slowing down in Delhi.“The number of cases in Delhi have gone down even as the cases continue to rise in the other parts of the country. It is likely that the prevalence of antibodies will be higher in the second round of sero-surveillance. If it is 40 or 50%, it might be the reason transmission is slowing down in Delhi. There are just two ways of gaining immunity to the infection – either through a vaccine or through natural infection. There is no vaccine against Covid-19 at present, so immunity can be developed only through natural infection. It is a good thing if a high percentage of people develop the immunity without getting sick and needing hospitalisation. At least for the time being, they will be protected against the infection and also protect others through her immunity,” said Dr Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/as-delhi-testing-hits-high-1404-covid-infections-added/story-I0fXUkOuvsU5NMbcI8s6xK.html
09-08-2020||Delhi||14 injured in LPG cylinder blast at South Delhi slum||Fourteen people were injured when an LPG cylinder exploded at a jhuggi in South Delhi’s Tigri, triggering a fire in the slum on Saturday evening, the police said.Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (South), said while a middle-aged woman sustained serious burns, the injuries received by the others were relatively minor and were either due to the blaze or because of the collapse of some parts of the ‘jhuggi’ in which the blast took place.“We are yet to ascertain the identity of the injured people. It is still too early to say how serious the woman’s condition is,” Thakur said on Saturday evening.The call about the cylinder blast was received by the fire department at 7pm and eight fire tenders were dispatched to control the situation at the Jhuggi Jhopdi Colony of Tigri, said Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Services.The LPG cylinder blast had led to the collapse of some parts of the one-storey jhuggi and the fire had spread to some other nearby shanties, the DCP said.“The fire was quickly doused and we removed the injured from the rubble and moved them to a hospital,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/14-injured-in-lpg-cylinder-blast-at-slum/story-qB579rPKItZiuAs0DYcWzH.html

Kejriwal, who was visiting market area under the New Delhi constituency, directed NDMC officials to solve the problem by then or shut it down, a Delhi government statement said. “The chief minister has given a deadline of 10 days to the NDMC officials to ensure cleanliness in the area and said that if the problem is not addressed by August 20, the plant will be shut down,” read a statement from the government. When contacted, a senior NDMC official said that the plant will be inspected and the issue will be resolved within the stipulated period. “The matter has been brought to our notice and we will get a team of engineers to work on it so that the stench from the plant is controlled,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-asks-ndmc-to-fix-stench-from-compost-pit-in-gol-market-area/story-elsA6aY7er1QIt9HlJz4wN.html

They can safely be in the same room on a separate cot. The mothers can safely breastfeed the children after taking some precautions such as wearing a mask, following strict hand hygiene, and cleaning any other surfaces she is likely to touch while feeding,” said Dr Sushma Nangia, head of the department of neonatology at Lady Hardinge Medical College. Lady Hardinge is attached with the Kalawati Saran Children’s Hospital, which is one of the biggest stand-alone paediatric hospital in the country. She said babies have to be placed in a separate cot about six feet away from the mother’s bed. And, every two hours, the mother may breastfeed the baby. “There is no evidence to suggest that mothers can transmit the infection to babies through breast milk and given the benefits of it, breastfeeding must be promoted. Only a few cases have been reported globally wherein viral particles have been found in the breast milk, but these were dead particles that cannot cause infection. Breastfeeding provides protective elements against several other diseases,” Dr Nangia said. At least 18 newborns in Delhi have tested positive for Covid-19, but the route of transmission of infection is unclear. “There is no conclusive proof of vertical transmission of Covid-19 in babies. And, in many cases, the babies test negative on a repeat test which could suggest that the virus detected could be fluids from the mother that the baby might have taken in,” Dr Nangia said. Vertical transmission is when an infection is passed on from a mother to a child through the placenta or breast milk just before or immediately after birth. Horizontal transmission is when Covid-19 is passed on from person to person through respiratory droplets. The World Health Organization recommends that “mothers with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 should be encouraged to initiate or continue to breastfeed. Mothers should be counselled that the benefits of breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks for transmission”. The same has been endorsed by the National Neonatal Forum, Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI), and the Indian Academy of Paediatrics. A study of 120 newborns in New York city, United States, published in the journal Lancet Child and Adolescent Health, shows that none of the babies got the infection during childbirth or after two weeks of breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact. “There is no contraindication for breastfeeding even with Covid-19. Even for mothers with viral infections like HIV, breastfeeding along with proper therapy is best for the baby. That is much better than providing contaminated cow milk etc,” said Dr Roopali Diwan, head of the department of gynaecology, Safdarjung hospital. However, it is easier said than done. Doctors say families push back thinking that breastfeeding while being infected will put the baby at risk. “A lot of my students working across the country have said that many mothers or family members believe that if the mother is Covid-19 positive, breastfeeding would harm the baby. This is the reason I suggest that the entire family should be counselled that breastfeeding is safe,” Dr Nangia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/safe-to-breastfeed-newborns-even-if-moms-are-covid-positive-say-doctors/story-iT0bJZs1PQyJv5ObiY3pAN.html
09-08-2020||Gurugram||Illegal call centre that duped US citizens of millions under garb of tech fix busted||The chief minister’s flying squad Saturday busted yet another illegal call centre operating from Sohna Road that allegedly duped people, especially those in English-speaking countries like the US, under the garb of providing technical support. Two directors of the firm were arrested.According to the police, the company had duped at least 35,000 users of millions of dollars. The victims used to receive an email with fake pop-up error messages stating that a malware had infected their computer and if not rectified immediately, their personal and financial data would vanish. It urged the user to call on a certain phone number. A pop-up would be displayed on full-screen mode and would lock the user’s screen within a few minutes with messages like “personal information is not safe” or “you computer has been locked”, enough to scare an unsuspecting user. “The number would be operated by employees of Green Rock Enterprise from the fifth floor of JMD Megapolis Mall on Sohna Road,” said Police commissioner KK Rao. “The operator would urge the users get their system repaired against a one-time fee and buy anti-virus software that they would say was of reputed companies through gift cards that would cost at least $250.” The bogus anti-malware application would in reality be a bug that would give the operator access to the victims’ computers. Police said the firm had about 150 employees, including those who worked remotely. The raiding team allegedly found 26 people, including seven women, at the firm on Saturday. The directors were identified as Delhi resident Vikram Verma, and Gurugrma resident Rishab. Police said they had a criminal record and were earlier also involved in similar fraud. The firm did not have any permits from the government to operate either.Inderjeet Yadav, deputy superintendent of police (DSP) of CM Flying Squad, said that employees working at the call centres were not arrested but were not given a clean chit either. “They may be questioned. Action will be taken against them if we found their involvement in the fraud,” he said. Yadav said they would write to the US agencies to record statements from victims. The employees were paid between ₹15,000 and ₹25,000 per month and would work from 8 pm to 5 am, five days a week. “They were working as per the US time,” said Yadav. A case was registered under sections 420 (cheating), 120B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC and sections 66D (cheating by personation by using computer resource) and 75 (committing offence outside India using computer network) of IT Act 2008 at Sadar police station. Earlier, in December 2018, similar 17 FIRs were filed by Microsoft Corporation (India) Private Limited in Gurugram and Noida with regard to fake tech support from users in 12 countries, including the USA, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, among others. In 2019 more than nine fake call centres were busted, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-held-for-running-fake-call-centre-and-duping-us-citizens/story-C9sF8paIp2kWyBh3vvcgsJ.html

The photo-sharing platform had several accounts sharing her pictures without her consent. The woman, who had won several beauty pageants in the past, has never created any account on Instagram, say police.Aishwarya Sheoran has been living with her father in the Army Officer’s Colony in Colaba since 2017. Colonel Ajaykumar Sheoran, her father, has been posted in Karimnagar, Telangana. Sheoran secured 93rd rank in the UPSC exams in 2019 and was also finalist for Femina Miss India 2016. “It’s not a serious issue as of now, but could be misused in future,” Sheoran told HT. Sheoran, in her complaint to the police, said that on August 5 while she was speaking to a newspaper for an interview, the journalist asked her which one is her official account on the popular app as there are too many of them in her name. She told the journalist that she has no account on Instagram.Later, she asked her brother to check if there are such accounts in her name. They were shocked to discover 20 fake accounts in her name. Many accounts claimed to be her official account. One of the Instagram accounts has over 27,000 followers.“We don’t know how the accused may misuse these 20 fake accounts. He may misuse my sister’s name and photos for illegal monetary gain, hence we decided to report the matter to the police,” said Aman, Sheoran’s brother. The FIR was registered on Thursday.“The accused person has created Instagram accounts using her photos without her permission. We have registered a case of identity theft and have begun investigation. These fake accounts would be pulled down with the assistance from the service provider and we would trace the person who had created these accounts,” said Shivaji Fadtare, senior inspector of Colaba police station.The police have registered a complaint under section 66C (identify theft) of the Information Technology Act.“The accused might have misused the complainant’s photo as she is a popular face and has an inspiring success story. The accused may have done this in order to attract more followers on Instagram,” added another police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/23-year-old-who-aced-upsc-exam-finds-20-fake-accounts-of-her-fir-filed/story-4yCDiMdNsbUucyXx3N3ziI.html

Khatri is survived by his wife and three children.MLA Ghanshyam Das Arora said, “I got to know about his sad demise early morning. Khatri’s son left for Chennai in the afternoon to bring back his body. After the procedures are completed, the body will reach Yamunanagar on Sunday and the funeral could take place on Monday.”“Khatri was unwell from quite some time. Even then, he was involved in party activities with dedication and discipline. He helped party workers in every possible way without any bias,” Arora said. His younger son Prateek said his father was unwell since November last year and had to undergo transplant. “My father had some problem in the heart and lungs for which we had planned a transplant in April but it was delayed due to the lockdown and he was admitted at the hospital on July 17 for the same. The transplant was pending but in the meantime he suddenly had a cardiac arrest and died late on Friday,” he said. Khatri was elected as BJP’s Yamunanagar district chief for the second time in 2016. Earlier, he had served as the district chief from 2006-2008.Education minister Kanwar Pal has also expressed sorrow on his demise. “Mahender Khatri and his family have remained connected with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) since long.

The resident of Hadapsar was declared dead by a private hospital located in Manjri Budruk, which is located on the border of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Haveli taluka limits, which comes under the Zilla Parishad (ZP). One of the relatives of the deceased said, “He was admitted on July 25 and was undergoing treatment for Covid-19. During the admission too, we faced problems of non-availability of beds and ambulances. Somehow we were informed of a bed at this hospital and we admitted him there. We did not think about the hospital being inside PMC limit or ZP limit. We just wanted our family member to get good treatment. Unfortunately, he succumbed to the infection.”“We had to arrange for a hearse van as we did not get any help from the hospital. We got the cremation certification for Yerawada’s ‘Amardham’ cremation centre. We dialled the PMC number for a hearse van, but they refused to come stating that the hospital was located outside the PMC limits and that the gram panchayat or the taluka administration has to take responsibility. After no response from the civic body, we contacted the local councillor for help, who later arranged for a private van and the cremation took place almost six hours after my uncle was declared dead.”PMC assistant health officer Dr Kalpana Baliwant, who is handling Covid-19 dead body management, said, “The gram panchayat authorities are supposed to manage Covid-19 dead bodies if the death is reported from a hospital under their limits. I did get a call on Friday night for the same, but the PMC cannot keep doing the work that the ZP or Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) is supposed to do, even though we have enough hearse vans and ambulances. There are so many deaths reported at Sassoon hospital of people from outside the district too, but since the hospital is in our limits, we cremate those bodies. We do not check their ration cards. Often PCMC and gram panchayats dismiss their responsibilities and call for the PMC van because the person was living within our jurisdiction.”Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer of the Pune Zilla Parishad, said, “Every hospital within the ZP limits has been asked to display boards giving information about the hearse vans, ambulances and other important contacts. We have a decentralised system with five nodal officers for all gram panchayats, so that the calls are responded to immediately. This is the fifth complaint, regarding Covid-19, be it shortage of beds, ventilators or dead body management. I will look into the issue and see what went wrong.”NCP councillor from the area, Yogesh Sasane, said, “I tried to contact the PMC’s health department and the electricity department who refused to attend to the query. After much delay, I finally had to call a private hearse van and the body was taken to the cremation centre. Even though the deceased lived in PMC limits, the civic body refused to send a van.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/boundary-dispute-between-pmc-and-zp-leads-to-6-hr-delay-in-cremation-of-covid-19-patient/story-uR4xWpjgFPhT3f6zhqlnlL.html
09-08-2020||World||Bill Gates says US coronavirus testing has ‘mind-blowing’ problems||Microsoft Corp. founder and billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates said it’s “mind-blowing” that the US government hasn’t improved Covid-19 testing that he described as slow and lacking fair access.“You’re paying billions of dollars in this very inequitable way to get the most worthless test results of any country in the world,” Gates said on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS” on Sunday. “No other country has this testing insanity.”“A variety of early missteps by the US and then the political atmosphere meant that we didn’t get our testing going,” he said.Gates cited long lines at commercial labs and delays in obtaining test results, meaning that “you pay as much for the late result as the timely result.” Meanwhile, “very wealthy people have access to these quick-turnaround tests,” he said.“It’s mind-blowing that you can’t get the government to improve the testing because they just want to say how great it is,” Gates said.Public officials have regularly cited delays in testing results in the US as an impediment to quick contract tracking and isolation of people infected with the virus.President Donald Trump has defended the US record on testing as “the best ever, the best in the world,” telling Fox News last week that half of the country’s testing is “short-term.”Gates reiterated that he expects the US to largely get through the pandemic by the end of next year as therapeutics and a vaccine become available.In a Bloomberg interview last week Gates said he’s funded vaccine development efforts by AstraZeneca Plc, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax Inc.The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged more than $350 million toward Covid-19 research. Much of that has gone toward funding research and manufacturing capacity that will help a vaccine be distributed globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-gates-says-us-coronavirus-testing-has-mind-blowing-problems/story-W7Ius7yvHZLrZqVAGYUXON.html
09-08-2020||World||One killed, 20 wounded in Washington shooting||At least three shooters opened fire during a large, unauthorized gathering of people in Washington early on Sunday, killing a teenager and wounding 20 others, including a critically injured police officer, authorities said.The gunfire broke out during a gathering of hundreds of people in a southeast district of the nation’s capital, D.C. Metropolitan Police Chief Peter Newsham and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a press conference.Local media called the event an “unsanctioned block party” in a residential neighborhood. Bowser said it violated the city’s coronavirus-induced ban on large public meetings of more than 50 people.“There were certainly was too many people out there, you know, with the Covid-19,” Newsham said.“We can’t tolerate these types of gatherings in our city during Covid-19. It’s just too dangerous,” he added.Newsham said at least three shooters opened fire when a dispute broke out at about 12:20 a.m. EDT (0420 GMT), striking 21 people, including an off-duty police officer.“She is struggling for her life right now at a local hospital,” Newsham said, saying the officer was among at least 11 women hurt. Killed was Christopher Brown, 17, who was pronounced dead at a local hospital, Newsham added.“I really don’t understand how my child’s life is just gone,” his mother Artecka Brown told Reuters.Most of the victims were adults and, aside from the police officer, none of the injuries were considered life-threatening, Newsham said.Bowser, wearing a face mask like Newsham, noted that people cooped up at home, as advised by medical experts to stop disease spread during the coronavirus pandemic, were starting to break rules, like those limiting the size of gatherings to allow for social distancing.“There are cookouts that have happened peacefully for years and years that are just spinning out of control,” Bowser said. “Sadly, several people who have no regard for human life opened fire at what had been people gathered together, enjoying themselves,” she said.Newsham said police had tried to break up the gathering but apparently lacked the manpower to do so. “It doesn’t sound like we had enough officers to disperse the crowd,” he said.No details were immediately available on the suspected shooters. Multiple weapons, including handguns, were confiscated from the scene, Newsham said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-killed-20-wounded-in-washington-shooting/story-oKFFL4zdISdsLXB0TAcAiI.html

The monsoon season runs from July through September, during which swelling rivers cause damage to crops and infrastructure.According to Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority, 19 people were killed in rain-related incidents in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, 12 in southern Sindh province, 8 in Punjab province and 10 in the country’s scenic northern Gilgit Baltistan region in the past three days.Rains also partially damaged about 100 homes and caused a breach in a flooded main canal, inundating villages in Sindh province. In a statement, the military said troops used boats to rescue stranded people and move them to safety. It said a medical camp was also established and food was being provided to the rescued people.Heavy rains also lashed many districts in southwestern Baluchistan province, damaging homes. According to local media reports, at least eight people were killed in Baluchistan because of rains and flash flooding.Heavy rainfall began last week and continued Sunday, flooding streets even in the eastern city of Lahore. It especially disrupted normal life last week in Karachi, the provincial capital of Sindh province and Pakistan’s commercial hub, where sewage flooded most of the streets, prompting Prime Minister Imran Khan to order the army to assist authorities in handling the situation.According to the Meteorological Department, heavy rains are expected to continue next week.In Pakistan and neighboring India, deadly floods occur regularly during the monsoon season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-days-of-heavy-monsoon-rains-kill-50-people-across-pakistan/story-qP18zsk0YfVWhYbKOpPG1M.html

A warning was sent to the Public Works Ministry the very day the Port of Beirut blew up, and at least three other times this year, shunted from office to office in a deadly game of pass the buck, documents suggest.As reported earlier, customs officials first warned about the chemical in 2016, three years after the ship carrying it had been impounded by Lebanese authorities for not settling port fees, and its volatile cargo was put into storage. But the warnings that could have headed off the mysterious Aug. 4 explosion that killed 156 people, wounded thousands and displaced hundreds of thousands didn’t stop there.Documents provided by the office of Prime Minister Hassan Diab show that interest in the cargo intensified this year for reasons that are unclear.On Jan. 27, State Security asked to investigate the storage of the ammonium nitrate at the port, and five months later, instructed the government commissioner at the military court to deal with the matter. The military court, which was approached because of the substance’s highly explosive nature, responded that it was not its jurisdiction.On May 28, State Security contacted the public prosecutor about the dangerous cache, and was ordered to liaise with port authorities. On July 20, the file was sent to Diab, who asked the Higher Defense Council to look into it. The council referred it on July 24 to the Public Works Ministry -- the entity responsible for port operations -- and the Ministry of Justice.The Public Works Ministry received the file on the morning of Aug. 4, just hours before the blast flattened the port and surrounding areas. Diab’s office attributed the delay in its arrival to the coroanvirus lockdown. The ministry wasn’t immediately available for comment.The current cabinet received the file 14 days prior to the explosion and acted on it in a matter of days, a government spokesman said.Authorities have detained the former and current general managers of Lebanese Customs and questioned a number of security officials and public works ministers. It has also placed all former and current officials responsible for the port under house arrest/Outrage against the government, already under fire for failing to take action to reverse a calamitous financial meltdown in recent months, has boiled up in violent protests. Demonstrators briefly occupied several government buildings and set up nooses in downtown Beirut on Saturday for politicians they blame for the blast. Security forces fired tear gas in response.With the estimated price tag on the damage ranging anywhere from $5 billion and $15 billion, global leaders on Sunday took part in a video conference meant to drum up emergency aid, hosted by the United Nations and Lebanon’s former colonial power, France. French President Emmanuel Macron promised on a visit to Lebanon on Thursday that any aid will go directly to the Lebanese people via non-governmental organizations and bypass a political class notorious for corruption and mismanagement.Diab has promised to propose an early election, though that may not be enough to quell fury over an explosion whose sheer scale drove home to many the extent of the state’s failings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beirut-blast-in-lebanon-s-port-capped-deadly-game-of-pass-the-buck/story-YGzLTAbjGqxOos8IpWGT8O.html

09-08-2020||World||Mauritius races to contain oil spill, protect coastline||Thousands of students, environmental activists and residents of Mauritius were working around the clock Sunday, trying to reduce the damage to the Indian Ocean island from an oil spill after a tanker ran aground on a coral reef.An estimated 1 ton of oil from the Japanese ship’s cargo of 4 tons has already escaped into the sea, officials said. Workers were seeking to stop more oil from leaking, but with high winds and rough seas on Sunday there were reports of new cracks to the ship’s hull.Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth has declared a state of emergency and appealed for international help. He said the spill “represents a danger” for the country of 1.3 million people that relies heavily on tourism and has been hurt by travel restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Satellite images show a dark slick spreading in the turquoise waters near wetlands that the government called “very sensitive.” Wildlife workers and volunteers, meanwhile, ferried dozens of baby tortoises and rare plants from an island near the spill, Ile aux Aigrettes, to the mainland.“This is no longer a threat to our environment, it is a full-blown ecological disaster that has affected one of the most environmentally important parts of Mauritius, the Mahebourg Lagoon,” said Sunil Dowarkasing, an environmental consultant and former member of parliament.“The people of Mauritius, thousands and thousands, have come out to try to prevent as much damage as possible,” said Dowarkasing, who spoke from the relief efforts at Bois des Amourettes by the lagoon.He said people have created long floating oil booms to try to slow the spread into the lagoon and onto the coast. The hastily made fabric booms are stuffed with sugar cane leaves and straw and kept afloat with plastic bottles, he said. People are also using empty oil drums to scoop up as much oil as possible from shallower waters.University students and members of the local Lions and Rotary clubs are among the volunteers, he said.“We are working flat out. It’s a major challenge, because the oil is not only floating in the lagoon, it’s already washing up on the shore,” said Dowarkasing. “The booms are really working in many spots.”He said the steady winds and waves have spread the fuel across the eastern side of the island.“We’ve never seen anything like this in Mauritius,” he said.The lagoon is a protected area, created several years ago to preserve an area in Mauritius as it was 200 years ago.“The coral reefs had begun to regenerate and the lagoon was getting back its coral gardens,” said Dowarkasing. “Now this might all be killed again by the oil spill.”A French military transport aircraft was carrying pollution control equipment to Mauritius and a navy vessel with additional material planned to sail from the nearby French island of Reunion.Residents and environmentalists alike asked why authorities didn’t act more quickly after the ship, the MV Wakashio, ran aground on a coral reef on July 25.“That’s the big question,” Jean Hugues Gardenne with the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation told The Associated Press. “Why that ship has been sitting for long on that coral reef and nothing being done.”For days, residents peered out at the precariously tilted ship as a salvage team arrived and began to work, but ocean waves kept battering the ship. Cracks in the hull were detected a few days ago and the salvage team was quickly evacuated. Some 400 sea booms were deployed to contain the spill, but they were not enough, he said.In Japan, officials of the company that owns the ship, Nagashiki Shipping, and the ship’s operator, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, apologized Sunday for the oil leak.At their first news conference since the ship ran aground two weeks ago, the officials said they have sent experts to Mauritius to join in the cleanup effort. They are trying to do so in an environmentally safe way, without using emulsifiers and other environmentally harmful chemicals, said Kiyoaki Nagashiki, president of the shipowner Nagashiki Shipping.“First of all, we are doing the utmost to prevent further oil spill and to remove it from the sea,” said Akihiko Ono, vice president of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines. “We are aware of a potential major impact on the tourism in the area and we take it very seriously.”The officials said the Wakashio left China on July 14 and was on its way to Brazil. The ship was about 1 mile off the southeast coast of Mauritius when it went aground, even though it was supposed to be 10 to 20 miles (16 to 32 kilometers) away from the island, Mitsui executive Masanori Kato said. Mitsui is investigating why the ship went off course.The officials said the companies were continuing to remove fuel from the ship using a vessel small enough to safely operate in the shallow waters. They said the operation is time-consuming because of rough waves. The shipowner and operator are working with a salvage ship to lift the tanker while trying to prevent any further oil leaks.The ship’s engine room and ballast tank were damaged and had water seeping inside, but its 20 crew members have been safely evacuated, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mauritius-races-to-contain-oil-spill-protect-coastline/story-GJHCvcLW4EFQzaCKa1N8mJ.html
09-08-2020||World||US tops 5 million confirmed coronavirus cases, to Europe’s alarm||With confirmed coronavirus cases in the US hitting 5 million Sunday, by far the highest of any country, the failure of the most powerful nation in the world to contain the scourge has been met with astonishment and alarm in Europe.Perhaps nowhere outside the US is America’s bungled virus response viewed with more consternation than in Italy, which was ground zero of Europe’s epidemic. Italians were unprepared when the outbreak exploded in February, and the country still has one of the world’s highest official death tolls at 35,000.But after a strict nationwide, 10-week lockdown, vigilant tracing of new clusters and general acceptance of mask mandates and social distancing, Italy has become a model of virus containment.“Don’t they care about their health?” a mask-clad Patrizia Antonini asked about people in the United States as she walked with friends along the banks of Lake Bracciano, north of Rome. “They need to take our precautions. ... They need a real lockdown.” Much of the incredulity in Europe stems from the fact that America had the benefit of time, European experience and medical know-how to treat the virus that the continent itself didn’t have when the first COVID-19 patients started filling intensive care units.Yet, more than four months into a sustained outbreak, the U.S. reached the 5 million mark, according to the running count kept by Johns Hopkins University. Health officials believe the actual number is perhaps 10 times higher, or closer to 50 million, given testing limitations and the fact that as many as 40% of all those who are infected have no symptoms.“We Italians always saw America as a model,” said Massimo Franco, a columnist with daily Corriere della Sera. “But with this virus we’ve discovered a country that is very fragile, with bad infrastructure and a public health system that is nonexistent.” Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza hasn’t shied away from criticizing the U.S., officially condemning as “wrong” Washington’s decision to withhold funding from the World Health Organization and expressing amazement at President Donald Trump’s virus response.After Trump finally donned a mask last month, Speranza told La7 television: “I’m not surprised by Trump’s behavior now; I’m profoundly surprised by his behavior before.” With America’s world’s-highest death toll of more than 160,000, its politicized resistance to masks and its rising caseload, European nations have barred American tourists and visitors from other countries with growing cases from freely traveling to the bloc.France and Germany are now imposing tests on arrival for travelers from “at risk” countries, the U.S. included.“I am very well aware that this impinges on individual freedoms, but I believe that this is a justifiable intervention,” German Health Minister Jens Spahn said last week.Mistakes were made in Europe, too, from delayed lockdowns to insufficient protections for nursing home elderly and critical shortages of tests and protective equipment for medical personnel.The virus is still raging in some Balkan countries, and thousands of maskless protesters demanded an end to virus restrictions in Berlin earlier this month. Hard-hit Spain, France and Germany have seen infection rebounds with new cases topping 1,000 a day, and Italy’s cases inched up over 500 on Friday. Britain is still seeing an estimated 3,700 new infections daily, and some scientists say the country’s beloved pubs might have to close again if schools are to reopen in September without causing a new wave.Europe as a whole has seen over 207,000 confirmed virus deaths, by Johns Hopkins’ count.In the US, new cases are running at about 54,000 a day — an immensely high number even when taking into account the country’s larger population. And while that’s down from a peak of well over 70,000 last month, cases are rising in nearly 20 states, and deaths are climbing in most.In contrast, at least for now Europe appears to have the virus somewhat under control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-tops-5-million-confirmed-coronavirus-cases-to-europe-s-alarm/story-2nWIp7euXVvCCQij1K9MeI.html
09-08-2020||World||Beirut explosion: Lebanon priests recount horror as blast rocked church||The video shows Father Rabih Thoumy swinging a chain censer sending smoke into the air when abruptly there is a rumble and then a loud bang as the shockwave from Beirut’s devastating explosion slams into the church.Thoumy darts for cover as stained glass and other debris fall from above. The camera tips over, coming to rest focused on a carpeting of glass shards covering the floor.The world witnessed fleeting glimpses of the horror wrought on the Lebanese people on Tuesday through videos that circulated widely online, among them that dramatic footage as Thoumy celebrated Mass via livestream from Saint Maron-Baouchrieh church.“If we hadn’t run quickly ... we would have been more badly hurt,” Thoumy, who suffered minor injuries on his head from the glass, told The Associated Press. “God has saved us.”The Tuesday evening mass — only about 10 people were present with the church closed to worshippers amid the coronavirus pandemic — had begun just minutes earlier when the church started shaking. Then it felt like it was swaying.Church priest, Father Marwan Mouawad was chanting off-camera when the lights went out and the glass rattled and then came crashing down. A gust of dusty wind — “like a storm,” he said — buffeted him as shards fell on his back. A nun was also injured in the head.“For a second we thought it was an earthquake,” Mouawad said. “Then we thought it could be an explosion targeting a politician.”It was neither. The massive blast was apparently the ignition of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, a chemical used for explosives and fertilizer, that had been stored at the Beirut port.At least 160 people were killed and thousands injured with many more left homeless in a devastating blow to a city and country already reeling from severe economic turmoil and the coronavirus pandemic and related woes.Inside the church, wooden pews that in normal times would have been full of worshippers were left littered and deeply scratched by the jagged glass.“If there were (more) people,” Mouawad said, “we would have definitely seen deaths.”When he finally left the church, he found what he likened to a “ghost city” of blown-out buildings and damaged cars. Later he learned that many members of the church’s congregation had been injured elsewhere.Like other faith communities around the world, the church was already struggling due to the pandemic. It closed to worshippers before reopening with limited capacity, and then closing again as cases increased in the country. Donations and collection plate money have dried up as parishioners increasingly struggled to stay afloat themselves.Now, it faces increased needs from congregation members, many asking for help with food, medicine or repairing homes damaged by the explosion.While the church has yet to begin its own repairs due to financial constraints, it reopened Friday to worshippers with limits on numbers. Only a smattering of the faithful attended service that day. Some didn’t know early enough that the church had reopened; others may have been scared, said Mouawad. There were tears and shock.“They all said the same thing: ‘Thank God that He has saved you.’”Even before the blast, Lebanon has struggled.“We see our people dying. We see our people going hungry,” Mouawad said. “We try to do the work but we have very limited capabilities. ... We cannot replace the role of the state,” which is not meeting the people’s needs, he said.But amid hardship he still sees God’s work, such as in the man who recently called offering to donate food for the needy just when the church had run out of supplies for its twice-a-week soup kitchen.“If there was no faith, we wouldn’t have been able to remain steadfast despite all these crises,” he said. “The people say ‘we rely on God and God will, for sure, not abandon us.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beirut-explosion-lebanon-priests-recount-horror-as-blast-rocked-church/story-CxODdP81fPPzzzWTYuSp8O.html
09-08-2020||World||6 Gulf Arab countries back extending UN arms embargo on Iran||A six-nation bloc of Gulf Arab nations torn apart by internal strife endorsed on Sunday an extension of a United Nations arms embargo on Iran, just two months before it is set to expire.The Gulf Cooperation Council said it sent a letter to the UN Security Council backing an extension of an arms embargo that’s kept Iran from purchasing foreign-made weapons like fighter jets, tanks and warships.The GCC — comprised of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — alleged Iran had “not ceased or desisted from armed interventions in neighboring countries, directly and through organizations and movements armed and trained by Iran.”A Saudi-led coalition continues to battle Yemen’s Houthi rebels, whom the UN, the US and armament experts have accused of receiving arms from Iran. Tehran denies arming the Houthis, even as Iranian armaments and components have repeatedly turned up in Yemen.“As such, it is inappropriate to lift the restrictions on conventional weapons’ movement to and from Iran until it abandons its destabilizing activities in the region and ceases to provide weapons to terrorist and sectarian organizations,” the GCC said.Iran’s mission to the UN did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the GCC statement.The UN banned Iran from buying major foreign weapon systems in 2010 amid tensions over its nuclear program. That blocked Iran from replacing its aging equipment, much of which had been purchased by the shah before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. An earlier embargo targeted Iranian arms exports.Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal saw the UN agree to sunset the arms embargo this October. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the deal in 2018, part of a maximum pressure campaign that’s hurt Iran’s already-ailing economy and led to a series of escalating incidents in the Mideast.That the GCC offered a unified statement on Iran comes as it remains torn by the ongoing Qatar crisis, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Emirates cut diplomatic ties and launch a boycott of the nation beginning in 2017. Kuwait has sought to mediate the crisis, though its 91-year-old emir now is hospitalized in the U.S. suffering from an undisclosed ailment.Amid the crisis, Qatar has had warmer ties with Iran and used its airspace while sharing a vast offshore oil and gas field with Tehran. The small nation is home to the massive Al-Udeid Air Base, home to the forward headquarters of the U.S. military’s Central Command. Oman, which saw its long-serving sultan die earlier this year, long has had close ties to Iran and has served as an interlocutor between Tehran and the West.Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the Emirates long have viewed Iran far more suspiciously, accusing it of stirring up dissent among Shiite populations in the region.The unified GCC statement comes after recent visits by outgoing US special representative for Iran Brian Hook amid the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-gulf-arab-countries-back-extending-un-arms-embargo-on-iran/story-cEZJ00WUH5FqZYl2qlDFYP.html
09-08-2020||World||For pandemic jobless, the only real certainty is uncertainty||For three decades, Kelly Flint flourished as a corporate travel agent, sending everyone from business titans to oil riggers around the planet. Then came the worst pandemic in a century, leaving her jobless and marooned in an uncertain economy.Furloughed since March, Flint has dipped into her retirement account to pay her bills, frustrated that her $600 weekly emergency federal aid payments have expired. She yearns, too, for an end to the twin disasters that now dominate her life: recession and pandemic.“I don’t deal well with the unknowns,” she says. “I never have.”Across America are legions of Kelly Flints, women and men who don’t know when they’ll receive another paycheck — or if.The Covid-19 outbreak and resulting economic upheaval have thrown millions of lives into disarray. Industries have collapsed, businesses closed, jobs disappeared. Compounding the misery is a question no one can answer: When will this all be over?If 2020 had to be condensed into a single word — and there are many, many words to describe it — uncertainty would hover at the top of the list. Uncertainty about health. About the future. About the country itself. And uncertainty about livelihoods and jobs and economic security in a historical moment where each day seems to bring a fresh wave of unwanted developments.America has faced economic calamity before, most recently during the recession of 2008, when the jobless rate soared to 10%. That pales in comparison to the two crises that have cost more than 160,000 American lives and ushered in spiraling unemployment — 30 million job losses, of which 17.5 million people remain unemployed.Uncertainty, painted onto the landscape by the numbers. And behind each one, a human being. Here are some of their thoughts.___“I’ll either be here or I’ll build my peace elsewhere. ... I can’t get wrapped up in the unknowns when I have blessings in front of me.”— LISA VINES, 56, of Memphis, Tennessee, laid off in March from her sales job at a promotional product company where she’d worked for 20 years.___“I’ve learned that you can’t possibly plan for everything and, though it’s a cliche, you’ve just got to roll with the punches. And I’ve learned to go where the next thing leads me. Hopefully, that will be soon.”— JARED SAIGH of Iron River, Michigan, laid off in 2019 from a marketing company. He was then hired to lead a nonprofit attached to his local hospital, but the offer was rescinded after the pandemic swooped in.___“This is a day-to-day process, and I can’t worry about the things I cannot change.”— JAMES JACKSON, 51, of Florida, who lost his job as a hospitality worker after his workplace closed in March. He’s now looking for a warehouse job and worries about having enough food for his kids, 8 to 18, and being able to afford school supplies and clothes.___“There are certain things you can’t control, and you have to let it go. I can’t control the pandemic. I can’t control the job market. ... In the back of my mind, there’s still a tiny drawer of anxiety and worry. ... But I’m starting to tell myself, ‘Listen, you’re going to be fine.’”— BRETT LIPSHUTZ, 46, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who lost his job as a bilingual software trainer when the pandemic hit. He’s starting a tofu business with friends and expects to be able to teach French in the Milwaukee public high schools this fall.___“I feel like I don’t have very much of a purpose now.”— MORGAN GITHMARK, 24, of North Carolina, who had to quit her marketing job in March because it involved face-to-face encounters with customers at big-box stores. She is diabetic and has an increased chance of serious illness if she contracts the coronavirus.___“I’m the type of person who, if I if I have an idea of what I’m facing, I can try to make a plan that makes sense. But you don’t really know what it is you need to do.”— MICAH ANDERSON, 37, who lost his job when the Portland, Oregon, club where he tended bar was forced to close in the pandemic’s early days. Now he walks almost everywhere. He has reduced his food budget to essentials. He doesn’t go out with friends. He’s become politically active, calling the offices of federal lawmakers, urging them to back a bill creating a $120 billion fund to help rescue restaurants and bars.___“At the end of the day, the only person who’s going to get me out of this is me.”— DEANNA KOUSKOULAS, 30, of Michigan, who was laid off from a copywriting-marketing job in suburban Detroit after six months of work. She’s now interviewing for jobs, preparing for the post-pandemic era. She spends part of every morning sharpening and expanding her skills, studying graphic design on YouTube, among other things, “so I can come out strong when things do go back to normal.”___Uncertainty ripples outward. There are so many things that, because of it, simply can’t be done.Job uncertainty is new for Flint, 53, the travel agent. She’s never been unemployed, and it’s “doubly scary,” she says, because she’s single. Every week, she sends out fresh resumes from her home in Galveston, Texas. “I’ve had anxiety that I’ve never had before. I’ve even had panic attacks. I’ve had crazy dreams of zombies,” she says. “It has worn on me.”For Micah Anderson, the uncertainty has been the hardest part — “having zero idea of what next week is going to even look like.”“You just have no clue. You make decisions the best you can. And you hope that they turn out OK.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-pandemic-jobless-the-only-real-certainty-is-uncertainty/story-MWSD8p5k3RlkaPTcsKUw7N.html
09-08-2020||World||No parties, no trips: US colleges set Covid-19 rules for fall||As they struggle to salvage some semblance of a campus experience this fall, US colleges are requiring promises from students to help contain the coronavirus — no keg parties, no long road trips and no outside guests on campus.No kidding. Administrators warn that failure to wear masks, practice social distancing and avoid mass gatherings could bring serious consequences, including getting booted from school.Critics question whether it’s realistic to demand that college students not act like typical college students. But the push illustrates the high stakes for universities planning to welcome at least some students back. Wide-scale Covid-19 testing, quarantines and plexiglass barriers in classrooms won’t work if too many students misbehave.“I think that the majority of students are going to be really respectful and wear their masks, social distance, keep gatherings small,” said incoming Tulane University senior Sanjali De Silva. “But I fear that there will be a distinct group of students that will decide not to do that. And it’ll be a big bummer.”Tulane students have already received a stark warning from the school in New Orleans, an early pandemic hot spot. After a summer weekend of large gatherings, Dean of Students Erica Woodley wrote to students, stressing her key point in bold, capital letters.“DO NOT HOST PARTIES OR GATHERINGS WITH MORE THAN 15 PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE HOST. IF YOU DO, YOU WILL FACE SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION FROM THE UNIVERSITY,” Woodley wrote, signing off with, “Do you really want to be the reason that Tulane and New Orleans have to shut down again?”The emphasis on student behavior is part of a broader effort to create safe bubbles on campus even if the virus surges elsewhere. The University of Texas at Austin is not allowing parties either on or off campus. In Massachusetts, Amherst College is prohibiting students from traveling off campus except in certain cases, such as medical appointments and family emergencies.Many universities have spelled out expectations for student behavior in pledges and compacts that cover everything from mask wearing to off-campus travel. The pledges often cover faculty and staff, too.It’s unclear how well these rules will work. Critics say the very nature of the college experience — with cramped housing and intense social activity — works against success. Some colleges are already backing off plans for in-person classes this fall.“The majority of kids who go to college are civic-minded, responsible people. They’re also young,” said Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at New York University. “If some of them don’t comply, it’s a problem. And I think some to many will have a difficult time ignoring every instinct pulsing through their body at that age that they’re supposed to socialize and find mates.”Galloway plans to teach online this fall and return to campus when there’s a vaccine.Outbreaks involving fraternities have already been reported at some schools, including the University of Southern California, the University of Washington and the University of Mississippi. The University of California at Berkeley recently decided to begin the fall semester with fully remote instruction after a local flare-up of cases linked to fraternity parties.“After weeks of developing a very elaborate plan for a hybrid model in the fall,” officials decided “it was just too risky to teach face-to-face,” Chancellor Carol Christ said during a virtual event hosted by the Chronicle of Higher Education.The pledges apply the advice public health officials have been giving since March for college settings. Yale’s compact includes a commitment to remain in Connecticut during the fall semester through Nov. 21 and a promise not to “invite or host non-Yale-affiliated individuals” on campus without permission. Ohio State University’s “Together As Buckeyes Pledge ” includes a promise to conduct daily health checks.“We want to be clear: Our return to on-campus operations in the autumn is fully dependent on each member of the university community following all requirements and guidance,” read a July 24 letter from Ohio State officials.Cornell University students must agree not to organize, host or attend events that may cause “safety risks” to people, under a school compact released this week. University of Pennsylvania students are warned in the school’s compact that alcohol and drugs are not an excuse for risky Covid-19-related behavior. Syracuse University’s pledge includes commitments to get a flu shot and to avoid going to social gatherings with more than 25 people.“I think that people will really keep each other in check. I know I will,” said Suhail Kumar, an incoming Syracuse sophomore. “If I see my roommates unmasked or not following protocol, I’m definitely going to let them know because I don’t want to jeopardize anything for myself.”Failure to comply with the pledges will be treated as a disciplinary violation.Syracuse students can face “serious consequences” for violating Covid-19 guidance, and students who host large parties could face sanctions up to suspension and expulsion, according to the school’s web site.At Penn, incoming senior Ben Zhao is optimistic the new rules will be followed.Zhao, who is from the Chicago suburb of Northbrook, Illinois, is looking forward to being back on campus after an interrupted spring semester, even with the prospect of online classes. He misses his friends, the school newspaper, where he is executive editor, and studying with classmates.“They’re all big things that I don’t want to necessarily miss out on for my senior year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-parties-no-trips-colleges-set-covid-19-rules-for-fall/story-SRKz5NbkAOnKcMpQwMeH1N.html
09-08-2020||World||Ohio governor’s conflicting Covid-19 tests raise backlash||The Ohio governor’s positive, then negative, tests for Covid-19 have provided fuel for skeptics of government pandemic mandates and critics of his often-aggressive polices.“I’m sure the Internet is lighting up with ‘Well, you can’t believe any test,’ ” Mike DeWine said in a WCOL radio interview Friday, after a whirlwind of events the day before when the initial positive showing forced the Republican to scrub a planned meeting with President Donald Trump.Instead of seeing Trump at the Cleveland airport, DeWine returned to this state capital for new testing with his wife, Fran, through Ohio State University’s medical center. They then went to their southwestern Ohio farm in Cedarville, where DeWine said he planned to quarantine for 14 days. But within hours, he had received Columbus test results that were negative. The first test, part of protocol for people meeting with the president, was a rapid-result antigen test, while the Columbus testing was a genetic, laboratory test whose results are considered more reliable.The governor’s office said Saturday another test for each by Ohio State’s Wexner Medical Center again returned negative results for DeWine and his wife.The conflicting results come as Americans have grown frustrated about access to testing and by slow results. Ohioans also remain divided over DeWine’s actions to deal with the pandemic, with some saying his early shutdown actions unnecessarily damaged businesses. He was an early advocate of wearing masks to stop the Covid-19 spread even as other Republicans in Ohio remain unconvinced.State Rep. Nino Vitale, a conservative GOP gadfly from Urbana, tweeted a photo of DeWine wearing a mask minutes after the positive test was announced Thursday.“I think the question must be asked. Has he not been wearing his mask, or do masks not stop the spread?” Vitale said in his post, which also stated he wished the governor no ill will.DeWine said he received some “not so nice” texts during the day Thursday about wearing masks. He reasserted Friday that while they might not be 100% effective, they do help prevent spread and have been made a noticeable difference in the state’s most-populated cities.Critics were blasting him on his official Twitter account, too.DeWine, 73, a former U.S. senator and House member who is in his first term as governor, at first appeared to have been only the second U.S. governor to positive for the coronavirus.Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt announced he contracted the virus last month. Stitt, a Republican who has been disdainful of mask mandates, said he contracted Covid-19 by hugging friends.Longtime Cincinnati-area conservative activist Mike Wilson, who has been analyzing and writing about coronavirus data since he contracted Covid-19 this summer, saw a storm of strong reactions on his Facebook page including from some who said DeWine’s results show the pandemic is “a scam.”“At this point, this is clearly not a hoax,” said Wilson, who has fully recovered from the virus. He said continued pandemic-deniers are mostly “outliers,” but many other people are frustrated over what they see as DeWine’s overreactions and also about the testing issues. Test results, including false positives, affect individual lives by triggering quarantines that are a rising concern as Ohio schools prepare to reopen.The number of positive cases in Ohio had decreased after the first surge, hitting a low in late May. But numbers again began to rise in mid-June as Ohio began to reopen businesses.DeWine had resisted a statewide mask mandate until July 23. He quickly backed off an earlier try at a mask requirement inside businesses and balked at closing down bars, instead recently mandating a “last call” at 10 p.m. and an 11 p.m. closing time. Nearly 3,700 Ohio deaths have been linked to the coronavirus.Wilson thinks by now, DeWine and other government officials should allow people to make their own decisions on which precautions they need or are willing to take.“We’ve found that people’s individual behavior matters more than those government actions anyway,” Wilson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ohio-governor-s-conflicting-covid-19-tests-raise-backlash/story-CjVyRbcDjjyOpNukRpPsOK.html
09-08-2020||World||Amid pandemic, future of many Catholic schools is in doubt||As the new academic year arrives, school systems across the United States are struggling to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic. Roman Catholic educators have an extra challenge — trying to forestall a relentless wave of closures of their schools that has no end in sight.Already this year, financial and enrollment problems aggravated by the pandemic have forced the permanent closure of more than 140 Catholic schools nationwide, according to officials who oversee Catholic education in the country.Three of the nation’s highest-ranking Catholic leaders, in a recent joint appeal, said Catholic schools “are presently facing their greatest financial crisis” and warned that hundreds more closures are likely without federal support.“Because of economic loss and uncertainty, many families are confronting the wrenching decision to pull their children out of Catholic schools,” said New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Boston Cardinal Sean O’Malley and Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez, president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops.They urged Congress to include funding in the next pandemic relief bill for scholarship assistance for economically disadvantaged families to use at Catholic or other private schools.The pace of closures has been relentless since March. Within the past month, Catholic leaders have announced the shuttering of five schools in Newark, New Jersey, and 26 in the New York City area.Several have promoted protests and petition campaigns by angry parents, and Catholic officials have been scrambling to help affected families.The Diocese of Brooklyn’s school superintendent, Thomas Chadzutko, said the closures were unavoidable due to the pandemic’s “devastating effects” on enrollment and finances.Parents were offered a $500 grant if their children enrolled in other Catholic schools, but many were bitter that the closures were announced with little time to make alternative school plans.“It is a complete travesty how the Brooklyn Diocese can shut down schools within a pandemic and with less than two months’ notice,” parent Javier Cortes wrote in an online post about the closure of Queen of the Rosary Catholic Academy. “Treating children like this is NOT the Catholic thing to do!”Also ordered closed was Nativity of Our Blessed Lady, an elementary school in the Bronx.“I was part of the first graduating class and now I walked out of there hysterical in tears,” said Hope Wilson, who attended the school as a child and later taught there for 30 years. “It’s heartbreaking.”In Newark, Shante McGlone Burgess was devastated by the news that St. Francis Xavier School was closing. All three of her children attended the elementary school last year, though the family is not Catholic.“They were very welcoming there,” McGlone Burgess said. “At a public school, I don’t think my children would have gotten the same camaraderie, as well as the structure.”St. Francis Xavier is one of many schools being closed that serve predominantly Black and Hispanic communities. Three bishops who oversee matters related to education and racial issues recently sent an appeal to U.S. Rep. Karen Bass, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, seeking support for families of color with students in Catholic schools.“A Black or Latino child is 42% more likely to graduate from high school, and two-and-a-half times more likely to graduate from college if he or she attends a Catholic school,” wrote Bishops Michael Barber of Oakland, California, Joseph Perry of Chicago and Shelton Fabre of the Houma-Thibodaux Diocese in Louisiana.At the National Catholic Educational Association, there’s acute concern about the closures’ consequences.“Catholic schools have a very profound impact on young people of low-income backgrounds, students of color, kids from single-parent homes,” said the NCEA’s chief innovation officer, Kevin Baxter “That makes it all the more tragic if we lose the Catholic schools that serve those populations.”One consequence of the turmoil: increased interest in Catholic-oriented homeschooling.Chris Sebastian, a spokesman for the Mother of Divine Grace School, said it is preparing to serve about 6,000 students in the new school year, compared with 4,800 last year.The school, based in California but serving families across the U.S. and overseas, offers a structured Catholic curriculum and assigns an educational consultant to work with each family that signs up.“COVID is the primary motivator for people enrolling,” Sebastian said. “People are afraid of the pandemic and not wanting the stress of required masks.”The Rev. Thomas Vassalotti, pastor of Queen of the Rosary Catholic Academy’s parish in New York, said numerous parents affected by that closure — and wary of switching to public schools — are expressing interest in homeschooling, perhaps in a cooperative with assistance from the parish.For Catholic schools that are reopening, there is no national directive as to how they should handle the question of in-person classes. Decisions are being made diocese by diocese, often influenced by local and state rules.In Los Angeles, archdiocese officials had hoped to open the new year with in-person classes. They now will have to start out with distance learning, due to an order from Gov. Gavin Newsom barring public and private schools from reopening campuses if their counties are on a monitoring list for high rates of new coronavirus cases.The situation is different in Dallas, where the diocese plans to open schools September 2, six days before the earliest date when secular schools can start in-person classes. The diocese chose that option after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said religious schools were exempt from local orders delaying in-person instruction.And in Evansville, Indiana, Catholic schools reopened August 5 with a full program of in-person instruction. Schools were told to spread out desks, place students in small groups and require face coverings.Mary Pat Donoghue, who heads the education office of the national bishops’ conference, said she expects a wide variety of reopening plans, with a common aim of getting students back in the classroom as quickly as health conditions allow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-pandemic-future-of-many-catholic-schools-is-in-doubt/story-WLokLcyR5SwkahPHqHFieP.html
09-08-2020||World||Masks in class? Many questions as Germans go back to school||Masks during class, masks only in the halls, no masks at all. Distance when possible, no distance within same-grade groups, no distance at all.As Germany’s 16 states start sending millions of children back to school in the middle of the global coronavirus pandemic, the country’s famous sense of “Ordnung,” or order, has given way to uncertainty, with a hodgepodge of regional regulations that officials acknowledge may or may not work.“There can’t, and never will be 100% certainty,” said Torsten Kuehne, the official in charge of schools in Pankow, Berlin’s most populous district where 45,000 students go back to school Monday. “We are trying to minimize the risk as much as possible.”Germany has won plaudits for managing to slow the spread of the coronavirus quickly, efficiently and early, but the opening of schools is proving a new challenge as the country struggles to balance the concerns of anxious parents and children, skeptical scientists, worried teachers and overtaxed administrators.Many around the world will be closely observing the real-life experiment offered in Germany to see what works and what doesn’t. U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for American schools to reopen in person and on time even as the country nears 5 million confirmed coronavirus cases, and in Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has stressed the government’s moral duty to ensure children return to class next month -despite having the highest official death toll in Europe.The U.N. said this week that as many as 100 countries have yet to announce a date for schools to reopen, and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned of a possible “generational catastrophe” in education. He urged that restarting school be made a “top priority” once countries have the coronavirus under control.Germany has seen some 217,000 confirmed cases and 9,200 deaths, and brought down a peak of some 6,000 new daily infections in March to the low hundreds. Numbers have been creeping back up, however, and topped the 1,000 per day mark in recent days for the first time in about three months.Israel attempted a full reopening in May, at a time when the coronavirus was widely thought to have been beaten in the country, only to suffer new outbreaks that led to schools being shut down again and a surge in the spread of the virus nationwide. In South Africa, four grade levels were restarted in June but then closed back down when the country’s virus cases surged.As Berlin prepares to send its nearly half-million students back to school on Monday, many fear something similar could happen.“The concerns are enormous, because the schools are hotspots,” said Doreen Siebernik, who heads the Berlin branch of the GEW teachers’ union. “I know that there are pupils coming to school who have contact with hundreds, with thousands of people every day.”Berlin’s plan includes requiring students - and teachers - to wear masks in hallways, but not during instruction or in the playground. Sports, music and drama will be allowed, but with restrictions, like requiring choir members to keep at least 2 meters from one another.Berlin’s minister for education Sandra Scheeres said “it’s not possible in a school” to always keep students 1.5 meters (5 feet) from one another, but that the distance should be kept if feasible. Students are to be kept in “cohorts” — groups that should not mix — so that if there is an outbreak, only those affected would need to be quarantined.The state government recommends those groups don’t mingle outside school either, but it was not clear how that could be enforced.“There are conflicting priorities, health protection on the one hand , which is very important to us, and on the other hand that we want to ensure the right to education of every single child,” Scheeres said.A Berlin Institute of Technology study on coronavirus transmission concluded that classrooms should be ventilated for a full 15 minutes every half hour. Scheeres’ current plan calls for windows to be opened following each 45 minute class.Dr. Isabella Eckerle, head of the emerging viruses research group at the University of Geneva, said there was still a lot to learn about how children are affected by the coronavirus and transmit it, but that it was clear from school openings in other countries they could spark wider outbreaks.“If we go back to the normal school day now clinging to wishful thinking that children do not play a role in the pandemic, that will come back to haunt us,” she said. “Instead of ideologically charged discussions, we need pragmatic concepts to get us through the winter.”In a sharply-worded open letter to Scheeres and the city’s mayor, Marco Fechner, a father of two and parent representative in the Pankow district, noted that many classroom windows don’t open, and that the government has stricter mask rules for supermarkets and its own offices than schools.He urged the administration to focus more resources to permit some learning from home, so that class sizes and contact could be kept to a minimum.“This decision is absolutely incomprehensible to me as a father, and I fear for the health of my children and our relatives,” Fechner wrote.Similar concerns are playing out elsewhere, like in Scotland where schools also are due to reopen on Tuesday. There is uncertainty about whether measures to increase hand washing and social distancing — with limited mixing between classroom groups but no mandatory masks — will work.Berlin’s back-to-school guidelines are middle-of-the-road among German states.The first students to return, in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, had no mask requirement but the “cohort” principle was in place and the education minister said mask regulations were in the works. In a worrisome sign, two schools were temporarily closed Friday after new cases of coronavirus were detected.Students over age 10 who returned to school in Hamburg on Thursday were required to wear masks, but could take them off once seated in classrooms.In Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, 2.5 million students face the country’s strictest measures as they return on Wednesday, including a mask requirement while in class.Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn said Germany’s staggered returns and different approaches will help determine what works and what doesn’t.Meantime, schools and districts have been improvising their own solutions to conform with voluminous government guidelines.In Berlin’s Pankow, Kuehne has been talking with school lunch suppliers all summer to work out a plan to serve meals at staggered times, and in classrooms, to avoid large groups in the cafeteria.“I wouldn’t say I’m worried, but I see the very, very big challenges ahead of us as school authorities, schools and parents,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/masks-in-class-many-questions-as-germans-go-back-to-school/story-SrL1JXjGG5hlP8y2KkmbzO.html

Around 100 people will take part in the trial. The volunteers are in their 20s to 50s. “As the trial is open to volunteers from 21 to 80 years old, we continue to be on the lookout for more participants, especially those in the older age group,” she said.Meanwhile, Singapore on Sunday reported 175 new coronavirus cases, taking the country’s tally to 55,104.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/early-stage-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-begins-in-singapore/story-w2tbtifC4z74VH99dHV2VP.html

The report blamed speeding for the crash.Deadly traffic crashes claim thousands of lives every year in Egypt, which has a poor transportation safety record. These crashes are mostly caused by speeding, bad roads or poor enforcement of traffic laws.The country’s official statistics agency says more than 8,000 road accidents took place in 2018, leaving over 3,000 dead and around 12,000 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/9-killed-in-car-crash-in-egypt-s-nile-delta-report/story-OZIfecarf13GBm7zxckKYN.html
09-08-2020||World||Beirut explosion bares pitfalls of sending aid to Lebanon||Hospitals and schools, then shattered and bent water pipes, then the crater that once was Lebanon’s port.The rebuilding needs of Lebanon are immense, but so is the question of how to ensure the millions of dollars promised in international aid is not diverted in a country notorious for missing money, invisible infrastructure projects and its refusal to open the books.And the port — the epicenter of the explosion that shattered Beirut, the center of Lebanon’s import-based economy, and a source of graft so lucrative that Lebanon’s political factions were willing to divide its control so everyone could get a piece — sits at the heart of the fears.Sunday’s donor teleconference is hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron, who was mobbed last week by tearful victims of the Beirut ammonium nitrate explosion begging him to ensure the corruption they blame for the blast that devastated the capital does not profit from its destruction.International diplomacy usually calls for careful language. Rigged votes are “irregular.” The response to furious protests should be “measured.” Disappearing funds require “transparency.”But Macron’s response to the crowd, and later in a speech in Beirut, was unusually blunt: The aid “will not fall into corrupt hands” and Lebanon’s discredited government must change. Germany, Lebanon’s second-biggest bilateral donor, made similar demands.“That’s precisely what the Lebanese people have rightly demanded: individual interests and old lines of conflict must be overcome and the welfare of the entire population must be put first,” German Foreign Ministry.In the short-term, the aid streaming into Lebanon is purely for humanitarian emergencies and relatively easy to monitor. France, Britain, Canada and Australia, among others, have been clear that it is going directly to UN agencies or the Lebanese Red Cross. But actual rebuilding requires massive imports of supplies and equipment. And the contracts and subcontracts that have given Lebanon’s ruling elite its wealth and power, while leaving the country with crumbling roads, regular electricity cuts, trash that piles on the streets and intermittent water supplies.“The level of infrastructure in Lebanon is directly linked today to the level of corruption,” said Neemat Frem, a prominent Lebanese businessman and independent member of parliament. “We badly need more dollars but I understand that the Lebanese state and its agencies are not competent.”Lebanon has an accumulated debt of about $100 billion, for a population of just under 7 million people — 5 million Lebanese and 2 million Syrians and Palestinians, most of them refugees. Its electricity company, controlled like the port by multiple factions, posts losses of $1.5 billion a year, although Frem said most factories pay for their own generators because power is off more than it’s on.“There’s grand theft Lebanon and there’s petty theft Lebanon. Petty theft Lebanon exists but that’s not what got the country in the hole we’re in,” said Nadim Houry, executive director of the Arab Reform Initiative.Prior aid, Houry said, ended up as a tool in the hands of the political leaders, who kept their slice and doled out jobs and money to supporters.“The pie is getting smaller and smaller and they just keep taking,” he said.Protesters, tired of the small indignities they endure to get through a day — 37% of people report needing to pay bribes, compared with 4% in neighboring Jordan, according to Transparency International — and the larger issue of a collapsing state, are going after both.On Saturday, they seized offices of the Economy Ministry, hauling away files they said would show corruption around the sale and distribution of wheat. Lebanon’s wheat stockpile, stored next to the warehouse filled with ammonium nitrate, was destroyed in the explosion.“We restored the economy ministry to the Lebanese people,” one man called out as they rifled through the desks.Julien Courson, head of the Lebanon Transparency Association, said the country’s non-profits are forming a coalition to monitor how relief and aid money is spent. He estimated Lebanon loses $2 billion to corruption each year.“The decision-makers and the public servants who are in charge of these files are still in their positions. Until now, we didn’t see any solution to the problem,” he said. “I think the Lebanese government has an interest in finding a suitable solution.”A first step would be an online clearinghouse for every contract linked to reconstruction, Courson said. And the first project has to be highly visible and spread the benefits widely, said Christiaan Poortman, board chairman of Infrastructure Transparency Initiative.“That will help keeping some of the political stuff at a distance,” Poortman said. “Donors will have to be on top of this. The issue of procurement is always where lots of corruption takes place ... it needs to be done quickly, and there is always the temptation to not follow the rules and go ahead and do something where a lot of people are going to make a lot of money.”Macron’s office said international donors can do nothing until Lebanon’s leaders agree to an audit of the national bank, a key demand of the International Monetary Fund for months and one that the political factions have resisted.Speaking at a news conference in which he conspicuously did not appear alongside Lebanese President Michel Aoun, Macron said he was approaching Lebanon with “the requirements of a friend who rushes to help, when times are hard, but not to give a blank check to systems that no longer have the trust of their people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beirut-explosion-bares-pitfalls-of-sending-aid-to-lebanon/story-2HGA1LEBKG3be8eHZy9OjO.html

New Zealand has 23 active cases in managed isolation facilities, and 1,219 Covid-19 cases in all so far. Vietnam, which went for three months without detecting any domestic transmission, is now racing to control a new outbreak in Danang.Neighbouring Australia’s second-biggest city, Melbourne, has gone into a six week lockdown due to a surge in cases. The second wave of cases in Melbourne has been largely a result of lapses in quarantining. “For countries like Australia and New Zealand the source of such outbreaks is likely to be from managed isolation and quarantine facilities because of the large numbers of people held there and the multiple shifts of staff involved in looking after them,” said Michael Baker, Professor of Public Health at the University of Otago. There have been cases of returning New Zealanders sneaking out of quarantine, and other security slip ups.New Zealand last week ramped up testing at quarantine facilities and clinics, and started work on technology to track people using Bluetooth technology.Ardern kicked off her re-election campaign on Saturday calling it a ‘Covid election’.But a resurgence of cases due to “Covid fatigue” could spark a backlash against her, and give the opposition a chance to work their way back into the election contest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-records-100-days-without-domestic-virus-case-but-warns-against-complacency/story-GPxXfevon71RaRtiBTERyK.html

The baby was found in a ground floor apartment in the same village. The local mayor reportedly said that the baby and its family were not local residents and were on holiday there.Many residents have climbed to the rooftops of their homes and the fire service has sent a rescue helicopter to the area.Heavy rain started falling at about midnight Saturday and firefighters responded to over 50 fires caused by lightning. The fire service said it was also called to rescue dozens of people and help many others drain flooded homes.Many local roads are impassable, police said.

09-08-2020||World||US response to the virus is met with incredulity abroad||The United States’ failure to contain the spread of the coronavirus has been met with astonishment and alarm in Europe, as the world’s most powerful country edges closer to a global record of 5 million confirmed infections.Perhaps nowhere outside the US is America’s bungled virus response viewed with more consternation than in Italy, which was ground zero of Europe’s epidemic. Italians were unprepared when the outbreak exploded in February and the country still has one of the world’s highest official death tolls at 35,000.But after a strict nationwide 10-week lockdown, vigilant tracing of new clusters and general acceptance of mask mandates and social distancing, Italy has become a model of virus containment.“Don’t they care about their health?” a mask-clad Patrizia Antonini asked about people in the United States as she walked with friends along the banks of Lake Bracciano, north of Rome. “They need to take our precautions ... They need a real lockdown.” Much of the incredulity in Europe stems from the fact that America had the benefit of time, European experience and medical know-how to treat the virus that the continent itself didn’t have when the first Covid-19 patients started filling intensive care units. Yet, more than four months into a sustained outbreak, the US is about to hit an astonishing milestone of 5 million confirmed infections, easily the highest in the world. Health officials believe the actual number is closer to 50 million, given testing limitations and the fact that as many as 40% of all cases are asymptomatic.“We Italians always saw America as a model,” said Massimo Franco, columnist with daily Corriere della Sera. “But with this virus we’ve discovered a country that is very fragile, with bad infrastructure and a public health system that is nonexistent.” Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza hasn’t shied away from criticising the US, officially condemning as “wrong” Washington’s decision to withhold funding from the World Health Organization and marveling personally at President Donald Trump’s virus response.After Trump finally donned a protective mask last month, Speranza told La7 television: “I’m not surprised by Trump’s behavior now; I’m profoundly surprised by his behavior before.” With America’s list-leading 160,000 dead, politicized resistance to masks and rising caseload, European nations have barred American tourists and visitors from other countries with growing cases from freely traveling to the bloc.France and Germany are now imposing tests on arrival for travelers from “at risk” countries, the US included.“I am very well aware that this impinges on individual freedoms, but I believe that this is a justifiable intervention,” German Health Minister Jens Spahn said in announcing the tests last week.Mistakes were made in Europe, too, from delayed lockdowns to insufficient protections for nursing home elderly and critical shortages of tests and protective equipment for medical personnel.The virus is still raging in some Balkan countries and thousands of maskless protesters demanded an end to virus restrictions in Berlin earlier this month. Hard-hit Spain, France and Germany have seen infection rebounds with new cases topping 1,000 a day, and Italy’s cases inched up over 500 on Friday.The UK is still seeing an estimated 3,700 new infections daily, and some scientists say the country’s beloved pubs might have to close again if schools are to reopen in September without causing a new wave.In the US, new cases run at about 54,000 a day — an immensely higher number even when taking into account its larger population. And while that’s down from a peak of well over 70,000 last month, cases are rising in nearly 20 states, and deaths are climbing in most.In contrast, at least for now Europe appears to have the virus somewhat under control.“Had the medical professionals been allowed to operate in the States, you would have belatedly gotten to a point of getting to grips with this back in March,” said Scott Lucas, professor of international studies at the University of Birmingham, England. “But of course, the medical and public health professionals were not allowed to proceed unchecked,” he said, referring to Trump’s frequent undercutting of his own experts.When the virus first appeared in the United States, Trump and his supporters quickly dismissed it as either a “hoax” or a virus that would quickly disappear once warmer weather arrived. At one point, Trump suggested that ultraviolet light or injecting disinfectants would eradicate the virus. (He later said he was being facetious).Trump’s frequent complaints about Dr. Anthony Fauci have regularly made headlines in Europe, where the US infectious diseases expert is a respected eminence grise. Italy’s leading COVID-19 hospital offered Fauci a job if Trump fired him.Trump has defended the US response, blaming China, where the virus was first detected, for America’s problems and saying the US numbers are so high because there is so much testing. Trump supporters and Americans who have refused to wear masks against all medical advice back that line.‪“There’s no reason to fear any sickness that’s out there,” said Julia Ferjo, a mother of three in Alpine, Texas, who says she is “vehemently” against wearing a mask. ‪Ferjo, 35, teaches fitness classes in a large gym with open doors, where she doesn’t allow participants to wear masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-response-to-the-virus-is-met-with-incredulity-abroad/story-QIbLd6kmCKTRVKNFHP2nbO.html
09-08-2020||World||London police defend smashing car window of man after racism complaint||Police in London have defended smashing a man’s car window and arresting him on suspicion of selling drugs only to find no drugs in his car, after the man complained of discrimination.The issue of how British police use “stop and search” powers, particularly allegations that Black people are disproportionately targeted, has come into sharp focus in recent months due to Black Lives Matter protests.Black people are over nine times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, according to civil rights group Liberty.Ryan Colaco, a rapper and Black Lives Matter supporter, had just been interviewed by Channel 4 television in May about a recent experience of being stopped and searched, only to be stopped and searched again while driving home.Colaco filmed the incident and posted parts of the video on social media. In the footage, he is heard saying “why does this keep happening?” and “this can’t keep happening to me, man” before an officer smashes his car window with a baton.In a statement, the City of London Police said officers noticed Colaco’s car parked on the side of the road and suspected its presence was linked to the sale of drugs.“One of the specialist officers identified behaviour from the occupant which warranted a stop and search of the man,” it said, without elaborating.The police said Colaco refused to step out of his car after several requests spanning some 10 minutes, despite officers making it clear they would use force if he failed to comply.No drugs were found in the car, which was returned to Colaco with shattered glass still strewn inside.The police force said it had investigated Colaco’s complaint and found “the level of service was acceptable”, apart from the condition of the car when it was returned to him - for which it has now apologised to him.

09-08-2020||World||Platinum giant South Africa forced by Covid-19 to look into abyss||South Africa’s gold industry has been dying slowly for years. As the coronavirus undercuts the already fragile case for investment, its platinum mines may be next.Beset by power and water shortages, alongside whipsawing government policies, South African producers have cut spending over the past decade on mines responsible for 75% of global platinum supply. The virus is accelerating that trend, damping demand for the catalytic converters that are the largest users of the metal, while stimulus packages push automakers to speed a shift to electric vehicles.A series of mega open-cast projects risk being shelved -- depriving a recession-hit economy of essential investment -- but the toughest blow may land on the so-called western limb, the traditional heartland of the nation’s platinum belt.“The western limb region has been the bedrock of South African platinum and that is in decline,” said Mandi Dungwa, an analyst at Kagiso Asset Management Ltd. “It is the end of an investment cycle in those type of mines.”Shunning capital spending leaves one of South Africa’s biggest export industries in limbo, just as the demise of the nation’s gold mines enters its final phase. With about 170,000 people employed in platinum mining, the timing is bad for President Cyril Ramaphosa as he battles the biggest economic contraction since World War II.Output from South Africa’s 130-year-old gold industry slumped over the past three decades as the geological challenges of operating the world’s deepest mines pushed up costs. The platinum deposits discovered by Hans Merensky in the 1920s contain about three-quarters of the world’s known resources, but were only exploited in the 1950s with a surge in demand from carmakers using the metal to cut exhaust pollution.“The sun is definitely starting to set over some of the conventional, deep, high-grade, western limb areas,” said Johan Theron, a spokesman for Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. “It’s exactly like gold: there is more gold, but it’s deeper and requires more capex and prospects of making a return are slim.”Platinum output peaked in 2006, and the lack of investment in deep-level western limb shafts will result in a further sharp contraction in production over the next 10 years.The windfall from surging palladium prices -- another platinum-group metal produced at South African mines -- refilled the coffers of local producers over the past 18 months but hasn’t been enough to justify large capital expenditure projects. That’s delaying the construction of the next generation of mines on the northern limb of the platinum belt, and hastening reserve depletion.In June, Implats balked at investing about 12 billion rand ($680 million) on building a new mine at Waterberg on the northern limb of the platinum belt. The outlook doesn’t support such spending over the next decade, said spokesman Theron.Anglo American Platinum Ltd. has delayed a decision until the second half of next year on whether to spend as much as $1.5 billion on expanding output at its key Mogalakwena mine.Vancouver-based Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. said it’s still evaluating finance for its new Platreef project, which could require about $1.5 billion of investment.Still, notwithstanding the investment hiatus, the platinum sector remains in better shape than South Africa’s gold industry. Even without further spending, some deep-level mines have a 30-year lifespan, according to James Wellsted, a spokesman for Sibanye Stillwater Ltd., the world’s No. 1 platinum miner.Still, investment decisions are complicated because of an uncertain regulatory and policy environment, among other challenges, Wellsted said.With the pandemic creating doubts over future demand, the development of new, lower-cost mines has been put on hold.“With Covid-19, all the companies went into cash preservation mode,” said Arnold Van Graan, an analyst at Nedbank Ltd. “Over the next decade, there could be a big step change down in PGM production, if the industry does not invest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/platinum-giant-south-africa-forced-by-covid-19-to-look-into-abyss/story-Kl9WyW82kM1MpFW7j5PamM.html
09-08-2020||World||Australia’s Victoria reports deadliest day of Covid-19 pandemic||Australia’s second-most populous state, Victoria, reported its deadliest day of the Covid-19 outbreak on Sunday, with 17 people dying in the past 24 hours, although new infections showed signs of easing. Victoria, at the centre of a second wave of infections in Australia, reported 394 cases of the new coronavirus, compared with a daily average of 400-500 over the past week. The new deaths bring the state’s total to 210.The southeastern state, with infections concentrated in the capital Melbourne, accounts for more than two-thirds of the national tally of nearly 21,000. In an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus, Victoria has imposed a night curfew, tightened restrictions on people’s daily movements and ordered large parts of the local economy to close.

It was referring to a letter of interest it signed on July 28 with Kodak.President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the government would investigate the circumstances surrounding the announcement of the loan, which will help the photographic equipment maker shift into making pharmaceuticals at its US factories.Kodak shares surged more than 1,000% last week after the loan was announced, generating a windfall for executives, some of whom had received options one day earlier. Lawmakers said they had “serious concerns” about the transactions and asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the circumstances surrounding the matter. They cited growing concerns about insider trading.The company said it had appointed a special committee of independent directors of its board to conduct an internal review.“The internal review will be conducted for the Committee by Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP,” Eastman Kodak said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eastman-kodak-s-765-million-us-loan-agreement-on-hold-after-recent-allegations/story-k4oGEoN8uQXViUX1OYDUuJ.html

09-08-2020||World||Lebanese protesters storm ministry buildings as anger over Beirut blast grows||Lebanese protesters stormed government ministries in Beirut and trashed the offices of the Association of Lebanese Banks on Saturday as shots rang out in increasingly angry demonstrations over this week’s devastating explosion.The protesters said their politicians should resign and be punished for negligence they say led to Tuesday’s blast, the biggest ever to hit Beirut, that killed 158 people and injured more than 6,000, compounding months of political and economic meltdown.A policeman was killed during the clashes, a spokesman said. A policeman at the scene said the officer died when he fell into an elevator shaft in a nearby building after being chased by protesters.The Red Cross said it had treated 117 people for injuries on the scene while another 55 were taken to hospital. Policemen wounded by stones were treated by ambulance workers. A fire broke out in central Martyrs’ Square. Dozens of protesters broke into the foreign ministry where they burnt a portrait of President Michel Aoun, representative for many of a political class that has ruled Lebanon for decades and that they say is to blame for its current mess.“We are staying here. We call on the Lebanese people to occupy all the ministries,” a demonstrator said by megaphone.About 10,000 people gathered in Martyrs’ Square, some throwing stones. Police fired tear gas when some protesters tried to break through the barrier blocking a street leading to parliament, a Reuters journalist said.Police confirmed shots and rubber bullets had been fired. It was not immediately clear who fired the shots. Riot police shot dozens of teargas canisters at protesters, who hit back with firecrackers and stones.TV footage showed protesters also breaking into the energy and economy ministries.They chanted “the people want the fall of the regime”, reprising a popular chant from the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011. They held posters saying “Leave, you are all killers”.The US Embassy in Beirut said the US government supported the demonstrators’ right to peaceful protest and urged all involved to refrain from violence.The embassy also said in a tweet that the Lebanese people “deserved leaders who listen to them and change course to respond to popular demands for transparency and accountability”.Prime Minister Hassan Diab said the only way out was early parliamentary elections.‘GO HOME!’The protests were the biggest since October when thousands of people took to the streets in protest against corruption, bad governance and mismanagement.“You have no conscience, you have no morality. Go home! Leave! Resign, Enough is enough,” shouted one of the protesters. “What else do you want? You brought us poverty, death and destruction,” said another.Soldiers in vehicles mounted with machine guns patrolled the area. Ambulances rushed to the scene. “Really the army is here? Are you here to shoot us? Join us and we can fight the government together,” a woman yelled.Tuesday’s blast was the biggest in Beirut’s history. Twenty-one people were still reported as missing from the explosion, which gutted entire neighbourhoods.The government has promised to hold those responsible to account. But few Lebanese are convinced. Some set up nooses on wooden frames as a symbolic warning to Lebanese leaders.“Resign or hang,” said one banner at the demonstration.The prime minister and presidency have said 2,750 tonnes of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, which is used in making fertilisers and bombs, had been stored for six years without safety measures at the port warehouse.ECONOMIC MELTDOWNThe explosion hit a city still scarred by civil war and reeling from an economic meltdown and a surge in coronavirus infections. For many, it was a dreadful reminder of the 1975-1990 civil war that tore the nation apart and destroyed swathes of Beirut, much of which had since been rebuilt.Some residents, struggling to clean up shattered homes, complain the government has let them down again.“We have no trust in our government,” said university student Celine Dibo as she scrubbed blood off the walls of her shattered apartment building. “I wish the United Nations would take over Lebanon.” Many people denounced their leaders, saying none of them visited the site of the blast to comfort them or assess the damage while French President Emmanuel Macron flew from Paris and went straight to the scene to pay his tribute.Macron, who visited Beirut on Thursday, promised aid to rebuild the city would not fall into “corrupt hands”. He will host a donor conference for Lebanon via video link on Sunday, his office said. US President Donald Trump said that he will join.“We don’t want any government to help us,” said unemployed protester Mahmoud Rifai. “The money will just go into the pockets of our leaders.”Aoun said on Friday an investigation would examine whether the blast was caused by a bomb or other external interference. He said the investigation would also weigh if it was due to negligence or an accident. Twenty people had been detained so far, he added.    ‘WE CAN’T AFFORD TO REBUILD’Officials have said the blast could have caused losses amounting to $15 billion. That is a bill that Lebanon cannot pay after already defaulting on a mountain of debt - exceeding 150% of economic output - and with talks stalled on an IMF lifeline.For ordinary Lebanese, the scale of destruction is overwhelming. Marita Abou Jawda was handing out bread and cheese to victims of the blast. “Macron offered to help and our government has not done anything. It has always been like that,” she said. “After Macron visited I played the French national anthem all day in my car.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanese-protesters-storm-ministry-buildings-as-anger-over-beirut-blast-grows/story-0Yav3mqlihjYmYrMvSlHMO.html
09-08-2020||World||Trump signs Covid-19 relief orders after talks with Congress break down||President Donald Trump signed executive orders on Saturday partly restoring enhanced unemployment payments to the tens of millions of Americans who lost jobs in the coronavirus pandemic, as the United States marked a grim milestone of 5 million cases. Negotiations broke down this week between the White House and top Democrats in Congress over how best to help Americans cope with the heavy human and economic toll of the crisis, which has killed more than 160,000 people across the country.Trump said the orders would provide an extra $400 per week in unemployment payments, less than the $600 per week passed earlier in the crisis. Some of the measures were likely to face legal challenges, as the U.S. Constitution gives Congress authority over federal spending.“This is the money they need, this is the money they want, this gives them an incentive to go back to work,” the Republican president said of the lower payments. He said 25% of it would be paid by states, whose budgets have been hard hit by the crisis.Republicans have argued that higher payments were a disincentive for unemployed Americans to try to return to work, though economists, including Federal Reserve officials, disputed that assertion. Trump’s move to take relief measures out of the hands of Congress drew immediate criticism from some Democrats.“Donald Trump is trying to distract from his failure to extend the $600 federal boost for 30 million unemployed workers by issuing illegal executive orders,” said Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. “This scheme is a classic Donald Trump con: playacting at leadership while robbing people of the support they desperately need.”The Democratic-majority House of Representatives passed a coronavirus support package in May which the Republican-led Senate ignored.Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden called the orders a “series of half-baked measures” and accused Trump of putting Social Security “at grave risk” by delaying the collection of payroll taxes that pay for the program.Trump also said he was suspending collection of payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and other federal programs, an idea that he has repeatedly raised but has been rejected by both parties in Congress. He said the suspension would apply to people making less than $100,000 per year.His orders would also stop evictions from rental housing that has federal financial backing and extend zero percent interest on federally financed student loans.Trump initially played down the disease’s threat and has drawn criticism for inconsistent messages on public health steps such as social distancing and masks. He spoke to reporters on Saturday at his New Jersey golf club, in a room that featured a crowd of cheering supporters.FAR APARTNearly two weeks of talks between White House officials and congressional Democrats ended on Friday with the two sides still about $2 trillion apart. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had pushed to extend the enhanced unemployment payments, which expired at the end of July, at the previous rate of $600 as well as to provide more financial support for city and state governments battered by the crisis.Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Friday offered to reduce the $3.4 trillion coronavirus aid package that the House passed in May by nearly a third if Republicans would agree to more than double their $1 trillion counteroffer.White House negotiators Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows rejected the offer.The $1 trillion package that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell unveiled late last month ran into immediate opposition from his own party, with as many as 20 of the Senate’s 53 Republicans expected to oppose it. Trump did not rule out a return to negotiations with Congress.“I’m not saying they’re not going to come back and negotiate,” he said on Saturday. “Hopefully, we can do something with them at a later date.”Democrats have already warned that such executive orders are legally dubious and would likely be challenged in court, but a court fight could take months. Trump has managed to sidestep Congress on spending before, declaring a national emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border to shift billions of dollars from the defense budget to pay for a wall he promised during his 2016 election campaign.Congress passed legislation to stop him, but there were too few votes in the Republican-controlled Senate to override his veto - a scenario that would likely play out again with less than 90 days to go before the Nov. 3 presidential election.

09-08-2020||World||LGBT protesters decry rising homophobia, arrests in Poland||A large crowd of LGBT rights supporters gathered in Warsaw on Saturday to protest the arrest of a transgender activist who had carried out acts of civil disobedience against rising homophobia in Poland.“You will not lock all of us up!” people chanted at the demonstration that appeared to have drawn thousands, many of them young adults. Most wore masks to battle coronavirus.Saturday’s protest comes a day after LGBT rights supporters scuffled with police who arrested the activist, Malgorzata Szutowicz, known best as “Margot.” Police said they detained 48 people, while activists said police used rough tactics against them.“The police were aggressively pushing the protesters out of the way, knocking people to the ground and holding them down with their boots,” the group said.The protests come amid an intensifying standoff in Poland between the LGBT rights movement and the conservative government, which has declared it an alien, dangerous “ideology.” President Andrzej Duda, who was sworn in for a second term Thursday, won re-election on a strong anti-LGBT platform, and social tensions have been rising.Szutowicz was put in pre-trial detention for two months for acts of civil disobedience, including using a knife to cut the tires of a van that drives around broadcasting anti-LGBT messages, including a claim that “homosexuals are preparing society to accept pedophilia.” She belongs to a group called Stop Bzdurom — “Stop the Nonsense” — which has been putting rainbow flags on Warsaw statues, including one of Jesus, infuriating the conservative government.Those defending her say that the legal measures being against her are disproportionate. Lawyers have not had contact with her, her defense lawyer said.Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro defended the police behavior as appropriate. He accused opposition politicians who are defending the LGBT protesters of supporting “banditry.” “Perhaps the knife that was used to destroy the van back then will be used for a bigger crime next time,” Ziobro said. “There can be no license for this type of attack ... we have to agree with this and stand together against criminals.” Protesters are further angered because Szutowicz, who was born into a male body and whose name at birth is Michal, has been put into male detention, though she feels like a woman.Dunja Mijatovic, the human rights commission for the Council of Europe, the continent’s top human rights body, called Saturday for Margot’s immediate release.“Order to detain her for 2 months sends very chilling signal for #FreedomOfSpeech & #LGBT rights in #Poland,” Mijatovic tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lgbt-protesters-decry-rising-homophobia-arrests-in-poland/story-s4oVLmcWsbywTBnRKiaL1I.html

09-08-2020||World||Twitter, TikTok have had preliminary talks about merger: Report||Twitter Inc. has held early talks about a potential combination with TikTok, the Chinese-owned video-sharing app that the Trump administration has declared a national-security threat, Dow Jones reported, citing people familiar with the matter.It’s unclear whether Twitter will pursue a deal, which would involve TikTok’s US operations, the people said. Because Twitter is much smaller, the San Francisco-based social media company has reasoned it probably wouldn’t face the same level of antitrust scrutiny as Microsoft Corp. or other potential bidders, people familiar with the discussions told Dow Jones.Microsoft has been negotiating for weeks with TikTok’s owner, Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., and is considered the front-runner for any possible deal, according to the people. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella spoke with President Donald Trump about the matter a week ago.A TikTok spokesperson said the company doesn’t comment on “market rumors,” in response to a inquiry on Dow Jones’ report.Twitter’s market capitalization is about $29 billion, smaller than Microsoft’s at more than $1.6 trillion. Twitter would almost certainly need help from other investors if it does buy TikTok, Dow Jones said, though it counts private-equity firm Silver Lake among its investors.Jack Dorsey, the chief executive officer of Twitter, has had a failed attempt at short-form video: it shut down the Vine app in 2016, four years after acquiring it, as part of an effort to cut costs. The company has recently been under attack by President Trump, who said that Twitter and Facebook Inc. are unfairly censoring him. Both platforms blocked a video shared by accounts linked to Trump for violating their policies on coronavirus misinformation.TikTok plans to file a federal lawsuit as soon as Tuesday to challenge President Trump’s executive order banning the video-sharing service from the US as unconstitutional, National Public Radio reported earlier Saturday, citing an unnamed source. TikTok responded to the ban in a blog post on Friday, saying it was “shocked” and would pursue all remedies available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-tiktok-have-had-preliminary-talks-about-merger-report/story-C9RN0aAqnsRmSIGK38Xs1J.html

We don’t know if it will be 50% or 60%. I’d like it to be 75% or more,” Fauci said in a webinar hosted by Brown University on Friday. “But the chances of it being 98% effective is not great, which means you must never abandon the public health approach.”Lockdown measures imposed to keep the virus from spreading have devastated the economy, which suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression in the second quarter, with gross domestic product dropping at its steepest pace in at least 73 years.The coronavirus has infected nearly 5 million people in the US and killed more than 160,000, making it the worst-affected country in the world.

09-08-2020||World||Amid public anger over Tuesday’s blast, Lebanon PM to introduce bill proposing early polls||Lebanon’s prime minister says he will introduce a draft bill proposing early elections for the crisis-stricken country.In a televised speech Friday, Prime Minister Hassan Diab called on all political parties to put their disagreements aside and work together.He said he is ready to stay in the post for two months to allow for politicians to work together on implementing structural reforms.Security forces fired tear gas and clashed with stone-throwing demonstrators Saturday in Lebanon’s capital amid mounting fury over the massive explosion that devastated much of the city and killed nearly 160 people. Dozens were still missing and around 5,000 people injured.Activists who called for the protest set up symbolic nooses at Beirut’s Martyrs’ Square to hang politicians whose corruption and negligence they blame for Tuesday’s blast.The explosion was fuelled by thousands of tons of ammonium nitrate that had been improperly stored at the city’s port for more than six years. Apparently set off by a fire, it was by far the biggest blast in Lebanon’s troubled history and caused an estimated $10 billion to 15 billion in damage, according to Beirut’s governor. It also destroyed 6,200 buildings and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless.“Resignation or hang,” read a banner held by protesters, who also planned to hold a symbolic funeral for the dead.Khodr Ghadir, 23, said the noose was for everyone who has been in power for the last 30 years. “What happened was a spark for people to return to the streets.” A placard listed the names of the dead, printed over a photo of the blast’s enormous pink mushroom cloud. “We are here for you,” it read.As the protest got underway, small groups of young men began throwing stones at security forces. Near parliament, riot police fired tear gas at protesters who tried to jump over barriers that closed the road leading to the legislature. The protesters later set on fire a truck that was fortifying barriers on a road leading to parliament. At least four people were hurt in the clashes, according to the Red Cross.The gathering at Martyrs’ Square and outside the parliament building and government headquarters came amid popular anger against Lebanon’s political leadership. The country’s ruling class, made up mostly of former civil war-era leaders, is blamed for incompetence and mismanagement that contributed to Tuesday’s explosion.The staggering devastation came on top of an economic and financial crisis that has led to the collapse of the Lebanese currency against the dollar, hyperinflation and soaring poverty and unemployment.The state, which is investigating the cause of the explosion, has been conspicuously absent from the ravaged streets of Beirut, with almost zero involvement in the cleanup, which has been left to teams of young volunteers with brooms who fanned out to sweep up broken glass and reopen roads.The protest came as senior officials from the Middle East and Europe arrived in a show of solidarity with the tiny country that is still in shock.In a show of anger, the president of the Christian opposition Kataeb party said its three legislators have decided to resign from Parliament over the disaster. Sami Gemayel called on every “honorable” member of parliament to step down and work for the “birth of a new Lebanon.” A senior Kataeb party official was killed in the blast. Also killed were 43 Syrians, the country’s embassy in Beirut said. Lebanon is home to some 1 million Syrian refugees.The Dutch foreign ministry said Saturday that Hedwig Waltmans-Molier, the wife of the Netherlands’ ambassador to Lebanon, had also died from injuries suffered in the explosion.Documents that surfaced after the blast showed that officials had been repeatedly warned for years that the presence of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate at the port posed a grave danger, but no one acted to remove it. Officials have been blaming one another, and 19 people have been detained, including the port’s chief, the head of Lebanon’s customs department and his predecessor.“We will support Lebanon through all available means,” Ahmed Aboul Gheit, the secretary-general of the 22-member Arab League told reporters after meeting President Michel Aoun on Saturday morning. Aboul Gheit said he would take part in a donors conference for Lebanon in France on Sunday and convey Lebanon’s demands to the international community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-public-anger-over-tuesday-s-blast-lebanon-pm-to-introduce-bill-proposing-early-polls/story-ulLit37pzC8dIZ0yP4m5pK.html
09-08-2020||World||Second plague death reported from China’s Inner Mongolia region||A patient in northern China has died from the plague, the second death from the disease in the country’s Inner Mongolia region this week. The victim died on Friday from multiple organ failure in a case of bubonic plague, the Bayannaoer city health commission said.The area where the person lived has been sealed off, and seven close contacts have been placed under medical observation, the commission said.

The state administration has now announced the setting up of a new dedicated Covid-19 hospital in the state and has promised better treatment protocols as the numbers have taken a decisive turn for the worse. “We will be setting up a new Covid-19 Hospital at the Sub-District Hospital, Ponda to cater to rising coronavirus cases in the state,” State health minister Vishwajit Rane said. Prior to this the state had only one dedicated hospital for Covid-19 with a capacity of 220 beds. The hospital soon filled up prompting the decision of the state government to set up care centres for asymptomatic patients. Those too soon filled up prompting the government to allow asymptomatic patients to go in for home quarantine. The new Covid-19 hospital, which will function out of the sub district hospital in Ponda town in South Goa and has the capacity to cater to nearly 440 patients.Goa has witnessed a total of 8,712 cases of which 5,995 have recovered and 75 have succumbed while 2,642 are undergoing treatment either at care centres or at the state’s dedicated hospital. “Our government is committed to provide the best healthcare facilities to the people in this challenging period. I urge everyone to come together and support the authorities to fight against this pandemic and avoid politicising issues related to healthcare,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said. The government has rolled out rapid antigen testing to help cope with the demand for tests despite their knack for false negatives but with a rider that they will only be used on asymptomatic patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-registers-506-new-covid-19-patients-in-a-day-the-highest-surge-so-far/story-IKWHDXFvgntD8pLpHQtQxL.html

If a family cannot provide the money then it can take the patient to another hospital, the commission has said. In another advisory issued on Saturday evening the commission has also said that sanction from patients’ families have to be taken for pathological tests if these cost more than Rs 2000 and necessity of the tests have to be explained to the families in advance. The commission has, however, said that if a test is considered urgent then it can be conducted but the attending doctor will bear the responsibility. With these, the commission has issued 10 advisories to private hospitals. Eight advisories were issued last week. Senior state health department officials said the Mamata Banerjee government may in the future fix the rates of treatment in intensive care unit (ICU), critical care unit (CCU) and ventilation facilities as well. “The chief minister (who is in charge of the health department as well) has taken note of numerous complaints. In one of these cases, a family had to pay Rs 1.5 lakh in one and a half days although the patient was not in critical state,” said an official who did not want to be quoted. While the government’s decision to put a ceiling on advance deposit has not drawn any adverse reaction from hospitals, some have questioned the logic behind explaining the necessity of tests to a patient’s family during critical care. Rupak Barua, president, Association of Hospitals of Eastern India, said, “We have received two advisories. There are some aspects of advisory No 10 which need some clarification. We will request the commission to share some more clarity.” Saturday’s advisories came a week after the commission issued seven advisories in one go, saying numerous anomalies have come to its notice. All hospitals and laboratories in the state are registered under the Clinical Establishment (Registration, Regulation and Transparency) Act The government last week said most hospitals were charging patients for the most expensive antibiotics, antifungals, analgesics and other drugs although these are available in different price ranges. In one of the advisories, the commission said, “Patients’ relatives shall be offered to choose which brand they would like to purchase.” “The government has already fixed a sum of Rs 1,000 per day on account of PPE to be charged in the in-patient bill. However, some of the clinical establishments are charging additional amounts on account of sanitizer, additional gloves, head gear, etc,” said an advisory issued last week. “It has come to the notice of the commission that the pathological laboratories authorized to conduct Covid-19 tests by way of home collection are charging additional amounts over and excess of Rs 2250 fixed by the government,” said another advisory issued last Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-take-more-than-rs-50k-as-deposit-from-covid-19-patients-bengal-govt-tells-pvt-hospitals/story-g6aeo46Cc8mBMu8z4IHRMJ.html

The vice president also urged people to pledge to drive out poverty, illiteracy, inequality, gender discrimination, corruption and all kinds of social evil. In a social media post, the vice president said the hard fought independence in 1947 was not just about ending the colonial rule of the preceding 200 years but also bringing down curtains on the 1000 year-long dark age during when the country was plundered at will by the invaders, traders and the colonialists taking advantage of the lack of unity among the Indians.“Lack of sense of belonging to each other and unity of purpose and action had led to long subjugation and exploitation of India. Learning from this, all Indians need to be bound by the shared sense of Indianness while pursuing their respective cultural value and ethos. This is all about nourishing the spirit of nationalism. A perception of divided India would make us an easy target for others for fishing in troubled waters. A strong, unified and emotionally integrated India is the best defence against those casting an evil eye on us with questionable intentions,” he wrote in the post.Naidu pointed out that the country paid a heavy price in the form of cultural subjugation and economic exploitation that enfeebled the once rich India.The vice president also stressed on the need to ‘Knit India’ into one single fabric by ensuring equality of all and equal opportunities for all and noted that a divided and iniquitous society does not enable the fullest development of all Indians to their capacity.Elaborating on the adverse impacts of a stream of foreign invasions resulting in the loot of the country’s wealth since the year 1000, Naidu referred to the destruction of the Somnath temple and the long period taken to rebuilt the same after independence and the gap of about 500 years taken to begin reconstruction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.Referring to the celebration of 75 years of independence in 2022, the vice president urged the people to take a pledge to||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/knit-india-into-one-single-fabric-says-venkaiah-naidu-on-quit-india-movement-anniversary/story-SjlAF88zKgW9VBMyjsGseK.html

Tests are being carried out in 1,200 plus centres. Our fatality rate is less than 1 percent and recovery rate one of the best in the country at 72 percentage. Of course there is more to do,” he noted.Rao was responding to a query posed by a twitter user on whether testing in Telangana was low compared to states like Maharashtra, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.The question was part of an #Ask KTR session held by him.As of 8 PM on August 8, the state has conducted 6.13 lakh tests.The tally of positive cases in the state was 79,495. The case fatality rate was 0.78 per cent, while the recovery rate was 70.44 per cent.When a twitter user alleged that there was no proper health infrastructure in the state and also sought to know of the situation in state-run Gandhi hospital, he said the same facility and its team has treated thousands of coronavirus patients and sent them home safely.“Of course there is scope for improvement and we will take necessary steps,” he said.Reacting to complaints of private hospitals overcharging Covid-19 patients, he said the government has already taken action against a couple of private hospitals.“We have already acted against a couple of private hospitals and will not hesitate to act on more. The government hospitals are offering their best services.. request people to realise this,” he said.To another query as to why the Centre’s ‘Ayushman Bharat’ scheme was not implemented in Telangana, he claimed that the state’s ‘AarogyaSri’ health insurance scheme was more comprehensive than ‘Ayushman Bharat.’ “Arogyasri is more comprehensive than Ayushmann Bharat and in fact the central government’s scheme is modelled on it,” he pointed out.To a suggestion to focus on rural healthcare infrastructure in the state, Rama Rao said the Covid-19 pandemic has shown that a lot more needs to be done in the healthcare sector.When a doctor, posted at a Covid-19 centre at government medical college in Nalgonda, pointed to the lack of proper accommodation for healthcare personnel, Rao said the college was a newly-established institution and that it would take time to develop it.The minister, however, said he would request the District Collector to provide better amenities to frontline warriors.Asked when city buses, the Multi-Modal Transport System (MMTS), trains and metro rail services would resume in the city, he said the state government was awaiting the nod from the Centre.When a twitter user took exception to his reported remarks that there won’t be any prizes given for conducting more Covid-19 tests, Rao said he only meant to convey that the Telangana government was not in race with any other state.“Each state has its own set of challenges and we will work towards combating the pandemic as per WHO and ICMR guidelines,” he said.Asked about the state’s contribution for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, he said, “We will pray and hope for ‘Ram rajya,’ where people of all faiths, castes and classes are respected and treated equally as enshrined in the Constitution of our great country.” Asked about his stand on Pothireddypaadu issue, he said the state government would fight for its rightful share in Krishna river water.“We will fight for our rightful share in Krishna waters.Already an SLP has been filed in Supreme Court by Telangana government,” Rao said.The opposition Congress and BJP have accused the TRS government of not doing enough to protect the state’s interests on the issue. To a query on major investments expected this quarter, the Minister said some big announcements will be made soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-to-ramp-up-covid-19-testing-to-40-000-samples-per-day-says-k-t-rama-rao/story-ihmrXldGBmifu40DUfuruK.html

The initiative received a further shot in the arm on Sunday with the surrender of 12 ultras including five with a collective reward of Rs 6 lakh on their heads for their involvement in an ambush of security forces in the past. The Maoists surrendered in Dantewada district of the state.The surrender took place in a ceremony attended by state officials, where Dantewada superintendent of police Abhishek Pallava told PTI that the cadres were drawn to the rehabilitation campaign being run by the local police and had given up the Maoist ideology. Dantewada MLA Devti Karma was also present on the occasion, he said.“All 12 ultras said in their statement that they were disappointed with the hollow Maoist ideology, and were impressed by the ‘Lon Varratu’ campaign being run by the police in Dantewada,” Pallava was quoted as having told PTI.Lon Varratu is a term from the local dialect and it means ‘return to your village’.The police officer quoted above said that one of the surrendered ultras, Chanduram Sethiya, was an active member of platoon no 26 of Maoists and is suspected of involvement in three attacks on security forces, including the one in Bhusaras-Chingavarm in 2008 that resulted in deaths of 23 policemen and two civilians. Sethiya was carrying a reward of Rs 2 lakh on his head, Pallava said.Lakhmu Hemla, Sunil Tati, Manu Mandavi and Maituram Barsa were the other four surrendered Maoists carrying rewards of Rs 1 lakh each on their heads, he added. They were all operating in separate areas of south Bastar.The remaining seven ultras to have laid down their arms on Sunday were among the lower-rung of the outfit, Pallava told PTI.One of them, Amit Kawasi was allegedly involved in the October 2018 Nilawaya attack, in which three policemen and a Doordarshan cameraman were killed in Dantewada.Under the Lon Varratu initiative, the surrendered ultras will be rehabilitated as per the government’s surrender and rehabilitation policy, which includes financial assistance.Posters asking Maoists to surrender have been put up by the police in their hotbeds in the state since the launch of the programme in June. The posters mention the names of rebels and appeal to them to join the mainstream, the police official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surrender-of-82-maoists-under-lon-varratu-holds-hope-for-chhattisgarh/story-67NhAcz35RL6Uw5UE0aslJ.html

09-08-2020||India||Party chief will be elected in ‘not too distant future’, Sonia Gandhi to remain interim president till then: Congress||The Congress on Sunday sought to set at rest the speculation over extending the tenure of Sonia Gandhi as the party’s interim chief beyond August 10, saying she will continue to occupy the post till the process of electing a new president is completed. A Congress functionary said the extension is a technical requirement as per the party constitution given that a regular president is yet to be elected. The party also has to inform the election commission of its decision as a prerequisite. The party has maintained that the process of electing a new president could not be initiated due to the coronavirus and the nationwide lockdown enforced since March 25 to contain the pandemic. “Soon after her appointment, there were assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana in October-November last year followed by polls in Jharkhand and Delhi. Then the Covid-19 struck,” added the functionary quoted above. The Congress Working Committee (CWC) had named Sonia Gandhi as the party’s interim chief on August 10 last year after Rahul Gandhi refused to take back his resignation. The CWC has powers to appoint a provisional president pending the election of a regular president by the All India Congress Committee (AICC), the party’s central unit comprising around 2000 members from across the country. “Neither nature nor politics nor political parties permit or tolerate a vacuum. Just like nature abhors a vacuum, political parties cannot function in a vacuum. It is true that the tenure is expiring tomorrow (Monday). There is a laid down procedure in the constitution for elections,” Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said, addressing a virtual news conference. “In the meanwhile, if anybody is suggesting that the Congress will become headless on the stroke of midnight of August 10. Is it possible? Is that a fair interpretation of any constitution that August 10 midnight happens and the seat suddenly becomes vacant? Nobody can suggest that. No point giving simple views as they have to be in accord with common sense,” he added. Singhvi said the process of electing a new party chief will be completed soon and till then Sonia Gandhi will remain at the helm. “Sonia Gandhi ji is the president and she will continue till such time a proper procedure is implemented and it will be implemented in the not too distant future. It is as simple as that,” he said. A veteran Congress leader said on the condition of anonymity that general secretary in-charge of organisation KC Venugopal will have to inform the election commission that the organisational polls could not be held due to certain reasons and till the time such process is completed Sonia Gandhi will continue to discharge her responsibilities as the party’s interim president.The CWC can ratify this decision anytime, he added. “There is a process that goes to the CWC and the AICC and this will start anytime and you will get the results soon. We are bound by our party constitution,” added Singhvi. In the run-up to the August 10 deadline, some sections of the Congress had started demanding that Rahul Gandhi return to the post he gave up in May 2019, owning responsibility for the party’s rout in the general elections. He was elected the Congress president in December 2017 for five years till 2022. Congress leaders say that while Rahul Gandhi is not keen to accept that responsibility in the immediate future, Sonia Gandhi is also unwilling to continue in the post for long.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/party-chief-will-be-elected-in-not-too-distant-future-sonia-gandhi-to-remain-interim-president-till-then-congress/story-OnKZ7VoXrMFfl0vPswvImJ.html

The fire service personnel, who were the first to reach the site, were able to rescue 18 patients by evacuating them through the windows, using ladders. It was a difficult exercise given the single staircase.All the rescued persons were rushed to Ramesh Hospital, where they were declared out of danger. Three others have been moved to a different hotel at Labbipet. Ten other patients, however, could not be saved and died due to suffocation from the fire, officials said. According to state health minister Alla Kali Krishna Prasad, the blaze started at around 4.45 am on the ground floor of the hotel before spreading to the first and second floors. Preliminary investigations suggest a short-circuit in the electric wiring caused the fire. Also Read: 10 Covid-19 patients killed as hotel turned care centre catches fire in Andhra PradeshFlames engulfed the hotel building and thick plumes of smoke billowed in the entire building, leaving the patients suffocated. Some of the medical personnel and hotel staff managed to escape through the exit on the ground floor while four of them jumped off the first and second floors. A security guard, Krishna Reddy, suffered injuries after falling on the ground. Many of the patients, who were fast asleep, woke up to scenes of commotion and fire and smoke filled surroundings. “I did not know in which direction I was moving. I managed to open the window panes and come out shouting for help. I picked up courage and informed the police,” a young patient Pavan Sai said in a video message. Vijayawada city police commissioner B Srinivasulu said the control room had received a call at around 5.15 am about the fire breaking out in the hotel. The minister, however, said the fire station, which is situated less than a kilometre away from the hotel, received the first call at 5.09 and within five minutes, the fire tenders arrived at the hotel. “The fire was brought under control within a couple of hours,” the minister said. After putting out the fire, the firemen and personnel of the National Disaster Response Force brought out the bodies of 10 patients, most of whom died of suffocation. The bodies were shifted to the Vijayawada government hospital for post-mortem.

The deceased were identified as: Kosaraju Suvarnalath (42) of Nidabrolu village of Ponnur block in Guntur district; Dokku Siva Brahmaiah (59) of Machilipatnam in Krishna district; Potluri Purnachandra Rao, Kodali of Krishna district; Sunkara Babu Rao (80), Indira Nagar, Vijayawada; Majji Gopi (54), Machilipatnam; G Venkata Jaya Lakshmi (52) of Kandukuru in Prakasam district; Venkata Narasimha Pavan Kumar (40) of Kandukuru in Prakasam; Sabbili Ratna Abraham (48), Rajakumari (40), both from Jaggayyapet; and Maddali Raghu (40) of Moghulraja Puram, Vijayawada. The tehsildar said Ramesh Hospital had entered an MoU with Swarna Palace Hotel to operate a Covid-19 facility on paid basis. “It appears that the management of the hotel and Ramesh Hospital had known that there were electrical defects in the lodge (hotel), and as rectification of defects involved a huge amount, they avoided repairing it. Knowing the fact that if the defects were not rectified, there is a possibility of an accident, they opened the Covid care centre,” the official said. The health minister said a committee involving the director of health and Arogya Sri director and other officials was formed to give a detailed report on the accident within 48 hours.“Preliminary report says the hospital and the hotel management are at fault. We asked for a detailed report so that stringent action can be initiated against those responsible”, the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/firemen-saved-18-covid-patients-from-certain-death-in-vijayawada-blaze-that-took-10-lives/story-2vLO9oyuq5BrsTaihh17PK.html

Rakesh Pandey alias Hanuman Pandey carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head, officials added. They said Pandey was involved in several murders and shoot-outs, carried out allegedly by Mukhtar Ansari’s gang in the past 27 years. Ansari was accused of hatching a conspiracy to kill Rai-- an MLA from Mohammadabad assembly constituency in Ghazipur-- while in jail, but was acquitted during trial in a lower court. Mukhtar Ansari and another gangster Prem Prakash Singh alias Munna Bajrangi are also accused in Rai’s murder case.Bajrangi was shot dead by another gangster Sunil Rathi inside Baghpat jail on July 9, 2018. STF inspector general (IG) of police Amitabh Yash said a team was continuously trying to track Pandey for the past many months.“Pandey was gunned down in retaliatory firing while the team was trying to arrest him when he came to meet one of his accomplices on Kanpur Road, under Sarojini Nagar police station limits,” Yash said.He said Pandey was in a four-wheeler with four other people but the others managed to escape during the encounter. Another STF official said Pandey had at least 10 criminal cases registered against him between 1993 and 2012. He added that no criminal case was lodged against him after 2012, however, his involvement surfaced in two cases, including fraudulent procurement of firearms licence in his wife Saroj Lata Pandey’s name in Mau in 2004 and purchase of two pistols from a gangster Neeraj Singh in May 2020. The official said a case of procuring firearms licence was lodged against his wife and the then station officer of Kopaganj police station Mritunjay Mishra (for negligence) at the Kopaganj police station of Mau on July 8 this year. He added that the STF was, however, tracing him since May 28 this year when the arrest of two criminals -- Neeraj Singh and Shubham Mishra -- revealed that Pandey was collecting firearms and ammunition and was planning some crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mukhtar-ansari-aide-and-dreaded-shooter-killed-in-lucknow-encounter/story-SBhUVldvZZwUrjoTP7TlfI.html
09-08-2020||India||Returning migrant workers boost tractor sales in Bihar, state records highest June sales in country||The return of migrant workers in Bihar has given an impetus to the sale of tractors in the state, with the state recording the highest increase in percentage terms in June in the country . Experts say the migrants are looking at agriculture as an alternate employment opportunity to compensate for loss of jobs during Covid-19. According to figures released by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA) in the last week of July, tractor manufacturing companies registered a growth of 122.54% Year over Year (YoY) sales in Bihar while the sales figure for the entire country was a mere 10.36 per cent.In June, 4,304 tractors were sold in Bihar --2,370 more as compared to June 2019--which is the highest in the country.Rajasthan clocked the second highest sales figures by selling 1,505 more tractors as compared to June 2019, while Assam secured third position by selling 1,276 more tractors. Bihar Agriculture University director RK Sohane, says that buying tractors will help augment their income.“The sales figures indicate that small farmers are buying tractors, which will help in augmenting their income. During farming season they can deploy their tractors in the agriculture field and earn money and after that they can use it for transportation of sand and bricks,” said Sohane. Tractor dealers say that they are struggling to meet the demand in August which is generally considered lean for the sale of these farm machines.The massive rise in tractor sales in Bihar was due to not just the return of migrant workers but also because of a bumper rabi crop in the state, said Jivan Kumar, general manager of Patna-based Ananya Tracto“Two factors are sparking the sale of tractors in Bihar - return of migrant labourers and bumper Rabi and potato crops in the state. The farmers have become cash rich by getting good prices for their crops. Also, the migrant workers who have returned to Bihar want to get engaged here and they are buying tractors,” he said. “About 60% of our buyers are first-time customers, who have returned to Bihar and don’t want to return to the place from where they have come in near future, so they are investing in tractors. The three-month moratorium in payment of EMI after purchase of tractors by finance companies is also boosting up the sales,” he said, adding, “August is considered a lean month for sale of tractors, as the agriculture activity stops and a ban on sand lifting also starts. However, we are getting lots of queries for purchase of tractors, but are unable to meet it as supply is less because of lean production in plants,” he said. According to another person engaged in the business of selling tractors, another reason for the rise in sales is that those who returned to the state could not get any other jobs and thus, they are investing in the purchase of these farm machines which can be used for other commercial activities as well.“The major reason for rise in sale of tractor is that the migrant labourers who have returned to Bihar are not getting any jobs, so they are buying tractors, which are being used for farming and transportation of sand and bricks. Besides this, the deferment of marriages due to Covid-19 has left the farmers with extra cash in hands so they are investing in buying tractors,” said Kumar Ranjan, proprietor of Maa Shitla tractors in Patna.State agriculture minister Prem Kumar said that the state government may consider providing incentives to farmers to buy tractors.“The scenario of agriculture has changed in Bihar with several schemes and incentives by the Centre and state government, so people are buying tractors to increase their income.

Due to pandemic, this has been a long phase which does not seem to end so soon. So, to be back on the sets with little singing wonders, who are competing to prove their singing prowess, is an add-on. And then, I’m in my musical land where it’s music everywhere.” Talking about what all kept her busy, Alka said, “When this lockdown happened I was good in a way that I got time to be at home, spend time with my daughter and son-in-law and I also got time to go back to my singing practice. But now I want normalcy to prevail in the world as soon as possible.” She recorded a few Covid-19 anthems from home and did two online concerts during the phase. “Such concerts can never ever replace live shows. The energy and magic of being on the stage is so different. Also, the audience connect is something I am longing for and now wish to get back to my live shows soon.” Alka has been judging reality shows for quite some time and enjoys her stints. “As I said music is my life and anywhere where there is music I would love to be there. Also doing reality show is super fun. When we restarted shooting for ‘Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Li’l Champs,’ I was very excited as in March we had to stop the show midway due to coronavirus crisis. So, getting to meet all the little champs again was thrilling experience,” she said over the phone. Getting back to shoot was a daunting task for her. “When I got a call last month informing about fresh shooting schedule I was glad as well as a bit apprehensive but my family downright said ‘no going back!’ After much persuasion I got back to judging the wonderful singers from across the country. Also, the way our production team was taking complete precautions, it made me more confident to be back to work.” For Alka all her songs are close to her heart. “For me picking one or two favourites will not be possible. Also, there a few memorable albums that I still cherish like ‘Qayamat se Qayamt Tak,’ ‘Refugee’ and ‘Kuch Kuch Hota Hai’. That kind of music will always be in demand even after so many years. See melody and good music will remain in our hearts forever and I am proud that I belong to that melodious era.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/melody-and-good-music-will-remain-in-our-hearts-forever-says-alka-yagnik/story-0andTqmaMWl5XuqsxyDkJK.html

The proposed mosque complex will come up at Ayodhya’s Dhannipur village.A government spokesperson said, “it is not the time to respond to it. It would be inappropriate on our part.”An advisor to the chief minister said, “It would be inappropriate to comment on something that’s only an idea. Currently, there are divisions in the Muslim community and stakeholders over the utilisation of the land. Let’s wait and watch.”Also read: Sunni Board may invite PM Modi, Yogi Adityanath to Ayodhya eventOn Saturday, Athar Hussain, the spokesperson for the Indo Islamic Cultural Foundation had said that the trust would invite the chief minister for the foundation stone laying for various public facilities at the proposed mosque. He had also made it clear that there would be no foundation laying ceremony for the mosque itself as there was no provision for it in the four schools of thought in Islam.Hussain’s statement came days after CM Adityanath, in an interview to a TV channel on the day of the Ram temple bhoomi pujan on August 5, had said, “No one will invite me, nor will I go.” His response came after he was asked whether he would go for the mosque construction event if invited.“I am not a party to it (mosque) in any manner. So neither will anyone invite me nor will I go. I know I am not going to get any such invitation. If I get any such invitation, then secularism of many people will be in danger. So I better work silently and send benefits of the government schemes to all without any discrimination,” he had added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-adityanath-s-office-refuses-to-comment-on-reports-of-mosque-trust-s-invite-for-library-hospital-event/story-V4aVJtIrUOT4G4KtDglRYP.html
09-08-2020||India||Bihar becomes first state to have 10 lakh self help groups run by women||Bihar has become the first state in the country to have 10 lakh self-help groups (SHGs) managed by women. The groups have been functioning under Jeevika, a World Bank-supported poverty alleviation programme operational in the state since 2007 to empower women and make them self-reliant.Arvind Kumar Choudhary, principal secretary, rural development department, said that the Jeevika model has ensured empowerment of women in a big way. “It has been a project closer to the heart of chief minister Nitish Kumar and the Jeevika model has ensured financial inclusion and empowerment of women in a big way. Even during the Covid-19 pandemic, the women of Jeevika worked as bank correspondents and ensured over Rs 543 crore worth transactions through POS machines to take banking to the doorsteps of the needy people in the remotest corners of the state. Besides, it reached out to 1.09 crore households to create awareness, extend a helping hand for relief work, food security, work on sanitation etc.,” he added.Bihar rural livelihood promotion Society (BRLPS), an autonomous society under the rural development department of the state government, has been designated as the State rural livelihoods Mission by the government to scale up the ‘Jeevika’ model in all 534 blocks of 38 districts under the national rural livelihood Mission (NRLM). It has promoted sustainable livelihood and financial inclusion through women-based community institutions and enterprises. Balamurugan D, mission director, NRLM said that nearly 1.20-crore women had got involved with over 10 lakh SHGs. “They have scripted a new saga of women empowerment, which is visible in the rural areas. They have availed Rs 12200 crore worth loan from banks so far to start their own income-generating activities and repayment has been timely. They have repaid loan worth Rs 5,000 crore to avail fresh loan. They also have Rs 1,350 crore worth savings for inter-loaning amongst its members,” he added. Two years ago, chief minister Nitish Kumar had also commended the way women ran their SHGs and the huge increase in bank credit to them. “Big shots take huge money from banks and run away from the country, while these women running SHGs make timely payments. This shows how committed and disciplined they are in financial matters,” he had said.Balamurugan said that these SHGs under Jeevika programme have been helping over 45 lakh households during the Covid-19 pandemic.“During Covid-19 pandemic, Jeevika has benefited 45.5 lakh households through its various activities, such as production of 2.14-crore masks, running ‘Didi in Rasoi’ outlets to serve food to quarantined people and in-patients, disbursal of Rs 350 crore worth loan to village organisations for food security and health risk mitigation, running community-led rural retail shops for supply of essentials and organising community professionals for extensive campaigns,” he said.Besides financial inclusion of a strong women workforce, the government has also been using their services for various social campaigns and initiatives of the education, health and welfare departments. “This is a model that can take Bihar miles to achieve self-reliance in the true sense, something that India dreams to achieve. Bihar has shown how it could be done. This has been a very positive initiative. All that is needed is to integrate the activities of SHGs and give them further opportunities for scale up to also become employment generators in the rural areas, which would further give a boost to the state economy,” said former director of AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-becomes-first-state-to-have-10-lakh-self-help-groups-run-by-women/story-8s6vHbFSQaGy06cigPLweO.html

The land at Ayodhya’s Dhannipur village was allocated to the board in compliance with the Supreme Court verdict of November 9 last year in the title dispute case. The UPSCWB officials said they would soon approach Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to seek an appointment for the foundation-laying ceremony that is likely to be held in September-end or in October.SM Shoeb, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Sunni Waqf Board, said, “We would like to invite the PM and the UP CM to lay the foundation of establishments of public utility like the community kitchen, hospital, museum, library, etc. The list of invitees would be finalised in the board meeting after a discussion with the other members. It would be a matter of pride for the board if PM joins us for the inaugural programme.”Also read: PM Oli lights up Ayodhya row again, says Lord Ram was born in NepalThe CEO made it clear that there was no provision for any groundbreaking ceremony for any mosque in Islam. “In all schools of thought, no ulema (cleric) has confirmed a provision for any ritual and groundbreaking ceremony for a mosque. Hence, there is no point in organising any such event or inviting anyone for such an event (for the mosque),” said Athar Hussain, spokesperson for the Indo Islamic Cultural Foundation, the trust constituted to oversee construction of the mosque and public utility establishments on the allocated five acres of land. With this comment, he made it clear that the ceremony would only be for the public utility facilities.“Since we are also providing public utility facilities around the mosque in the Dhannipur area, and those facilities are for the betterment of UP residents, we would be inviting the chief minister also to the inauguration programme, once we have a plan,” said Hussain. The board may also invite former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and other political and non-political personalities. The list of invitees would be finalised after the board meeting that will be held shortly.“It was just a week back we got the land papers. The physical possession of the land is expected by the next week. Once we get the possession, we will go for land measurement. Then, we will chalk out the blueprint for the development work to be carried out on the land, which would be followed by the foundation stone laying ceremony of the public utility establishments. It will take a month or so for us to start the work,” said the CEO of the UPSCWB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sunni-board-may-invite-pm-modi-yogi-adityanath-to-ayodhya-event/story-hcHoVgTWQ6WaOyhdWLYzkN.html
09-08-2020||India||Cornered by rivals, PM Oli is back with a ‘ludicrous’ claim on Ram’s birthplace||Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli this week attempted to ignite a fresh row over Lord Ram’s birthplace, telling a delegation that he was convinced that Lord Ram was born in south Nepal’s Ayodhyapuri and not Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya.PM Oli’s remark on Ayodhya, the second in a month, comes against the backdrop of an acrimonious power struggle within the ruling Nepal Communist Party that is widely seen headed for a split. PM Oli has made it clear that he isn’t going to step down anytime soon as demanded by the rival camp led by the party’s co-chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal and the two other former PMs, Madhav Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal.PM Oli’s rivals have the majority within the party but have been unable to dislodge the prime minister who has been needling India - Nepal’s new map was one such effort - to endear himself to China’s communist party.Also read: Nepal okays map tweak, India calls it ‘untenable’PM Oli’s claim last month that Lord Ram was born in south Nepal’s Ayodhyapuri, and not UP’s Ayodhya, was delivered in this context. The remark was described as “ludicrous” by his party who spotted a pattern in the prime minister’s “undiplomatic” and “irritating” pinpricks targeting India.New Delhi had then let it pass after the foreign ministry in Kathmandu rushed to put out a clarification, clarifying that the prime minister only meant to highlight the importance of further studies and research of the cultural geography represented by Ramayana.PM Oli worked hard to rake it up again on Saturday.The prime minister, who has been bunking meetings of the NCP’s top leadership for weeks, took out two hours to meet a delegation from Madi in Chitwan district to discuss his plans for Lord Ram’s birthplace. He told the delegation led by Madi mayor Thakur Prasad Dhakal that they should get down to prepping for Lord Ram’s idol and promote Ayodhyapuri as his place of birth. A suggestion to rename the municipality to Ayodhyapuri was also floated at this meeting.PM Oli’s continuing effort to appropriate Lord Ram’s birthplace has drawn sharp reactions from religious leaders in Nepal including the priests at the Janaki temple. Acharya Durga Prasad Gautam, the Nepalese priest who participated in the bhumi poojan at Ayodhya, had run down PM Oli’s claims, describing the claim as absurd.Also read | ‘Keep Lord Ram out of regional politics’: Ayodhya saints lash out at Nepal PM OliKathmandu watchers say the shrewd communist leader’s sudden interest in religion lately appeared to be designed to signal to China and its ambassador Hou Yanqi that he was their best bet against India and should receive Beijing’s support.Ambassador Hou, derisively described as Nepal’s new viceroy to reflect her influence over the prime minister, has been quietly working to avoid a split in the Nepal Communist Party. At one point, she is learnt to have messaged to Oli’s rivals that the Chinese Communist Party’s sole interest was to ensure that the NCP - formed in 2018 after the merger of Nepal’s two communist parties - did not split.“PM Oli is trying hard to tell China that he is indispensable to serving Beijing’s interests in Kathmandu,” a Kathmandu watcher in New Delhi said.PM Oli last month made it clear that the NCP could split if he was pushed out of the government when his camp re-registered his old party CPN-UML as a political party with the election commission. The ruling NCP was formed with the merger of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and Dahal’s Communist Party of Nepal- Maoist Centre in 2018PM Oli hasn’t spoken about it. But Dahal, who suspects the move to register the new party is part of PM Oli’s Plan B; to split the NCP in case he is forced to resign, has told his followers to prepare for the “worst”.Diplomats in Kathmandu said they had not been able to decipher why Dahal, a former guerilla leader, and Madhav Nepal had not pushed PM Oli hard enough so far though he has had the numbers on his side.“It is a little curious,” he said, wondering if PM Oli’s upper hand over his rivals had something to do with some “political vulnerabilities”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-oli-lights-up-ayodhya-row-again-says-lord-ram-was-born-in-nepal/story-SreuEJe32EohO1O0WtOJoN.html

09-08-2020||India||FIR lodged against MP Congress working president Jitu Patwari for tweet on PM||Police in Indore lodged an FIR against state Congress working president and MLA Jitu Patwari on Sunday for his alleged undignified remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and for tampering with his photo in his social media post on Saturday, said police. The FIR was lodged under sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 464 (Making a false document) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the minister by Indore’s Chhatripura police station on a complaint signed and submitted by member of parliament from Indore Shankar Lalwani and several other BJP leaders. “On his Twitter account, the Congress MLA posted a photo of the PM snapped when he was performing bhoomi poojan for construction of Ram Temple at Ayodhya on August 5. Jitu Patwari tampered with the photo and made undignified remarks against the PM which caused damage to his dignity and hurt sentiments of people”, said the complaint. However, talking to media persons, Jitu Patwari, who has deleted his post now, said he didn’t make any defamatory or undignified remark against the PM. His comment was on failure of the central government on economic and employment fronts. Harinarayanchari Mishra, DIG of police, Indore said, “Police are investigating the matter. Any further action will be based on the facts which come to light during investigation.” Earlier in June, Jitu Patwari regretted his comments he made on his Twitter handle when chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan attacked him for his alleged derogatory remarks against women. Jitu Patwari had tweeted: “Five daughters were born namely demonetisation, goods and sales tax (GST), employment, inflation and economic slowdown while anticipating a son called development (vikas).”He deleted the tweet after chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan hit out at him and the Congress and called them anti-woman. Patwari regretted his comments and said daughters are like goddesses. “My tweet was to suggest how people have been waiting for years for development promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi but they got instead demonetisation, GST, unemployment, inflation and economic slowdown which have broken the backbone of the economy.”(With input from Neha Jain in Indore)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fir-lodged-against-mp-congress-working-president-jitu-patwari-for-tweet-on-pm/story-wK2GiQhCk6FQE1NErNLFPP.html
09-08-2020||India||‘Congress needs to find new chief to arrest perception of being rudderless’: Shashi Tharoor||Senior Congress leader from Kerala Shashi Tharoor has said that the party needs to find a new full-term president to counter the perception that it is “rudderless”.He also said that it is unfair to be expecting Sonia Gandhi to carry interim chief’s burden indefinitely.“Congress needs to expedite process of finding full-term president to arrest perception of being rudderless and adrift,” Tharoor said on Sunday.His comments come just ahead of Sonia Gandhi completing one year as interim chief on August 10.“I certainly believe we should be clear about our leadership going forward. I welcomed Sonia ji’s appointment as interim president last year, but I do believe it’s unfair to her to expect her to carry this burden indefinitely,” Tharoor told news agency PTI.Tharoor also said that he certainly thinks Rahul Gandhi has the “mettle, capability and aptitude to once again lead the party”, but if he does not wish to do so then the party must “take action” to elect a new chief. A section of the Congress has started demanding that Rahul Gandhi should return to the post he gave up in May 2019, owning responsibility for the party’s rout in the general elections.The demands came in three meetings - the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on June 23; at Sonia Gandhi’s deliberations with the party’s Lok Sabha members on July 11; and during her interaction with the party’s Rajya Sabha MPs on July 30.One Congress leader said on condition of anonymity that he sees it as the responsibility of Rahul Gandhi to assuage the concerns of both veterans and members of the young brigade because there is visible unease between the two groups over the leadership issue and their future in the party.His reference is to the long-simmering conflict between the party’s old guard and its younger members - which came to fore most recently during Sonia Gandhi’s meeting with Rajya Sabha MPs.While Sonia Gandhi is not keen to continue in the post, Rahul Gandhi has not shown any inclination to take up the responsibility.Tharoor said that Rahul Gandhi has done a remarkable job in holding the present government accountable for its actions and failures.“Through his activities during this lockdown, whether it has been on the issue of the COVID-19 virus or Chinese transgressions, Rahul Gandhi has without a question and almost single-handedly done a remarkable job in holding the present government accountable for its actions and failures,” the Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram said.Experts have said the clamour for Gandhi’s ascendancy to Congress president once again highlights the fact that the party does not want to take the tougher route of holding elections and finding a new leader from outside the Nehru-Gandhi family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-needs-to-find-new-chief-to-arrest-perception-of-being-rudderless-shashi-tharoor/story-VkyuXgTJMYk5Wxikb3PfTN.html

They came in contact with two cooks, who had tested positive earlier,” said state health department’s principal secretary Nitin Kulkarni.He added, “People still are not following the preventive measures like using masks and maintaining social distancing in their true sense leading to a spike in cases. Police personnel living in barracks get easily infected due to ignorance of social distancing norms.”On August 4, chief minister Hemant Soren along with his family members and staff had undergone the Covid-19 test after 19 people associated with his office and residence including some cooks and security guards were found infected.However, test reports of the CM and his family members returned negative. A day later, another 22 staff of the CM’s residence were found infected with the disease.This is the second time in less than a month that the CM had undergone the Covid-19 test and was found negative.

A person of the family, however, was found alive outside the hut they lived at Lodta village of Dechu area, an officer said. “But he claimed to have no idea about the incident, which believed to have happened in the night,” said Superintendent of Police (Rural) Rahul Barhat. “We are yet to ascertain the cause and means of death. But apparently, all the members appeared to have committed suicide by consuming some chemical in the night,” Barhat said. He said there was a smell of some chemical around in the hut, suggesting that they consumed something. All the family members were Hindu migrants from Pakistan from the Bhil community and had been living on the farm in the village, which they had hired for farming. “There was neither any injury mark on any of the bodies nor any evidences of any foul play,” the SP said. “But we have roped in the forensic team and a dog squad to arrive at any final conclusion.” Preliminary information indicated that there was some dispute in the family over some issue. “Once we interrogate the survivor, we would be in any position to find out that what had led to this incident”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-pak-migrants-found-dead-in-rajasthan/story-aDbQNbbp9rxGi8wsdf2wSP.html

Raut said that “conspiracy” by the BJP government in Karnataka to remove the statue in the night is “condemnable”.The Sena leader challenged the state’s Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis to lead an agitation to Belgaum over the district and promised support from the Shiv Sena. Raut said that days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid respects to the Maratha warrior king during the bhoomi pujan of Ram temple, the same party’s government conspired in the dark of the night to remove the statue.“The manner in which the Karnataka Police removed the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is condemnable. Nobody from Maharashtra’s Opposition party is ready to talk on it. Prime minister Narendra Modi paid respects to Chhatrapati Shivaji during the foundation laying ceremony of Ram temple in Ayodhya. The same party’s government in Karnataka removed the statue in the night by switching off the lights. Maharashtra government should take serious note of this incident. Without indulging in politics, the Opposition party in the state should be taken in confidence. If needed, we are ready to go to Belgaum and agitate under the leadership of the Opposition leader. Ask him, if he is ready,” Raut told reporters in Mumbai.Belgaum district of Karnataka, which has a sizeable Marathi-speaking population, is the subject of a protracted boundary dispute between the two states.On Saturday, Sena leader and Maharashtra minister Eknath Shinde demanded that the Karnataka government reinstate the Shivaji statue.In a letter to Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa, Shinde, who is coordinator minister for border areas along Karnataka, claimed that a life-size statue of the warrior king was removed at Mangutti village by the police and district authorities.

The fishermen were allegedly drowned after their fishing boat named ‘Lucky Star’, carrying 13 people, capsized around 10 nautical miles from Gorai coast on August 4.

09-08-2020||India||Rajasthan CM writes to all party MLAs, appeals to save democracy||Few days ahead of the assembly session, which probably could witness a floor test, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot writes to all state MLAs, appealing to save the democracy. “To save democracy, maintain people’s faith and avoiding wrong traditions, you should listen to people’s voice. No matter which political party you belong to, after understanding the sentiments of people of your constituency, family and peers, the decision should be taken that will not let the plan of destabilizing the elected government succeed,” said Gehlot. Lauding the work done by the government since its formation in 2018, including efforts to bring the state economy on track and measures taken against Covid-19 pandemic, Gehlot said the management by the state against Covid-19 is appreciated nationally. Looking at the seriousness of the Covid-19, meetings were held with political groups, elected representatives, NGOs, saints, philanthropists, doctors, police etc., he said. Also read: Six more people die due to Covid-19 in Rajasthan“With your (MLAs) support, success, to an extent, is achieved in curbing coronavirus but today it has taken such a shape that it is difficult to assess where it will stop. The number of cases in Rajasthan have increased. The state has developed a testing capacity of over 40,000 tests per day. In comparison to other states, the death rate is low and the recovery rate is high in Rajasthan,” he said. He further added that in the current situation, when the Covid-19 pandemic should be a concern for all, “some of our colleagues and certain opposition leaders are conspiring to destabilize the government, which is unfortunate”. The CM shared that during 1993-96, horse-trading was done to topple the government of Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. “Then, as a union minister and state party chief, I met Governor Baliram Bhagat, PM PV Narsimha Rao and protested against the toppling of an elected government which is against democratic values and I consider it as political enormity,” he said. In 1984, during Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure, the anti-defection law was brought and when Atal Bihari was the prime minister, a provision was made that two-third members of a political group can make a separate group or can merge in another group. To ensure a stable government, the six-BSP MLAs decided to merge, which is legal but destabilizing a government through horse-trading or other means is unjustified. It is against democratic values, te chief minister said. “Winning or losing is part of elections. People such as Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Atal Bihari too had faced defeat in elections but they never let the democratic values and tradition weaken. We respect the elected representatives, no matter which political parties they belong to, and ensure that their justified demands related to the constituency are fulfilled,” he stated. Gehlot concluded by saying, “I hope you will stand by the truth and cooperate in fulfilling the promises made to the public for state’s development and prosperity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cm-writes-to-all-party-mlas-appeals-to-save-democracy/story-bdhYZnfHhxyMaUOIqLmHPJ.html

What it means is we will try to make the same equipment (that we import today) in 2 to 4 years and stop imports thereafter!” the Congress leader added.Singh had said while announcing the development on Twitter that it would be a big step towards self-reliance in defence.Artillery guns, missile destroyers, ship-borne cruise missiles, light combat aircraft, light transport aircraft, long-range land-attack cruise missiles, communication satellites, basic trainer aircraft, multi-barrel rocket launchers, a variety of radars, assault rifles, sniper rifles, mini UAVs and different types of ammunition have been included in the list, Singh had said.The embargo will kick in for different items between 2020 and 2025, the defence minister had said.The defence minister said the list of the embargoed items comprises of “not just simple parts but also some high tech weapon systems like artillery guns, assault rifles, corvettes, sonar systems, transport aircraft, LCHs, radars & many other items to fulfil needs of our defence services”.He also said the list was made after several rounds of consultations with all stakeholders, including the armed forces, public and private industry to “assess current and future capabilities of the Indian industry for manufacturing various ammunition & equipment within India”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-s-import-embargo-high-sounding-jargon-cong-s-chidambaram-takes-a-jibe/story-cIcDWJ4wrXJCvCUq1J4AHP.html

He said that the decision has been taken for political gains and as part of pressure tactics.Terming it as a “conspiracy against Maharashtra”, the resident editor of party mouthpiece Saamana said that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has politicised the case by linking a state minister with it.Raut, in his weekly column Rokhthok, has said that the decision of handing over the investigation is an attack on the state’s autonomy. He has also pointed at the ‘misuse of the central agencies’ like CBI and said that the Centre’s intervention in the case is an insult to Mumbai Police. He said that though the CBI is a central agency, it has been proved time and again that it is not independent and impartial. “Many state governments have banned the CBI. People in West Bengal took to streets against the agency when it tried to intervene in the Saradha Chit Fund case,” the Shiv Sena leader stated.“Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah were of the same opinion about the CBI when they were active in Gujarat politics. They had opposed the transfer of Godhra riots and the subsequent killings (in Gujarat in 2002). What is wrong if the same feelings are expressed after the transfer of the Sushant Singh death case to the central agency,” he questioned.Raut also accused the BJP of defaming the state government under Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray with the help of a section of media. “One channel has been using derogatory and threatening language for chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. This has anguished many including Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar. Expressing his discontent over the disrespect to Thackeray who holds constitutional post, Pawar asked me what action the government has taken. The section of media has support from the Opposition party, which wants to destabilise the government,” he said.“It appears that the script of the entire Sushant episode was pre-determined. The Opposition has been linking state minister Aaditya Thackeray with the case just because he shared cordial relations with some of the Bollywood actors. More disturbing is the Opposition’s stand on the entire episode as they have stood firm in support of the Bihar Police. The Opposition and a few news channels have been insensitive and inhuman about the Disha Salian and her family members who have been going through tremendous trauma,” Raut said in his column.He has also slammed Mumbai Police for enormous delay in the investigation and said that it needs to be checked if the case was used to “terrorise” Bollywood. “Sensing the high profile character of the case, they should have ensured briefing of the case to the media every next day. Police came under tremendous pressure after the linking of a state minister to the case. The police should have clarified that they will register a statement of the politician or minister if they found any connection. By inviting the Bollywood stars to record statements, the police gave room to gossiping,” the column reads.Raut said that Aaditya Thackeray shares cordial relations with actor Dino Morea who had hosted a party at his residence before Rajput’s death, but linking it with the case was wrong. Mudslinging against any politician without having any firm proof is unethical, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conspiracy-against-maharashtra-sanjay-raut-on-sushant-singh-rajput-case-going-to-cbi/story-B0ric9knbKGaQnqVQTCSXL.html

The casualties are low in this Kozhikode tragedy. The reason why 158 people died in the Mangalore incident as the plane caught fire. The plane went down deep and people died due to asphyxiation and only 8 survived. In the Kozhikode incident, the plane went down for around 30-40 foot,” he told ANI. Also read: Kozhikode crash puts spotlight on tabletop runway risksHe also explained about problems during landing if the rainwater is accumulated on the runway. “It was raining heavily in Kerala. The accumulation of rainwater on the runway surface in the rainy season is the riskiest thing. There should be proper drainage on runaway and a maximum of around 3 mm water film is allowed. During braking, the wheel of aircraft gets locked while landing and later released. At that time, if there is a film, then the plane will skid off. In this case, the plane can go in right or left direction or it cannot stop,” Bhushan said. “Rubber in the plane tires melts while landing and that’s why smoke comes out. In this case, if the water is on the runway, there will be a problem while landing,” he said. Also read: Part of perimeter wall demolished, cockpit cut open to pull out pilots, say rescuersEarlier, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) officials told ANI that the visibility was 2,000 metres at Kozhikode due to heavy rain and after landing at Runway 10, the plane continue running to the end of the runway and fell down in the valley and broke into two pieces.Bhushan said that there is no problem in the operations of table-top runways but extra skill and caution are required while carrying out flight operations there.“There are many table-top runways in India and across the world. There is no reason to be afraid of it. The airport in Kozhikode has a longer runway than Mangalore. But there is a rule by DGCA in landing at tabletop runways. Differents tests of pilots were taken before they get clearance to land at table-top runaways. Every runaway has its speciality. Different precautions are taken for these airports,” he said. Also read: Investigators find black box of crashed Air India Express jet, probe beginsThe retired Air Marshal said that the inquiry panel will also look into why pilots have to take the decision to land compulsorily in Kozhikode if visibility was a problem there. “As media reports say 2000 metres was the visibility. If that’s true it was good visibility because in our field we consider 500 metres also good visibility. The inquiry should find out what was the visibility at that time. Another is the wind factor. The wind is erratic in tabletop runaways. The pilot ensures safe landing while considering all this. Maybe the situation was not well, that’s why they took a round of the airport and then landed. There is a standard operating procedure set up by DGCA for clearing water from the runway. The inquiry panel will check this aspect during the investigation,” he said. “Pilot can land somewhere else but it is important how much fuel was left in the aircraft. Another thing is what was the weather in other airfields as if there would not be any different. In case of rain around those airfields. It will come out after inquiry about why they have to take the decision to land compulsorily in Kozhikode,” he said. Bhushan said that the Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) that have been recovered from the Air India Express aircraft will reveal reasons behind the tragedy.“It is good that DFDR has been found. CVR has been found which will help to find out what pilots were talking like if there was an engine problem, fuel availability, control issue, and braking issue. These things will be recorded in DFDR. This two equipment were badly damaged in the Mangalore incident,” he said.As the DGCA has ordered an inquiry into the mishap, Bhushan said that exact reasons will be known if the inquiry panel formed should be a composite team.“I was the chairman and there was an experienced pilot with me. Two engineers were there and ATC officials who were experts of the runway, weather experts, and doctors. There should be a composite team. Medical reasons should also come out in these cases,” he said. “After the inquiry in the 2010 Mangalore incident, we gave 40-50 suggestions and those were implemented also. We will get to know about inquiry in this incident also. The pilot in the Mangalore incident had fallen asleep,” he said. On Friday, Air India Express aircraft carrying 190 people including 184 passengers and six crew members on board crash-landed at the Kozhikode airport. At least 18 people lost their lives in the incident. Both the pilot and the co-Pilot are among the dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expert-who-investigated-mangaluru-accident-lists-reasons-for-kozhikode-plane-crash/story-MUEA13xMTAwaz96muovwVJ.html

The DBO dialogue is separate from the military commanders on-going dialogue on Chushul-Moldo area with the specific task of disengagement and de-escalation of troops on the four friction points.The decision to fly Chinook over DBO advance landing ground during night time was taken to test the Indian Army’s capability of rapid insertion of special forces and infantry combat vehicles in case the situation deteriorates in the sub-sector north (SSN) area. “ While Apache attack helicopters have been patrolling Chushul area, the US made Chinook flew over DBO to test its night fighting capabilities…..we have already deployed T-90 tanks and artillery guns in the area,” said a senior commander. The US built Chinook has a proven record of night flying in Afghan mountainous terrain and is used for rapid military retaliation by the special airborne forces. The twin rotor platform has two heavy calibre machine guns deployed at the front and back of the chopper to suppress ground fire.While the Chinese have raised objections to the deployment of tanks and guns at DBO, the Indian Army have pointed to recent accretion of PLA troops in the area along with air activity across the SSN. Both sides are matching each other’s deployment in the area even as the PLA is indulging in fast paced construction of roads in the area for rapid deployment. The interesting part is that while China raises objections to India building border infrastructure, there is no slowing down of the same all along the LAC---from occupied Aksai Chin to Kibuthoo in Arunachal Pradesh.At the divisional commander level meeting on Saturday, India has also raised the issue that both sides should be allowed to do unhindered patrolling of their respective claim lines in the area including the Depsang Bulge, south of DBO. This was a clear indication of the Indian intent that it is not going to back down from patrolling rights at the Bulge or at any other place on the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-force-night-flies-chinook-over-dbo-as-pla-ramps-up-troops-in-occupied-aksai-chin/story-fxOObHJcV8Btt2qu8oOAtL.html

In last three years, more than 150 cases of wildlife have been registered in which the field forest officers have investigated the cases and charge sheeted in appropriate courts of law but the scrutiny of the earlier wildlife offence cases revealed that the acquittal rate is very high. In around 90 per cent of the cases the accused get acquitted in the court,” said an IFS officer of Chhattisgarh, on condition of anonymity. The main reason being that the statement of the witness is nearly all cases till now were recorded in front of Range Officer not Assistant Conservator of Forest (ACF) in the presence of the accused, officer claimed. “Most of the ACF officers don’t want to involved in these cases because of apathy and court cases and hence acquittals took place,” added the officer. The forest department has also decided that if any officer will not follow the directives, departmental action will be taken. “We have clearly mentioned in our directive that action will be taken if it is not followed. The instructions to all the field officers says that all wildlife crime will be investigated by an officer not below the rank of Range Officer (RO) as the RO is empowered by the government to place challan in the court. Further it has also been directed that the statement of the witnesses will be recorded by an officers not below the rank of Assistant Conservator of Forest (ACF) in the presence of accused person,” said Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife) Arun Kumar Pandey talking to Hindustan Times. This has been instructed to ensure that the statement recorded in this way will be admissible in the court of law during trial. It is worth mentioning that section 50(9) of Wildlife Protection Act 1972 gives a unique power to forest officers (of the rank ACF and above) that the statements recorded by them of witnesses in presence of accused will be admissible in the court during trial. In simple words, magisterial power with respect to statements of witnesses has been given to ACF rank forest officers. “The department has also moved a proposal to the government seeking permission to get call detail records and live tower locations of the accused persons during the course of investigation and also to form a special task force for investigation of the wildlife crime,” said Pandey. The wildlife activists claimed that the directive reflects how serious Chhattisgarh forest department was about the wildlife crime. “After so many years, the department has now realised about the implementation of Wildlife Act reflects the seriousness of department. Secondly, the department should focus of capacity building of its officials, which are very apathetic about the wildlife crime. The forest officers are least bothered about the crime investigation,” said Meetu Gupta, member of the State Wildlife Board. Chhattisgarh’s 44 per cent area is forest with three tiger reserves, namely Udanti-Sitanadi Tiger Reserve, Achanakmar Tiger Reserve and Indravati Tiger Reserve, and two national parks - Kanger Valley National Park and Gurughasidas National Park. The state also has eight sancturies - Barnawapara, Bhoremdev, Gomarda, Bhairamgarh, Pamed, Semarsot, Badalkhol and Tamor-Pingla Sanctuary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-forest-department-wants-to-improve-conviction-in-wildlife-offences-issues-strict-directions-for-officers/story-39uWv5ulY3vAgzr2r9Mv8O.html

Announcing the development on Twitter, Singh said it would be a big step towards self-reliance in defence. The list includes artillery guns, missile destroyers, ship-borne cruise missiles, light combat aircraft, light transport aircraft, long-range land attack cruise missiles, communication satellites, basic trainer aircraft, multi-barrel rocket launchers, a variety of radars, assault rifles, sniper rifles, mini UAVs and different types of ammunition. The list also spells out when the embargo kicks in for different items --- between 2020 and 2025. Also read: Rajnath Singh announces embargo on import of 101 defence items. Check full list hereAll necessary steps would be taken to ensure that the timelines for the production of the equipment on the negative import list are met, Singh said. “The list also includes, wheeled Armoured Fighting Vehicles (AFVs) with indicative import embargo date of December 2021, of which the Army is expected to contract almost 200 at an approximate cost of over Rs 5,000 crore,” the minister said. He said the ministry has split the capital procurement budget for 2020-21 between domestic and foreign capital procurement routes. “A separate budget head has been created with an outlay of nearly Rs 52,000 crore for domestic capital procurement in the current financial year,” he said. Also read: Rajnath Singh announces import embargo on 101 defence items, says ‘big step towards self-reliance’From raising foreign direct investment (FDI) in defence manufacturing to creating a separate budget for buying locally-made military hardware and notifying a list of weapons/equipment that cannot be imported, the government had announced a raft of measures to boost self reliance in the defence sector in May 2020. Singh said the embargo on imports would be progressively implemented between 2020 and 2024. “Our aim is to apprise the Indian defence industry about the anticipated requirements of the armed forces so that they are better prepared to realise the goal of indigenization,” he said. The list of weapons banned for import will be reviewed every year and more items will be added to it after discussions with the department of military affairs (DMA). This implies India will have to compulsorily develop technology for the defence systems and platforms figuring on the negative import list. “More such equipment for import embargo would be identified progressively by the DMA in consultation with all stakeholders. A due note of this will also be made in the Defence Acquisition Procedure to ensure that no item in the negative list is processed for import in the future,” the minister said. The list has been prepared by the ministry after several rounds of consultations with all stakeholders, including the military and the industry, and factoring in future capabilities of the defence sector to locally manufacture equipment and ammunition. “Almost 260 schemes of such items were contracted by the Tri-Services at an approximate cost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore between April 2015 and August 2020. It is estimated that contracts worth almost Rs 4 lakh crore will be placed upon the domestic industry within the next 6 to 7 years,” Singh said. One of the key responsibilities assigned by the government to the DMA, headed by chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, is to promote the use of indigenous military equipment in the armed forces. Imports account for 60-65% of the country’s military requirements and it has signed contracts worth billions of dollars during the last decade for weapons and systems including fighter jets, air defence missile systems, submarine hunter planes, attack helicopters, heavy-lift choppers and lightweight howitzers. India was the third-biggest military spender in the world last year after the United States and China, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) said in a report released in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-big-guns-to-missiles-india-bans-import-of-101-defence-items-to-boost-self-reliance/story-KN7V3wBHpKnGPZmCdxYWqJ.html

He was elected as a Member of Parliament at the young age of 24 in 1970. He has since been elected President twice and has been appointed Prime Minister thrice. The SLPP, led by Mahinda Rajapaksa, registered a landslide victory in the August 5 general election, securing two-thirds majority in Parliament needed to amend the Constitution to further consolidate the powerful Rajapaksa family’s grip on power.Also read: Fresh opportunity for India, Sri Lanka to enhance bilateral engagement, says Indian High CommissionMahinda Rajapaksa polled over 500,000 individual preference votes -- the highest ever recorded by a candidate in the history of elections.The SLPP won in 145 constituencies, bagging a total of 150 seats with its allies, a two-thirds majority in the 225-member Parliament. The cabinet ministers, state and deputy ministers are expected to be sworn-in on Monday.The Rajapaksa family -- including SLPP founder and its National Organiser 69-year-old Basil Rajapaksa, who is the younger brother of Gotabaya Rajapaksa, 71, and Mahinda Rajapaksa -- has dominated Sri Lankan politics for two decades. Mahinda Rajapaksa previously served as the president for nearly a decade from 2005 to 2015.President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had won the November presidential election on the SLPP ticket.In the parliamentary election, he was seeking 150 seats mandatory to execute constitutional changes, including to repeal the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which had curbed the presidential powers while strengthening the role of Parliament.Activists, already alarmed by the diminishing space for dissent and criticism in the island nation, fear such a move could lead to authoritarianism.The biggest casualty from the election outcome was the United National Party (UNP) of former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe which managed to win only one seat. The country’s grand old party failed to win a single seat from any of the 22 districts.UNP leader and four-time prime minister Wikremesinghe was unseated for the first time since he entered Parliament in 1977.

This is a big step towards self-reliance in defence,” Singh said.The embargo on imports is planned to be “progressively implemented” between 2020 to 2024, he said.“This decision will offer a great opportunity to the Indian defence industry to manufacture the items in the negative list by using their own design and development capabilities or adopting the technologies designed & developed by DRDO to meet the requirements of the Armed Forces,” he added.The defence minister said the list of the embargoed items comprises of “not just simple parts but also some high tech weapon systems like artillery guns, assault rifles, corvettes, sonar systems, transport aircraft, LCHs, radars & many other items to fulfil needs of our defence services”.He also said the list was made after several rounds of consultations with all stakeholders, including the armed forces, public and private industry to “assess current and future capabilities of the Indian industry for manufacturing various ammunition & equipment within India”.“All necessary steps would be taken to ensure that timelines for production of equipment as per the Negative Import List are met, which will include a co-ordinated mechanism for hand holding of the industry by the Defence Services,” Singh tweeted.The announcements made by Singh on Sunday are part of the government’s recent emphasis on the Atmanirbhar Bharat mission after PM Modi’s push for self-reliant India during his address to the nation in May.

The choice is not today between will India engage or not engage the world. Proponents of FTAs make out as if that is the only vehicle to engage the world and if you missed out of RCEP, you are missing something very big in the world,” he said. “I am not sure that it’s an accurate assessment of RCEP or FTAs... We need to drill down, get to basics, have detailed honest debates and not make these mantras ‘oh my God, we’re retreating and becoming protectionists’. A lot of our problems arise when we start overhyping it,” heIn November last year, India decided not to join the RCEP agreement as its key concerns were not addressed. The key issues behind New Delhi’s decision not to be part of RCEP included inadequate protection against import surge, insufficient differential with China, possible circumvention of rules of origin, keeping the base year as 2014 and no credible assurances on market access and non-tariff barriers.In May, China said it will welcome India back to negotiations on the RCEP at an appropriate time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-talks-of-rcep-says-it-is-important-not-to-get-into-false-choice-on-ftas/story-Ii99K8aJgYm2bodW5M7wMM.html

He has been shifted to Shri Maharaja Hari Singh (SMHS) hospital.The police said that Abdul Hamid Najar was on morning walk when unidentified gunmen fired at him near Ompora.Thirty eight-year-old Najar (who belongs to the Other Backward Class) was the district president of the BJP.This is the third attack on a BJP leader or worker in last five days. Earlier, a sarpanch was killed in South Kashmir’s Qazigund area on Thursday.The sarpanch, Sajjad Ahmad, was attacked outside his residence, the police said. He was rushed to the hospital where authorities declared him brought dead.Another sarpanch Arif Ahmad Shah was also critically injured in the attack by terrorists in the same district.After these attacks, three BJP workers had announced their dissociation with the party.“We have resigned from the BJP. I am an unlettered person and earn my living as a labourer. I had joined BJP a few months back. I thought it is better to focus on my living and feed my family happily without any tension,” said Wani, a baker by profession.Two other panchayat members - one of them affiliated with the Congress - had resigned after the attack.Last month, former BJP district president Waseem Bari, his father and brother were killed inside their shop after militants fired on them from close range. Bari had a 10-member police security and all of them were suspended and arrested because they were not with him when he was attacked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-worker-out-on-morning-fired-upon-in-budgam-third-attack-in-5-days/story-XTPZDs6drMdwTBpvL1NIcK.html

The incident took place in Burhanpur, 328 km southwest of state capital Bhopal, where the attackers used sling shots and arrows, they further said.While three people sustained serious injuries in their heads and were admitted to district hospital, others were discharged after first aid, said MR Tarnekar, Additional Superintendent of Police, Burhanpur.The police registered a case against 200 unidentified people for voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servants from performing their duties at Nepanagar police station on Saturday, said Tarnekar. Burhanpur district forest officer, Gaurav Chaudhary, said, “Forest officials and residents of Ghaghrala village had gone to the Navra range where alleged encroachment took place by tribals, who recently migrated from neighbouring districts in large number. We had a report that more than 200 tribal are trying encroach upon land by felling tree. Forest teams have requested them so many times but every time they showed their aggressive behaviour. This was the fourth incident when they attacked the forest team.” “The local villagers, who are opposing the encroachment, came forward to help the forest team on Friday but when they reached the site, the encroachers started pelting stones by using sling shots and also attacked them with arrows,” he added. Chaudhary said there might be an organised land mafia who is using these tribal for encroaching upon the land. However, Navra range officer Gulab Singh claimed that police were not supporting them in anti-encroachment drive. Refuting the allegations, ASP Tarniker said, “It is a sensitive issue and we can’t take action all of sudden without informing the authorities.” “But on Friday when the tribal attacked forest team and villagers, heavy police force reached the spot and controlled the situation. Now, we have asked the forest officers to hold a coordination meeting with district administration to have a proper strategy to deal with them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-people-injured-in-clash-at-madhya-pradesh-town-case-registered-police/story-F0SCq3z9vkBfDEJyfW6iLI.html
09-08-2020||India||Centre asks states to conduct Covid-19 test of grocery shop workers, vendors||Expressing concern that grocery shops, vegetable and other vendors can be potential spreaders of coronavirus infection to a large number of people, the Union health ministry has advised states and UTs to take up testing of such people to ensure early detection of cases which can lead to reduction in mortality rate.In a letter to states and UTs, secretary in the health ministry, Rajesh Bhushan, also stressed on the need for operationalising ambulance transport system with oxygen facility and quick response mechanism.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here He underlined that the refusal rate of ambulances must be monitored at a daily basis and brought down to zero.With the Covid-19 pandemic now spreading to newer areas in the country, Bhushan said there are likely to be scattered cases, cluster of cases or large outbreaks in districts and that the primary aim is to control outbreaks, especially in new locations. “The focus at the same time should be to save lives at all cost,” he said.“While we have so far done better than many other countries in this respect, our aim should be to further reduce mortality and ensure that it does not cross the 1 per cent mark,” Bhushan said in the letter, addressed to additional chief secretaries, principal secretaries and secretaries (health).Click here for complete coronavirus coverage He pointed out that early detection of cases through aggressive testing, prompt isolation or admission in a healthcare facility and ensuring proper clinical management are major components of mortality reduction.“Early detection of cases is the most crucial element to ensure that the case fatality is reduced. It helps in terms of not only identifying the case before it may become critical but also supports in terms of checking the spread of infection,” he said in the letter.Bhushan stressed on enhanced surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI)/severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) as their symptoms are mostly the same as Covid-19.Also read: 13 districts account for 1 in seven Covid-19 deaths in IndiaOnce a positive case is identified, a prompt contact-tracing should be undertaken and at least 80 per cent of the contacts must be identified and quarantined within 72 hours, he said.Normally, a person would have an average of 30 contacts for a period of tracking that two days before the symptom onset, Bhushan said.“There can be potential hotspots for spread of infection like industrial clusters with closed work environment, people coming from high prevalence areas, other high density areas such as slums, prisons, old age homes, etc. “In addition, grocery shops, vegetable and other vendors, etc. can be potential spreaders of infection to a large number of people. Testing in such areas and of such people should be taken up proactively as per ICMR guidelines,” Bhushan underscored.He also asked states and UTs to undertake weekly death audits to assess the determinants of death such as age differentials, comorbidities, late reporting to hospital and clinical protocols that were followed.“This will help identify challenges to be addressed and will facilitate effective case reporting and ensure timely and required medical interventions,” Bhushan highlighted. In the letter, Bhushan also said that a regular house-to-house search must be done periodically to identify those who are at high-risk, that is the elderly, people with comorbidities and pregnant women among others.Alongside this exercise, containment and buffer zones should be set up and the perimeter of the containment zone must be properly secured. Buffer zone should also be identified properly so that any diffusion of infection outside the containment zone is monitored, he pointed out.For early detection, all suspected cases need to be tested immediately, the health secretary said, emphasising that at least 140 tests per million per day (although a higher number is encouraged) must be ensured along with a strict monitoring of daily positivity rate.Depending on the test result, those found positive should be sent to a Covid-19 care centre or under home isolation if there is requisite provision at home.“An ambulance transport system with oxygen facility and quick response mechanism needs to be operationalised. The refusal rate of ambulances must be monitored at a daily basis and must be reduced to zero,” Bhushan stressed.Availability of Covid-19 beds in all healthcare facilities (government and private) must be proactively put in the public domain, he said, adding that responsible administrative officers should coordinate transparent allocation of beds and timely admission.A communication mechanism between the patients and their family members must be organised, he stated. He also urged districts to analyse the requirement of health infrastructure in terms of availability of sufficient oxygen supported beds, ICU beds and ventilators and take advance action to upgrade health infrastructure based on expected caseload in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-states-to-conduct-covid-19-test-of-grocery-shop-workers-vendors/story-2R2vBX3cpfb7qnVsjIoMUI.html
09-08-2020||India||Supreme Court seeks explanation on listing of Prashant Bhushan’s criminal contempt plea||The Supreme Court has asked its registry officials to explain why a petition filed by journalist N Ram, former Union minister Arun Shourie and advocate Prashant Bhushan challenging the validity of contempt of court law was listed before a bench headed by justice DY Chandrachud instead of another bench already hearing similar matters, people aware of the matter said. Hours after the explanation was sought, an updated list of cases showed that the case will no longer be heard by the justice Chandrachud-led bench.Bhushan is facing contempt proceedings in two cases for his alleged remarks against the court and the Chief Justice of India. Those cases were heard and reserved for judgment on August 4 and 5 by a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra.“The registry has committed yet another mistake in the listing of a matter challenging the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act. As per the practice and procedure, the matter should have been listed before the bench which is already seized of similar matter but it has been listed ignoring established practice and procedure,” a person said on condition of anonymity.According to a list on the Supreme Court website uploaded on August 6, the plea was listed before a bench of justices Chandrachud and KM Joseph and was slated to be heard on August 10. “In this regard, explanation of concerned officials has been called,” the person added.Bhushan could not be reached for comment.“The master of the roster is the Chief Justice. It is unclear as to whether the explanation was sought by the Chief Justice or by any particular judge. The registry official may well have gone by the roster that assigned questions of Constitutional validity to one bench, while a particular instance of contempt was being heard by some other bench. Surely it is no one’s case that everything related to the court’s contempt jurisdiction is assigned to one bench alone,” said senior counsel Sanjay Hegde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-admin-seeks-explanation-on-listing-of-criminal-contempt-plea/story-abRV9hwlTOn1wQqaBBBYXO.html

09-08-2020||India||Kozhikode crash puts spotlight on tabletop runway risks||The crash involving an Air India Express plane that was attempting to land amid heavy tailwinds and rain on a tabletop runway at the Kozhikode airport has once again shone light on safety concerns over flight operations in such conditions.Concerns were raised following the 2010 Air India Express crash in Mangalore that killed 158 people on board. That year, a court of enquiry report by a former Indian Air Force chief Air Marshal BN Gokhale noted that tabletop runways require extra skill and caution. The hazard of “undershooting” and “overshooting”, in particular, can lead to grave situations, the report said.“While the length of the runway 24/06 (in Mangalore) is adequate for operations by aircraft such as Airbus A320 and Boeing 737-800, the downward slope at end of R/W 24 leading into hill slope is not recommended if one is to consider the hazards of overshooting the paved surface during takeoff or landing...,” the report, submitted in October 2010, said.Also read| Kozhikode plane crash: Flight was shaking, it was a nightmare, recount survivors“There are three tabletop airports in India from where scheduled flights operate. These are Mangalore, Kozhikode and Lengpui. Because of the undulating terrain and constraints of space, these airfields require extra skill and caution while carrying out flight operations. The hazard of undershooting and overshooting, in particular, can lead to grave situations, as was the case in this accident (in Mangalore). These table-top runways also have a problem of access roads around the airfield, which may need to be used in case of aircraft accidents,” it added.The narrow and winding roads can delay and hinder rescue operations, the report said.So-called tabletop airports have limited space at the ends of the runway, and several international airlines have stopped flying bigger aircraft into Kozhikode due to safety issues.The Air India Express flight with 190 on board overshot and fell 50 metres off the end of the runway at the Kozhikode airport in treacherous conditions on Friday, breaking into two — making it one of the deadliest commercial aviation disasters in the country in nearly 10 years.The crash occurred around 7.40pm, when it was raining. The incident bears eerie similarity to the 2010 Mangalore airport crash when a plane, also an Air India Express Boeing 737, overshot a table-top runway and crashed nose-first into the ground.According to Robert A Clifford, lead counsel in the case against Boeing for the last major Boeing crash — the 737 Max 8 accident in Ethiopia on March 10, 2019 — and senior partner of Clifford Law Offices, Chicago, the investigation into what caused Friday’s Air India crash will likely focus on the plane itself and pilot error.“The weather being involved probably speaks to pilot flight error, but the aircraft’s safety systems could have played a role. Investigators will need to evaluate the flight data recorder, cockpit voice recorder, and other devices, along with expert evaluation, to determine what happened,” he said.DGCA has classified certain airfields as critical that need special qualification for the flight crew to undertake operations. The criteria for classifying airfields as critical are based on various factors such as terrain, length of runway, predominance of inclement weather etc.Also read| Part of parameter wall demolished, cockpit cut open to pull out pilots: Rescuers“There are 11 such airfields, which include the tabletop runways of Mangalore, Kozhikode and Lengpui. In addition, airfields such as Patna, Jammu, Leh, Port Blair etc. also qualify as ‘critical airfields’. The operators can add some more airfields as critical, in case additional caution needs to be exercised during operations. As per SOP of Air India Express, three airfields at Mangalore, Kozhikode and Pune qualify as ‘critical airfields’. These airfields are, therefore, cleared for operations by experienced flight crew and take off and landings have to be carried out by the pilot in command (PIC) only,” said the 2010 report by Gokhale.Following the Mangalore crash, the court of Inquiry recommended setting up of an independent Indian Civil Aviation Safety Board (ICASB) urgently in view of rapid growth of aviation in the country. Such independent safety organisations have been set up in the USA, UK, Canada, France and Indonesia to name a few.The ICASB will focus on all flight safety related issues to suggest proactive measures, to minimise accidents and incidents, it said.Back then, the Civil Aviation Safety Advisory Council (CASAC), an independent aviation safety board that was set up in 2011 after the Mangalore crash, also warned authorities that the Kozhikode runway was very risky for landing during rains and harsh weather conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kozhikode-crash-puts-spotlight-on-tabletop-runway-risks/story-IgqwuD2po2V2g9FT2Q4nHK.html

It was dark and the area had been put on red alert due to heavy rain. Aslo, a lot of fuel had spilled out from the plane which could have caught fire or even cause an explosion. Despite the risk our men continued the rescue and did not step back even once,” the CASO said.However, soon the firefighters, airline staff and AAI officials arrived at the spot with emergency lights and other equipment. “The cutters and other equipment were used to cut cables and metallic body of the aircraft and make way for the rescue teams to enter the aircraft and pull out passengers safely,” he said.Kumar said, apart from the agencies, because locals had gathered on the main road, right adjacent to the perimeter wall of the airport where the plane had crashed, 20-30 civilians also voluntarily joined the rescue team.Describing the crash site, Kumar said, when they reached they could hear the passengers and children crying in pain. “Most of them were stuck between the seats and had their legs and lower body critically injured. Many had even fallen unconscious. There was a lot of luggage in the aircraft. All were pulled out with the help of medical professionals and were immediately sent to hospitals,” he said.Kumar said most challenging was to bring out the two pilots. They were both found in unconscious state. Because of the impact of the crash, cockpit cabin got separated from the rest of the aircraft and had rammed the perimeter wall of the airport. The speed of the plane must have been very high because the cockpit cabin got stuck into the wall. Luckily, we found a JCB machine on the main road across the wall. It was used to demolish a portion of the wall. The firefighters and medical staff then used equipment to cut open the body of the aircraft to pull out the two pilots. Their rescue alone took close to an hour. Their bodies were badly damaged. Both of them were rushed to the hospital without any delay,” the officer said.

So far, the infectious disease has killed 42,518 people across the country, with 933 deaths being reported on Saturday, according to data shared by the Union health ministry. The case fatality rate — the percentage of deaths among the number of cases detected — stood at 2.04% on Saturday, according to the government’s data. In comparison, the CFR in Delhi stood at 2.8%, even as it reduced from a high of 4.1% in mid-June.Two high-level meetings, chaired by Bhushan, were held on Friday and Saturday to advise and support states reporting higher number of cases and deaths due to Covid-19.“These districts account for nearly 9% of India’s active cases and about 14% of Covid-19 deaths. They also report low tests per million and high confirmation percentage... A surge has been observed in daily new cases in four districts — Kamrup Metro in Assam; Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh; and Thiruvananthapuram and Alappuzha in Kerala,” the Union health ministry said.In view of reports from some areas that patients were dying within 48 hours of being admitted to health facilities, the Union health ministry asked the states to ensure timely referral and hospitalisation of people who are diagnosed with Covid-19.While the daily numbers of deaths have risen over the recent days, India has reported one of the lowest Covid-19 mortalities compared to the total cases, with about 30 deaths per million population. The global average stands at 91 deaths per million population. The highest mortality rate has been reported by the United Kingdom, with 684 deaths per million population, followed by the US, with 475 deaths per million, according to data shared by the health ministry.

Or, it could be that most of us have been given BCG vaccine. It is a controversial topic, but perhaps studies will show whether the T-cell immunity from the vaccine is actually protective against Covid-19,” he said. On Friday, the Union health secretary also held a virtual meeting with 16 other districts in four states — Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Karnataka — reporting Covid-19 mortality higher than the national and states’ averages.Saturday’s meeting, however, focused on 13 districts in eight states and a UT. The states and the UT were advised to address the issues of low laboratory utilisation, low tests per million population, decrease in absolute tests from last week, delay in test results, and high confirmation percentage among the health care workers, the health ministry said.They were asked to ensure timely assessment and make advance preparedness for infrastructure such as ICU beds, oxygen supply and other areas based on the prevailing caseload and estimated growth rate, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/13-districts-account-for-1-in-seven-covid-19-deaths/story-Wjc89GfrkMHnVwsLiYsFMO.html

Five more legislators were flown on a chartered flight from Jaipur. BJP leaders said the Congress was trying to approach their legislators, especially those from Mewar’s tribal belt, to win their support.Also read: Six days before Rajasthan showdown, Vasundhara Raje meets Rajnath Singh“We had an input that the Congress was approaching our legislators in the Udaipur division through administrative officers and other influential people of the area. So we decided that they should all be at one place where they can be protected,” said state BJP president Satish Poonia. Another party leader said there was an effort to approach “weak legislators”.“We alerted our MLAs [members of legislative assembly] before August 6 and told them to be together,” said BJP leader Gulab Chand Kataria, who is from south Rajasthan. “The Congress government is set to fall and the party is approaching our legislators for support.

09-08-2020||India||Investigators find black box of crashed Air India Express jet, probe begins||The black box of an Air India Express jet that overshot the tabletop runway of the Calicut International Airport while arriving from Dubai, nosedived and split into two was recovered on Saturday, even as authorities launched an investigation into the worst air disaster in India in a decade that has claimed 18 lives.Civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri visited the site of the accident on Saturday to assess the situation on the ground. “It (the plane) overshot the runway while trying to land amid what were clearly inclement weather conditions prevailing at that time,” he said at a news briefing, but added that it was still too early to speculate on the cause of the crash.The Union minister said two separate teams reached Kozhikode from New Delhi to carry out investigations into the crash. Responders managed to rescue most of the passengers because the plane did not catch fire while descending the slope at the end of the runway, he added. Also read: Hardeep Puri cautions against speculative observations on Kozhikode air crashPuri said there was no question over the pilots’ competence. An official from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were recovered from the crash site on Saturday. The cockpit voice recorder keeps a recording of all the conversations taking place in a plane’s cockpit and along with the flight data recorder, which logs data such as airspeed, altitude and fuel flow, it can help in determining the cause of the crash.Air India Express AIX1344 was a repatriation flight under the Vande Bharat programme for Indians who were stranded outside the country amid travel restrictions brought on by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.On Saturday, the sample of one of the passengers who died in the accident tested positive for the infectious disease, with state health minister KK Shailaja asking all those engaged in rescue operations to go into self-quarantine as a precautionary measure and get themselves tested.Puri earlier said the passengers included 174 adult passengers, 10 children, four cabin crew and two pilots. “We were happy when we were about to touch down and I told my wife sitting beside me that rain was a welcome sign. But the happiness was short-lived. Suddenly, there were big jerks and loud cries. I tumbled out of my seat and lost consciousness. When I opened my eyes at the hospital, I was happy to see my injured wife. A pregnant woman, who was sitting next to us, was not so lucky,” said a survivor, who did not wish to be identified.Also read: As Kerala plane crash theories rise, pilots’ body makes an appeal, govt presents defenceMany people eager to see their injured relatives engaged hospital workers, who could be seen repeatedly asking them to maintain social distancing under Covid-19 prevention rules.The commander of the aircraft, Deepak Vasant Sathe, a former fighter pilot with the Indian Air Force, had 10,000 hours of flying experience on the Boeing 737 aircraft, Puri said. Out of those, he flew 6,662 hours as commander. Sathe had landed at the challenging airport 27 times, including more than 10 times this year. His co-pilot, 32-year-old Akhilesh Kumar, also had experience of 1,728 hours of flying with the aircraft.“He (Sathe) was a very accomplished, experienced, decorated person in command of the aircraft. There is absolutely no doubt over their competence,” Puri said.The minister left from Delhi to Kozhikode on Saturday morning along with two probe teams. One flight took off around 2am from Delhi, carrying investigating officers from DGCA, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), the CEO of Air India Express and other officials of the national transporter, people aware of the developments said. Another flight from Mumbai to Kozhikode took off around 6am, carrying a rescue team of Air India to provide support and assist families of those affected by the accident, they added.Air India Express is a subsidiary of state-run airline Air India.“Reached Kozhikode to take stock of the status & implementation of relief measures after the air accident last evening. Will hold consultations with senior civil aviation officials & professionals. Digital Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder of the ill-fated aircraft have been retrieved. AAIB is conducting investigations. It is very unfortunate that 18 people including the two pilots have lost their lives in this air accident. I once again offer my condolences to the families of the bereaved & wish speedy recovery to those injured,” Puri tweeted.The civil aviation ministry’s accident investigation division, AAIB, will conduct a detailed investigation into the crash. The bureau’s role is to conduct independent aircraft accident investigation and to obtain a preliminary report on the accident and assist in setting up of a committee of inquiry and formal investigation in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) rules.The so-called tabletop airport has limited space at the end of the runway, and several international airlines have stopped flying bigger aircraft into Kozhikode in the past due to safety issues over the length of the runway.Puri said that there was no need to speculate on what happened during the crash till the probe was been completed and DGCA filed an investigation report.“We will look into all the issues. Let me tell you that there are tabletop airports not just in our country, but all over the world. These airports pose a problem but then landing clearances are given based on the experience of the pilots. Let us not speculate as a full and comprehensive probe will take place,” he added.According to a route playback on flight-tracking website FlightRadar24, the plane circled the airport twice before attempting to land. In its second instance, it aborted the attempt with 2,000 feet to go.The crash has claimed at least 18 lives, including the two pilots. Air India Express on Saturday said it will provide an interim compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the family members of the deceased passengers over 12 years of age and above Rs 5 lakh to those of passengers below the age of 12. Rs 2 lakh each will be given to critically injured passengers and Rs 50,000 to other injured passengers.The Kerala government said the condition of 23 of the 149 injured undergoing treatment at various hospitals was critical while one more person succumbed on Saturday, taking the death toll to 18.According to an official document issued by the government, four of the deceased were children -- three girls and a one-year old boy -- and seven were men and other women. Two girls were aged two and the other was five.“It was raining heavily and we suddenly heard a deafening sound and the aircraft came out of the boundary wall and fell on the road. We couldn’t believe it. Soon, we heard cries for help. Smoke was billowing and there was smell of aircraft fuel also,” said Mohamad Sahal, one of the first people to reach the spot.Air India Express said the families of the deceased pilots were escorted to Kozhikode. The airline also said three relief flights had been arranged to assist passengers and their family members affected in the accident that also brought back memories of the crash of Air India Express flight IX 812 on May 22, 2010, at the Mangaluru International Airport.The flight from Dubai had overshot the runway and plunged down the cliff into a wooded valley, killing 158 people.An aviation official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that it emerged DGCA had issued a show-cause notice to the director of the Kozhikode airport on July 11 last year after it found “various critical safety lapses”. DCGA had pointed to cracks on the runway, water stagnation and excessive rubber deposits among other lapses in its show-cause notice, the official added.Safety concerns over flight operations at tabletop runways in airports were raised following the 2010 Air India Express crash in Mangaluru. A court of enquiry report by Air Marshal BN Gokhale had then noted tabletop airports required extra skill and caution while carrying out flight operations. It said that the hazard of “undershooting” and “overshooting”, in particular, can lead to grave situations, as was the case in the Mangaluru accident.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/investigators-find-black-box-of-crashed-air-india-express-jet-probe-begins/story-j57LlASTEAF9HRcAKtclCN.html
09-08-2020||India||Multi-month prescription, home delivery for uninterrupted AIDS drugs in times of Covid-19||Within days of China locking down Wuhan and other cities in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) -hit Hubei province on January 23, and India confirming its first case in Kerala on January 30, officials from UNAIDS and National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) went into a huddle in New Delhi to ensure an uninterrupted supply of HIV services, which are offered free to everyone who needs them under the national Aids control programme. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) given to people living with HIV (PLHIV) works in two critical ways -- it slows disease progression and helps PLHIVs lead productive lives, and reduces the viral load to lower disease transmission and prevent new infection. “When Covid-19 was first reported in India, we put our heads together with NACO, civil society and PLHIVs to plan for contingencies such as the Wuhan lockdown , to mitigate the impact on critical HIV services, including ART delivery and harm reduction,” said Dr Bilali Camara, Unaids Country Director for India, who is a medical epidemiologist by training. Unaids is the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS. By March, monthly dispensation of ART drugs was replaced with a three to six months supply across states. “Instead of monthly, we began giving six months provisions to people so they didn’t have to come back to a facility and risk exposure to Covid-19, or spent money on transportation etc. This was introduced by state Aids control societies across India very quickly. With treatment saturation, we can achieve a lot in terms of keeping PLHIVs health and preventing new infection,” said Dr Camara. What also helped was the introduction of a new antiretroviral drug with fewer side-effects called dolutegravir. “At the beginning of the pandemic, there was a very good policy change, when NACO introduced a much safer, less toxic drug on Unaids advice. That medication really helped people stay on treatment course, which will improve outcomes and lower their risk of developing drug resistance,” he said. There are 2.1 million people living with HIV in India, with new infections rising in Assam, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Uttarakhand, and declining in Nagaland, Manipur, Delhi and Chhattisgarh. Just eight states accounted for two-thirds of the estimated 87,580 annual new HIV infections in India in 2018. In absolute numbers, India has the third highest number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in the world after South Africa and Mozambique, but cases have hovered around 2.1 million for the past decade despite people living longer with improved access to testing and ART. Since 2010, India has reduced new infection by 37%. Delhi resident Saurabh, 41, who does not want to share his second name, is among those who benefited from the multi-month dispensation of ART drugs just before the lockdown. “I was surprised when I was given medicines for several months in March but within a week, the lockdown was announced, which meant I couldn’t step out. It was a big relief as I could continue treatment without a break,” said Saurabh, who was diagnosed with HIV in 2012. “India has accomplished reductions in new HIV infections, important reduction in AIDS-related deaths, and an increase in the number of pregnant women living with HIV on treatment, with a 66% ART coverage in 2018. This has resulted in 79% people knowing their status, and 82% of them being on treatment,” said Camara. Testing and treatment is provided free in the public sector, and costs the government US$ 70-80 per patient per year. The lockdown also invigorated the community-based dispensation drugs. “We have volunteers collect the ART drugs from the government and distribute them on motorbikes, bikes, carts, and on foot to ensure people get medicines at their doorsteps. I really have to thank all the networks of HIV and Aids in India, all of them have participated,” said Dr Camara. Opportunities to fast track the AIDS response include focusing on high burden districts for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV based on the last ANC survey data which has shown a prevalence of 0.2%., and intensifying prevention programmes, including targeted interventions for key populations such as female sex workers, (1.56% HIV prevalence), the prison populations with 2.04%, transgender (3.14%), and people who inject drugs (6.26%), according to NACO data. “Covid-19 has been a huge challenge but it has forced us to think differently. UNAIDS has worked with NACO and ministry of health to take oral substitution therapy to injecting drug users in prescribed doses for two to three months,” said Camara. Since this again was community- led, the oral substitution therapy using buprenorphine (opioid) reached injecting drug users at home as well as the homeless. “The unexpected outcome was that more and more people moved from injecting drug use to oral drug use, which is preferred because HIV infections occur from injecting drug use. So we have an opportunity to reduce risk as injecting drug use is a serious problem is in the north eastern states, and some pockets in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh,” said Dr Camara. At least 82 countries criminalise some form of HIV transmission, exposure or non-disclosure, sex work is criminalised in at least 103 countries and at least 108 countries criminalize the consumption or possession of drugs for personal use, according to UNAIDS. “There are instances drug users being put in jail, NACO data collected for the first time from jails for 2019 shows 2.04% prevalence rate which is 10 times more than the general population. Jailing drug users like criminals is not addressing the problem of drug use and Covid-19 has helped establish that overcrowded jails are not practical. Jails should be an instrument to educate and rehabilitate people,” he said. Working closely with the community for HIV service delivery and engaging them in the national AIDS response is key. “Community empowerment is essential to reduce stigma, deliver medicines and and tools for prevention, which has gone down. The increasing emphasis in treatment is needed, but not at the cost of prevention in vulnerable populations, who still account 62% of new infections in India,” said JVR Prasada Rao, former health secretary, and founder director of NACO, and special envoy at Unaids.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/multi-month-prescription-home-delivery-for-uninterrupted-aids-drugs-in-times-of-covid-19/story-2ReN6plxYzKUxVFi6aspIP.html

But 350 police personnel, from the rank of a constable to the deputy commissioner of police (DCP), are already here. Housed in different quarters, they are not allowed physical contact with the outside world. Their body temperature is measured daily, and they are checked for other symptoms of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as well. Essentially, they are in quarantine.The officials are part of the guard of honour that will be inspected by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Red Fort on August 15, the Independence Day, at a ceremony that will be attended by other dignitaries as well. “We are adopting this for the safety of every person that day. We are taking all the necessary precautions. It has been more than eight days in quarantine. Inside the complex, our officers are following all the necessary social distancing norms. No one has shown any symptoms,” a senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said. Also read: To ensure safe I Day celebrations, Covid 19 test for staff, awardees to be conductedSpecial Commissioner of Police Robin Hibu, who is overseeing the arrangements, confirmed that the officers are in quarantine but did not wish to share more details citing security reasons. Considering the high-profile nature of the event, the police establishment is leaving nothing to chance.“The 350 include all those who are connected to the ceremony for the guard of honour. We have a back up for every person. For example, we need only two parade commanders of the rank of DCP but four such officers are in quarantine. We do not want to take chances and are even keeping the reserve officers in quarantine. If somebody falls unwell (even due to a non-Covid issue), we want to ensure that even the reserve ones do not have any symptoms,” a senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said. Dr Amit Tyagi, chief medical officer of the city police’s Police Training College (PTC), said this was a necessary step. “Police personnel come from different places. Some even live outside the state and travel to work daily using public transport. Some live in barracks at the police stations. One could catch the infection anywhere. Getting them in an isolated safe place is the best for all those present that day,” he said.Also read: Rashtrapati Bhavan I-Day guest list cut to 90 peopleOne of the quarantined officers, who did not wish to be identified, said the experience of the past eight days reminded him of his life as a trainee police officer. “We are back to hostel life as bachelors and it is fun.

The officials were quarantined on Saturday for the next 14 days. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) was the first responder to the crash site at Karipur airport where the Air India Express flight from Dubai with 190 people on board overshot the table-top runway, fell into a 35-feet deep valley and broke into two killing eighteen passengers, including the two pilots of the Boeing 737 aircraft.Senior officers from the CISF said on Saturday it was discovered that one of the passengers who had died in the crashes turned out to be infected with coronavirus. “There were reports of another survivor being Covid-19 positive, however, it is yet to be ascertained. As a precautionary measure we have quarantined out personnel who were involved in rescuing these passengers,” the officer said requesting anonymity.

09-08-2020||India||Captain Deepak Sathe killed in Kerala plane crash had big plans for mother’s birthday||Former Indian Air Force pilot Captain Deepak Sathe had planned to pay a surprise visit to Nagpur on his octogenarian mother’s birthday on Saturday. However, a day before his mother could mark her 84th birthday, Sathe, 58, died in the air crash that claimed the lives of 17 others at Kerala’s Kozhikode airport. “Today is the birthday of Capt Sathe’s mother. He had last met his parents in March and was constantly in touch with them over phone since then. They had last spoken a day before yesterday,” his nephew Dr Yashodhan Sathe told PTI on Saturday. “Captain had told some of the relatives that if flights are available, he would pay a surprise visit to his mother on her birthday,” he said. Captain Sathe, who was manning the ill-fated Air India Express flight coming in from Dubai, lived with his wife in Mumbai. According to Captain Sathe’s cousin, Nilesh, he had survived an air crash in the early 1990s when he was in the Air Force. “He was hospitalised for 6 months for multiple skull injuries and nobody thought that he would fly again. But his strong will power and love for flying made him clear the test again. It was a miracle,” Nilesh wrote in a Facebook post.Captain Sathe’s mother, Neela, who lives with her husband Vasant Sathe, a retired colonel, in Bharat Nagar locality of Nagpur, said that after the coronavirus outbreak, he had told her not to step out of the house. “He used to tell me not to go out due to the pandemic. He would tell me that if something happens to me, he would feel bad. And suddenly this tragedy struck...what can we do before the will of the God,” she told PTI. She remembered him as being “top” in everything — be it studies or sports. “He was brilliant in table tennis, squash. He was also very good at horse riding. Our son had also received the rare ’Sword of Honour’. However, he would not boast about his achievements,” she said. Captain Sathe was a former Wing Commander of the IAF and had served at the force’s flight-testing establishment. Dr Yashodhan said that the body of Captain Sathe is yet to be handed over to the family. “His wife and brother-in-law are in Kozhikode, but the decision about where the last rites will be held is yet to be taken. Due to the coronavirus restrictions, we will not be able to go there,” he said. “Pilot in-command of the crashed Air India Express flight Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe, among those killed in the accident here, was one of the most experienced commanders with more than 10,000 flying hours and had landed aircraft 27 times at the Karipur airport in the past,” civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said while interacting with media on Saturday. “||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-pilot-had-big-plans-for-mother-s-birthday/story-QCUPYA5DLooT0jNYUl3IFK.html

The tragedy has struck the family at a time when Sharma’s wife Megha, 29, is expecting a child within a fortnight.The family lives in Govind Nagar locality of Mathura. “Initially, we got the news that bhaiyya (Akhilesh) was critical and hospitalizsd after the plane crash but we were later informed about his death on Friday night. My brother, Bhuvnesh, and (brother-in-law) Sanjeev Sharma have left for Kozhikode via Delhi,” said Lokesh Sharma (24), who lives in Mathura and aims to become a commercial pilot. Akhilesh was elder to Bhuvnesh, 28, works in an IT firm in Gurugram, and Lokesh, 24. Their elder sister is married. His father, Tulsi Ram Sharma, owns a business in Mathura and had come to Govind Nagar in Mathura city from his ancestral village in Mathura district. “Akhilesh studied in Amarnath College in Mathura and joined CAE Oxford Aviation Academy in Gondia (Maharashtra) to be trained as a pilot. He joined Air India in 2017. He was married to Megha in 2018, and the couple was about to have a child. But destiny snatched him from us,” said Lokesh.

09-08-2020||India||Saw the aircraft plunge towards us: CISF officer||Ajeet Singh, 31, a Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) assistant sub-inspector, was on patrolling duty at the Calicut International Airport on Friday when he heard an ear-splitting sound. As Singh turned about, he saw an aircraft at the edge of the airport’s runway as it plunged into the valley and crashed hardly 20 metres from the CISF’s security post where he was standing.The Air India Express plane, carrying 190 passengers and crew from Dubai, skidded off the tabletop runway amid heavy rain before it plunged, killing 18 people on board in India’s worst passenger aircraft accident since 2010.“I was from 1pm-9pm shift [duty] and was checking the register at our CISF security post where ASI [assistant sub-inspector] Mangal Singh was on duty. Soon, as we saw the plane plunge towards us, as an instinctive reaction, both of us ran away from the site as it appeared that the aircraft will fall on us. Seconds later, as we realised the plane was full of passengers, we ran towards it. It had [by then] broken into three pieces — tail, body, and cockpit,” Singh said.Singh, who was the first respondent at the crash site and the first rescuer to enter the damaged aircraft, said the he alerted the quick reaction teams and the CISF control room immediately. He added that they, in turn, alerted the agencies concerned — local police, Airports Authority of India (AAI), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and firefighters.“After alerting others, I entered the aircraft. The first person I pulled out safely was a senior citizen who had his legs stuck between his seat and an iron angle...I also picked up a six-month-old child and brought him out safely.” Singh added many passengers were unconscious and some crying in pain or for help. “Most of them had their bodies entangled... There were many children, even infants.”Singh said his priority was to pull out those who were still alive and could move around without assistance. He added that the aircraft fuel was flowing out heavily, and they feared it might catch fire. “But probably because it was raining heavily, the debris did not catch fire despite a lot of fuel spilled around.”“Because of the force with which the cockpit must have crashed into the wall, it was completely damaged. Probably this was the reason the two pilots could not be saved. A portion of the wall has also collapsed.”A First Information Report over the accident was filed on the basis of his statement.Also read: Kozhikode plane crash: Flight was shaking, it was a nightmare, recount survivorsAt least 50 CISF personnel, officials from Kerala police, AAI staff, firefighters, airline crew and 20-30 civilians joined the rescue operation that lasted close to three hours.Deputy commandant Kishor Kumar AV, the chief airport security officer (CASO) at the airport who led the rescue operation, acknowledged Singh’s role. “Our control room then informed all the agencies...,” Kumar said.“One of the major challenges was visibility. It was dark and the area had been put on red alert due to heavy rain. Also, a lot of fuel had spilled out from the plane, which could have caught fire; there could have even been an explosion. Despite the risk, our men continued the rescue and did not step back even once,” he said.Soon, rescue officials arrived at the spot with emergency lights and other equipment. “The cutters and other equipment were used to cut cables and metallic body of the aircraft and make way for the rescue teams to enter the aircraft and pull out passengers safely,” the deputy commander said.Kumar said most challenging was to bring out the two pilots, who were found unconscious and later declared dead.“Because of the impact of the crash, cockpit cabin got separated from the rest of the aircraft and had rammed the perimeter wall of the airport. The speed of the plane must have been very high because the cockpit cabin got stuck into the wall. We found a JCB machine on the main road across the wall. It was used to demolish a portion of the wall. The firefighters and medical staff then used equipment to cut open the body of the aircraft to pull out the two pilots. Their rescue alone took close to an hour. Their bodies were badly damaged. Both of them were rushed to the hospital without any delay,” the officer said.Special director general, CISF, MA Ganapathy said after moving all the passengers safely to hospitals, officials started taking their luggage out.“It was a mammoth task because many people on the flight were returning after year; they had a lot of luggage full of valuable like jewellery, electronics and cash. CISF, along with the local police, carefully preserved the luggage of the passengers, which will be returned to them in due time,” he said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saw-the-aircraft-plunge-towards-us-cisf-officer/story-UmX2R9xWzTRM1LUwFB2swL.html
09-08-2020||India||Kerala crash brings back memories of ’10 tragedy||Thiruvananthapuram/ New Delhi The accident involving an Air India Express plane in Kerala’s Kozhikode on Friday brought back memories of the crash of Air India Express flight IX 812 on May 22, 2010 at Mangaluru International Airport, according to experts.Back in 2010, the aircraft overshot the runway at Mangalore airport, fell into a gorge, caught fire and 158 people lost their lives. Eight persons survived the crash. In both instances, Air India Express pilots had overshot tabletop runways. Also, the flights were coming from Dubai.In its report on the Mangalore accident that happened on May 22, 2010, the Court of Inquiry said the direct cause was the captain’s failure to discontinue the unstabilised approach of the plane.Also read: Kozhikode crash puts spotlight on tabletop runway risks“Despite the constraints of terrain surrounding the tabletop runway, the rescue and fire fighthing operations had been carried out with due diligence,” the report dated October 31, 2010 said.Aviation expert Jacob Philip said:“There are many similarities between two mishaps. Both airports have similar structure and in both cases it happened during the landing. But in the latest case whether pilots were trying to save lives of passengers can be ascertained only after an inquiry.” In both cases pilot and co-pilots were among victims. Civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri, meanwhile, reiterated that an inquiry has been ordered under Aircraft Act in the Kozhikode incident. Officials said the findings will be made public as Puri encouraged all to exercise patience and refrain from making speculative observations.At the time of Mangalore crash, there was no Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), which was set up only in 2012. The AAIB is probing the Kozhikode accident.The pilot in-command of the crashed Air India Express flight, Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe, among those killed in the accident in Kozhikode, was one of the most experienced commanders with more than 10,000 flying hours and had landed aircraft 27 times at the Karipur airport in the past, Puri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crash-brings-back-memories-of-10-tragedy/story-GFAxXssu8gJ05eMCqJWcKI.html
09-08-2020||India||India, China commanders meet at Daulat Beg Oldie sector||Senior military commanders from India and China on Saturday met in the Daulat Beg Oldie sector and held talks on reducing tensions along the contested Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh, with focus on thinning the buildup of troops and weaponry in Depsang plains where the forward deployment of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army has disrupted the Indian Army’s patrolling patterns, people familiar with the developments said on the condition of anonymity.Heightened concerns about Depsang come from an earlier intrusion in this sector in 2013 when the PLA set up positions 19km into the Indian side of the LAC and triggered a face-off that took three weeks to resolve.The PLA’s forward deployments in Depsang have hindered the access of Indian soldiers to several patrolling routes including the ones leading to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11A, 12 and 13, said one of the officials cited above. The military buildup in this sector includes deployment of tanks and artillery by the two armies, said a second official.The Depsang plains lie south of DBO in a strategic area that the military calls Sub-Sector North (SSN). DBO is the country’s northernmost outpost where India operates an advanced landing ground to support its forward military deployments.“Depsang is more of a pressure point as the PLA’s reported deployment in forward areas has disrupted the Indian Army’s patrolling pattern. It has become more time consuming for the army to dominate the LAC. But as long as talks are on there is hope for a mutually acceptable solution to the dispute,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations.The latest round of military talks between division commander-ranked officers came days after their bosses (the corps commanders) met on August 2 to discuss the next stage of disengagement at a time when negotiations have hit a roadblock due to differences between the two sides in the Finger Area and the PLA’s reluctance to vacate positions held by it in what New Delhi claims as Indian territory.The outcome of Saturday’s talks wasn’t immediately known as there was no official word from the army.The division commander-ranked officers have met a few times after the border row erupted in early May, but this was their first meeting after the corps commanders from the two sides began discussions on disengagement and de-escalation on June 6. The latter have met five times so far.The Finger Area — a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range overlooking the Pangong Lake — has emerged as the hardest part of the disengagement process with little hope of immediate resolution.The August 2 military negotiations came three days after Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong said his country’s traditional boundary line on the northern bank of the Pangong Lake was in accordance with the LAC and there was no case of Beijing expanding its territorial claim.The ambassador’s contention was a clear indication of the Chinese hard line on its claims in the Finger area, the officials said.The meeting began at 11 am on the Chinese side of LAC and went on till 7.30pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-commanders-meet-at-daulat-beg-oldie-sector/story-gq2qH3FY0PWrVfLxzIC2oN.html
09-08-2020||India||India, China need to reach an equilibrium: S Jaishankar||India and China can overcome their differences in the long term if they reach “some kind of equilibrium” but achieving this is one of the big challenges faced by the country, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Saturday.Jaishankar made the remarks while participating in an interactive session organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) as part of its “India@75 Summit - Mission 2022” initiative. The event looks ahead at India in its 75th year of independence in 2022 and seeks to bring together stakeholders such as industry and government to work on a vision.Replying to a question on whether India and China, which are currently engaged in a tense border stand-off, could be friends in the coming decades, Jaishankar said the two countries are neighbours and demographically unique as they are the only ones with populations of more than one billion.China is the world’s second largest economy and India is set to become the third largest, and the period of their difficulties and the period of their “re-emergence in a very strong way in international politics” were not far apart, he said. “We are seeing the parallel but differential rise of the two countries... To my mind, what it does is it puts a huge premium on reaching some kind of equilibrium or understanding between the two [in the interests of both countries]. How to do that is one of the big challenges that we face,” Jaishankar said. The border stand-off, which emerged in May, has taken India-China relations to a new low. Both countries have mobilised tens of thousands of troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), especially in the Ladakh sector, after a brutal clash on June 15 caused the death of 20 Indian soldiers and unspecified Chinese casualties. Efforts to disengage and de-escalate the tensions have run into problems as the Chinese side hasn’t pulled back its troops at several key friction points along the LAC, such as Pangong Lake and Depsang.Jaishankar said he believes the world “has a lot riding on” India and China reaching equilibrium, given the size and impact of both countries. “It is not an easy question to answer, there are problems [that are] well laid out. Certainly, it’s something which I feel is very central to our foreign policy calculations,” he said.He said a good foreign policy is one that addresses national and economic security and advances the country’s goals and aspirations in a competitive environment. Such a policy depends on skill and agility to build “capabilities strongly, deeply [and] much faster”, he added.In this regard, Jaishankar held up China as a “remarkable example of our lifetime” and pointed out that India, too, is doing its bit by weighing in on big issues such as climate change and shaping big debates on matters such as terrorism.Jaishankar also said India’s approach was based more on issues as the country is now dealing with a “much more loose architecture” with more poles and less rules, where overlapping interests are a key factor in working with other nations.“The country which is able to navigate best by finding overlapping interests and working with most countries is going to be very successful in diplomacy,” he said, adding that this would mean a country has to be less dogmatic and less dependent on global chains and global sources while striving for strategic autonomy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-need-to-reach-an-equilibrium-jaishankar/story-0UsvyyWI9xbNrelcTzgQtM.html
09-08-2020||India||Conditions were not conducive for landing: Civil aviation expert||Civil aviation expert Captain Mohan Ranganathan believes that the pilot of the Air India Boeing 737, a Covid-19 evacuation flight from Dubai that crashed on Friday, should have diverted to Coimbatore as the conditions in Kozhikode were not conducive for landing. “The visibility was fine,” said Ranganathan. “But due to the torrential downpour, it was not prudent to land in Kozhikode. The pilot should have diverted to Coimbatore.” Ranganathan, an aviation safety consultant and a former instructor pilot of the Boeing 737 specialising in wet runway operations, added that he was surprised that aviation regulator DGCA gave permission to the flight to land there. Also read: Pilots explain what poses the challenge in wake of the Kozhikode crash“The runway is not safe,” said Ranganathan. “From what I have heard, not much has changed since I was there last. It is fortunate that a 737 was landing and not a wide body flight.” According to Ranganathan, he warned authorities a year after the 2010 Mangalore crash that the Calicut runway was unsafe for landing and needed to be re-evaluated, but his message was ignored. “It is a dangerous situation, especially in wet conditions. Runway 10 approaches should not be permitted in view of the lack of RESA (runway end safety area) and the terrain beyond the end of the runway,” Ranganathan said in his report submitted 17 June 2011. He was then a member of the operations group of the Civil Aviation Safety Advisory Committee (CASAC). “... in spite of the danger if the crew accept a landing in wet and tailwind conditions, their concept of ALAR (Approach and Landing Accident Reduction) is very poor,” he said in the communication. On Saturday, Ranganathan added that a 240m RESA should immediately be introduced and the runway length should be reduced to make operations “safe”. “There should 150m on either side to avoid mishaps,” Ranganathan told HT. “But there is not sufficient area there. It has always been dangerous.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conditions-were-not-conducive-for-landing-civil-aviation-expert/story-CZ7Vp2uwbrhfySgmxtGlmL.html
09-08-2020||India||IMD warns of heavy rains across northwest region||India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday issued an orange category warning, which means disaster management authorities should be prepared to avert any possible disasters, for parts of northwestern India for Sunday and Monday as the monsoon trough is likely to shift northwards and cause heavy to very heavy rain in Uttarakhand, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, western Uttar Pradesh, eastern Rajasthan.Rainfall activity over northwestern India is likely to increase from Sunday and heavy to very heavy rainfall is expected at isolated places in the Western Himalayan region over the next two days.Extremely heavy rains continued on Friday and Saturday in Kerala, where a red category warning has been issued for the weekend. A red warning implies disaster management authorities need to act immediately to control or prevent any rain or flooding disaster. Heavy rains triggered a landslide in Kerala’s Idukki district on Friday and left at least 15 people dead.Also read: Red alert sounded for five districts as Kerala battles flood-like situation, more rains till SundayTorrential rains triggered floods and landslides in the Western Ghats in Kerala in 2018 and 2019 and left hundreds dead. The entire Western Ghats mountain range, which stretches from Kerala to Gujarat, is extremely vulnerable to disasters because of its topography and increasing incidence of extreme rains linked to global warming.National Weather Forecasting Centre senior scientist RK Jenamani said strong westerly and south-westerly winds from the Arabian Sea hit the Western Ghats perpendicularly. “The low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal strengthened the monsoon winds. Monsoon is a large-scale system of winds and moisture surge. The west coast is definitely vulnerable but the incidence of extreme rain is increasing across the country in recent years.”Devala in Tamil Nadu and Kerala’s Vadakara recorded 34 cm and 33 cm from Friday to Saturday.IMD director general M Mohapatra said extremely heavy rains were likely to continue in many places in Kerala till Monday. “When the warm westerly winds hit the hills, the ghat areas there are uplifting that air. It is called orographic uplifting. The warm air condenses and forms clouds. The formation of convective clouds leads to extremely heavy rain,” he said. He added Kerala has been recording deficient monsoon rains over the long term but there has also been an increase in the incidence of extreme rainfall events.A fresh low-pressure area is likely to form over north and adjoining west-central Bay of Bengal by Sunday. Under its influence, more rain is likely over east and adjoining parts of central India and heavy to very heavy rainfall in Odisha from Sunday to Tuesday and in Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh from Monday to Wednesday.Also read: Swollen rivers, flood-like situation in several parts of Karnataka due to heavy rainfallAccording to a Union earth sciences ministry report, there has been a significant rising trend in the frequency and intensity of extremely heavy rain events over central India from 1950 and a decreasing trend in the moderate rain events. Compared to the 1901–1975 period, rainfall has reduced by 1–5 mm/day during 1976–2015 over central parts of India (the core monsoon zone), Kerala, and extreme northeastern parts, it added.An Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology study published in Nature journal in 2017 said there has been a three-fold rise in extreme rains along the west coast and central India from 1950 to 2015.“I cannot comment on each station, but overall studies have shown that incidence of extremely heavy rain along the west coast is increasing due to the impact of global warming,” said Mohapatra.“Monsoon trough (line of low pressure) is likely to shift northward and will continue to pass close to Delhi NCR during evening of August 9 to 12. During this period south westerly winds from Arabian sea and easterly winds from Bay of Bengal will reach to Haryana, Delhi NCR and west UP in lower levels.A cyclonic circulation will also form and persist over Madhya Pradesh and adjoining Uttar Pradesh during the same period. Delhi is likely to get moderate category rain during the period,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-warns-of-heavy-rain-across-northwest-region/story-sMORCmgFcTBEXwfcxf1SIO.html

He told his relatives and friends back home that he and his family will be coming back to the country. They never imagined that will be his last journey.A social worker among the expatriate community in Dubai, he insisted that he will go back once the rush subsided, his friends recalled.Four hours before the accident, he posted a photo with his family in protective shields and masks. “Back to Home,” he wrote on his Facebook. Several passengers part of the flight from Dubai to Kozhikode had cited loss of jobs as the reason to travel back home, according to their repatriation flight list reviewed by HT. A large number of workers based in the Gulf have lost their jobs due to the pandemic. Parammal Afsal, 27, who works at a hotel in Dubai, has a different story. When he arrived at the airport to board the Kozhikode-bound flight on Friday, he realised that his visa period had expired — by a few hours.Airport authorities asked him to produce his employment details and other formalities. He immediately rushed to procure them from his room, but by the time he was returned, the boarding process was over. But that proved a blessing for Afsal. He was planning to return for his wedding, which was fixed last year. Now, he is planning to take next flight to Kannur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/friends-mourn-social-worker-man-who-missed-flight-thanks-his-stars/story-GX4J6R5DlYr3mdhBzzSGIO.html
09-08-2020||India||Pilots explain what poses the challenge in wake of the Kozhikode crash||Pilots on Saturday underscored the challenges posed by tabletop runways in the wake of the deadly Kozhikode crash, explaining why they can be tricky.The most obvious challenge of a tabletop runway, a commercial pilot said, is the fact that on a normal runway if you run out of runway, you would still be on the ground. “On a tabletop runway, you may find yourself on the ground several hundred feet below,” he said.A second pilot, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said tabletop runways, located on plateaus or hills, can also create optical illusions for pilots when they move from the instruments to the visual segment of the flight especially during bad weather. “It can be tricky as the pilot may get the illusion of not being on the correct flight profile. Add-ons like heavy rain, wet runway, and pilot fatigue can complicate things further.”Also read| Kozhikode plane crash: Chaos, screams at accident site as locals rush to rescueSeveral international airlines stopped flying bigger aircraft to Kozhikode due to safety issues given the length of its runway as tabletop airports have limited space at their ends. But pilots flying smaller aircraft are not immune to the hazards either. “The runway is at a height, which is higher than the surrounding areas and the weather conditions also differ. Sudden changes in wind pattern on approach is a common phenomenon which a pilot has to tackle. On an approach till such time you hit the table-top, you may be under the influence of some winds which vary suddenly when you reach the table making the approach management that much more difficult,” said a third pilot, who did not wish to be named.Possible variation in instrument reading when the transition on the table-top happens is another key challenge. “For example, the radio altimeter, which calls out the height of the aircraft, may call out 500 feet and a second later may call out 100 feet because you have entered the table zone. This transition to the table-top is also when the winds may change which at times becomes a little tricky to manage,” the third pilot said. The degree of difficulty increases multifold during the monsoons, the pilot added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilots-explain-what-poses-the-challenge/story-o0Lfn0fGsq1PWdGCpakznJ.html
09-08-2020||India||Sushant Singh Rajput death probe: CBI acted in ‘haste’, Mumbai Police tells SC||The First Information Report (FIR) lodged by the Bihar police in connection with actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death on a complaint filed by his father is politically motivated at the instance of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, the Mumbai police said in an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court on Saturday.The affidavit added the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has shown “indecent haste” in lodging a fresh FIR on the recommendation from the Bihar government and in constituting a team to probe abetment of suicide charge against Rajput’s girlfriend, Chakraborty Rhea, her family members, and two friends. It insisted the CBI FIR is without “legal sanctity” as it was filed without the consent of Maharashtra, which alone is entitled to give consent and not Bihar.“The indecent haste with which the CBI has proceeded in this regard, speaks for itself, regarding the bonafides of all involved in this exercise,” said the affidavit filed through advocate Sachin Patil.Bihar government and police officials were not immediately available for comments.The affidavit was filed days before the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear Chakraborty’s plea on Tuesday seeking the transfer of the FIR lodged in Patna to Mumbai.Rajput’s father, KK Singh, separately filed his reply in the apex court terming Chakraborty’s petition “infructuous” as CBI has taken over the case. Singh accused the Mumbai police of inaction and questioned why even after 54 days of inquiry, no FIR was registered. “If the respondent No.3 [Maharashtra] has found no evidence qua the petitioner [Chakraborty ] in 54 days of inquiry, it only reflects one conclusion that the Respondent No.3 is trying to shield the Petitioner for the reason best known to them,” Singh said in his affidavit through senior advocate Vikas Singh.The Mumbai police wondered why Singh did not approach them for registering FIR against Chakraborty and her family members. It added at best, the Bihar police ought to have registered a Zero FIR and transferred the same to Mumbai police seized of an inquiry into Rajput’s death.“The registration of the FIR.... [in] Bihar was politically motivated and due to extraneous reasons,” the Mumbai police said. It cited a newspaper report saying while the Bihar police were hesitant to file FIR, it was Kumar and another minister who persuaded them to register it.Commenting on Bihar’s decision to recommend the CBI probe, the Mumbai Police said it “bristles with malafides and same is void ab initio.” Such a thing could lead to a “chaotic situation” as the accused or complainant would then choose their own state police to initiate an investigation into a case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-death-probe-cbi-acted-in-haste-mum-police-to-sc/story-aZZBAnSnoniy3e0Hocl3nN.html

It all happened in a flash. Just when they thought they had reached home, their plane fell into a 35-feet gorge in pelting rain, survivors of the crash said on Saturday.Also read: Hardeep Puri cautions against speculative observations on Kozhikode air crash“We were happy when were about to touchdown and I told my wife that the rain was a welcome sign. But our joy was short-lived. Suddenly there were big jerks and the plane was filled with loud cries. I tumbled out of my seat and lost conscious. When I opened my eyes at the hospital, I was happy to see my wife. A pregnant woman, who was sitting beside us, was not so lucky,” said a person who did not want to be named.Those who survived the accident said chaos prevailed at the accident site as initially passengers could not gauge what happened. “We did not realise what really happened other than the flight was shaking,” said Ramshad, who was undergoing treatment at a local hospital in Malappuram district. His wife and daughter escaped with minor injuries. “As soon the flight crashed, the emergency door was opened and people jumped out to safety, another survivor said. Vijaymohan, who escaped with minor injuries and is recovering in a private hospital, said he thought it was a nightmare. “I could see heaps of twisted metal spread around when I opened my eyes after the initial shock of the impact,” said Vijayamohan, a resident of nearby Malaparamba.

09-08-2020||India||6 BSP MLAs move Supreme Court for plea transfer||Six Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) lawmakers, who in 2019 merged with the ruling Congress in Rajasthan, moved the Supreme Court on Saturday seeking the transfer of a disqualification petition pending before the Rajasthan high court against them over the defection to the apex court.Rajasthan assembly speaker C P Joshi approved the merger a day after the six joined the Congress and prompted opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to seek their disqualification in February. Joshi on July 30 rejected the BJP’s disqualification petition.The high court sought replies of Joshi and the six lawmakers by August 11 after BJP lawmaker Madan Dilawar moved the court against the speaker’s order.“The entire basis for the petition [by Dilawar] pending before the high court is that there has been no merger between the BSP and the Congress. It is submitted that the speaker of the legislature, while acting under Paragraph 4 [Constitution’s 10th Schedule], is not concerned with the happenings outside the legislature, so long as two-thirds of the legislature party (ie members of a party within the assembly) has accepted the merger,” the six said in their plea.The 10th Schedule contains provisions relating to the disqualification of lawmakers for defection. One of the grounds for disqualification as per paragraph 2 of the schedule is voluntarily giving up membership of a political party on whose ticket a lawmaker is elected. According to paragraph 4, when two-third members of a political party merge with another political party, they are immune to disqualification.The six pleaded BSP’s entire legislative party merged with the Congress and therefore, the condition laid down in paragraph 4 is met and does not attract disqualification.The petitioners sought the transfer of the petition as the issues raised in it are under the Supreme Court’s consideration in another--Mithou Krose--case from Assam. The Mithou Krose case relates to an appeal against a 2015 Gauhati high court judgment, which said the only requirement under paragraph 4 is the merger of the legislature party and there is no requirement of the merger of parent political party.“There is an urgent need to clarify the law in respect to the scope of paragraph 4 of the 10th schedule to ensure that there are no conflicting judgments,” the petitioners said, seeking the transfer.“Therefore, the present transfer petition is being moved so that there may be a uniform interpretation of the law,” the six said in their plea filed through advocate Amit Pai.The six lawmakers are crucial to chief minister Ashok Gehlot as he faces a revolt by his former deputy, Sachin Pilot, and 18 Congress lawmakers supporting him. The Gehlot camp has claimed support of 101 legislators in the 200-member assembly. The BJP has 72 members in the House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-bjp-shifts-17-of-its-mlas-to-gujarat/story-W3FjcwecnZyZ42Q70269fO.html
09-08-2020||India||Punjab Congress seeks action against MPs Bajwa, Dullo||Congress’s Punjab unit has recommended disciplinary action against Rajya Sabha members Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo for their alleged “anti-party activities and using derogatory language” against chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and state party chief Sunil Jakhar, people familiar with the matter said.The recommendation, in form of letter, has been sent to the party’s central disciplinary action committee headed by former defence minister AK Antony and comprising veteran leaders Motilal Vora and Sushil Kumar Shinde, and also Congress president Sonia Gandhi.Bajwa and Dullo have stepped up their attacks against the chief minister and Jakhar following the recent hooch tragedy in which over 100 people were killed. They have demanded their removal over alleged failure to check the liquor mafia’s nexus.Bajwa has claimed the removal of Singh and Jakhar will be in the interest of the party, which otherwise will be obliterated in Punjab.A Congress functionary said on the condition of anonymity that the state unit has attached video clips of Bajwa’s alleged “utterances” against the chief minister and Jakhar during his recent interactions with journalists.A joint letter written by Bajwa and Dullo to Punjab governor V P Singh Badnore, seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate into the alleged “illegal” liquor trade in the state, has also been attached, he added.“Whatever grievances they had, the two leaders should have written directly to the party high command and not the governor against their own government. This is gross indiscipline and a clear cut case of anti-party activities,” said the functionary quoted above.The central disciplinary committee will now look into the matter and decide accordingly, he added.Soon after Bajwa and Dullo met the governor, the Punjab unit recommended their expulsion from the party. It was followed up by Jakhar’s letter to Gandhi, demanding the removal of Bajwa and Dullo from the party for “breach of discipline and also the betrayal of the Congress”.Congress’ in-charge of Punjab affairs, Asha Kumari, has asked all state leaders to refrain from making public comments and instead raise their issues at party platforms.She said the Congress high command is aware of the matter and will take whatever action is required.On Saturday, the Punjab government also decided to withdraw the state police security given to Bajwa, claiming that he did not face any threat.A Punjab government spokesperson said the decision was taken following an assessment that there was no threat perception to him and that he was already provided with security cover by the Centre.The state police security provided to Bajwa had become redundant since he had managed personal security directly from home minister Amit Shah, the spokesperson added.Bajwa said he and Dullo are firm on their demand for the removal of the chief minister and Jakhar and that they will also present their views to the central disciplinary panel.“Both Captain Amarinder and Jakhar are mixed up with the BJP and the Akali Dal. A very senior bureaucrat in the Modi government is calling the shots in the Captain Amarinder Singh government. Now the time has come for the Congress high command to decide if it wants the state leadership to remain in the party or is outsourced to the BJP,” he said.“Action should be taken against them rather us. We are actually trying to safeguard the party’s interests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cong-seeks-action-against-mps-bajwa-dullo/story-qfKg3NqNAw5TOb4xMStBEP.html
09-08-2020||India||Swachh Bharat has played key role in Covid fight: PM Modi||New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday that Centre’s flagship Swachh Bharat mission, a nationwide campaign to eliminate open defecation and improve solid waste management, has played a key role in the fight against coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Launching a week-long garbage-free India campaign in the run up to Independence Day, called Gandagi Mukt Bharat, the Prime Minister said: “Imagine the situation if a Covid-19-like pandemic had hit us before 2014. Due to lack of toilets, could we have checked the spread of the infection? Would lockdown been possible when 60% of the population was forced to defecate in open?” the PM said. He also launched the Rashtriya Swachhata Kendra, an interactive experience centre on the Swachh Bharat Mission at the Gandhi Smriti and Darshan Samiti at Rajghat. In his speech, Modi urged children, who attended the event, to follow social distancing norms and wear masks to guard against coronavirus.The PM also urged officials at the district level to construct toilets in all the villages and to repair the existing facilities during the week.He said areas where migrant workers are residing should get priority. “Together, we have to move forward ... preparing compost out of dirt, water recycling, getting rid of single-use plastic,” he said.Highlighting that August 8 is the anniversary of Quit India Movement, a drive launched by Mahatma Gandhi demanding an end to the British rule in India, Modi said that all should work towards ensuring that things that weaken the country quit India. “Poverty, compulsion to defecate in open, single-use plastic, discrimination, terror and violence, corruption, finding water with great difficulty have to quit India,” he said. Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi evoked the clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers at Pangong Tso to take a dig at the PM. “…We have to take an extra step and also clean the dirt of falsehood. Will the PM tell the truth of the Chinese attack to the nation and kick-start this satyagraha?” he tweeted in Hindi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swachh-bharat-has-played-key-role-in-covid-fight-pm/story-yDKgXlJhUt8OUQmIwK2JlI.html
09-08-2020||India||Audits more focused now: Outgoing CAG Rajiv Mehrishi||Retired IAS officer Rajiv Mehrishi, who demitted the office of Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) on Friday, said that there has been a radical shift in the way the government’s auditor now works with its reports being more substantive and focused, and there being no “roving or fishing enquiries”. “We are a large ship and it takes time to turn. But some steps have been taken. If you look at CAG reports now, they are extremely meaningful,” Mehrishi, who headed the constitutional body for almost three years (from September 2017 till Friday), said. G C Murmu, who was Lt Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, will take over as the new CAG on Saturday. Detailing how CAG now focuses on specific audits rather than going into policy issues or coming up with headline-making figures, Mehrishi said : “Take the example of performance audits (examining performance of government departments in accordance with principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness), which makes for the most interesting reading. What we were doing was in a dissipated and non-focused manner. The idea (now) is to get them to focus on issues and try to answer those issues”. His reference is to outcome-based audits . Mehrishi cited the example of CAG’s audit of Uttar Pradesh’s hospitals in December, in which it focused on specific issues such as the infant mortality data and the nurse to bed ratio. The audit body has also initiated the practice of engaging domain experts from various institutions,such as the Indian Institutes of Technology and the Indian Institutes of Management, so that there is “quality control” in writing the reports. Mehrishi said that CAG took help of a doctor while finalizing the audit report on UP hospitals. Similarly, IIT Delhi’s help was taken by CAG for a report on Delhi Metro.  CAG is also working on making its audit reports “shorter” and more accessible so that the general public can read and understand them. “The long reports are difficult to read.” Mehrishi also confirmed that CAG plans to conduct an audit of the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme of the government with a focus on coverage (establishing correspondence between beneficiaries and benefits), efficiency, and design of payment process. The audit will also look at the outcomes. DBT is a scheme of government to transfer the benefits and subsidies of various social welfare schemes directly to the bank account of the beneficiary. Other officials in CAG, who didn’t wish to be named, said that a team of CAG visited Geneva last month to audit the World Health Organization (WHO). Mehrishi was elected as the external auditor of WHO in June 2019 for four years. Murmu will now take over the proceedings.CAG also plans to conduct an audit on the availability of drugs, medicines and equipment in all government medical institutions throughout the country, in which it will include procurement of Covid-19 equipments/medicines as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/audits-more-focused-now-outgoing-cag/story-Mo5aquTClQopwcVELg6b0O.html
09-08-2020||Today's||How China gamed the multilateral trading system | Opinion||China, which was a founding member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1948, pulled out of it in 1950 for political reasons. By the time the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations was launched in 1986, China became an “observer” of GATT with the express purpose of re-joining the multilateral trading system. Interestingly, Hong Kong acquired membership of GATT as a separate customs territory in 1986 and to this day enjoys full membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO) as “Hong Kong, China”. It is also worth noting that Taiwan has been a full member of the WTO from 2002 onwards with the appellation: Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu or quite simply “Chinese Taipei”. But it is mainland China’s journey in the GATT and subsequently the WTO that should interest all of us. Every country that desires membership of the WTO has to conduct what is known as “accession” negotiations. Essentially, it means that the applicant country has to painstakingly negotiate with each and every WTO member on its trade concessions with regard to Goods, Services and Intellectual Property Rights. The decision to admit a country to the WTO is not just based on trade issues alone; it is also enormously political. The period of accession negotiations for countries usually ranges from 4 to 5 years. In China’s case, the period of accession lasted nearly 15 years. China, having been an observer in the GATT from 1986, became a full member of WTO at the Doha Ministerial Conference in 2001. Normally, when a country joins the WTO, it must ensure the conformity of its laws, regulations and administrative procedures with its WTO obligations. In the case of China, such an undertaking alone was not considered enough for two reasons: one, there was lack of trust between the major players of WTO led by the US on the one hand and China on the other; two, the “ hybrid state capitalist” model followed by China was not something the WTO Rules were framed for. The decision to admit China was based on the following assumptions:• It was better to have a country like China within the system rather than without;• Membership of the WTO would enable China to shed the “hybrid state capitalist” model and become an open free market economy; and• The political reasoning of countries led by the US was also that economic liberalisation in China will inevitably, over time, lead to democratic change.Keeping the above in mind, a special Protocol of Accession was signed between the WTO Membership and China in 2001.The main obligations for China in this Agreement were:• In the case of domestic laws, regulations and administrative procedures, the Agreement enjoins transparency, uniform application of law and judicial review;• China to be treated as a non-market economy for fifteen years;• China to fully liberalise trade in services in due course;• Full compliance with TRIPS (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement of the WTO; and • Reduce and/or eliminate subsidies to State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and a pledge by China that SOEs will run on a commercial basis.On the all-important aspect of transparency and uniform application of law, it is well known that the Chinese trade policy regime is characterised by remarkable opacity. For instance, China has not provided a full and complete list of subsides provided by the Federal government let alone those provided by its provincial governments. On trade in services, it is well known that China does not allow foreign payment companies such as Mastercard and Visa and instead favours China Union Pay which dominates the domestic market. Chinese banking sector is pretty much closed to foreign players too. Again, in the case of the digital and data economy, the Chinese strategy is the same: disallow foreign companies such as Google, Amazon, Twitter, Facebook etc and allow Alibaba and Tencent to dominate the market. With Telecom services, it is the same story: the domestic company Huawei is ubiquitous. The two areas of real concern are IPRs and SOEs. In both these crucial areas, US and some other key WTO players are furious about Chinese non-compliance with the Protocol of Accession. In the case of IPRs, the Americans have long complained about forced technology transfer and IP theft by China. These are well detailed in the US Section 301 report on China. Perhaps the most disturbing thing from a free market perspective is the role of state-owned enterprises in China’s trade policy. There is evidence that between 2001 and 2003 there was some effort by China to reduce the role of SOEs in the economy. But there is incontrovertible evidence that over the last five years, the role of SOEs has increased significantly in the Chinese economy. The above outlines the classic saga of how China has gamed the multilateral trading system for its own benefit. It is now safe to conclude that the original assumptions about China’s entry into the WTO were fundamentally flawed.

09-08-2020||Editorials||Develop a vaccine plan | HT Editorial||After nearly 20 million infections, 730,000 deaths and half-a-year of living with Covid-19, it is clear that vaccines are the strongest bet for the world to emerge out of the pandemic. The scientific community has given us six promising candidates. They are tearing through a process of trials, involving tens of thousands of people, generating reams of data, to prove they are a safe and effective bet — so much so that some of the biggest economies have put billions of dollars worth of wagers on them. India is yet to count as one of these nations. India’s seeming reluctance with pledging money at this point to any of the candidates is backed by some economic and scientific wisdom: Vaccines take years to develop, and seven months is too short a time to commit millions of dollars for a country with stretched coffers. Officials have hinted that the country was looking at multilateral mechanisms such as the World Health Organization-led Covax facility to help secure supplies. But such a mechanism — designed as it is to ensure distribution is equitable across the world — will be able to supply only a fraction of India’s requirement in the immediate term.Last week, the government appeared to recognise the need to step up focus on its vaccine plan, forming an expert committee to identify viable candidates, put in place a financing and purchase strategy, and lay down a road map of administering it to the Indian public. The first step of this will involve opening bilateral discussions with developers such as AstraZeneca, Moderna, Pfizer and others which have the most promising candidates yet. These are also companies on which the United States (US), United Kingdom and some European nations have bet millions of dollars (the US alone has pledged nearly $4 billion). The deals won’t be easy; India will need to negotiate the lowest of the rates and secure supply commitment for the largest of volumes.Once that is taken care of, the authorities will face the challenge of identifying those who will get the shots at the soonest. Health workers are an obvious first choice, but beyond that lie complicated equations determined by factors such as age, profession, geography and economic class. It will also involve mobilisation of its formidable grassroots staff, but they are already the most prepared, working tirelessly to carry out the process of testing and contact tracing. It is important, then, that India begins taking the first step, of securing supplies, at the soonest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/develop-a-vaccine-plan/story-5yivxzDeduuzwy7e005QyH.html
