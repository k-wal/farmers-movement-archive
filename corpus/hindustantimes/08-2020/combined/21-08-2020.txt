The goal of universalisation of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) and the focus on achieving universal foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN) is especially laudable. The challenge now lies in translating policy into action on the ground at scale. Most policy suggestions are not new — several state governments have been trying hard to implement such reforms. However, the lack of consistent political will and the slow pace of adopting emerging technologies have stymied these efforts. We know how to educate children, as is evident in elite schools — our inability to do so for all children is due to the failure in understanding the role of politics and technology. How are parents, from less-privileged backgrounds, expected to understand the value of the current reforms such as curriculum overhaul, teacher-training or activity-based learning in schools? These are all hidden behind school walls, parents are not involved, and the visible impact of better education manifests later in life. As a result, the public-school system has lost the perception battle to the private system. The latter takes huge pains to dazzle their most critical constituency — parents — through fancy brochures or computer labs. Public educators tend to be poor publicists. Unfortunately, NEP ignores the political-economy aspects of education and the critical need to involve the parent as a teacher and voter. Parents are only mentioned 25 times, as compared to 221 mentions for teachers. The opaqueness of progress and lack of value realisation by the constituents is why politicians across the spectrum have, in turn, not paid attention to education, as compared to other sectors such as infrastructure and skills training. Education reform attempts come and go, based on the whims and fancies of officials and their unpredictable tenures.Even beyond political incentives, it is vital that parents are involved directly in the learning process of their children. Such home effects have been shown to be key drivers of learning outcomes. Parent and community engagement is not just a political carrot, but also essential for the child’s progress. Models designed to include teachers as key facilitators for parent interactions also increase community respect for teachers, another key objective of the NEP. Across the board, teachers are motivated by how parents value them more, realise the positive things happening in school, and express their admiration for their efforts — in comparison even to private schools.Recently, we see that, when parents notice education improvements, it translates into political popularity — Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh are all early examples. In this context, governments and politicians will only do the hard slog to translate NEP into reality if their efforts are easily visible and impressive to parents, a key voting bloc.A natural question is, how? How can we bring parents on board and achieve universal FLN throughout India? How can government achieve this scale with a high Return on Investment (ROI)?The answer has been staring us in the face all along — the digital revolution. India is expected to have 820 million smartphone users by 2022 and, for the first time, India has more rural Internet users than urban. This is the time to use these tail winds and adopt innovative low-tech to enable school-home connections and engage parents where they are.Specifically, school systems need to leverage technology and mass media communication to show parents daily and directly that they are investing in their children’s success, and that the child is actually learning. Technology can play a key role in bringing about this behavioural change by implementing the Aspiration, Information & Measurement (AIM) framework. We can use social media platforms such as Facebook and Youtube to bring about awareness, we can leverage messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram to disseminate educational content to learning communities, and we can use Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data to measure these learning outcomes at scale. The possibilities are endless. Now is the time to commit to an approach spearheaded by technology and digital India.There is evidence of the effectiveness and high ROI for tech-enabled information interventions. Many research studies have shown that low-cost interventions such as text message nudge the learning process along. In our organisation, Rocket Learning, we have seen that tech- and media-enabled models of leveraging government infrastructure to build parental aspiration, information gateways and, social motivation have led to up to 80% of parents conducting learning activities with children on a regular basis district-wide. The writing on the wall is clear — for the system to change for the long-term, we need initiatives and technology that achieve both educational and political success, as was the case with the midday meal scheme. It is imperative that the recently announced FLN mission, which builds on NEP, both addresses the political economy problem and adopts technology quickly to achieve universal ECCE. It must be accompanied by a national mass media and social media campaign that specifically targets communities, as in Swachh Bharat or Skill India. The mission must create a virtuous cycle of governments pulling parents along and vice versa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/nep-ignores-a-key-aspect-the-critical-role-of-parents/story-D7xz9HlFBSsCuBBXe6kYdJ.html
21-08-2020||Delhi||DU entrance exams notified, to be held from September 6 to 11||Over 220,000 aspirants who are to appear for Delhi University Entrance Tests (DUET) to get admitted to DU’s various undergraduate, postgraduate, and MPhil/PhD courses will do so between September 6 and 11, as per the examination schedule released by the National Testing Agency (NTA) on Friday. “Keeping in view the academic interest of a large number of students, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) has agreed to the proposal of MHRD (now MoE) for conducting various entrance examinations in the month of September 2020,” NTA said in the public notice. The central government body has been conducting entrance tests for DU for since 2019. Earlier this week, the Supreme Court had rejected a plea seeking to postpone the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) and National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), which are also slated to be conducted by NTA in September. DU conducts entrance tests for all postgraduate courses and nine undergraduate courses, including BA (Honours) Humanities and Social Sciences, BA (Honours) Multimedia and Mass Communication, and BTech IT & Mathematical Innovations. Varsity officials said around 140,000 students had applied for the entrance tests to various postgraduate courses while approximately 70,000 had applied for the nine entrance-based undergraduate courses. Around 14,000 students have applied for MPhil and PhD programmes. According to the bulletin on NTA’s website, entrance tests will be conducted across 24 cities, including Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Jaipur, Patna, Chennai and Mumbai. “The exams will be conducted online but the students will have to go to the test centres. It will be similar to how JEE exams are conducted. In a day or two, students will receive their admit cards as well,” a senior DU official, requesting anonymity, said. “Hand-held metal detectors will be used for frisking candidates while maintaining a distance. These will be sanitised at regular intervals. Admit cards will have specific barcodes which will be scanned and rooms will be allotted to students accordingly,” Vineet Joshi, director general, NTA, said. “We have prepared a standard operating protocol that will be followed to ensure safety,” Joshi said. He also added that the number of exam centres are currently being finalised and each centre will have gloves and masks for all staff and students. The exams will be conducted in three “two-hour” slots on all six days to reduce crowding. Dean (admissions) Shobha Bagai said, “According to the NTA, there will be around 50-60% reduction in the number of students per centre to ensure social distancing. This will lead to an increase in the number of centres across cities. Students will have to wear masks and gloves and follow all protocols. Isolation rooms have been prepared for those feeling unwell.” JP Dubey, honorary director of Delhi School of Journalism, said, “Students are willing to take the tests as there is no alternative available. When Parliament and Assemblies are running while maintaining protocols, exams too can be conducted. Parents and students are expressing concerns over exam dates clashing with other papers.” Students have expressed concerns over social media about two exams – the common law entrance test (CLAT) and IIM-Indore’s Integrated Programme in Management Aptitute Test (IPMAT) – that are scheduled for September 7, clashing with an undergraduate entrance test for DU.Harshit Singh, 18, a resident of Kanpur, who applied for a undergraduate management course, said, “My nearest centre is in Varanasi for which I have to go by train or road. If I go by train, there is a severe health risk. By road, the journey would be too expensive. My family is not keen on me appearing for the tests by risking my health.” Taddo Tayeng, a resident of Roing in Arunachal Pradesh, who applied for a postgraduate course, said,“ It is unlikely that I will be able to appear for the paper since my nearest centre is in a different state. If I travel to that state, I will have to quarantine myself there for 14 days and then again when I return to my state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-entrance-exams-notified-to-be-held-from-september-6-to-11/story-k9I9gh8XqMHLYmyjUBPqqK.html
21-08-2020||City||Ranked 3rd dirtiest in country, Abohar pays price for stalled civic works||Bathinda Started with much fanfare by the then local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu in October 27, 2017, work to develop the Abohar town in Fazilka district stalled soon thereafter. The home town of state Congress president Sunil Jakhar has since seen road roads dug up and clogged drainage, with even a walk on the road a challenging task.In the recent Swachh Survekshan, the centre’s annual survey on cleanliness under the Swachh Bharat Mission, the results of which were announced on Thursday, the town ranked as the third dirtiest in India with a population between 1 and 10 lakh on cleanliness and sanitation.In the work that was to be done under the Centre’s Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) Yojana, Rs 82 crore was earmarked for the sewer system and Rs 23 crore for drinking water supply for Abohar. Besides, 8-km new water supply pipeline, work was allotted for the 72-km lateral sewer line in Abohar city.As the city’s roads remained inundated a day after heavy rain on Thursday, residents blame the state machinery for slow-placed work. “Abohar is considered to be a VIP city as this is the native place of the politically influential Jakhar family of the Congress party. State Congress head Sunil Jakhar represented Abohar assembly segment for three consecutive terms in 2002, 2007 and 2012. Congress is in power since 2017 and Abohar can be an example of governance by the present dispensation,” Sanjeev Kumar, a resident said.Another resident Deepak Kathuria rues that even quality of the drinking water supply has been hit due to dilapidated infrastructure. “Road accidents are frequent due to battered roads. Incomplete work of laying sewage and road work leads to traffic jams. No one is accountable for inordinate delay,” he said.BJP MLA of the area Arun Narang said, “The Centre-funded AMRUT was announced in 2017 after a delay of one year. To date, work under this scheme has not been completed by the Punjab government. Water-logging is usual even after moderate rainfall. It is shocking that a city that is the base of the state Congress president is graded so low in terms of hygiene and sanitation.”Municipal commissioner Abhijeet Kaplish said the private firm engaged under the AMRUT project was found to be inefficient. “Over 50% of work is incomplete. The MC is contemplating action against the firm,” he added.“Dissatisfied with the private contractor’s performance, the MC has already allotted work of Rs 11 crore to another firm to expedite development work. We are in the process of giving operation and maintenance work to another firm after competitive bidding,” he said. Kaplish added that Abohar would improve its grading in next year’s cleanliness ranking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranked-3rd-dirtiest-in-country-abohar-pays-price-for-stalled-civic-works/story-6IshFd8qaJD1Qtinpu4MBI.html
21-08-2020||Delhi||No Covid positive inmate at Delhi’s three jails, says prisons DG||There is no inmate with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infection at the three prisons in Delhi, prisons director-general (DG) Sandeep Goel said, after the last of the two Covid-19 positive patients was declared recovered on Thursday. However, two members of the Tamil Nadu Special Police (TSP), the force that provides security inside the prison, are yet to recover from the disease, Goel said. The three prison complexes -- Tihar, Mandoli and Rohini -- have reported 232 Covid-19 cases till date. These include 63 prisoners, 87 jail staff and 82 members of the TSP, Goel said. Two inmates have succumbed to the virus infection so far. “Both were senior citizens jailed in Mandoli,” the prisons DG said. The dead included a 1984 riots convict Mahender Yadav, who had succumbed to the disease at a private hospital in Dwarka during treatment. The officer said of the 63 inmates, only two were detected positive this month -- both on August 3. “Now, both of them have recovered, leaving us with no Covid-19 positive inmates. But two staffers continue to remain infected while the remaining 167 have recovered,” he said. Tihar jail is the most populated prison complex in the country and houses around 18,000 prisoners. Since March, around 4,000 prisoners have been released on interim bail and emergency parole in a bid to “reduce overcrowding” and to contain the spread of Covid-19. Many of them have since returned to jails after they were allegedly found involved in crimes. Prison officials said they have managed to contain the spread of Covid-19 among prisoners by implementing measures such as isolating all new prisoners for 14 days before lodging them with the others. In March, the prisons department had also suspended the bi-weekly family visits of all prisoners. All court hearings are also being held via video conferencing. The prisons department has also started a virtual visit (video conferencing) facility with family members in Tihar. This facility will soon be extended to all 15 sub-jails of the three jail complexes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-covid-positive-inmate-at-delhi-s-three-jails-says-prisons-dg/story-WIri2UizraxI9Rfi0rBJtL.html
21-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram drowns as drainage plan delayed by over a year||A ‘comprehensive drainage plan’ for the city, conceived by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority in May last year, which envisaged a long-term plan to deal with repeated monsoon flooding in Gurugram, has been delayed due to prolonged talks with stakeholders that stretched out to over several months in the second half of 2019, and then due to the outbreak of Covid-19 early this year, officials privy to the matter said on Thursday.Officials in the GMDA’s infrastructure-2 division (which deals with water supply, sewerage, and drainage) said the plan which was also approved by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, proposes the construction of recharge wells, water harvesting structures and focuses on building stormwater drains to carry rainwater as part of its strategy to fix Gurugram’s monsoon woes.The proposal identified the Badshahpur drain, which runs from Ghata to Najafgarh, as most critical for channeling the monsoon run-off. “Gurugram’s total stormwater catchment area, including Aravalli foothills, is about 50,000 hectares,” the proposal states, adding that the Badshahpur drain carries the run-off from almost half of this catchment area, making it a vital natural resource. However, given that the drain’s carrying capacity has been severely hindered due to encroachments and increased concretisation in recent years, the authority had proposed to build a parallel 2.5 km-long open drain, and another 3km box drain to connect Vatika Chowk to NH48, to channel the run-off that the Badshahpur drain can no longer accommodate. The work on the drains was supposed to start earlier this year but is still in the tendering process.“This construction of the two drains, which will be known as Leg 4, is a long-term solution that will fix flooding issues in the city, but there was prolonged back and forth with the National Highways Authority of India in finalising the terms of agreement. The work was to commence earlier this year, but then we lost four months due to the outbreak Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdown. The project is at a tendering stage now and should be completed within 18 to 24 months,” said Pradeep Kumar, chief engineer, GMDA.The plan, which has a budget of ₹298 crore, is meant to be implemented in four phases over four years. Kumar also added that the plan will include construction of box drains, recharge wells and water harvesting structures along the Southern Peripheral Road, for which ground surveys have been conducted. The plan is unlikely to come to fruition completely before 2022, he added.Based on the city’s topography, the GMDA had divided Gurugram into four zones— non-urbanised areas along the Gurugram-Faridabad Road up to Ghata village, areas lying east of Gwal Pahari in the Aravalli foothills, areas lying between Ghata and Sohna Road (beyond Sectors 58-67), and areas lying between Sohna Road and NH-48.Given the delay in the construction of the two drains, earlier this year, the GMDA identified 35 ‘choke points’ in the city’s drainage system, officials said, and the authority undertook remedial measures to increase the drainage system’s carrying capacity in these areas. “This exercise largely paid off as despite heavy rainfall on Wednesday water-logging in areas, which used to become a challenge in monsoons in the last four or five years, such as MDI Chowk, Vatika Chowk or Hero Honda Chowk did not persist for a long time. However, unfortunately, new choke points have emerged in other parts, such as Golf Course Road, which could not handle the unprecedented downpour. That’s why the flooding happened in the last two days,” said Rajeev Bansal, superintending engineer, GMDA.This view was echoed by VS Kundu, chief executive officer, GMDA, who said, “The new choke points will be investigated by a flood control committee comprising engineers from the GMDA, municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and DLF. We have constituted the committee on Friday and an order will be issued regarding its formation tomorrow (Saturday). I will have a meeting with them in the next week, following which a field investigation will be conducted and a report will be filed with recommendations for long-term remedial measures.”A senior GMDA official, seeking anonymity, however, disagreed with the GMDA’s approach on dealing with drainage during monsoon. “We are still looking at rainwater as something to be disposed of through stormwater drains. Stormwater drains are in bad shape. The infra division has done a good job in fixing some perennial choke points. However, because of poor vigilance during the lockdown, other areas have become prone to flooding, either because the drains haven’t been routinely de-silted or because of encroachments. This pattern will keep repeating itself until we understand that we don’t need a drainage plan, but a water management plan. We need to revive green belts and water bodies, and to stop construction in floodplains like Ghata village which have changed the hydrogeology of Gurugram,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-drowns-as-drainage-plan-delayed-by-over-a-year/story-KSzyyWe4JA5q7cnskv6QGO.html

Ajay Bhardwaj, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Airport, said, “We have suffered a loss of around Rs 40 crore in the past four months as we are losing Rs 8.5 crore every month. As far as waiver of rent of shops at the airport goes the authorities will take the decision soon.” Even if the outbreak was controlled it would take around six months to one year to normalise operations, Bhardwaj added.The airport earns most of its revenues under the aeronautical category, whereby it charges Rs 800 per passenger from the airlines. For instance: An airline flying to Delhi with 80% occupancy pays around Rs 65,000 to the airport per flight. Commercial revenues come from rent of retail shops, office space rent, car parking and advertisements, and total revenues under the two heads come to around Rs 30 lakh per day. Chandigarh Airport was earning around Rs 90 lakh per month from the shops as rent, but since March 25 no rentals had been paid.A senior Air India official said, “Since the past four months we have been operating flights with 50% occupancy and sometimes 30%. People are not moving out due to Covid-19 and only travelling for important work. We are suffering a huge loss, but are helpless.” The owner of a high-end brand store at the airport who did not wish to be named said, “We have already given our proposal for the waiver of rent for the shop for the past four months and hopefully the authorities concerned will consider it. Otherwise we will be forced to vacate the shop.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-airport-incurs-40-crore-loss-in-4-months-90-drop-in-footfall/story-4ZtTSA8uynq4ydDLmhjy1H.html

So far, he has distributed 60 Ganesh idols.Swapnil Gharat, 29, who has worked for many Bollywood films, has been making Ganesh idols since 2016. Gharat initially started making idols as a hobby and later took this up as a profession. “More than 250 Ganesh idols are sold every year. But this year, due to the pandemic situation, not many of my regular did not make any bookings,” he said.He later called his regular customers to enquire about the orders, but unfortunately many had lost jobs and were facing a financial crisis. He then decided to distribute idols for free. “Almost 70% of my customers have lost their jobs. Some amongst them who have businesses were incurring losses. Some of them are saving money to pay for school fees. Those who were admitted due to Covid-19 have lost their savings in treatment. Around 20% of the customers brought the idol. I decided to give out the Ganesh idols for free to rest 80% of them. I know these idols will bring a smile to their faces,” Gharat said.A customer Ramchandra Makhane, said, “We have been celebrating this festival since the past 26 years. My father started this ritual. I lost him 10 years back, but we decided to continue with the festivity, in his memory. I work as an electrician, and since the past five months, I have been earning a mere ₹2,000. Hence, we decided to not bring Ganesh idol this year. Swapnil then gave us the idol and he did not charge us for it. We are grateful to him for this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/artist-distributes-ganpati-idols-for-free-to-customers-who-lost-jobs-during-pandemic/story-E1YBhGQImS1Jsiluem9XsI.html
21-08-2020||City||Two minor boys drowned in pond filled with rainwater||Ghaziabad: Two minors drowned Friday evening after they went for bath at a pond behind the Shalimar City highrise located at Sikanderpur in Sahibabad. The police ruled out foul play, based on initial investigation as five friends of the victims were present with them during the incident.The police identified the two boys as Mohammad Zeeshan, 10, and Mohammad Hanna, 11. They added that the two, as well as their friends who went there, are residents of nearby Shaheed Nagar locality and all seven had come to the pond to have a bath. The area of Sikandarpur has several open deep pits which have filled up with rain water during past several days. “The seven boys had come for a bath or for swimming at the pond. The two minor boys went deep into the water and drowned. Other five boys are safe as they did not venture into the water by the time their two friends went inside. The pond is flooded due to heavy rains which lashed the city recently,” said Keshav Kumar, assistant superintendent of police (Sahibabad). He added that the body of the two boys was sent to the mortuary for further legal formalities. “There is no foul play into the incident as only the seven boys were there at the spot. After the two boys got drowned, the other five shouted and locals arrived for help. We informed their families upon getting information,” Kumar added. The cops added that the pond probably had about 5-7 feet of water due to which the boys could not escape. They added that the other five boys were safe and did not suffer any injuries. The incident site is also close to the new civil terminal near the Hindon airbase from where regional flights are operated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-minor-boys-drowned-in-pond-filled-with-rainwater/story-U1O2LXHajyrO0N0OQp91BI.html

Greater Noida authority filed the complaint in Bisrakh police station after they were found developing the projects at night to escape surveillance. The developers were identified as Krishna Chand Pandey, Alka Rani, Anil Choudhary, Seema, Nirmala Gupta and Rajendra Saini. Greater Noida Authority’s circle officer Amit Kumar filed a complaint alleging that these people were earlier served notices against illegal constructions. “But they continued the unauthorised construction despite the High Court stay,” the complaint read. Shahberi area has been under lens since 2018 when an illegal construction collapsed and killed nine persons. An IIT Delhi audit later found that only three out of 437 buildings in the area were safe for living. When contacted, Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer (CEO) of Greater Noida Authority, said that additional CEO KK Gupta was the nodal officer on issues related to construction in Shahberi. Gupta could not be reached for comment. The authority had, last week, issued a fresh notice informing people that land in Shahberi was notified and that there was no permission for any sort of construction. Bisrakh police have registered a case against the six persons under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), Section 288 (negligent conduct with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings), Section 420 (Cheating) and Section 468 (Forgery for purpose of cheating) of the Indian Penal Code. Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central said, “We are investigating the matter,” he said. Police have so far registered 81 cases against over 100 developers and also charged 19 of them under Gangsters Act and four of them under National Security Act.

The team started its investigation on Friday. CBI questioned Neeraj Singh, who was employed as Rajput’s cook, and the actor’s house manager Samuel Miranda. The Central agency will also question the actor’s manager Deepesh Sawant, said sources in the CBI. CBI has set up four teams to investigate the circumstances surrounding Rajput’s death. One team will focus on translating documents from Marathi to English, while another will question people involved in the case. Another team will coordinate with superiors in Delhi and handle logistics in Mumbai. Another team of officials met deputy commissioner of police (Zone 9) Abhishek Trimukhe at his office in Bandra to collect documents, including the forensic report and post-mortem reports as well as statements of more than 60 people whom Mumbai Police had questioned as part of its investigation. These and other material evidence were handed over to the CBI team, said sources in Mumbai Police. CBI will also collect other evidence, including Rajput’s personal items including, three mobile phones, a laptop, clothes, a blanket, bed sheets, a green kurta, a glass; and CCTV footage of his house and building, added sources in CBI. According to sources, once the documentation is complete, CBI plans to visit the actor’s flat in Bandra and recreate the scene of his death scientifically, using weights. The actor was found dead in his apartment on June 14, following which Mumbai Police had registered an accidental death. Later, Rajput’s father filed a complaint in Bihar, accusing actor Rhea Chakraborty and her family of abetting Rajput’s suicide and misappropriating his money. A first information report was filed by Bihar Police on the basis of the complaint and later, it later handed over the case to CBI. Enforcement Directorate also filed a case on July 31, to probe the allegations of money laundering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cbi-sets-up-4-teams-quizzes-sushant-singh-rajput-s-staff/story-2qCN8uAvmArlBsKca5Y6rL.html
21-08-2020||City||Greater Noida: Good Samaritans come together to feed stray animals amid pandemic||Greater Noida: A group of Good Samaritans in Greater Noida have been feeding a langur, some monkeys, ducks, fishes, cows, dogs and other stray animals since in the initial stages of the lockdown. Every morning, they fill their cars with bread, milk, bananas, mangoes, fodder, fruits, etc., and visit the Jaitpur village temple near Greater Noida authority’s office. The temple has some dense trees and a pond spread over 20 acres where stray animals, birds and fish live. The residents say that when they reach the area, the fauna flock towards them every morning, and that this has become a routine. They have been feeding the stray animals for over four months, they said.Harinder Bhati, a resident of Sector Beta – 1, said: “When the lockdown began, the shops and markets were closed and people shunted themselves indoors. Some also lost their jobs. So we started a community kitchen and helped them. But soon we realised that if people are facing so much difficulty, then the stray animals’ survival would be an even worse deal. We then decided to feed them every morning,” he said.A group of 8-10 volunteers, under the banner of Active Citizens’ Team [ACT], identified the Jaitpur village temple which has a sprawling landscape with dense trees and a pond. Sardar Manjeet Singh, another ACT member, said that there is one langur, around 150 monkeys, 50 ducks, 15 dogs, 20 stray cows, and scores of fishes in the pond.“We are locals and we know that stray animals live in this area. Every morning we pack our car with fruits, milk and eatables and come to this spot. The monkeys, cows and other animals flock to us as soon as we reach here. We have developed a good bonding with the animals and they now identify us and our vehicle. They feel good when we visit here,” he said.Pooran Singh, temple priest, keeps the langur in the temple premise while the other animals freely move in the green patches.Raisuddin Siddiqui, who runs a tailoring shop in Jagat Farm, is another volunteer. “Human beings can express their needs and desires through words but animals can’t. At this difficult time of coronavirus and lockdown, people should help each other and also feed stray animals around their neighbourhood,” he said.It costs around Rs 1,500 per day to feed the animals, and the Good Samaritans bear it. Sometimes local residents also volunteer and support the initiative financially.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-good-samaritans-come-together-to-feed-stray-animals-amid-pandemic/story-fjgyS0qn3XoPGXcDPIBb3N.html

21-08-2020||Mumbai||SSC students struggle to change revised scores on portal||Several first-year junior college (FYJC) aspirants whose SSC exam scores have increased after revaluation, were struggling to get their scores updated on the online admission portal until Friday, which was last day to fill forms for the general admission round.Schools said that in the absence of guidelines about editing their scores, they are unable to help students who were struggling to get their marks edited. “We are getting requests from students who have got their revised scores from the board, but the portal does not allow us to edit scores,” said an official working at a guidance centre.One of the students approached her school based in Malad where she was told to wait for instructions from the education department. “I got five more marks after revaluation. I approached the school since I could not edit the marks by myself. Officials asked me to wait until they hear from the department about what is to be done in such a situation,” she said on condition of anonymity.Dinkar Patil, secondary education director, said students can make the changes through the grievance section on the admission portal. “There is a mechanism to make these changes. The scores can be changed through the guidance centre of the office of the deputy director. For this, students can raise their grievances from their accounts and share details of their revised scores. The deputy directorate will correct it. Students can do it from their homes. We will issue a notification about this soon,” he added.This year, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the entire process for FYJC admissions is online. Until Friday evening, over 2.15 lakh students had filled their forms for admissions to colleges in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). The provisional general merit list for students will be declared on August 23 where they can check their scores and raise objections in case of errors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ssc-students-struggle-to-change-revised-scores-on-portal/story-CMao5PBvXv08YobJm6uLzH.html
21-08-2020||City||Noida authority ties up with oil firm to recycle plastic waste||NOIDA The Noida authority on Friday signed a memorandum of understanding with the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) to start work on a project related to the resurfacing of city roads using plastic waste.BPCL has agreed to recycle the plastic waste and make road under the ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’, authority officials said, adding that the public sector oil marketing major will bear the cost for this project.The Noida authority general manager, Rajiv Tyagi, and BPCL executive director Sanjay Bhargav signed the MoU in the presence of other senior officials.“We are committed to follow the laid down guidelines of the waste management rules, 2016, and handle the waste scientifically. Now, BPCL will reuse the plastic waste in making roads in the city. In the time to come, the authority will try to recycle all the plastic waste generated by the city,” said Tyagi.To begin with, BPCL will resurface 500-metre stretch of a sector road in Sector 129 that runs parallel to the Noida-Greater Noida expressway. The stretch, which is 12 metre wide, covers an area of 6,000 square metres in the sector, the officials said.BPCL has a research institute that is conducting a research project to devise a methodology to recycle plastic waste in cities, officials from the company said, adding that it will recycle 20-25 tonne of plastic waste on 6,000 square metres road construction in the Noida sector. “If the project becomes successful, then we will start recycling plastic waste at large scale in Noida and also other cities,” said Mahesh Kasture, chief manager (research and development) at BPCL. The Noida authority has roped in BPCL with an aim to recycle the entire volume of plastic waste in future.“It is a pilot project. If all goes well, then we aim to recycle the total plastic waste in future with different schemes. In this 6,000 square metre area, the authority will provide a truckload of plastic waste. The BPCL will now start taking required steps so that we can resurface the stretch by October 2,” said Tyagi.In September last year, the Noida authority had started a campaign to make Noida a plastic-free city, where single-use plastic is prohibited in order to make the city pollution free. The authority had also built a 2.5-km stretch of Delhi-Noida Link road by using plastic waste collected from various city areas.The authority also has plans to set up a plant to generate shredded plastic for construction use in future, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-authority-ties-up-with-oil-firm-to-recycle-plastic-waste/story-2gBhxiNaPwfDau5NoxZqoN.html

The meeting, during which a range of civic issues were discussed between the two parties, was held at a community centre in Sector 19 on Friday.This comes as part of a fresh drive by the authority to meet with residents of a particular sector every week, discuss their civic issues and plan a solution with the FONRWA office-bearers.“Friday’s meeting was held with the Sector 19 RWA office-bearers wherein various civic issues were discussed, such as issues regarding road repair, maintenance of footpath, drains, sewer line, park and street lights, among others,” said Yogendra Sharma, president of FONRWA.The authority’s general manager Rajiv Tyagi, along with his staff, was present during the meeting. He directed staff to address all grievances raised.The Sector 19 RWA representatives put forth issues related to the department of health, civil engineering, horticulture, water, sewer and electrical. Residents said that the dysfunctional street lights were not being repaired, roads were riddled with potholes and culverts of drains needed maintenance, among other issues. They also demanded proper sanitisation of city parks.“We have demanded that there should be sanitisation regularly in our parks and sweepers should also clean the roads, parks and other areas properly. We also demanded that the street lights should be repaired in community centres and other areas,” said SS Rana, Sector 19 RWA president. “We have started this drive to reach out to residents in every sector to understand their civic issues and try addressing them promptly so that the citizens do not have to face any inconvenience.

21-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad: District to be divided into five zones for better Covid monitoring||Ghaziabad: With the rising number of Covid-19 cases as well as of Covid patients being discharged, the district administration has come up with classification for different zones which will also include areas marked as “Corona-free,” “observation” and “inter/intra district” zones. Officials said they have a different plan laid out for each of the five zones.The district till August 21 had a total of 7,049 Covid-19 cases, which includes 5,846 patients (82.93%) discharged and 67 dead, besides 1,136 active cases. The district at present has 338 active containment zones in different parts of the district.“The idea for dividing areas into different zones is to have a separate plan laid out of activities which will be specific to each zone. Every zone will be monitored by different teams of officers in order to prevent spread of infection. So, in this way, different resources will be dedicated to different zones in order to take up measures,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. The Corona-free zones will be marked in areas where no case has come up in the past 28 days and regular health related activities will be taken up besides awareness campaigns will be launched with the help of RWAs and other prominent persons of the areas. The other set of zones will be defined as observation zones where no cases have resulted during the past 14 days. These zones will have deployment teams who will report daily about symptomatic cases so that the virus can be treated at the earliest. “The zones identified as inter-district or inter-state will be the ones where boundaries of nearby districts or states meet. These areas will need special monitoring and door to door surveys will be taken up, in addition to special camps for Covid-19 testing. Since these areas are near the borders, there is special need to pay attention to these areas in order to prevent the local population getting infected,” the DM added.The parameters for the other two zones – containment zones and buffer zones – are already in practice as part of the containment exercise. The category 1 containment zones (having one case) are defined in a radius of 100 metres while the category 2 zones are defined in an area of 200 metres of radius. The major containment zones in the district are 63 each under jurisdiction of Sihani Gate and Indirapuram police station areas and having 124 and 130 active cases, respectively. The Kavi Nagar police station area has 42 zones with 155 active cases while the jurisdiction of Sahibabad police station area has 30 zones with 103 active cases up to August 19. The buffer zones will be defined in areas which have their boundaries close to the containment zones. From these zones, officials will seek information of suspected cases from local doctors, chemists and even clinics. Under the two zones, special surveillance drives to detect influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases will be taken up more vigorously along with household surveys.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-district-to-be-divided-into-five-zones-for-better-covid-monitoring/story-xcepw4W16UlU5MK6rjqHVJ.html

The virtual general body meeting held on Wednesday was attended by mayor of BNCMC Pratibha Patil, corporators and civic officials. “Since the lockdown has affected many in terms of income and job loss, the general body has passed the proposal to not collect tax for three months, giving relief to the people. However, this can be only imposed once the state government approves it,” said BNCMC commissioner Pankaj Ashiya. Since the lockdown was imposed, power looms in Bhiwandi were shut, leading to job loss for many locals as well as outsiders. “The loom where I used to work was shut, and we were jobless. Many took up work like selling vegetables or other items to earn a living. The exemption of tax will definitely help many as they will get relief from some amount. Three months exemption is needed, “said Hanif Shaikh, 38, who worked in a loom at Ganesh Nagar in Bhiwandi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhiwandi-civic-body-proposes-3-month-water-property-tax-exemption/story-IVPJzM5zant1Xa4TzV4vHK.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||Cop suspended for fraudulently obtaining bank documents||An assistant police inspector (API) of Mumbai Police was suspended on Wednesday after an investigation found him guilty of cheating and forgery in a first information report (FIR) registered against him and two others at Azad Maidan police station.“API Vilas Vasant Sutar is suspended after an FIR was registered against him at Azad Maidan police station,” said S Jaykumar, additional commissioner of police (ACP), local arms (LA), Mumbai Police.An FIR was registered by Irphan Mogul, a resident of Vile Parle, against his former wife, her lawyer and API Sutar for allegedly fraudulently obtaining his bank account statement in connection with a pending maintenance case.Earlier, the family court at Bandra had granted maintenance only to the two children of Mogul and denied such relief to his former wife.Mogul’s former wife challenged the family court’s decision in Bombay high court (HC) last year, and in February she also filed an affidavit that disclosed her husband’s income. The affidavit contained Mogul’s bank account details.“Mogul questioned his bank on how they had shared his personal details to a stranger without his knowledge. Bank officials informed him that API Sutar had allegedly visited their branch in Fort on August 16, 2019, and sought account details saying that he was investigating a fraud case registered against him at Agripada police station,” said a police official requesting anonymity.Later, Mogul filed a right to information (RTI) petition to ascertain whether Agripada police station authorities were investigating any case against him.Mogul filed the complaint under sections 419 (punishment for cheating by personation), 420 (cheating), 465 (punishment for forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), 120-B (punishment for criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against his wife, her advocate and Sutar at Azad Maidan police station after he found that no case was registered against him at Agripada police station.A departmental probe was initiated against Sutar following Mogul’s complaint. The investigation found him guilty, which led to his suspension from Mumbai Police’s Worli unit of LA department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cop-suspended-for-fraudulently-obtaining-bank-documents/story-7jjjAs6CyGXtaglmM2j7UM.html

21-08-2020||Mumbai||HC asks Pakistani national to study Disabilities Act before taking his aunt out of India||The Bombay high court (HC) questioned Mashal Khan, a Pakistani national, as to how he could be appointed as the guardian of his aunt Zarin Ghani Walsh, a Canadian citizen and resident of Pedder Road. Khan submitted that he filed the petition to take his aunt back with him to Pakistan due to her frail health and urged the court to decide on this as he and his family are the only surviving heirs of Walsh. He also added that his other request for appointing him as executor of her properties in India could wait. The court has asked Khan to file an additional affidavit listing Walsh’s properties as well as the remedies available to him under the Disabilities Act, 2016 within 10 days and posted the matter for hearing on September 21. The division bench of justice KK Tated and justice Milind Jadhav, while hearing the petition filed by Khan, a resident of Charsadda, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (North West Frontier Province) in Pakistan, was informed that Walsh, 76, was ailing and living alone in Mumbai. Advocate Mayur Khandeparkar, representing Khan, along with advocate Vaishali Dholakia said as Khan and his brothers and their family in Pakistan were the only surviving relatives of Walsh, they wished to take her to Pakistan so that she may spend her remaining time with them. On a query as to how a Pakistan national could approach an Indian court, Khandeparkar said that he was doing so under Article 21 which the court accepted. The court then said that while it could allow Khan to take Walsh back to Pakistan, his second plea for appointing him as the executor of her estate and bank accounts could not be granted. To this, Khandeparkar cited an order by a previous bench of the HC which allowed a foreigner to be appointed as a guardian. The Union of India and the state, however, opposed the same and said that as per National Trusts Act, Khan could not be appointed as executor of Walsh’s property and bank accounts. Khandeparkar said Khan’s main concern was uniting his aunt with the family back in Pakistan and the issue of her property and bank accounts could be dealt with at a later stage. After hearing the submissions, the court directed Khan to file an affidavit listing the movable and immovable properties of Walsh in India as well as justify the 2013 will of Walsh which named him as executor and heir as it was not approved by any competent court. The court also directed Khan to study the Disabilities Act and directed the Union of India to file an affidavit and rejoinder to the petition and Khan’s affidavit in light of the relevant laws. The matter has been posted for hearing on September 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-asks-pakistani-national-to-study-disabilities-act-before-taking-his-aunt-out-of-india/story-64gDfzzz3ODyTk6UR12RAL.html
21-08-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Readers’ Take: Guarantee students’ safety if exit exams take place||Some things in life are more important than examsBy delaying examinations the University Grants Commission (UGC) can potentially save lives as the risk of students getting infected and carrying the virus to their homes with chances of elderly relatives living there is quite high. Conducting examinations will require a combination of things such as implementing social distancing norms, hand hygiene protocols, and sanitisation, depending on whether the examination centre is near any containment zone. It requires time and planning to make such arrangements. There are chances of transmission of Covid-19 even if one centre does not have safety measures in place. UGC needs to wait till normalcy is restored to complete the final examination process for exit classes in colleges and universities. SK Khosla, Chandigarh Increase number of exam centresFactories, offices and other workplaces are open through the day so why can’t a three-hour examination be conducted peacefully? UGC’s decision to complete the examination process by September 30 is fair and should not be rolled back because students cannot waste time any more this year. A few things to be kept in mind are: Increasing the number of centres to ensure social distancing, proper sanitisation, adoption of water, sanitation and health (WASH) guidelines by UNHCR as a reference to frame guidelines for conducting the exams. Auditors should be appointed at the examination centres to make sure that the guidelines are followed. Other measures such as checking temperature, building sanitisation tunnels, wearing face mask and carrying hand sanitisers should also be followed. Students giving these exams are old enough to understand what needs to be done and so they will act accordingly. Krrish Madaan, Ambala Interests of students importantUGC’s decision to complete the final examinations for exit classes by September 30 is in the interests of students and parents as it will save a precious study year. Subhash Chugh Students should just focus on studiesWhy are exams conducted? To assess a student’s competency to get promoted to the next class or for further studies. However, if we keep postponing exams the students will remain in a state of suspense. We (students) need to co-operate and respect UGCs decision and focus on our studies as this is for our own good. Ankita Tiwari Open more centres, limit number of exam takersWe are making specific changes in our lifestyles to curb the spread of Covid-19, therefore, rules should be followed in the education sector as well. Students and examiners will be gathering at the exam centres and face the risk of getting infected. Online exam is also not a very good option as it’s not something that’s accessible to all students. One way out is by opening more centres in districts and allowing a limited amount of candidates there. There is definitely no doubt that the virus is yet to peak and stay for a prolonged period. So delays are not an option but a more structured process can help both ways. UGC must chalk out a proper plan rather than just focusing on completing the exam. Komal Sharma, Chandigarh Time needed to mentally prepare for examsUGC should revisit the decision that seems to have been taken in a hurry so that the students are not left to fend for themselves as they have already suffered on the academic front this year. If the commission mulls rolling back the decision, a large number of students will get sufficient time to mentally prepare for their respective examinations due this year, as and when new normalcy is restored. Ramesh Dhiman, Chandigarh Cannot be held to ransom by virusThe career of students cannot be held to ransom by a virus, which we have to live with for a considerable period of time. Hence, life must go on. Even the Supreme Court has rejected the plea of a handful of students to cancel exams by stating that the students cannot be made mute victims and spectators by wasting their whole year at the altar of Covid-19. There is no doubt that education has been one of the worst affected fields due to the pandemic, but an entire academic year cannot be disrupted. The forthrightness shown by the highest court of the country will ensure the end of uncertainty and frequent postponement of the key postgraduate courses, and help overcome stress, nervousness and anxiety among the aspirants. The UGC move is very prudent in the current scenario. Rajiv Boolchand Jain, Zirakpur Safety measures should be in placeIt is important to take physical exams and students’ careers depend on final year exams because if they fail to get a high score they might not get a good job or good programme at an institute of higher learning. The only thing is that proper safety measures must be in place at the exam centres. Priyam Aggarwal, Chandigarh Give priority to students’ futureUniversities and colleges will have to work extra hard to complete the challenging job of conducting the exams. Various suggestions have been made: That grades should be given on the basis of previous performance and assessment. Others say that UGC should send question papers and receive answer sheets by post. All of this is not viable as under the present conditions, the postal department might not oblige and chances of the papers leaking are also high. A well thought out plan should be worked out. Students have been under pressure for long and in the present conditions all stakeholders should give top priority to the students’ future. Usha Verma, Chandigarh Conduct exams as quickly as possibleThe authorities should decide in the best interests of the students. Either the UGC should allow the students to appear in an online test (examination) or grades should be allotted to them on the basis of previous performances. Valuable time should not be wasted. Students cannot plan ahead without mark sheets or degrees. So the exams should be conducted as quickly as possible using any format: Online, or previous performance. Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, Mohali Previous performance should countStudents should be given the option to choose between written exams or assessment on the basis of previous performances. Online tests are not a good idea because students can cheat and many do not have access to computers or Wi-Fi. Ishita Nara Gives marks on basis of internal assessments, viva UGC should conduct online exams as it’s not feasible and safe to conduct physical exams at centres during the Covid-19 pandemic. Each paper can be divided into internal assessment, viva, speaking at length on a particular topic, project, or group discussions. This is a fair way to evaluate a students’ knowledge. Abhilasha Gupta, Mohali Involve medical experts in taking decisionsWill the UGC be able to maintain physical/social distancing in the examination centres involving all the students and examiners or risk their lives? Let the top officials of UGC work in the Covid hospitals or mortuaries for a few days to have a feel of the exact situation the country is in, instead of dictating their rules from their exclusive air-conditioned chambers. Are the lives of students and examiners more important than an examination? Almost all students have passed almost five semesters of their papers. The heavens will not fall if the situation is put on hold till the situation normalises. We are aware of the standards of education in the government aided schools or colleges in our country. Let the UGC involve experts of medical fields and take a decision one way or the other. Suresh Verma, Chandigarh Wind up the examination process quicklyThe UGC decision to complete examination for exit classes in colleges and universities by September is prudent and its negation will be detrimental to students’ long-term interest. The observation of the Apex Court: “Life has to go on even in Covid times”... students’ career “cannot be put under jeopardy for long,” while dismissing pleas to defer the scheduled JEE/NEET, is pertinent. Corona is not leaving us any time too soon and next academic session (2020-21) has already started. The final examinations must conclude session 2019-20 post haste. Promoting students without examination is not the right step. Examinations are for comparative evaluation of performance and the benefits far outweigh extra efforts required to conduct them under testing circumstances and where there is a will, there is a way! The verdict reserved by Supreme Court of India, likely early next week, will decide whether there should be a final examination for degree students across the country as insisted by the UGC. Better wait and watch!Lalit Bharadwaj , Panchkula Exams must, but with precautionsUGC’s decision to hold exams seems to have been taken after deep introspection. The decision is laudable. Final year exams are crucial in determining admissions in higher courses and for job prospects. However, UGC must strictly impose all precautions to prevent transmission of Covid-19. Students should start preparing for the exams. Dr Karan Singh Vinayak, Chandigarh Students at a crucial stageAs per the circular issued by University Grants Commission (UGC) dated July 6, 2020, universities have been given sufficient flexibility to conduct exams via online, offline or hybrid modes. Further, for the benefit of students, it was also mentioned in the circular that exams will be re-conducted on a later date, in case a student is unable to appear for it on the scheduled date. Therefore, conduct of examinations in online/offline/blended/hybrid mode, instead of physical mode in traditional classroom environment, will be an encroachment on the legislative field of coordinating and determining the standards of higher education in the country. “Learning” is a dynamic process where the only way to figure out what students/learners know is by seeking evidence of their knowledge. In a developing country like India, exams are used as a medium for assessing the knowledge of the students. Because students of the final year classes are at a crucial stage, stuck in between the global epidemic and career, conducting exams is hence a prudent move for securing their future. Pallavi Kapadia Students know bestUniversities should be opened for the students to continue their studies as we are young we have sufficient immunity and as adults can take proper precautions like sanitation and masks.Kasirao Gumadala Who will be responsible if students are infected?I have a few questions for UGC.The Covid-19 outbreak is not under control. Will you be responsible if any student or his or her family member is infected. Get all of us insured and we will give the examsWhat about transportation and stay for outstation students?Yogesh Nehra Students denied opportunitiesI am a BSc physics final year student from Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi. I got an admission letter from an international university in France. I will have to provide my provisional certificate or course completion letter. But due to these new guidelines from UGC, I may have to forego this offer. So UGC’s decision to hold final year exams is just a foolish decision and it will deny students a number of opportunities.

21-08-2020||Mumbai||Juhu developer murder: Crime branch arrests third accused||The Mumbai Police’s crime branch on Friday arrested Wasim Pashakar Khan alias Munna Khan, 38, the third accused in connection with the murder of 55-year-old Juhu real estate developer and chairman of Al Sofi Group Abdul Munaf Shaikh. According to police, Wasim had provided his bike to conduct recce and helped the other accused. Earlier, two others — Abdul Rehman Abdul Latif Shaikh alias Sonu, 30, and Nadeem Naushad Shaikh, 29 — were arrested in the case. As per Nadeem’s statement, Sonu had hired him and planned the murder, said a crime branch officer. Initial reports suggested that Sonu had given a contract of ₹5 lakh to Nadeem to carry out the murder. Investigations later revealed that the plot was being hatched since a long time, said sources in crime branch. Nadeem met Sonu few months ago through a common friend and as he was looking for a job, Sonu introduced him to Wasim who hired Nadeem as an office boy for a salary of ₹12,000 per month, said the officer. Wasim had also given his bike to Nadeem to conduct recce before the murder. Police are conducting inquiry to find out if Wasim only helped financially or was involved in planning the murder, the officer added. Investigation has also revealed that Sonu had given a similar contract of ₹2 lakh to one Ankit Trikha alias Ankit Punjabi in October 2019. Trikha had followed the developer for around 10 days and had tried to attack him but had to back off as there were a lot of people nearby. Trikha then changed his mind and contacted Anwar Mullah, who lived in the same vicinity as the developer, and told him about the contract, said sources. “Mullah then took Trikha to meet Abdul Munaf Shaikh. When Ankit narrated the story to Shaikh, he recorded the conversation and approached DN Nagar police station,” said a police officer. DN Nagar police officers, however, did not register an offence but had questioned Sonu and Trikha. The murder was the result of a fall-out over six-acre slum land where Abdul Munaf Shaikh was to start an SRA project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/juhu-developer-murder-crime-branch-arrests-third-accused/story-EFiqrPp1Sj1OsRvXQHmTuO.html
21-08-2020||City||UP’s sero survey to target only people aged 18 to 59 years||Ghaziabad The Uttar Pradesh government, which gave its nod to conduct the serological survey in the last week of August, has decided to include people in the age group of 18-59 years only. The survey will be conducted in 11 districts, including Ghaziabad.The UP’s age bar is surprising as the Delhi’s second round of sero survey, result of which was announced on Thursday, found that prevalence of antibodies among those aged less than 18 was 34.7%. Ghaziabad district officials are, however, clueless about the reason for non-inclusion of those aged below 18 years and those aged over 59 years in the upcoming survey. On Thursday, the UP government’s order for 11 districts was issued by Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health). The order stated that random samples will be taken for people in the age group. According to official figures, people aged below 18 years and those over 59 years account for about 19% of the total Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad. This would mean that a good chunk of population will be excluded from the survey. “We are making arrangements for the sero surveillance and identifying teams for the purpose. The government order has included age group 18-59 years for the survey. However, there is no specific reason given why the remaining age group is not included,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. A serological survey checks for an immune response against the coronavirus in the form of antibodies in the blood of a random sample of the population. It can help establish how far the disease had spread and how many people fought off the virus without showing symptoms. Antibodies generally appear around two weeks after a person has been infected and is expected to last several months. The survey will also exclude people who have already recovered from Covid-19, the order said. The survey samples will be sent to King George’s Medical University, Lucknow, said the officials. Regarding the age group limitation, experts said that probably the government is trying to target a focussed group. “The probability of contracting infection in the age group below 18 years and those over 59 years is probably less. So, the survey is being kept on focussed group of 18-59 years as they have high share in number of cases and may provide more positive results in the sero surveillance. The state administration in future may again conduct more of such surveys and then can include the other age groups as well,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad.Dr Ashutosh Rawat, microbiologist from Columbia Asia Hospital, Ghaziabad, said, “The extreme age groups are probably left out as the immune system is not fully developed or gone weak in old age to develop antibodies. Further, the age group of 18-59 years has more people who are working and more exposed on a daily basis. Meanwhile, the second sero survey in Delhi whose results were made public by the Delhi government on Thursday, included the three age groups -- below 18 years, 18 to 49 years and above 49 years. According to the Delhi’s survey results, almost 30% of the 15,000 people surveyed in the national capital had antibodies for Sars-Cov-2. This suggested that approximately 1.2 million people more may have silently contracted and recovered during the period between July and early August. The prevalence of antibodies among those aged less than 18 was 34.7% and 28.5% for those aged between 18 and 50 years. For those above 50, it was 31.2%, as per the survey. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has conducted an all-India sero survey, the results of which are yet to be published.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-s-sero-survey-to-target-only-people-aged-18-to-59-years/story-eKeWj4m3QUaUmRMweNf80N.html
21-08-2020||City||Months after delay, JEE, NEET aspirants can’t wait to take exam||Stressed over the delay in Joint Entrance Examination and National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) due to Covid-19 pandemic, students are finally relieved by the Supreme Court order on conducting the exams next month.However, parents have expressed concern over the risk of infection.Over 2,500 students from Ludhiana will appear in JEE Mains, scheduled from September 1 to 6, and NEET on September 13. As per sources, despite Covid fear, a similar number of candidates has applied for the exams.Students who have dropped a year to appear in the exam stated that they have waited for quite long to appear in the exam and just want to get done with it.Majority of the students have said they have lost the momentum for exam preparation, but would surely appear in the JEE Mains exam to improve their score. As many students were not satisfied with their scores, they decided to take the exam again as best of two scores is taken and the candidate has nothing to lose.Vanshpreet Singh Kohli, a student, said, “I appeared in JEE Mains in January and scored 99.35 percentile. I believe I can improve my score so I will take the test again on September 3. The pandemic has affected my preparation, but am working hard to give my best this time.”Asked if scared of stepping out amid the surge in virus cases, Vanshpreet said full precautions will be taken to ensure health and safety of the candidates during the exam. The 18-year-old scored 97% marks in Class 12 board exams.Medical aspirants, who will appear in the NEET entrance exam on September 13, also expressed frustration over the delay in conducting the exam. Eighteen-year-old Samridhi Manchanda said, “I have been preparing for this exam since last year and postponement twice has irked all students. The decision of conducting the exam in September is a great move as it’s high time, and I am all prepared for the test.”Despite the risks, students want to wait no more for the exams and see their professional education start soon, as sitting idle at home has been very stressful for most of them. Edusquare co-founder and COO Tejpreet Singh said, “Students must revise all concepts again without thinking about whether they have utilised or wasted the past few months. They need to practice well, attempt mock tests and analyse their mistakes. They must also set their body clock as per the exam schedule. They should follow all safety measures on the exam day to keep themselves and their families safe.”SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS AT EXAM CENTRESDue to covid-19 pandemic, the arrangements at the exam centres will be different this time. The National Testing Agency has directed all centre authorities to follow the standard operating procedures and leave two-desk gap while seating the students. Each candidate will be offered a fresh three-ply mask before entering the exam centre. The seating areas will be thoroughly sanitised between every exam shift. All door handles, staircase railings and lift buttons will be disinfected. Wheelchairs (if present at the venue) will be disinfected. Hand sanitisers will be available at the entry and inside the exam venue at various places for candidates and staff.Barcode readers will be available at the entry point to scan the admit cards of candidates.BoxTHINGS STUDENTS CAN CARRYExam-related documents like admit card, ID cardA transparent ball-point penAdditional photograph for the attendance sheetPersonal hand sanitiser (50ml)Personal transparent water bottle||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/months-after-delay-jee-neet-aspirants-can-t-wait-to-take-exam/story-sjR549ykKjwPOQCzqOfANL.html

21-08-2020||City||Amritsar’s Partition Museum adds Guru Nanak’s rare painting to online exhibition||Chandigarh Partition Museum, Amritsar, has announced that it has included a pre-Partition painting of Guru Nanak by renowned artist Sardari Lal Parasher in its on-going online art exhibition-cum-fundraiser, ‘Memories Unlocked: Partition, Migration, Identity’ organised to commemorate August 17, the Partition Remembrance Day. The painting titled ‘Guru Nanak, Continuous Light’ has a miraculous history. It is closely linked to the turmoil that took place during the Partition, and was almost lost — along with many other works of the well-known artist, SL Parasher, who was then the vice-principal of the Mayo College of Art in Lahore. Parasher had to leave Lahore overnight post-Partition, and many of his pre-Partition works were lost.Fortunately, the painting was saved due to the friendship between him and another famous artist, Abdur Rahman Chughtai. Chughtai managed to rescue this painting and some of Parasher’s other works from the chaos of Partition and sent them across the border. The exhibition is the first-ever online art exhibition cum fund-raiser organized by the Partition Museum with the support of Art Alive Gallery, New Delhi. It showcases 26 exclusive works by 16 eminent and upcoming artists of the country. August 17 was declared Partition Remembrance Day by the Punjab government in 2017, when the museum was completed and opened.Mallika Ahluwalia, CEO and curator of the Partition Museum, and founder trustee of The Arts And Cultural Heritage Trust, said, “We are honoured and grateful to the Parasher family to include such a rare painting by SL Parasher in our ongoing exhibition. Work of this archival nature is not seen anymore as most of the early work by many of Punjab’s artists was either lost or scattered due to the Partition.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amritsar-s-partition-museum-adds-guru-nanak-s-rare-painting-to-online-exhibition/story-8j1z7L7fGqhG3QFjhpmprL.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||Mahul pollution: Two firms to move SC against NGT’s order||Private firms in the Mahul-Chembur area, directed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to pay compensation for environmental damage caused by air pollution over five years, have decided to move the Supreme Court (SC) against the order.Industrial firm Aegis Logistics Ltd (ALL) and SeaLord Containers Limited (SLCL, a subsidiary of ALL), were directed to pay Rs. 142.2 crore of the Rs. 286.2 crore compensation that was ordered by NGT in its order from August 13 (based on a June 30 hearing). The compensation amount was based on a Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) in-house technical committee report using VOC emissions data submitted by the industries themselves. ALL and SLCL have denied the charges against them.“Aegis will appeal to SC against this order and also that it had engaged Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B), IIT Chennai and the Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT) which supported Aegis’s contentions that emission concentrations due to said industries were close to zero; when comparing these concentrations with Indian and United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) standards, there was no breach of any standards,” read the statement issued by the firm to the Bombay and National Stock Exchanges earlier this week. An Aegis official shared the statement with HT. The other two companies, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), will also take steps against the NGT order, which directed HPCL to pay Rs. 76.5 crore and BPCL to pay Rs. 67.5 crore as compensation. “We are in receipt of the NGT order. Appropriate action will be initiated at our end after examining it,” read HPCL’s statement while a BPCL spokesperson said, “We have shared the order with our legal team. Necessary follow-up action will be taken soon.” NGT’s hearing was based on an execution application filed under a 2014 application by Mahul residents Charudatt Koli, Dayaram Mahulkar, Mohan Mhatre and Dattaram Koli, seeking closure of SLCL, which is located less than 10 metres from Mahul and Ambapada villages. NGT held that pollution emissions came from logistic services, storing oil, gas and chemical items, and oil companies releasing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during loading, storage and unloading or handling of hazardous chemicals at various stages. “Conditions prevailing in the area are sometimes likened to that of ‘Gas Chamber’,” NGT had said. VOCs are harmful toxic pollutants causing exposure related health effects in humans. Meanwhile, apprehending ALL’s move, applicants said they were working out a strategy to respond before the Apex Court. “Environmental restoration costs must be imposed for damages due to air pollution since the inception of these industries. Aegis started functioning in 1984 and SLCL in 2010,” said Koli. Mhatre said the damage cost payable by industries was actually much higher if a report by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) was considered. “Had CPCB considered VOC emissions data by NEERI, Rs. 1,167 crore would be payable by SLCL and Rs. 13,088.3 crore by ALL (damages from 2015 to 2020),” he said. NGT in its latest order said funds would be utilised for restoration through an air pollution action plan while constituting a 10-member joint committee of state, Central bodies and research institutes to prepare this plan. On Thursday, environment minister Aaditya Thackeray had tweeted that the NGT order was discussed by state bodies and the role of departments was assessed for further follow-up. “We request the state to implement immediate measures to deal with toxic emissions from these industries and provide a concrete solution as relief for Ambapada and Mahul Koliwada villagers,” said Mahulkar. AEGIS HAD MOVED SC DAYS BEFORE NGT ORDER WAS PUBLISHED Apart from the fresh intention to move SC, ALL had already moved SC on August 10 challenging NGT’s (June 30) order before it was published on August 13. On August 14, the SC had held that NGT will hear Aegis before pronouncing its written order, preferably within a period of two weeks. However, by the time the order was circulated, NGT had already published its August 13 order. Thus, the NGT issued a notice on August 18, in view of the SC order, that the execution application will be taken up for hearing on Monday (August 24). Applicants said these were delay tactics. “These strategies are used to postpone proceedings to benefit industries every time. ALL approaching the SC at the very last hour when the NGT order is to be published as part of the same modus operandi adopted to create confusion,” said Koli adding, “If a hearing was needed ALL should have challenged it immediately after June 30.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mahul-pollution-two-firms-to-move-sc-against-ngt-s-order/story-IBfA4uQhgvbZUfD8JUjl8H.html
21-08-2020||City||KDMC suspends licence of hospital for overcharging||Ten days after serving a show cause notice to Shree Devi Hospital, the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has suspended the hospital’s licence till August 31 on grounds that the hospital failed to explain the irregularities in treating Covid-19 patients as pointed out by the civic body. KDMC also said the hospital overcharged patients without following the rate mentioned by the state government. Earlier on August 10, KDMC had served notice to the hospital after the civic flying squad, which is appointed to look after complaints regarding irregularities in Covid hospitals, pointed out irregularities. The civic body said the hospital has overcharged ₹1.6 lakh from patients and asked the hospital authorities to refund the same. “The license of the hospital has been cancelled till the amount is refunded or till August 31. There has been several complaints based on which a show cause notice was served, but since there was no explanation from the hospital we have cancelled the licence,” said Sunil Pawar, additional commissioner, KDMC. The civic body also claimed that the hospital has been treating Covid patients since July without informing the civic body. “The hospital has overcharged patients, did not maintained 80:20 ratio of Covid and non-Covid patients, and also did not cooperate during the audit of bills and documents. The license has been revoked under the Bombay Nursing Homes Registration. Act,1949,”added Pawar. However, the 100-bed hospital, which currently has 30 patients, will be allowed to treat them and haemodialysis patients despite the suspension of licence. No new patients can be admitted to the hospital. The civic body will also appoint a medical officer to keep a watch on the hospital. Bala Shetty, owner of the hospital, said, “We have already refunded the amount mentioned by the civic body to the patients on Friday evening. We had asked the civic body to give us 10-days’ time to refund the money, then why are they cancelling the license? Hospitals are already working under a lot of pressure, and in such situation, instead of getting support, we are being targeted.” Earlier in July, the civic body suspended the license of A and G Hospital for overcharging patients to the tune of ₹9.36 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kdmc-suspends-licence-of-hospital-for-overcharging/story-qWvPYmKEmdnYywBPWl4rdM.html
21-08-2020||Chandigarh||Controlling street crime was a challenge: Jagadale on last day as Chandigarh SSP||Controlling street crime remained a challenge, said Nilambari Vijay Jagadale, Chandigarh’s first woman senior superintendent of police (SSP) who relinquished her charge on Friday. “Street crime instils fear in the mind of people and we managed to bring down the snatching cases,” said Jagadale, who had joined office in 2017. In 2017, the city recorded 238 snatching incidents, followed by 191 in 2018. In May 2018, the Punjab and Haryana high court even reprimanded the SSP, taking note of the spike in snatching cases. The figures came down in 2019, with 122 cases. As many as 53 have been registered this year, so far. “Mapping of the snatching-prone areas, making it compulsory for DSPs and SHOs to visit the crime spot and registering of cases against snatchers who stopped attending court hearings helped us bring down the numbers,” said Jagadale, who is returning to Punjab Police as the AIG, cyber, and director, Digital Investigation Training and Analysis Centre (crime), Mohali. Corruption a major concernCorruption in the department remained a major concern, so much so that UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had pointed to it during Chandigarh Police’s 51st Raising Day ceremony in November 2017. During her tenure, as many as 70 cops were suspended for indulging in graft or other immoral practices.Interestingly, as she joined in Chandigarh, the charge of the crime branch — the most important wing of the police department — was taken away from the SSP, and she oversaw only law and order.Projects remained non-starter Taking charge shortly after the infamous Varnika Kundu case, Jagadale started the work on making the city safe for women. However, her project of hiring trained counsellors for women, children and senior citizens in distress by using the Nirbhaya fund could not see the light of the day. Even on community policing front, her plans to have mohalla committees comprising with area residents for each police station could not take shape. “Owing to Covid-19 pandemic, these projects could not be started,” she said, adding that the pandemic helped change image of police and “we got close to the residents”.Wait for new SSP SP (city) Vineet Kumar has been given the charge of SSP till the new officer is appointed. The UT had recommended Punjab-cadre officer Vivek Sheel Soni’s name for the SSP’s post to the MHA. However, the MHA has forwarded Mohali SSP Kuldeep Singh Chahal’s name to the department of personnel and training. The UT administration is yet to receive the final communication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/controlling-street-crime-was-a-challenge-jagadale-on-last-day-as-chandigarh-ssp/story-XVZNUW6c0ZrLsSG31cTgXJ.html
21-08-2020||Gurugram||GMDA committee to submit report on floods within a week||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) on Friday constituted a seven-member expert committee to probe what caused the flooding at numerous spots in Gurugram, including Golf Course Road on Wednesday and Thursday.Named the Flood Protection Committee, the expert group is tasked with ‘submitting a report regarding flooding caused in various parts of Gurugram city due to excessive rains on August 19 and 20.’ GMDA said the committee will comprise engineers from the GMDA, the municipal corporation gurugram (MCG), and a representative of private developer DLF. Their report is expected to be filed within the next seven days.A copy of the authority’s order, dated August 21, is with HT. As per the order, “The flood protection committee will examine the causes of flooding specially in the underpasses at Golf Course Road, Medanta road at Rajeev Chowk and IFFCO Chowk which were submerged with stormwater rendering them unusable for normal traffic and to suggest short and long term solutions... to prevent this from happening in the future.”The order states that the committee will be chaired by former Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) engineer-in-chief, KK Bhugra, who played a key role in formulating a ‘comprehensive drainage plan’ for Gurugram, which was approved in the GMDA’s authority meeting in May last year, but whose implementation has since been delayed.The remaining members of the FPC include Pradeep Kumar (chief engineer, infrastructure-2, GMDA), Rajesh Bansal (superintending engineer, infrastructure2, GMDA), Raman Sharma (chief engineer, MCG), Vishal Garg (executive engineer, MCG) and an unnamed representative of private developer DLF.VS Kundu, chief executive officer, GMDA, said, “I will have a meeting with the committee within the next week, after which they will conduct necessary investigations and submit their report, which will identify the cause of the floods and suggest measures to mitigate such an event in the future.”DLF spokesperson, Akash Ohri, said he had not yet received a copy of the GMDA’s order, but added, “It’s the right step to form a committee to investigate. Every department should do their bit to fix the issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-committee-to-submit-report-on-floods-within-a-week/story-uOGzZDTbwtsGgM1gIATX0L.html
21-08-2020||City||Residents take out bathtub on waterlogged lane, protest against civic body in Ambala||The rainfall on Friday morning caused waterlogging in Nadi Mohalla of the city, exposing the poor arrangements made by the civic body for the rainy season. Residents of Nai Basti area took out a bathtub, on the waterlogged lanes, as a mark of their protest against the civic body’s ill-preparedness to tackle the situation.“The rainwater up to four feet entered the houses of low-lying areas like Nai Basti and Nadi Mohalla on Friday afternoon and the residents had to bear the brunt of the flooding. We also blocked a road and when the videos of a bathtub on the roads started circulating, officials reached the area and tried to pacify the protestors,” said Congress leader Davinder Verma.Several localities near the office of the municipal corporation like Jagadhari Gate, TB Hospital Road, lanes near old railway road and posh areas like sectors 8, 9 and 10 were also waterlogged.“I’m witnessing waterlogging for the last two decades and nothing seems to have changed since then. The civic officials have not cleaned the sewage systems and drain,” a shopkeeper near the old cloth market said.Despite repeated attempts, MC Commissioner Parth Gupta could not be reached for comment. However, sources said that the MC officials were out on the field to deal with the waterlogging situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-take-out-bathtub-on-waterlogged-lane-protest-against-civic-body-in-ambala/story-CAOJPRVD6BlyBedGhKV3SL.html
21-08-2020||City||Haryana allows private labs to conduct antigen, antibody tests, puts cap on charges||m The state health department on Friday issued an order, allowing private labs and hospitals to conduct Covid-19 antigen and IgG antibody tests, while putting a cap on the testing charges at the same time. The decision has been taken almost two-and-a-half months after the private labs approached the health department seeking permission to start the testing. Officials privy to the matter said private labs and hospitals all this while continued to conduct these tests without any fixed price.Based on the advice of the experts and after taking the costs of the kits and consumables into account, the department has capped the price of rapid antigen testing at ₹ 650 and ₹250 for the IgG antibody test. The latter does not detect active Covid-19 infection but confirms the history of contracting the virus. The gold standard of front-line Covid-19 test is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), the price for which has been fixed at ₹2,400.Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department said, “Citizens can get themselves tested for rapid antigen and antibody tests in the private labs/hospitals for the diagnosis of Covid-19. They will have to show identify proof and prescription from a doctor to get tested. The process is similar to getting a RT-PCR test done. The fixed price is inclusive of sample pick-up, packing and transportation within the state.” As per the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), states have been advised to use antigen kits for detection of the virus in hot spots and containment zones. Symptomatic people with influenza-like illness, asymptomatic patients who are high-risk contacts of confirmed cases, people with co-morbidities, and high-risk patients, who are either hospitalised or seeking hospitalisation, are to be given priority for testing.Antigen tests look for specific protein associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus — the pathogen that causes Covid-19. In the antibody test, blood samples are collected to check for antibodies which appear after the person is infected with Covid-19 and stays in the body for months.In the first week of June, as reported by HT, four private labs had approached the district health department and shared the proposed rates for conducting the tests, with antibody tests ranging from ₹600 to ₹1,450 per sample. The proposed rate for antigen test was ₹500 to ₹950 per test. The district health department had submitted its recommendations to the state to fix price for IgG antibody ELISA test at ₹1,000 per test and ₹800 for antigen test. Currently, both the tests are being conducted by the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-allows-private-labs-to-conduct-antigen-antibody-tests-puts-cap-on-charges/story-cPv5nHvt4n73MWVHXh8DkM.html
21-08-2020||Gurugram||Malls, shopping complexes and offices to shut on weekends||All malls, markets, public and private offices and shops, except those dealing in essential goods and services, will remain shut on every Saturday and Sunday in Haryana to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). There will not be any restrictions on peoples’ movement or traffic. The decision is likely to hit traders in Gurugram, already reeling from the 68-day national lockdown induced by the viral pandemic, and people’s reluctance to move out during the initial phase of the relaxation of curbs from June.The decision was declared by state home minister Anil Vij on Twitter on Friday evening. Later, chief secretary Keshani Anand Arora issued the order in this regard. A senior state official privy to discussions said the government had noticed that the people were not following health protocols and were careless. “Since gatherings are taking place and huge rush of people is seen in market complexes, we are noticing citizens are taking pandemic lightly. Due to this, Covid-19 numbers are increasing not in Gurugram alone but other districts as well,” said the official who did not wish to be named. “It is not a weekend lockdown. No curfew has been imposed.”In Haryana, the Covid-19 tally has crossed 52,000 and 585 deaths till Friday, according to the daily state health bulletin. The above mentioned official said the Covid-19 numbers were largely increasing in northern parts of the state sucha as Panchkula, Kurukshetra and Panipat.In a press statement issued from state capital Chandigarh, the government said that these orders shall remain in force till further orders.Shopping malls and market associations in Gurugram were disappointed over the move. Aman Bajaj, member, Metropolitan Mall Association, said that they had not anticipated this. “Business is already affected as malls opened in the later stages of the unlock phase. In a week, there are nearly three to four days with no sale at all. We were gradually regaining our customers on Saturdays and Sundays as people are occupied during the weekday due to work from home. The decision will affect us badly,” he said.Harinder Rana, president, Palam Vyapar Kendra Market Association, said that the business will be affected. “But nothing can be done as it is a government order and we cannot go against them. We have been informed that challans will be issued if shops except those dealing in essential goods are opened on weekends,” said Rana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/malls-shopping-complexes-and-offices-to-shut-on-weekends/story-Yn4bF9lsjpT6DKuDpaQnPN.html

Dr Rajesh Kapoor, who runs the Navkiran De-Addiction Centre, said the caretaker of the centre, Pintoo, telephoned him in the wee hours of Friday, informing him about the robbery. He rushed to the spot immediately and alerted the police.Pintoo told the police that the robbers barged into the centre around 2am and overpowered him. After restraining him, they stole 19,000 tablets worth Rs 6 lakh and Rs 2 lakh in cash.Dr Kapoor said the medicine was only available at government hospitals and government approved de-addiction centres, and could be misused by the robbers.Inspector Rao Varinder Singh, SHO at Machhiwara police station, said they had lodged a case of robbery and started investigation to arrest the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/robbers-decamp-with-drugs-worth-6-lakh-2-lakh-in-cash-from-rehab-centre-in-ludhiana/story-YhXErYOn8KZGAnAor0wk7L.html
21-08-2020||Gurugram||Sector 9 shootings may be linked to gang rivalry over land plot: Police||A day after three men were killed in two seemingly coordinated incidents in Sector 9 area, the police on Friday said that the shootings could be linked to a dispute over a 1,000square-yard plot in Basai between two gangs — a rivalry that has led to several violent confrontations, including murders, in the past few years. The police have so far identified three suspects in the case. Four crime branch teams have been assigned to trace them. A senior police official, familiar with the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “Prima facie, the shootings appear to be related to enmity regarding a feud over a plot in Basai between two gangs from the area. Joni Kataria, who is currently lodged in jail in a murder case, had an ancestral plot in Basai, which was usurped by one Hari Om. This led to a feud. Joni and his brother Moni joined gangster Ashok Rathi’s group and killed Hari Om’s brother about two years ago. In retaliation, Hari Om had murdered Moni Kataria in Rewari.”The police said Joni and Moni grew up in Bahadurgarh after the death of their father. They had an ancestral plot in Basai and, during their absence from the village, it was allegedly taken over by a rival. The police said tensions had subsided in the past one year after both Joni and Hari Om were arrested. “The victims killed in Thursday’s shooting are associated with Joni’s gang. The police on Thursday had named one Pavan Nehra as the prime suspect. Nehra is allegedly a relative of Hari Om. The police have also announced a reward of ₹1 lakh for information leading to the arrest of prime suspect, Pavan Nehra, and his aides. On Thursday around 5pm, unidentified armed men had shot two people – Anmol and Sunny – dead after cornering them in an empty plot near Wings Apartment in Bhawani Enclave. Another person, Sameer alias Vicky, was shot dead in Basai village within a few minutes of the first shooting. The police have recovered a CCTV footage in which several suspects can be seen chasing one of the victims on scooters. In the footage, at 4.58pm, a suspect can be seen conducting a recee before parking his motorcycle in a plot adjacent to Wings Apartments. He makes a phone call and within a few seconds, several suspects arrive on scooters. As a herd of buffaloes pass through, a suspect corners Anmol, who is trying to escape on his motorcycle, and shoots him in the head. The police said after shooting him, the suspects chased Sunny and another person, Angrez, who entered Wings Apartment. Sunny was shot dead in the society while Angrez hid in a staircase and survived. A man, who has a shanty at the plot where the first shooting incident took place, said, “A group of men arrived and started firing shots indiscriminately. I heard about seven gunshots and retreated into the shanty to take cover. One victim was escaping on his motorcycle when he was shot in the head. He walked a few yards before collapsing here.”After the incident, the residents of Wings Apartment have requested the police to deploy police personnel at night at the society entrance for additional security. A resident, requesting anonymity, said, “We have requested the police to deploy three policemen at night for some time. Naturally, there is some fear due to the incident. The victims and perpetrators were outsiders. We are also installing a fibre panel on the entrance gate of the society.”Subash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “A request was received and a team has been assigned to make rounds in the area during the night.”Preet Pal, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, “Crime teams are conducting raids to nab the suspects. One FIR has been registered in the case. The enmity between the victims and perpetrators started due to the plot dispute. No arrests have been made.” The police said the post-mortem examination of the victims was conducted by a medical board on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sector-9-shootings-may-be-linked-to-gang-rivalry-over-land-plot-police/story-WWE1radaPCjhXs77Hh72IN.html
21-08-2020||Gurugram||Nearly 30% Covid-19 deaths in state due to multiple co-morbidities||At least 30% Covid-19 deaths in the state are due to multiple co-morbidities, mainly hypertension, diabetes and heart disease, according to the data by the Haryana health department. Senior doctors treating coronavirus patients said that those who could not survive were mostly overweight with high insulin resistance. Based on the data of 538 deaths reported till August 16, nearly 29% had succumbed to the illness without having any previous health issues. On the other hand, patients of liver disease, cancer, kidney disease, hypertension, heart disease, respiratory illness, diabetes and other health issues along with those under investigation when combined contributed to 41% of coronavirus deaths.Data shows that highest number of deaths has been reported in the age group 55-64 years, followed by 65-74 years and then 45-54 years. Based on the overall toll, the mortality rate of Haryana is 1.12%. The death count till Friday was 585. Going by the state figures, of these 41%, at least 8% patients had diabetes mellitus and 6% had history of respiratory illness. Two percent each had liver disease and neurological disorder. It also includes nearly 3% cancer patients and 3% patients with kidney disease. Almost 4% had hypertension and 4% had heart disease. At least 3% had other health issues.Dr Dhruv Chaudhary, head, pulmonary and critical care medicine department, PGIMS-Rohtak, who is also Haryana’s nodal officer for Covid-19, said, “Covid-19 deaths are due to multiple factors. Firstly, people are getting admitted late to the hospital. It is due to late diagnosis and reporting, and patients shifting between hospitals before getting the final treatment. The process is not seamless. Secondly, the availability of healthcare, diagnostics, medicines and identification of the patient by the health worker at the preliminary stage contributes to the fatality rate.”He said, “Patients who have succumbed to the multiple co-morbidities were found insulin resistant, which is linked to high-cholesterol levels and heart issues. Findings shows these patients are mostly obese.” Over 6% deaths are also under investigation as the patients were brought dead to the hospital and were Covid-19 positive. In Gurugram till now, 10 such sudden Covid-19 deaths have been reported. Since fatality rate helps in identifying high-risk population, severity of the disease and setting up quality of healthcare, every district has constituted a death audit committee to review the cause of the deaths. Earlier this month the state health department stressed upon preparing the audit reports properly to ascertain the cause of deaths. In case of Gurugram, at least 131 Covid-19 deaths have been reported in Gurugram, with a fatality rate of 1.25%. Of the total deaths, 92 are due to co-morbidities and 39 without co-morbidities, according to the district health bulletin. On Friday, out of the 10,756 cases, 811 are active and 9814 have recovered from the illness. Of the active cases, 705 are in home isolation, 8 in government or self-paid isolation centres and 98 are hospitalised. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “More than 320 Covid-19 deaths are reported from Faridabad and Gurugram, while the remaining from other districts. Most of these deaths are largely due to multiple co-morbidities where a patient had diabetes, hypertension and heart disease together.” In Faridabad 160 deaths have been confirmed till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nearly-30-covid-19-deaths-in-state-due-to-multiple-co-morbidities/story-u0rghqFgedlawCsOFYMwIM.html

21-08-2020||Gurugram||Three buildings tilt dangerously after heavy rain, owners asked to demolish structures||At least three residential buildings in the city, developed by Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), have tilted dangerously after being battered by two days of heavy rains on Wednesday and Thursday. The owners of these buildings have been asked to demolish these structures at their own cost and HSVP on Friday also formed a committee to probe the reasons for the structural failure of these buildings and make recommendations to prevent such happenings in the future.Around 30 families living in houses alongside these structures have been forced to vacate their homes and take shelter with family and friends, said residents’ associations. Notices to the owners of these buildings were issued on Thursday by the authority telling them to demolish their structures.A visit to the location of these three buildings on Friday revealed that the structures had been constructed on smaller plots measuring between 60 square yard and 140 square yard. Two of the structures are located in sector 47 and 46 and are still under construction. The third, located in sector 27, was completed only five months ago and five families lived as tenants in the building  All three structures have an empty plot adjacent to them where heavy waterlogging had taken place during the two days of the rain that could have led to the weakening of the base of the building. However, officials privy to the matter said that structural defects also contributed to the damage, apart from rainwater playing its part.In sector 27, the four-storey building and the stilt built on a 100 square yard plot was prevented from collapse on Thursday itself, after neighbours and local residents joined hands and brought large iron girders themselves and placed these strategically to support the leaning structure. “We came to the spot around 7am and after seeing the tilt immediately decided to place heavy girders on the sidewalls. It was also ensured that within an hour the five tenant families living in the building evacuated the place. A crane was called and we spent money ourselves so that there is no accident,” said Rajesh Khangwal, a local resident and a civil contractor.Six girders were purchased by local residents from Sadar Bazar and these were improvised and fixed on the side of building, which cost them around Rs 60,000, said Khangwal.Jalender Yadav, who lives in an adjacent building, said that he had vacated his house in the morning itself as he feared that the structure will collapse. “I had asked the owner in the past to rectify structural defects that happened during construction. A thorough probe needs to be done and this structure should be pulled down immediately,” he said.Rohtash Bedi, a local leader, who was on the spot, added that apart from severe waterlogging, structural defects caused the tilting. “Around 10 to 12 families have been affected and have shifted to other places,” he said.A similar incident also happened in sector 47, where a residential structure being built on a 60 sq yard plot tilted dangerously on Thursday after which HSVP officials and local police rushed to the spot.Virender Tyagi, former president of sector 47 RWA who went to the spot, said that poor construction practices coupled with waterlogging in an adjoining plot caused the house to tilt. “The good thing is that the building did not collapse immediately. It will have to be demolished,” he said.In sector 46, local residents said that 21 families have shifted from seven houses adjacent to the tilted building, which was coming up on a xx square yard plot, fearing a collapse. “The reason for this structural tilt is not only waterlogging but leakage of sewage in the structure. The drains and pipes are inadequate in draining out water and this has caused this situation. The authority should ensure that the structure is demolished at the earliest,” said RK Yadav, RWA president sector 46. The building tilted on Thursday morning.HSVP officials, meanwhile, said directions have been given to the owners to demolish the structures at the earliest. “We have issued notices to concerned owners to demolish the structures and department officials are investigating the reasons which may have caused these incidents,” said Vivek Kalia.The authority has also formed a committee led by an executive engineer to look into the reasons, which caused the structural failure of these buildings. “The committee will give its report on reasons for this damage after examining the site, report of architect/ structural engineer and recommend action to be taken,” said Jitender Yadav, HSVP administrator.The committee will also look into issues of structural weakness, excess construction and waterlogging, which is said to have triggered the tilting, said officials.Dinesh Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Sadar police station, said, “An under-construction four storeyed building had tilted slightly in sector 47 area. After the information was received on Thursday, a team had gone to the area. People in the vicinity of the structure were told to evacuate. The adjacent plot is vacant. The HUDA officials had submitted a letter for demolition of the structure to avoid any mishap.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-buildings-tilt-dangerously-after-heavy-rain-owners-asked-to-demolish-structures/story-OKAPUySwVSeIJwlD5NUyRM.html
21-08-2020||City||Nuh: Mid-day meal beneficiaries await regular ration||Even as government schools in Nuh have been shut for more than five months in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, many students in the district are still waiting for a regular supply of dry ration as promised by the Haryana government in lieu of the mid-day meals.  With schools being shut down amid the growing Covid-19 threat, the state government in March had decided to deliver ration at home monthly to students who are beneficiaries of mid-day meals. However, many students in Nuh said they had either not received the ration at all or received it only once in the last few months. In a directive shared with district elementary education officers on March 20, the state elementary education department had directed them to deposit cooking costs to eligible students in their bank accounts and provide dry ration as well. The amount of ration and cooking costs were initially calculated for 10 days. Subsequently, ration distribution was extended and is now expected to continue until schools remain closed. On a monthly basis, 150 grams of wheat and 100 grams of rice are to be provided to students. The cooking cost was also revised and increased by 10%. Currently, the cooking costs per day per child is ₹4.97 for primary classes and ₹7.45 for upper primary. The monthly cooking cost is calculated based on the number of working days. 9-year-old Neha, a class 6 student, who studies in the neighbourhood government school in Asaisika village, said she received dry ration only once since the nationwide lockdown was imposed. Her mother Sushma said that officials from the education department had distributed dry ration comprising rice, dry milk powder, and some pulses in April and the family has not received any ration since then . “We received ration once in April but not after that. Most people we know have also received it only once. We have not received any money in lieu of mid-day meals either,” said Sushma. Jan Mohammad, a resident of Kotla village in Nuh, said most families of government school students in Kotla had received ration only once. Three of his siblings study in the village government school and are mid-day meal beneficiaries, he said, adding that only his brother, a class 5 student, had received dry ration from the school sometime in April. “We don’t get prior information about the distribution of ration. If people get to know about ration dispersal through word of mouth, they are able to collect it from the school on the day of distribution, or else they miss the chance,” said Mohammad. He said that students had been called to the school to collect ration kits comprising 100 grams of rice and pulses each. However, he did not receive the cooking cost. “I checked my account but no amount of money towards cooking costs had been deposited,” said Mohammad. Mohammad Jubair, another Kotla resident, whose son is a Class 8 student, said that he had neither received dry ration nor the cooking costs. “Some people in the village collected ration earlier but we did not receive anything,” said Jubair. Kapil Kumar Punia, district elementary education officer, Nuh, however, said that the government had been distributing ration for every month since the lockdown. “Initially, we were asked to deliver ration for 10 days. Later, it was extended for April, May, and June. Sometimes there are delays since funds are released by the Centre but we provide ration to all. Since many blocks need to be covered, the timing can vary but everyone will get the ration,” said Punia. He added that the department was currently distributing ration for four months, to last till October. He said that cooking costs couldn’t be delivered to several students since they didn’t have bank accounts. To counter this problem, the department had started delivering cooking costs to accounts of parents, said Punia. “There are students who don’t have bank accounts. They are deprived of the benefits. To resolve this problem, we have sought bank account details from parents and are sending money,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nuh-mid-day-meal-beneficiaries-await-regular-ration/story-cZQnz3QUx1XgoUHzB8wYLJ.html
21-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram completes second round of serological survey; results by August-end||The three-day exercise of conducting the second round of serological survey in the district was completed on Friday with a total of 850 blood samples being collected to detect IgG antibodies developed against the SARS-CoV-2 virus among the population. The survey, which started on Wednesday, was affected by the incessant rain and waterlogging the district witnessed on that day, said officials. Teams comprising lab technicians, medical officers and health workers collected 90 blood samples on Wednesday, followed by 500 samples on Thursday, and 260 samples on Friday. Similar exercise is being conducted across the state in the 21 other districts to trace the prevalence of the infection and identify individuals who have developed immunity against the infection. At least 21,000 people are supposed to be covered under the survey. Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, said, “The state will be releasing the survey results by the end of August. The results from the all the districts will be collated and analysed to understand the prevalence of infection and take measures accordingly.”The purpose of the serological test is not to detect the virus but the presence of antibodies in the blood developed against the virus. It is body’s immune response against the coronavirus that produces these antibodies. Antibodies against the infection are not developed in the early days of infection. As such, these antibodies are not detected before seven to 14 days. It is for this reason the serological test is not used for diagnosing active infection. The test is also used to detect the antibodies level in recovered Covid-19 patients who can donate a part of their blood called convalescent plasma to critical Covid-19 patients.The district’s chief medical officer(CMO), Dr Virender Yadav, said that the survey has been conducted following all the protocols issued by the state government. “Samples were collected from 16 clusters, including four in urban areas and 12 in rural areas. “Urban clusters include Tigra, Patel Nagar, Khandsa and Basai. The 12 clusters in rural areas were Daulatabad, Badshahpur, Pataudi, Bajghera, Palra, Sherpur, Sarai, Aklimpur, Inchhapuri, Bhudka, Bhorakalan and Rathiwas. The district had conducted the first round of serological survey from June 24 till mid-July. At that time, 454 IgG antibody tests were carried out, out of which 56 were found to be positive and 398 negative. The neighbouring state of Delhi on Thursday released the results of its second serological survey, which covered at least 15,000 people and showed that 29.1% of the city’s population has developed antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Findings showed that the prevalence of antibodies increased by over 6 percentage points as compared to the first survey held in June-July. At that time 22.86% people were detected with antibodies. In the first survey, 21,387 samples were collected, while 15,000 were collected in the second round.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-completes-second-round-of-serological-survey-results-by-august-end/story-cxGyiV4nB3BB9t4jCxhxiM.html
21-08-2020||City||Night curfew from 7pm leaves traders, restaurateurs in Ludhiana sleepless||Already reeling under losses due to low footfall amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the weekend lockdown, traders, gym owners and the hospitality sector are worried over the Punjab government’s decision to impose stricter night curfew between 7pm and 5am. While traders rue that the decision will dent their efforts to make up for the losses suffered during the lockdown, hotel and restaurant owners claim they may be forced to shut down their establishments. They have sought relief in the night curfew norms to keep their businesses afloat.“Hoteliers are already receiving tepid response due to Covid-19 and now the restaurant business will also be affected at large,” said Amarjit Singh, executive member of the Ludhiana Hotel and Restaurants Association.“To adhere to the curfew starting at 7pm, owners have to close their establishments by 6pm. The government has allowed us to serve drinks in the restaurants, but who will come to enjoy drinks or have dinner by 6pm? The footfall was less than 5% on Friday,” he added.Proprietor of Bistro Flamme Bois, Pakhowal Road, Vishal Malhotra said, “More patrons had started coming in after the government allowed restaurants to remain open till 10pm. But, the new curfew timings in no time again will take a toll on the already shaky business. We have been receiving only around 35% footfall post lockdown.”TRADERS IN SAME BOATTraders have also sought that they be allowed to keep their shops open longer and the lockdown restrictions on Saturday be lifted. “Our business has already dropped by 50%. With increased curfew hours, even fewer customers will come in. We started closing shops around 6pm on Friday as there was less than quarter of the usual footfall,” said Parampal Singh Witty, president of Chaura Bazaar Shopkeepers Association, adding that the government should allow the shops to remain open till at least 8pm.GYM OWNERS SWEATINGGyms are the worst affected as they had reopened only on August 5 after keeping their operations suspended for over four months.Struggling to tide over their losses, they said curfew starting at 7pm will derail their efforts as most customers visit gyms in the evening after work.Director of Gym Ekta Welfare Association, Ramesh Bangar said, “Customers are anyway few and far between due to risk of infection. Many gyms are on the brink of closure due to low footfall and hefty operating costs involving rent, electricity bills and salaries.”“Most fitness enthusiasts visit gyms after 7pm, so how can gyms survive with the advanced night curfew? Residents need to take precautions in view of the rising Covid-19 cases, but the government should also allow businesses to remain open till 9 or 10pm,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/night-curfew-from-7pm-leaves-traders-restaurateurs-in-ludhiana-sleepless/story-cleVCyR8HYuusAiu0hIrlI.html
21-08-2020||Bangalore||Siddaramaiah asks BJP leader to introspect about commitment to social harmony||Presenting figures about the victims of violence in the state, former chief minister of Karnataka Siddaramaiah on Friday said BJP leader Nalin Kumar Kateel should introspect about his commitment to social harmony.“You have said that 24 Hindus were killed in communal violence during 2013-18. But if you include both Hindus and Muslims, the number of victims is not just 24 but 45. Our party had released facts about the deaths. Read it and introspect about your commitment to social harmony,” Siddaramaiah said.“Those accused of the murder of 10 Hindus during 2013-18 belong to PFI and SDPI. And the accused in the murder of 11 Muslims and Hindus are from Bajarang Dal and Hindu Jagarana Vedike. So, which outfits will you ban?” he asked.“Do you remember that your party @BJP4Karnataka had become a laughing stock when you had included a living person, named Ashok Pujari, in the list of murdered people sent to the Central govt during my tenure?” he asked.The former CM asked that in the murder case of Paresh Mesta of Honnavara, why don’t they pressurise CBI to nab the culprits? When will you help his family get justice? he asked“Your best friend Naresh Shenoy is the main accused in the murder of Hindu RTI activist Vinayaka Baliga. Who is protecting your friend? When will you ensure that justice is delivered in this case?” Siddaramaiah asked.“You may be both intellectually and emotionally bankrupt and continue to light communal fires for political gains. But true Hindus are intelligent enough to see through your act of treason!” he said.The comments of Siddaramaiah came after Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai on August 20 said that chief minister BS Yediyurappa will discuss with the Centre regarding the banning of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) for its alleged role in the violence which erupted in Bengaluru on August 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/siddaramaiah-asks-bjp-leader-to-introspect-about-commitment-to-social-harmony/story-j9qtsOK71jsTtyNOaoVxrO.html

21-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi hotels asked to anti-Covid-19 measures like e-wallets, disposable menus||The DDMA on Friday issued an order, asking hotels to open in the city with various anti-Covid-19 measures, including use of contactless processes like e-wallets, undertaking deep cleaning of washrooms and proper crowd management on its premises.It also prescribed use of disposable menus, social distancing at buffet, restricted numbers in elevators and use of escalators with a person on alternate steps.The representatives of the hotel associations in Delhi also met Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and thanked him for opening the hotel industry.During the meeting, the chief minister said all the stakeholders have to work together to strengthen Delhi’s economy. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in its meeting on Wednesday had given its approval for opening of hotels, restaurants and weekly markets in the city.The order issued on Friday by DDMA said “hotels will be permitted to operate throughout the National Capital Territory of Delhi in all areas, except the containment zones, subject to strict compliance of standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on June 4, 2020, and other instructions and guidelines of Government of India and Government of NCT of Delhi from time to time.” According to the Union Health ministry’s SOP, proper crowd management inside and outside hotel premises like parking lots should be ensured and large gatherings at the hotels should be prohibited.Besides general precautions like social distancing, use of face cover and hand and respiratory hygiene, it prescribes furnishing details like travel and medical history as well as identity proof by the guests at the reception.It also states that gaming arcades and play areas for children shall be closed and the hotels must adopt contactless processes like QR code, online forms, digital payments like e-wallets for check-in and check outs.It also prescribes air conditioning to be maintained in the range of 24-30 degrees Celsius and relative humidity at 40-70 per cent. Valet staff will use face covers and disinfect key, steering and door of vehicles of the guest, it said.Earlier, during the meeting with representatives of hotel associations, Kejriwal thanked the hotel industry, saying when coronavirus was at its peak, the hotels supported the government in enhancing the capacity of beds for treatment of patients.Kejriwal said even though the central government was against the opening of the hotel industry in Delhi out of a fear that the cases might rise again, it was a very important step in reviving the economy of Delhi.“The Central government was against the idea of opening the hotel industry in Delhi, and I would not blame them because the Centre must have thought that the cases might rise again. “But I explained to them that the hotels are functioning in areas where the cases of corona are rising in the country. Either the Centre should shut the hotels down across the entire country, or open it in the region where the corona is under control,” he said.  The chief minister said there were two challenges -- how to end the spread of the virus  and reviving the economy of Delhi because businesses have been shut and jobs have been lost due to the pandemic.“I am happy that since June 1, when the central government had opened the lockdown, and after we went ahead to lift the lockdown in Delhi on their directions, we did not have the need to re-impose the lockdown in the capital,” he said.He said Delhi government planned in detail for this and once the lockdown was lifted on June 1, the government did feel that the situation was getting out of hands during first 15-20 days, but it took support of all and reinstated normalcy and control in Delhi, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hotels-asked-to-anti-covid-19-measures-like-e-wallets-disposable-menus/story-Mli9SykpRmQrrNxVR4HgAK.html

His son was tested positive for coronavirus after he developed flu-like symptoms on Thursday. It is suspected that the elderly man died of Covid-19. However, the health department cremated the body as per Covid protocol, but no sample was taken after the person’s death. The victim’s son said: “My father was not a Covid-19 patient. On Friday, I was tested positive for Covid-19 and the authorities suspected that my father might also have the infection.”“A few days ago my father was operated as he had a urinary tract infection. On Friday morning, he complained of uneasiness and died at around 5 am,” he said adding that the health authorities did not collect his father’s sample posthumously but cremated the body as per Covid protocol. He said as per WHO guidelines only one family member was allowed to attend the funeral. Civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said: “It is still a suspected Covid-19 death. With the shortage of ambulances and with three bodies of Covid-19 victims left to be cremated, we have to ensure the safety of other persons. We presume that there were 50% chances that the elderly man was Covid-19 positive. With the rising Covid-19 cases and limited resources, it really doesn’t matter if one number goes up and down, what matters is ensuring the safety of people.”Public health expert and former dean of PGIMER Rajesh Kumar said: “The Centre has given instructions that on death certificate, there is a provision to declare suspected Covid-19 death on the basis of clinical grounds. If a test is conducted and reports comes positive then the suspected death can be converted to positive death.”He said that in this case the suspicion is quite high as his son was Covid-19 positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-samples-taken-even-as-pinjore-man-cremated-under-covid-protocol/story-akAobYTBZkX6lgZ7LxqpXI.html
21-08-2020||Chandigarh||Routine healthcare services pick up pace in PGI||After a slow start, routine healthcare services that saw a sudden disruption at the onset of the pandemic picked up pace in the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research.The institute, which provides tertiary healthcare services to the north Indian states, has seen the number of hospitalisations and surgeries being doubled from April to July. However, no decision has yet been taken to re-open physical OPDs.Statistics shared by the institute show that 1,122 surgeries were performed in April, which have now been increased to 2,717. Emergency ward admissions have increased from 2,022 admissions to 3,773. Trauma and related admissions, indoor patient admissions have also seen a jump.“We are striking a balance between regular services and the Covid-19 services for patients. Regular services which were partially disturbed after the outbreak of the pandemic are being brought back on track,” official spokesperson, Professor Ashok Kumar said.Professor Jagat Ram, director PGIMER stated, “Being a tertiary care hospital, it is our responsibility not only to focus on the pandemic but the regular health needs of our patients. Despite the challenges of infection spread, a huge influx in emergency and rising infection numbers, we are trying to handle it. No decision on restoring OPD servicesEvery day the PGIMER receives 12,000 patients on an average for the consultation services at OPDs that were shut since March 20.“The pandemic is on the upswing and we don’t want the institute to emerge as a Covid-19 hotspot which is also stopping us from reopening physical OPD services,” Professor Jagat Ram said.‘Need for adopting a better model’Professor Ashok Kumar said, “With daily Covid-19 cases crossing the 100-mark, we are in the midst of a big challenge, which can be met only with collaborative efforts.”“It is essential that a model should be adopted where one critical Covid Care Centre for patient capacity as per estimates is set up at PGIMER without hampering normal services,” Professor Ashok Kumar said.Recently in addition to the 200-bed dedicated Covid hospital, PGI will increase the capacity by 100 more beds as directed by the UT administration.As on date, 30-bed capacity has already been earmarked in the Advanced Paediatric Centre and another 80-bed capacity has been earmarked in a dedicated hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/routine-healthcare-services-pick-up-pace-in-pgi/story-oFtuOG5DvpWuN92gB61sEM.html

21-08-2020||City||Two booked for cheating travel company owners||The Kharghar police have booked two men after they allegedly cheated two tour and travel company owners by taking their car on rent and then trying to sell them online. The accused men had rented four cars from the duo worth ₹28 lakh, said police.The complainant Vashi resident Anilkumar Shukla, 41, runs a tour and travels firm based in Belapur. On August 3, he came across a classified ad online and got in touch with one Shailesh Dabhane, a Bhiwandi resident.Dabhane allegedly told Shukla that he and his partner need vehicles on rent. On August 7, Shukla met Dabhane and his business partner Mitesh Bhanushali in Panvel at Bhanushali’s apartment. The duo told Shukla that they drive employees of both private and public firms to their workplaces and Bhanushali even showed him a driver’s identity card as proof.After discussions, Shukla recommended a seven-seater vehicle. The men agreed at a monthly rental of ₹25,000 for the car and additional ₹9 per kilometre if the vehicle is driven for over 6000 kilometres.Shukla then contacted his friend Krishna Behra, who also runs a tour and travels company, and the latter agreed to give his three cars on rent. Bhanushali then made an advance payment of ₹47,000 to Shukla in two separate transactions, said police.On August 13, Bhanushali called Shukla requesting another vehicle on rent as he needed to go to Akola. Shukla gave him his brother’s car at a rental of ₹12 per kilometre. Collectively, Bhanushali and his business partner took four Multi-utility vehicles (MUV) from the Shukla and Behra worth Rs 28 lakh.“Bhanushali told Shukla he will return the car by August 14 evening. However, he did not return that night and instead Shukla received a speeding ticket for his vehicle which was found speeding in Malegaon. When Bhanushali did not answer Shukla’s calls, he visited the man’s Panvel apartment but he was not there,” said an officer from Kharghar police station.On August 15, Behra was shocked to come across an advertisement on WhatsApp where his car was listed for sale at ₹2.65 lakh. They figured out that Bhanushali was attempting to sell the car. They then traced another of Behra’s vehicle in Amravati using GPS location.When the accused duo continued evading his queries over returning the cars, he approached the Kharghar police on Monday where a cheating case was registered. No arrests have been made so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-booked-for-cheating-travel-company-owners/story-qiX4gule7vZIp8x95HaQqJ.html

They have sensitized various mandals, distributed masks, face shields and sanitizers to organisers.Shiv Sena Parel corporator Sindhutai Masurkar, whose area boasts of a lot of Ganesh Mandals, said he had been helping them with sanitizer stands apart from Pooja kits.“I am distributing sanitizer stands to all the mandals and also other facilities for them,” Masurkar said before adding, “I have till now distributed 1200 Pooja kits to those residents who bring Ganesh idol at their homes.”Mumbadevi Congress legislator Amin Patel has started a special free taxi service for all households wishing to bring the idol home as well as for taking it to the immersion spots. “I am giving free masks, face shields as well as customised sanitizers to all the mandals in my area,” said Patel. BJP Ghatkopar legislator Ram Kadam has been conducting meetings with all the mandals in his constituency. “I am stressing that this year, the festival needs to be restricted to just religious customs and all gatherings should be shunned. Majority of them have subscribed to this,” said Kadam.Also Read: Wet Ganesh Chaturthi expected: IMD predicts heavy rain this weekendThis year, the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has framed strict rules for the mandals including restricting the size of the idol as well as the number of people taking part in the festivities.

Taking up the SLP, the apex court has issued a notice to Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana.

Jagjeet Singh had demanded that the recommendations of the Bureau of Police Research and Development, 2006, whereby weekly-offs and fixed duty hours were recommended, be implemented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/seeking-8-hour-shift-ut-cop-moves-sc/story-8nlG36DAjZpfV7juVSBE8O.html
21-08-2020||Chandigarh||Light to moderate rain likely to continue in Chandigarh||After 28mm rain on Friday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that light to moderate rain is likely to continue in the city in the coming days as well.IMD officials said, “Chances of rain are likely to go down on Sunday and only light rain up to 20 mm is expected. However, from Monday, rain up to 50 mm is on the cards. Thunder and gusty winds up to 45 km/h can also be expected in the city.”Due to light spells of rain throughout the day on Friday, the maximum temperature fell down from 32.1°C on Thursday to 29°C on Friday, four degrees below normal. Meanwhile, the minimum temperature fell down from 25.4°C on Thursday to 24.9°C on Friday. In the next three days, the maximum temperature will remain between 30°C and 31°C while the minimum temperature will hover around 26°C.Sukhna water-level goes upFollowing moderate spells of rain this week, the water-level of Sukhna Lake has increased to 1161.7-ft. A week ago, it had just touched 1160-ft after over 200 mm of rain in two days. The water-level is yet to reach the danger mark of 1163-ft. Officials of the UT administration say they are monitoring the situation. “Floodgates of the lake are opened when the water level touches the 1163-ft mark. This was done last in 2018,” they said. Due to the catchment of the lake, water-level increases significantly more during heavier spells of rain. Due to this, officials said the water-level is unlikely to reach the danger mark in the next few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/light-to-moderate-rain-likely-to-continue-in-city/story-IjYAgNDGuGbsk7dgocHM5M.html

21-08-2020||Chandigarh||Pandemic sets back Chandigarh railway station makeover project by a year||The Chandigarh railway station makeover project is set to be delayed by almost a year as no work has been done for the last six months due to the pandemic outbreak, railway authorities confirmed on Friday. The station was to get a world-class makeover by the end of 2021 but authorities say they are now planning to finish the work by December 2022. During an online interaction, Indian Railway Station Development Corporation (IRSDC)’s representative to Chandigarh, Balbir Singh, said, “The work has been stalled due to the pandemic. We are hopeful that the work is likely to begin between October and December. It will take two years to finish once it is started, so by December 2022, the makeover of Chandigarh railway station is likely to be finished.” The Rs 136-crore project was awarded to Ludhiana-based Deepak Builders and Engineers Pvt Ltd on October 30, 2019, under the public-private partnership (PPP) model. Under this, the station will be beautified and developed from both sides-- Chandigarh and Panchkula. An ‘air concourse’, on the lines of airport terminals, will also be developed for all six platforms with facilities such as a VIP waiting room, a coffee house, ATM machines, etc. Subways will be put in place to segregate passenger flow and prevent chaos at the station. The station will also have new lights, four new lifts, twelve escalators, baggage scanners and bottle crushing machines. Although a delay is expected, DRM Gurinder Mohan Singh assured that all the facilities that were listed in the earlier contract will still be provided. More CCTVs to come up With the expansion of the railway station, more closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras are likely to come up at the station for better safety. Currently, 35 CCTV cameras are installed at the station but their recordings are of poor quality as per sources. DRM Gurinder Mohan Singh confirmed that by the next financial year, the station will have 80 to 100 cameras in all. “Right now, since many trains aren’t working, installation of CCTV cameras will be done by the next financial year, after services have normalised.” The DRM added that during the lockdown, the Ambala division had achieved additional 23 rakes of vehicle loading from Chandigarh railway station. During the lockdown, upto July, the division had been able to increase the revenue from Rs 829.92 crore last year to Rs 944.52 crore this year while they were able to reduce their expenditure upto July from Rs 610.36 crore last year to Rs 530.25 crore this year. As many as 144 Shramik Special trains were run by the division during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pandemic-sets-back-chandigarh-railway-station-makeover-project-by-a-year/story-Er5CWxGwEScuSoL1s2dtBP.html

Consequently, residents have been left with no other option, but to rush to neighbouring Amritsar and Jalandhar districts for treatment.The district health department has 100 beds in the isolation ward of the civil hospital and 100 in the PTU for level-1 and level-2 patients only, and the district does not have any level-3 bed to treat critical patients.Level 1 is for patients requiring advanced respiratory support alone or monitoring and support for two or more organ systems; Level 2 for patients requiring more detailed observation or intervention including support for a single failing organ system or post-operative care and those ‘stepping down’ from higher levels of care and Level 3 for critical and in need of ICU and ventilator, including pregnant and aged patients.As on date, only 88 patients are being treated at government hospital in the district, 152 are in home isolation, but many prefer to take treatment from private hospitals in Jalandhar. The district has reported 110 positive cases over the seven days. Over the same period, seven deaths have been reported, of which six were being treated at Jalandhar private hospitals.Most of 30 patients who have died, to date, were over 50, and had co-morbidities. A senior doctor said many died due to not getting timely treatment, as a critical patient needs attention on ventilators equipped with two high-flow nasal oxygen therapy machines, multi-para monitors, pulse oximeters, infusion pumps and suction machines. “On August 19, a 54-year-old man died at the isolation ward of the hospital on August 19,” the doctor added. District nodal officer Dr Sandeep Dhawan admitted that the district does not have any level-3 bed. “We have tied-up with Government Medical College and Hospital, Amritsar, and critical patients are sent there,” he added.

21-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC asks cops to show videos of Pinjra Tod member making instigating speeches||The Delhi High Court Friday asked Delhi Police to show the videos of a member of Pinjra Tod group, a women’s collective, allegedly making instigating speeches during the communal violence in northeast Delhi early this year.The police, however, said they do not have the videos of the time when the group’s member Devangana Kalita, a JNU student, was allegedly making instigating speeches during the riots incident.The police said it has the videos of her allegedly instigating people before the riots took place on February 24 and 25 and also of February 22 and 23 when a large gathering was sitting and protesting outside Jafrabad metro station in northeast Delhi against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).While hearing the arguments on Kalita’s bail plea in a case related to the communal violence in Delhi during protests against the CAA, Justice Suresh Kumar Kait said, “Show me any portion of the speech recorded by the media or anyone else which showed that Kalita instigated the mob to commit the crime.” During that period, the media was everywhere and recording everything, the court said.“I want to know what she said which instigated the mob,” the judge said.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S V Raju, appearing for the police, said there was no media on February 25 when the incident happened and the witness accounts showed Kalita’s role in instigating the mob.When the law officer stated that Kalita’s call detail records showed her location to be that spot, the judge said even she has admitted that she was there.“It was well planned and organised at a time when US President Donald Trump was to come here. It was done to damage the image of the country. Public property was destroyed and a large number of people were injured and one person died,” the ASG argued while opposing the bail plea.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing Kalita, said the police was not showing any instigation or speeches allegedly given by her but was only relying on statements of others recorded under the CrPC.The counsel shared a video with the court to show that the police were recording the protest and said the officials were still not showing any videos to the court. “Accused in not a politician. She is an academician and a research scholar. She has already been granted bail in two cases. Let the police show us the video and the hate speech. The police are not showing us that there is any possibility of her fleeing from justice,” Sibal submitted.The high court, after hearing the arguments, reserved its order on the plea challenging a trial court’s order which had dismissed Kalita’s bail application.During the hearing, the ASG said it was a case where a large number of persons were involved and it is not possible that everyone comes in video footage and the evidence showed that Kalita was involved in the riots.Countering Sibal’s arguments, he said the academic record of a person is not required for considering bail and it is the nature of the offence which is required to be seen for bail and whether she can tamper with the evidence.“Others are poor illiterate ladies who were instigated to turn violent. They were given false statements. It was a case of conspiracy and violation of section 144 CrPC order. Poor people were misled by her that they will be thrown out of the country,” Raju contended.He added “they are very clever operators. She is educated and knows the law, so she also knows how to evade the law. It is a very case.” When the court asked the investigating officer in the case whether he had recorded the speech given by Kalita, he said there was a mob of 10,000 people and even media persons were not there and that she was making the statement a kilometre away.“If she was 1 km away, how did you manage to hear what she was saying,” the judge asked.To this, the IO replied the SHO who had gone near Kalita had heard her making an instigating speech.Kalita and another member of the group Natasha Narwal were arrested in the case in May by the Crime Branch of the Delhi police and booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including rioting, unlawful assembly and attempt to murder.They have also been booked under the stringent anti-terror law - Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a separate case related to the communal violence, for allegedly being part of a “premeditated conspiracy” in the riots.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.In all, four cases have been registered against her, including in relation to the northeast Delhi riots earlier this year and violence in old Delhi’s Daryaganj area during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in December last year.Kalita has secured bail in two cases -- Daryaganj and one northeast Delhi matter. On June 14, a trial court had dismissed Kalita’s bail plea on the ground that there was no merit in the application and that it was amply clear from the charge sheet that the investigation was still pending and it has been filed against other accused persons also Pinjra Tod (Break the Cage) was founded in 2015 to make hostels and paying guest accommodations less restrictive for women students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-asks-cops-to-show-videos-of-pinjra-tod-member-making-instigating-speeches/story-HzmG47v7LHVk29PeO5R9GN.html
21-08-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 negative report must for entry to Punjab assembly||Chandigarh: Punjab Vidhan Sabha speaker Rana KP Singh has put in place a detailed precautionary protocol for the one-day monsoon session on August 28, making a Covid-19 negative test report must for entry. Rana KP Singh said that the latest Covid-19 negative report will be mandatory for ministers, legislators, officers, security personnel and staff of Vidhan Sabha to attend the assembly session. The 117-member Vidhan Sabha will meet for the first time since the Covid outbreak. No visitors will be allowed to witness the proceedings. THREE-DAY COVID TESTING CAMP The 12th session of the state assembly has been summoned by governor VP Singh Badnore amid the Covid-19 pandemic to fulfil the constitutional obligation that there should not be a gap of more than six months between two sessions. Covid-19 cases, which are seeing a constant spike, have almost doubled to 38,000 in the past 16 days in the state with one minister, the deputy speaker and some MLAs contracting the virus in the past one week. “The MLAs will have the option to get their coronavirus test conducted in their respective districts or at a three-day camp to be held at MLA Hostel in Chandigarh from August 25 to 27,” an assembly official said. The health department and deputy commissioners have been asked to make arrangements for Covid-19 tests of legislators in districts accordingly. ONLY 20% OF HOUSE STAFF TO BE CALLED The Vidhan Sabha has decided to deploy only 20% of its staff for essential duties and a special camp will be held outside the assembly building to test them for coronavirus. The state government has been asked to deploy only those officers who are required in connection with bills to be taken up when the House conducts legislative business. The official said the House has adequate seating capacity with 105 desks, each meant for two members, but one desk will be assigned to each member to maintain the required social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-negative-report-must-for-entry-to-punjab-assembly/story-AhlQNroMLtocNgfnkogCHK.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||NCB seizes 3,056 ecstasy pills smuggled to Mumbai from Belgium in soft toy parcel||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in Mumbai busted an international drug racket and seized 3,056 tablets of methyl​enedioxy​methamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as ecstasy. The high-quality part drug was illegally trafficked from Belgium to Mumbai by concealing them in false cavities of parcel cartons of soft toys.NCB investigations have also revealed that the ecstasy was meant to be sold for drug parties in Mumbai. A couple has also been arrested by NCB in connection with the drug racket. The Central anti-narcotics agency said that this is the largest seizure of ecstasy by NCB.According to NCB officers, acting on specific inputs, the Mumbai zonal unit, under the supervision of zonal director Ugam Dan Charan, on August 10 seized a total of 3,010 of MDMA pills, weighing around 969 grams, from a parcel containing soft toys at DHL Express India (P) Ltd, Goregaon (West).Further probe revealed that the drugs were sourced from Belgium. Unlike previous traditional methods in which drugs are hidden inside soft toys, this time the smugglers concealed them inside a false cavity in the cardboard box containing the consignment.During the investigation, the NCB team arrested a couple from Navi Mumbai and recovered 46 tablets (17.5 grams) of MDMA from their residence. H Choudhary and R Batharey had sourced the drug from Brussels, Belgium. They were arrested under relevant sections of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. They were remanded in judicial custody by a Mumbai court.“The ecstasy pills which were in different colours – orange, pink and green – were meant for supply in the party circuits of Mumbai,” said an NCB officer.Deputy director (operations) of NCB, KPS Malhotra said that the agency suspects links of Central European drug traffickers in the racket. “The seized drug is of high quality and it was meant for drug parties. From the findings of the investigation so far, we believe that the racket was using crypto-currency to fund the transfers,” Malhotra said.“The arrested couple would send the drugs to party organisers in India. We investigated the links of this case to the wider syndicate trafficking supply of party drugs into India,” he added.In a statement, NCB said that as per United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) World Drug Report 2020, ecstasy continues to be manufactured primarily in Europe, most notably in Western and Central Europe. Europe accounts for two-thirds of the ecstasy laboratories dismantled worldwide.“The total quantity of ecstasy seized worldwide has doubled over the period 2009-2018. This is also reflected in the rapidly increasing popularity of such synthetic drugs in India,” NCB stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ncb-seizes-3-056-ecstasy-pills-smuggled-to-mumbai-from-belgium-in-soft-toy-parcel/story-mC0G0ceEH2A3WmJLsoAeoJ.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||Oval Maidan-sized green cover wiped out from Thane creek section over 10 years: Report||A nine-hectare (ha) green cover, which is around the size of South Mumbai’s Oval Maidan, has been wiped out over the past decade from a section of the Thane creek in the densely populated Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).A comparative decadal study, using satellite images, conducted between April 2010 and April 2020 for the Kolshet creek area, adjacent to Kolshet village and Balkum pipeline, located on Vasai creek, which meets Ulhas river and is a part of the Thane creek, has revealed a loss of 9.43 ha green cover.The authorities, who carried out the study, have attributed the green cover loss to debris dumping, encroachments, dumping of plastic and hazardous waste.The loss of mangroves, along with other vegetation, rings alarm bells for Thane, including flooding concerns, according to Muse Foundation, an environmental group that released the report on Thursday.The group submitted their findings to Maharashtra government’s mangrove cell and Bombay high court (HC)-appointed mangroves conservation committee.Stalin D, a member of the HC-appointed committee, said the matter would be taken up during its next meeting.The report, which called for restoring the green patch, highlighted the altered land use and land cover changes and raised concerns over the ecological damage. It identified the alarming scale of encroachments and debris dumping on the site with photographic evidence.“These mangroves are extremely important to Thane due to current climatic conditions and frequent flooding. In the past, Kolshet had reported major flooding because of a swollen Thane creek,” said Nishant Bangera, founder, Muse Foundation.The report pointed out instances of debris being covered by mud and letting weeds grow in a bid to evade surveillance of authorities.The stretch is covered with waste because heaps of plastic from Thane city are routinely washed through the streams.“The debris also consists of construction and biomedical waste, broken liquor bottles and other hazardous waste materials. Encroachments, ranging from shanties to recycling plants, are also threatening the local biodiversity,” said Bangera.He pointed out that the encroachments increased during the recent coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced lockdown restrictions.In September 2018, Bombay HC had banned mangrove destruction along the Maharashtra coastline and stopped any construction within 50 metres from the trees. “We will investigate the submissions made in the report. However, the majority of Thane mangrove patches, except for Bhiwandi (600 ha), falls under the revenue department or the Thane Municipal Corporation’s (TMC) jurisdiction. It needs to be handed over to us for better security,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF) (mangrove cell).Rohit Joshi, a member of the Thane district wetland committee, said the site was slated to be developed by TMC under its waterfront project.Joshi had filed a petition before the HC against the project but the court had rejected his submission last September. “Development work in low-lying areas, including Kolshet, near the creek has resulted in submergence during heavy rains causing great risk to both human lives and properties. This year, too, these sites were flooded again due to random ecological destruction,” said Joshi.A TMC executive engineer said the waterfront project was the solution to alleged environmentally destructive activities at the site. “We have planned the waterfront, spread over 2.5 ha at Kolshet, along with seven other such locations in Thane on government land for local residents to use open spaces such as mangrove trail, small promenades, playgrounds, among other facilities. At least 50% of the area will have fresh mangrove plantations. We will ensure that encroachments and debris dumping are stopped forthwith to make way for these projects,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/oval-maidan-sized-green-cover-wiped-out-from-thane-creek-section-over-10-years-report/story-kdUpHNy6MYZ4xSspHWhNFM.html

21-08-2020||Chandigarh||Widening of Parwanoo-Solan highway in Himachal hits Covid hurdle, set to miss second deadline||The National Highway 22 four-laning project between Parwanoo and Solan is set to miss its extended deadline of September 30, 2020, chiefly due to lack of coordination among the multiple agencies executing it. Though the widening of the highway is meant to curtail the travel time to Shimla, work has been in slow progress on the 40-km stretch after hitting roadblocks, the latest being the labour shortage amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “Though we haven’t set a new deadline but we hope to complete the work by December-end. The labour shortage due to the coronavirus crisis has hit progress,” says National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) regional officer GSS Sangha. “There were around 1,200 workers deployed on the project, but even now many migrant labourers, who left for their native places amid the pandemic, have not returned,” says Sangha. 88% OF EXPANSION COMPLETE IN STAGE 1 NHAI had allocated the four-laning work on the 40-km stretch connecting Himachal Pradesh’s Parwanoo and Solan towns to GR Infra Projects Limited but lack of coordination between different agencies has delayed the project that was to be completed by September-end. This despite 88% of the work on the expansion of the stretch already completed. Work on the project started on September 21, 2015, and was scheduled to be completed on March 21, 2018. But due to hurdles, the next date of completion of the project was fixed for September 30, 2020. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 748.7 crore for the first stage. HURDLES ON THE WAY The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had halted the felling of trees for the highway widening, while the loose strata of soil in areas where the cutting had taken place led to landslides, hampering the project. The lack of coordination in getting permission for approach roads to the 681-metre flyover in Kumarhatti added to the delay. Land acquisition for 300 metres of stretch on both sides of the flyover was also delayed. At present, work is underway at snail’s pace on the road over the 160-metre bridge near the Timber Trail resort road junction. ONLY 18% WORK DONE IN STAGE 2 Work on the second stage of the project’s 23-km stretch from Solan to Kaithlighat was awarded to Ms Airef Engineer Private Limited and Parkash Esphaltings and Toll Highways Limited on March 28, 2018. The company started work in November that year and is scheduled to complete the Rs 598-crore four-laning by May 2021. So far, only 18% of the work on the project has been completed. There is a proposal to build a 460-metre tunnel and 368-metre flyover in Kandaghat. But the government is yet to allot a dumping site for debris being extracted for the road widening. Work on the 27.5-metre road stretch between Kaithlighat and Dhalli has been hit after the government terminated the concessionaire agreement in 2019 even though the agreement for work was reached with M/s Shiv Valley Highways Limited. The Himachal Pradesh government plans to enhance amenities along the highway between Parwanoo and Shimla. There is a proposal to construct shopping malls along the highway. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, who also holds the public works department charge, has directed the NHAI to complete the project by the year-end. WORK IN PROGRESS September 21, 2015: Work on the 40-km Parwanoo-Solan four-laning project starts. March 21, 2018: Initial deadline for project to be completed. March 28, 2018: Work on second stage for 23-km stretch from Solan to Kaithlighat allotted. September 30, 2020: Extended deadline for completion of project that is set to be missed, too. COST FACTOR Estimated cost of project’s stage 1: Rs 748.7 crore Estimated cost of stage 2: Rs 598 crore||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/widening-of-parwanoo-solan-highway-in-himachal-hits-covid-hurdle-set-to-miss-second-deadline/story-wpfNPDHU1qKqfVO70lbavL.html
21-08-2020||Chandigarh||Supreme Court dismisses bail plea of Tarn Taran blast case accused||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed the bail application of Malkit Singh alias Shera, one of the accused in connection with the blast that took place in Punjab’s Tarn Taran district in September last year. A bench headed by Justice NV Ramana dismissed the plea saying it cannot grant bail to the accused. The accused, Malkit Singh, had earlier applied for bail on health grounds in the Punjab and Haryana high court and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Mohali, both of which were dismissed by the respective courts. Before the NIA court, he had sought bail contending that he was falsely implicated and that he was a patient of diabetes. The prosecution had submitted before the NIA court that during the course of investigation, incriminating role of the accused had emerged and that he was highly radicalised towards the Khalistan movement and he was part of a gang that had planned terrorist activities. The NIA court observed that evidence pointed to the accused was an active member of the pro-Khalistan terrorist gang, adding that it was of the opinion that there was sufficient ground for believing that accusation against the applicant/accused is prima facie true. The NIA had in March this year filed a chargesheet against nine accused in connection with Tarn Taran blast case before a special NIA court. Two persons were killed and one was injured in the blast, which took place in Tarn Taran on September 4 last year, when the victims were reportedly digging a pit to retrieve a concealed explosive consignment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/supreme-court-dismisses-bail-plea-of-tarn-taran-blast-case-accused/story-qkGPGFTzpMOAaTmlTvsgNO.html
21-08-2020||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh govt to table 17 important Bills in Assembly on Saturday||The Uttar Pradesh government would table 17 important Bills in the state assembly on Saturday and it is expected to be approved instantly.These 17 Bills were slated to be tabled on Friday but due to death of a BJP member Janmejay Singh, the assembly was adjourned for the day and all the agenda have been shifted to Saturday.Official sources here on Friday said the government is prepared to bring these bills and is ready to reply to any queries of the members.The state government had implemented major ordinances after the outbreak of Covid-19, related to the postponement of MLA funds, cuts in the salary of ministers and legislators and preventing attacks on frontline workers.The ordinances brought by the state government are required to get the approval of the Legislature under constitutional obligation. After the passage of the Bill, the Governor will also have to approve them, after which they will be considered as finalised.In March this year, Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel had promulgated an ordinance for recovery of damages to public and private properties from rioters and protesters, and to provide the setting-up of tribunals to adjudicate claims for damages and recover them. As per the statement of object and reasons (SOR) of the ordinance, it aims at dealing with “all acts of violence at public places and to control its persistence and escalation, and to provide for the recovery of damage to public or private property during hartal, bundh, riots, public commotion or protests.”The Uttar Pradesh Cabinet had approved the ordinance on March 13, a day after a vacation bench of the apex court, comprising justices UU Lalit and Aniruddha Bose, refused to stay the Allahabad High Court’s order for removal of the government’s anti-CAA stir, name-and-shame posters. While hearing an urgent plea by the state government seeking a stay of the high court order, the apex court had refused to grant relief to the government saying that there was no law to support its action.After various incidents of assaults on healthcare workers emerged in the state, the amendment to the Epidemic Act 1987 was done to ensure stricter punishment for those harassing coronavirus frontline workers, which includes doctors, paramedical staff, police personnel and sanitation personnel. Spitting on any worker is also considered an offence under this.Meanwhile, in the month of June earlier this year, the BJP government had approved the Cow-Slaughter Prevention (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020. The amendment calls for stricter punishment for violators and allows the publication of pictures of the accused in prominent spots in the city. It also permits the prosecution of the driver and owner of the vehicle, which was used to carry a cow for the purpose of slaughter.A cabinet meeting chaired by CM Yogi Adityanath approved the amendment to Section 5A of the UP Cow Slaughter Prevention Act 1955. It penalises cow slaughter with jail terms ranging from a minimum of one year to a maximum of 10 years and imposes monetary fines between Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.The new law will also allow the recovery of expenses incurred on the maintenance of recovered cows till they are released to their owners or for a time period of one year, whichever is earlier. The amendment to the Act also makes space for a provision that allows the denial of bail to the accused unless the special prosecutor gets a chance to oppose it.Other key bills that are to be presented during the session include -- Contingency Fund (Amendment) Bill 2020; Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Second (Amendment) Bill 2020; Uttar Pradesh State Legislature Members Achievements and Pension (Amendment) Bill 2020; and the Uttar Pradesh Public Health and Epidemic Disease Control Bill 2020.Some bills related to labour law and industrial management will also be tabled in the assembly, namely, the Uttar Pradesh Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Bill 2020; Uttar Pradesh Factory Disputes (Amendment) Bill 2020; Uttar Pradesh Industrial Area Development (Amendment) Bill 2020 and Temporary Exemption from Certain Labor Laws (Amendment) Bill 2020.The Prisons Act 1894 (Amendment) Bill 2020; Prison Uttar Pradesh (Amendment) Bill, 2020 will also be tabled. Meanwhile, the Value Added Tax Amendment Bill 2020; Ministerial Pay Allowance, and Miscellaneous Provisions (Amendment) Bill 2020; Agricultural Produce Market (Amendment) Bill 2020; Uttar Pradesh Govt Prevention (Amendment) Bill 2020; Uttar Pradesh Self-financed Independent Schools (Fee Regulation) (Amendment) Bill, 2020; Prison Uttar Pradesh (Amendment) Bill, 2020, will too be put forth for approval in the assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-govt-to-table-17-important-bills-in-assembly-on-saturday/story-xY45XdnPssCQHjiB9TjogJ.html

The family was on their way back from Kolkata, where the teenager was undergoing treatment. Their relatives said the car was speeding as the family wanted to return home before the beginning of the 48-hour statewide Covid-19 lockdown from 6 am on Thursday.The accident took place around 4.30 am at the Dak Bungalow intersection on NH-34 at Dhulian, barely two kilometres from the family’s home.The relatives of Saidul Islam, 50, a resident of Tinpakuria village, said he went to Kolkata two days ago for the follow-up treatment of his younger daughter, Nadiba Tabassum. Tabassum, a high school student, was detected with cancer a few months ago and was being treated at a private hospital. Tabassum’s sister, brother and mother also accompanied them to Kolkata.Islam’s wife, Nasima Bibi, elder daughter Nurain Sultana, son Asif Hossain and the driver were admitted to Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital in a critical condition. Islam and Tabassum died on the spot.An officer from Shamserganj police station said, “We have learnt that the car was moving at high speed. We suspect that the driver dozed off and rammed into the parked truck.”Altaf Hossain, a relative of the family, said, “Saidul Islam was unaware that there would be a state-wide lockdown on Thursday and Friday. He had initially planned to return to Murshidabad on Friday. On Wednesday, we told him about the lockdown. It appears that Saidul decided to come home before the lockdown started to avoid running into trouble with police. Apparently, he was ignorant of the fact people travelling for medical emergency are exempted from the restrictions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/cancer-patient-father-die-in-bengal-car-accident-four-critically-injured/story-85kbgktyFUid7RL2eluuJL.html
21-08-2020||Patna||Nothing has changed in Bihar in the last 15 years: Chirag Paswan||Chirag Paswan, Lok Jan Shakti Party president and a Member of Parliament from Bihar’s Jamui constituency, has been vocal in his criticism of the Nitish Kumar-led Bihar government, even though his party is an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA). He pulls no punches in criticising the Bihar government for its alleged failure to take adequate measures in tackling the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and the annual flood woes. He maintains that the upcoming assembly polls, slated to be held in October-November, should not be a priority. In an interview to HT, he said he has conveyed his concerns about holding elections to pick a new assembly to both the Election Commission of India (ECI) as well as the NDA allies. Edited excerpts from the interview: Your party is an ally of the NDA. Yet, there seems to be a disconnect between the LJP and the Janata Dal (United), or JD(U), and there are disagreements on some issues. There is a lot of disagreement between the LJP and the JD(U). The basis of my disagreement is that a lot of promises were made to Bihar that were not delivered. Consider the present scenario. Bihar is facing dual challenges such as the unprecedented Covid-19 outbreak and the annual flood fury that have affected a lot of people. It is a matter of grave concern the way the state machinery is working. I expected my chief minister and my government to perform better and to deliver more, but he (Kumar) has disappointed us all. What has disappointed you the most? Because the government claims it has reached out to people who were stranded during the Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions, it has offered cash through direct benefit transfer (DBT), provided relief materials and made efforts to give jobs to those who returned to the state .The day the migrant worker crisis started I had expected the government to help them and not to leave them to die on highways. I expected that buses would be sent to ferry them back home, as was done by Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath. I don’t know if any DBTs have been done because a lot of people whom I have met don’t seem to have received any. People told me that they had to pay for their train fares. I don’t know if any of these measures reached people on the ground. But the biggest issue right now is the way our government is playing with the lives of the Biharis. A few days ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had held a meeting with a few CMs through a video-conference. Soon after the meeting the PM had tweeted some states are required to improve their testing records and Bihar had topped the list. On that day though about 75,000 tests were conducted, the PM said categorically that there is a need to improve. This implies that something is wrong somewhere. What is also going wrong is that until now about 90% of the testing is being done through the rapid antigen detection (RAD) test, which even the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said should only be conducted in Covid-19 containment zones or during emergencies in hospitals. So not only are we not testing enough, but we are also not doing it the right way. When I say life of Biharis is in danger, JD(U) leaders call me the poet Kalidas for sawing off the proverbial branch I am sitting on. In such a scenario, are you willing to be a part of the NDA? At present, I am not even thinking about elections; I don’t understand how my CM is thinking about elections at a time, when 18 of the districts in the state are flooded and Covid-19 cases are increasing by leaps and bounds on a daily basis. Also Read: Parties see opportunity in Dalit assertion in BiharYou have said this to the ECI, but have you mentioned this to the BJP or raised it at an NDA meeting? At a meeting with the national president of the BJP, JP Nadda, a few weeks ago I had mentioned this to him. I had said our priority should be to control the pandemic and we should not be thinking about the elections. I am neither thinking about the alliance nor assembly polls. So will you participate, if the ECI decides to hold the polls on schedule? The call has to be taken only by the ECI. And if that happens, then we will participate because we are prepared for the elections but we would prefer not to hold them now. As a head of a political party, it is my responsibility to give a correct picture about the state of affairs to the ECI. Political parties are not meant to only contest elections -- to win or strategise. We have a much bigger social responsibility as well. You have listed shortcomings in response to the pandemic and the workers who returned to the state during the lockdown restrictions. What do you think have been the achievements of the Kumar government? Forget about the last five years with which I have had major issues. Let’s talk about the past 15 years. What has changed? If you look at your own archives and compare the pictures of floods from 2005 onwards you will see nothing has changed. This is the primary issue with my state government. Repeatedly, I have shared a road map on how to make our state more developed; I made suggestions on how to counter the flood problem such as by interlinking the state’s rivers. Look at my Lok Sabha constituency Jamui, half of it is affected by droughts and the other half by floods. None of my suggestions have been accepted or acted upon to date. What has been done in the past 15 years to improve the revenue in the state? I agree we need a special state’s status. But why do we need it even after 15 years? For instance, so much could be done to promote religious tourism. Our students spend millions of rupees every year to attend coaching centres in Kota, Rajasthan, where the teachers are also from Bihar. Why can’t this model be replicated in Bihar? Why can’t we hold investment summits in Bihar? With so many differences have you considered walking out of the alliance? This government should now have a common minimum programme (CMP) because unless and until my Bihar First, Bihari First vision document is not incorporated in the new government , there is no point being a part of it. They (the Kumar-led government) have not been listening to us. And if you are going to return to power because of the BJP’s and my party’s support and not listen to us, as you’re (JDU) doing right now, then what can we do? It is important for the government to function on the agenda that comes out of the CMP and not on the one that was formed during the mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) in 2015. Why am I saying this? Because right now, it is the mahagathbandhan agenda, drafted by Kumar and Lalu Prasad five years ago, which is being followed. What has changed? Only the deputy CM, earlier it was the RJD (Rashtriya Janata Dal), now it is the BJP. There is a talk of a third front with you as the CM. I am not overambitious and not saying make me the Bihar CM. But I have hope from my party and we are working hard. And why not? Eventually, there will be a CM from the LJP. At present, my priority is to only rein in Covid-19. Are you going to release your vision document anytime soon? I will release it within 24 hours of the ECI announcing the date of election. I will also request the ECI that they should make it a mandatory for all political parties to release the manifesto at least five-six weeks before the polls, otherwise, they should not be allowed to contest. In the absence of a vision document, politics, invariably, boils down to Hindu-Muslim, caste and identity politics, where development agenda goes for a toss. You said the focus should be on the Covid-19 pandemic and the flood fury, but there is a perception that there is undue attention on the alleged death by suicide of actor Sushant Singh Rajput If things had happened in the right manner the undue attention would not have been needed. I remember when he had passed away on June 14, I called my CM four days later and asked him to proactively intervene because I knew the (Rajput) family and they suspected something fishy. I also spoke twice to Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray. Unfortunately, I got no response. Why this is a matter of concern for me is because a high-profile Bihari died in another state, how will my CM assure the others living outside that they will be taken care of? If the state had put pressure was on the Maharashtra government, the latter would have acted in a different manner. You started off as an actor. What are your views on the debate about nepotism in the film industry? I never had any such experience. I think it’s too early to come to any conclusion, as there are many theories floating around. Whether it is nepotism, or something else, or a personal angle, as suggested by his family, the truth must come out. I don’t know about nepotism in the film industry. I never faced it. But a lot of my acquaintances and friends suggested a theory of too insular and clubby, where a group of biggies keep the outsiders at bay. But truth be told, I don’t know what the facts of the matter are.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/what-has-changed-in-the-in-bihar-last-15-years-chirag-paswan/story-aU4KQCJOyvnx95J2rvLi1O.html

21-08-2020||Chandigarh||Blow to business but Covid curbs needed, say traders as Punjab extends night curfew from today||Amritsar: As Punjab gears up to implement stricter Covid-19 restrictions from Friday night amid surge in coronavirus cases, businessmen, including retailers, traders and restaurant and hotel owners, are concerned about the financial implication of the extended night curfew from 7pm to 5am and weekend lockdown. “When the government had announced a complete lockdown in March, people were serious about the pandemic and were following the guidelines. However, when Covid cases started rising, the government announced relaxations and people stopped following social distancing. The government failed to control the situation and the police inaction against violators led to the rapid spread of the virus. Industry and trade in Punjab has already suffered huge losses and these restrictions will further hit business,” said Pyare Lal Seth, the president of the Punjab Pradesh Vyapar Mandal. “The government has given no respite in taxes and bills to the public. It should help businessmen by waiving bank interest on loans and administrative charges,” Seth said. Surinder Singh, a member of the hotel federation in Amritsar, said: “The tourism sector is already in loss and hotel owners are worst hit. But this is a time to cooperate and help the government in controlling the situation. Covid cases have to be brought down for normalcy to return.” “We are cooperating and following all restrictions and emergency measures. The rules should be implemented strictly so that the chain of infection can be broken,” said Jatinder Singh, a cloth market wholesaler. OPEN MARKETS ON SATURDAY: LUDHIANA TRADERS The Ludhiana-based president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association, Amarvir Singh, said: “Restaurant business will be affected the most. The night curfew begins from 7pm so owners will have to close establishments by 6pm. Who orders dinner at 6pm? Some restaurant owners may be forced to shut down business.” He said traders want the government to extend the closing time till 8pm besides easing lockdown restrictions on Saturday. Model Town Market Association, Ludhiana, president Amarjit Singh said, “There has been a low footfall as it is and most residents venture out only in the evening. What’s wrong in opening shops on Saturday if markets are open on weekdays?” Ludhiana police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal, however, said that market associations have been briefed and police will implement the night curfew strictly. “No one will be allowed to venture out after 7pm except in case of emergency cases,” he said. PUBLIC HEALTH A PRIORITY: BATHINDA RESIDENTS Stricter Covid curbs got a mixed response in Bathinda. While residents welcomed the government’s decision, traders called it a blow to business. Baljit Sandhu, a local resident, said, “The curbs are needed to check the spread of coronavirus infection. People may face hardship but public health deserves priority.” Senior citizen NK Gosain said the state government should have worked more diligently to handle the Covid situation. He said residents have a crucial role to play in following the safety protocol. “The resumption of public transport should have been avoided as physical distancing is not being followed,” he said. Deepak Jindal, a grocer, said sale would be affected but such efforts are needed to curb the spread of the infection. Bathinda-based Satish Arora, who is the state president of the Punjab Hotel Restaurant and Resorts Association, said the hospitality sector is fighting a battle for survival. “The government should plan a relief package for the sector,” he said. “Restricting unnecessary movement of people will be a priority. Residents should understand the gravity of the situation and cooperate,” a police official said. STRICTER ACTION AGAINST DEFAULTERS THIS TIME: PATIALA DCPatiala district has recorded nearly 4,500 coronavirus cases so far and seen 98 Covid deaths. With the district administration set to implement the new guidelines from Friday evening, traders and residents say they have no choice but to abide by the government’s orders. Anant Jain, a shoe trader, said, “We are facing losses but the restrictions are for our and our customers’ safety.” Rajinder Singh, a restaurant owner, said that he had been following the guidelines but found residents were reluctant to dine out. Deputy commissioner Kumar Amit warned of stricter action against defaulters this time round. Traders and shopkeepers in neighbouring Sangrur were also worried about incurring further losses. “Cases of coronavirus are up and business is already down. The weekend lockdown is for public safety but it will affect business,” said Amarjeet Singh Teetu, the president of the Vyapar Mandal in Sangrur. Savinder Singh, a local shopkeeper, said curfew from 7pm would mean shutting shop an hour earlier.

21-08-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: CBI takes over investigation||A day after the Supreme Court ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, a team comprising a dozen CBI officials arrived in Mumbai late Thursday. CBI currently is questioning Neeraj Singh, the actor’s cook, at the DRDO guest house in Mumbai and will later question his manager Deepesh Sawant, said CBI sources. CBI has formed four teams to investigate the case. One team first met deputy commissioner of police (zone 9) Abhishek Trimukhe at his office in Bandra to collect documents, including the forensic report, autopsy report, statements of over 60 people that the Mumbai Police has recorded, and other material evidence, said Mumbai police sources. The team is currently camping at the Bandra police station next to the DCP office to complete the documentation process. Also Read: Sushant Singh Rajput’ sister expresses faith in CBICBI sources said that once the documentation is complete, another team will visit the actor’s Bandra flat to recreate the scene. One of the CBI teams will focus on translating documents from Marathi to English, while another will be questioning people. The fourth team will be coordinating with superiors in Delhi and handling logistics in Mumbai. The actor was found dead in his Bandra apartment on June 14, following which Mumbai Police had registered a case of accidental death. Later, based on a complaint by the actor’s father which accused actor Rhea Chakraborty and her family of abetting the actor’s suicide and siphoning of his money, Bihar Police registered an FIR and handed the case over to CBI. The Enforcement Directorate also filed a case on July 31 to probe money laundering allegations against Chakraborty and her family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-cbi-takes-over-investigation/story-MfrNB5H09jYA36cGbD9x2L.html
21-08-2020||Kolkata||Orlando the dog cracks his first case: Gaur poaching||Under two months after he joined the forest department, Orlando—a Belgian Malinois dog—helped crack a case of gaur (Indian bison) poaching at the Gorumara National Park in north Bengal on Thursday. “This was his first assignment. While we have already arrested one person from a hideout near Borodighi tea garden in Jalpaiguri district, we have launched a search operation for seven others,” said a senior official of the forest department. Thanks to Orlando, the raiding team recovered some cooked and raw meat, sharp weapons and liquor from a hideout, and sent the samples for forensic analysis. US Navy Seals used the Belgian Malinois breed during the 2011 operation that killed Osama Bin Laden. They also used them to chase down ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi before he was killed at Idlib in Syria. On Thursday morning, the forest department staff of Gorumara National Park found a gaur carcass in the forest. Some portions of the carcass were missing. Later, the forest department received a tip that it could be a case of poaching and that some villagers had cooked the animal’s meat. The department formed a team which raided at least three houses. Orlando found the meat hidden in the roof of a one of the raided huts, said a forest official. “Orlando joined the West Bengal forest department late June. He was trained at the police dog training school at Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh. While Orlando was sent to Gorumara, another Belgian Malinois named Shyana was sent to the Sunderbans to join the department,” said Ravi Kant Sinha, the chief wildlife warden of West Bengal. The CRPF was the first to introduce the breed in India, and over the years it has become one of the Indian security forces’ favourites, even to conduct anti-maoist operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/orlando-the-dog-cracks-his-first-case-gaur-poaching/story-QlNJdC2jPUDa0AELkDgUDP.html

This is the fourth of the seven lakes to overflow this monsoon. Earlier, Tulsi and Vehar lakes at Sanjay Gandhi National Park had overflowed followed by Modak Sagar lake on Tuesday. This could mean that Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) may revoke the water cut as the civic body had earlier said it will re-examine the 10% cut in water supply to the city once the lake levels cross 90%. As of Friday morning, Mumbai’s lake levels are at 90.88%, in comparison to 94.91% on the same day in 2019, and 93.91% in 2018. The seven lakes have 1,315,423 million litres of useful water content. On Friday, the water cut in Mumbai was reduced to 10%, from the earlier 20% imposed on August 5 due to low rainfall in catchment areas. BMC announced this decision on Wednesday, after the water levels in the seven lakes crossed the 85% mark. In the past years, the Tansa lake started overflowing much earlier; on July 25 in 2019, on July 17 in 2018, on July in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tansa-fourth-lake-in-mumbai-to-overflow-bmc-may-revoke-water-cut/story-crBZoecIC4ymnvjlsdDkLO.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||PM CARES Fund, HC reserves verdict||The Bombay high court’s Nagpur bench on Thursday reserved its verdict on a public interest litigation demanding appointment of three trustees, including two from opposition parties, to manage Prime Minister’s Citizens Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM CARES) Fund.The petitioner, lawyer Arvind Waghmare, has also sought removal of private auditing firm M/s SAARC Associates since public money is involved in the fund. According to him, the appointment of an auditor before filling up vacant seats of three trustees is illegal and, therefore, should be cancelled. He amended his petition in the wake of the Supreme Court’s order on Tuesday dismissing a plea seeking the transfer of money collected by the PM Cares Fund to the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF).In his petition, Waghmare has sought a direction to the government to declare funds received and expenditure of the same on a government’s website periodically.A division bench of the high court reserved the verdict after a hearing that lasted for more than one-and-a-half hours and witnessed sharp exchanges between the petitioner and the respondents.Additional solicitor general of India Anil Singh opposed the petition. He called it politically motivated while doubting the intentions of the petition. He maintained total transparency has been maintained in the fund.The petitioner said three trustees have not been appointed till date despite clear guidelines even as crores were being accepted. Being a donor to this fund, he insisted on the appointment of other trustees for “fortifying confidence of the general public”.This is not a personal fund of any political party, said Waghmare while seeking appointment of leaders belonging to opposition parties to make the working of fund more transparent and inclusive.A three-judge Supreme Court bench on Tuesday held the establishment of PM Cares Fund was necessitated by the situation borne out of Covid-19 pandemic and requirement of financial resources to deal it. It added the court cannot object to the same.The Centre set up the PM Cares Fund on March 28 as a public charitable trust with the primary objective of dealing with any kind of emergency or distress situation such as that posed by Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pm-cares-fund-hc-reserves-verdict/story-8LJZ6fEpFZYTjfyjIuJtiK.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC to not interfere with compulsory Covid-19 test for those travelling to Konkan for Ganeshotsav||The Bombay High Court has refused to interfere with the directive of the state disaster management authority, making it mandatory for people visiting their hometowns in the Konkan region after August 12 for Ganeshotsav to undergo a Covid-19 test.A bench comprising justices KK Tated and Milind Jadhav upheld the clause in the Government order issued on August 4, 2020, observing that it has been issued to ensure that the population of Konkan region stays safe and does not “get infected or come in contact with corona virus”.The bench said that effective steps need to be taken to contain the spread of the deadly infection, especially where transportation of citizens from one region to another is concerned. The bench then dismissed the petition filed by one Santos Gurav of the Konkan region.Gurav had moved the high court, represented by advocate Harshal Mirashi, contending that the government order, especially the clause making the Covid-19 test mandatory, had curbed his freedom to travel to Ratnagiri district in Konkan region for the festival. The test was mandatory irrespective of whether people travel in state transport buses or private vehicles and they would be allowed to travel only if the test result is negative, Mirashi pointed out.The high court, however, refused to accept the contention. The bench said if people travelled from one place to another to a different region or district, then there was a likelihood of the infection spreading and effective steps need to be taken to contain it.Also read: With 68,898 Covid-19 cases, India’s tally surges past 2.9 million; recovery rate over 74%“Not very long ago, Maharashtra, Mumbai in particular, had the highest number of Covid-19 cases.

21-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi wakes up to a clear blue sky||Residents in many parts of Delhi woke up to an azure sky, an unusual sight in one of the most polluted capitals in the world. A similar natural phenomenon was also noticed by many Delhi residents on August 6, when the sky was unusually blue. Meteorologists have attributed to Delhi’s unusual blue sky to a raft of factors, albeit what, they said, could be a short-lived affair. The blue sky would be a temporary natural phenomenon because easterly winds have started blowing and low-pressure area is lying over eastern Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and that would lead to overcast conditions over the north-western parts of the country as well, according to meteorologists. Also read: Five reasons that led to Delhi’s monsoon messDelhi recorded two “good” air quality days until Thursday (August 20), as compared to the corresponding period last year. However, the average air quality index (AQI) was lower than last year at 66.1 (satisfactory). In 2019, the average AQI for the same period was 73.9 (satisfactory). The blue tint is due to sunshine, a lack of cloud cover and a rain-washed clean atmosphere, meteorologists said. “However, a blue sky can only be seen for a brief period. We must all enjoy the moment, which is pure physics. The radiation has seven colours, and blue gets scattered more because of shorter waves. The blue is more evident than usual because of a lack of cloud cover, sunshine and clean atmosphere,” said K Sathi Devi, head, National Weather Forecasting Centre (NWFC). Delhi-based Regional Meteorological Centre’s office doesn’t track blue sky days, but officials said that such natural phenomenon was visible in the national capital and north-western parts of the country for the first time in several years. “We started observing this after the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced lockdown restrictions were imposed. Newspapers also published pictures of the Himalayan peaks being visible from the north-western plains in May following thunderstorms. Delhi was lashed by heavy rains this week that washed away pollution particles. Molecules in the atmosphere scatter white sunlight in all directions. Blue light is scattered more because it travels shorter waves. The obstacles to this scattering are clouds, fog, pollutants and smoke. Now, we have high clouds over Delhi, but they will clear up in a few hours. We will again be able to see a blue sky,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC), Delhi.

21-08-2020||Chandigarh||55 years after former Punjab CM Partap Singh Kairon’s assassination, son opens political conspiracy chapter||Chandigarh Fifty-five years after the assassination of Partap Singh Kairon, who was chief minister of an undivided Punjab for eight years (1956-64), a book co-authored by his younger son Gurinder Singh Kairon has raked up political conspiracy in the murder that has so far been considered a closed chapter in turbulent history of the border state.“This is an honest effort to tell the true story of the man who had such a deep and long-lasting impact on Punjab, says the preface of the book, Partap Singh Kairon: A Visionary, which shares authorship with Panjab University historian M Rajivlochan and his civil servant wife Meeta Rajivlochan. “If he had more time, the history of this region would have been different”. Curiously, the book puts the spotlight on the rivalry between Kairon and then Punjab Congress leader Chaudhary Devi Lal, who later became deputy prime minister and Haryana chief minister, raising a question mark on the “closeness” between the latter and one of the four assassins of Kairon, who was a favourite of then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and one of the tallest leader in post-Partition Punjab.The book records how the Kairon family suspected “political foul play” after a CBI probe into the assassination was denied despite requests from Punjab MLAs. “Why would an unknown person who was already wanted by the police for murder attract even more police attention by killing someone who was no longer a chief minister? Could there have been a deeper political conspiracy?” the book says, quoting the Kairon family. “The question that continues to remain alive is this: Who was the real murderer? Why was political conspiracy ruled out?” THE ASSASSINATION A year after US-educated Kairon stepped down as chief minister in 1964, he was waylaid and shot dead on February 6, 1965 on Grand Trunk Road near Rai in Sonepat when he was on way from Delhi to Chandigarh. Also, killed with him were three others — Kairon’s friend Baldev Kapur, a director in Punjab government; his personal assistant Ajit Singh and driver Dalip Singh. Three of four assassins Sucha Singh, Baldev Singh and Nahar Singh Fauji, were sentenced to death by a trial court in Rohtak, which was confirmed by the high court on September 21, 1970, and they were hanged to death. The fourth assassin, Daya Singh, was arrested in 1972 and sentenced to death in December 1978. Police investigations had linked Kairon’s assassination to personal revenge by the main accused Sucha Singh and had found no political conspiracy.The book records how Devi Lal, one of the opponents of Kairon, began to take interest in pardon for Daya Singh. “It’s not clear how much of Lal’s influence worked, but in April 1991, the Supreme Court of India converted the death sentence of Daya Singh into life imprisonment and was finally freed in 1994,” reads the book. Devi Lal was deputy Prime Minister then. “The closeness between Lal and Daya Singh indicated an underlying conspiracy,” says Gurinder Singh, adding the book is based on facts. WAS AGAINST PUNJAB REORGANISATION“Kairon was of the firm opinion that the greatest strength of Punjab was its large size and tremendous geographical and cultural diversity, with the Punjabi language and culture providing a unifying template,” reads the book. Masters in economics from University of California,Berkeley, and political science from Michigan State University, Kairon’s love for Punjabi language was exceptional. When he took over as the chief minister, he introduced Punjabi in official work and also in the courts. THE GOLD HUNTA few months after he resigned as CM in June 1964, the compound of Kairon’s village house was dug up to “extract hidden gold” and police were looking for ₹3 crore worth of yellow metal that never surfaced. “Did the police dig deep enough,” Kairon’s disparagers asked in the Vidhan Sabha, says the book. The authors highlight how troubles mounted for Kairon after the death of India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in May 1964. Within three weeks of Nehru’s demise, Kairon announced to retire from public life and sent his resignation when Lal Bahadur Shashtri took over, it says. By then Kairon was already facing an inquiry by the Das Commission into the alleged wrongdoings during his tenure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/55-years-after-former-punjab-cm-partap-singh-kairon-s-assassination-son-opens-political-conspiracy-chapter/story-a4Mb8uwjPXB4ibNHb6vtYL.html

Also read: How tribal women in West Bengal district got sanitary napkins, baby food for ₹1 in lockdownPeople were confined to indoors in Kolkata and its surrounding areas on Thursday because of the lockdown that was accompanied by incessant monsoon showers. Earlier, the Bengal government had announced that lockdown would be enforced on certain days in August. The state government changed lockdown dates at least five times in a bid to accommodate religious festivals and public holidays such as the 74th Independence Day that was observed on August 15.Initially, though nine days were decided for the lockdown in August, later it was brought down to six.“We have arrested 756 people for violating lockdown norms in Kolkata on Thursday. At least 387 people were arrested for not wearing masks and another 64 for spitting in public,” said a Kolkata Police official. On Thursday, Kolkata recorded around 45 millimetres (mm) of rainfall. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) authorities have issued a warning for heavy rainfall in Kolkata and its surrounding areas until August 25. Bengal has recorded 1.29 lakh Covid-19 cases until Thursday, including 3,129 in the last 24 hours. North 24 Parganas district has overtaken Kolkata as the epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak in Bengal. On Thursday, North 24 Parganas district recorded 747 new Covid-19 cases, as compared to 583 in Kolkata. “There has been a surge in Covid-19 cases because of aggressive testing. However, the positivity rate, which had shot up to around 17% in mid-July, came down to 12% over the past few weeks. At present, it is less than 10%,” said a state government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/second-day-of-48-hr-lockdown-over-750-arrested-for-violations/story-obC9XuuHq4yVzUSfaQK7wN.html
21-08-2020||Delhi||Money heist, Delhi edition: Instances of uprooted ATMs increase over six months||In the past six months, a dozen ATMs have been uprooted and stolen in the national Capital, causing a loss of over Rs 1 crore. In August, two ATMs were uprooted and stolen from Narela and Rajokri. The increase in number of such instances has prompted the city police to take steps to curb such crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice. Senior police officers said that the modus operandi in all ATM thefts was about the same—the thieves drive a stolen SUV, spray black paint on CCTV cameras installed at the ATM booth, uproot the machine by tying it to their vehicle and flee with the machines and the CCTV camera footage storage device.An analysis of the reported cases shows that while a majority of the thefts took place in February and March, before the nationwide lockdown was announced to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), one case was reported in south Delhi’s May during the lockdown. Of the 12 reported cases, seven are from southeast Delhi areas, such as Jaitpur, Badarpur, Pul Prahladpur, Govindpuri and New Friends Colony—all bordering Haryana’s Faridabad.Between February 9 and 14, four such cases were reported—three in southeast Delhi’s Jaitpur, Govindpuri, and Badarpur and another in Mandawali in east Delhi. On March 5, two cases were reported from Jaitpur and Pul Prahladpur.During Unlock 3.0, two consecutive cases involving the uprooting of cash dispensing machines from ATM booths in outer Delhi’s Narela and Rajokri in south Delhi were reported within three hours on August 5. They not only left the city police baffled but also forced its top brass to constitute multiple teams and intensify their manhunt for the perpetrators of such crimes. Soon, the police arrested three suspects from Haryana involved in seven reported ATM uprooting cases after an exchange of fire in two separate operations between August 9 and 14 in Delhi and Haryana’s Rithath village in Mewat district.Two of them, identified as Arshad Khan, 27, and Ahmad alias Kalma,35, were injured in the leg. Khan was caught on August 9 from south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj, while Ahmad and his associate Saddam, 32, were arrested from Rithath village on August 14 by a joint team of Delhi and Haryana Police.When the team caught up to the suspects, it was surrounded by a mob that assaulted them with lathis and pelted them with stones, the deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah said in the press statement released on August 15, a day after the operation.“Nearly 25 bullets were exchanged between the raiding party and the two suspects. One assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of Haryana Police was also shot in the hand while Ahmad was shot in the right knee,” Kushwah said in the press statement.A senior police officer who was part of both operations said on condition of anonymity that Khan and the other two men belonged to the same gang that was involved in most ATM uprooting cases reported in southern parts of Delhi.“This gang comprises nearly 12-15 members, and each member has a specific task to perform in the uprooting’s execution and theft of ATMs. Khan’s job was to drive around the city during odd hours, look for unguarded ATM booths in isolated areas and conduct detailed reconnaissance before passing on the information to other gang members, who would enter Delhi only to execute the crime,” said the officer.Equipped with necessary tools such as gas cutters, belts or ropes, the officer said, the men would enter Delhi in their own vehicles and before heading to the selected ATM booth, they would steal an SUV. One of them would carry out the final reconnaissance to ensure there was no security guard, police or any danger lurking around.After getting a go-ahead from the assessor, another man would immediately blacken the lens of the CCTV cameras with spray while the others would cut the cables to disable the security alarms, if any, tie the machine to their stolen vehicle and uproot it, said another police officer from the special cell, requesting anonymity.“This ATM uprooting technique is new. Earlier, the thieves would cut into the machine using a gas cutter at the booth. But since a lot of currency notes would burn, the thieves devised this new way of uprooting and stealing the machine. Their earlier process was time-consuming as well. But now they hardly take four-five minutes to complete the job,” the officer added.Senior police officers said that apart from neutralising the perpetrators of such crimes, they are also holding meetings with bank officials, asking them to take preventive measures such as strengthening the foundations of ATMs, installing hidden cameras in the ATM booths and deploying security guards with firearms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/money-heist-delhi-edition-instances-of-uprooted-atms-increase-over-six-months/story-0xSTAuwdBGQ4DEjxOTbJlK.html

The civic officials said the load on Currey Road and Chinchpokli bridges should not exceed 16 tonnes due to their dilapidated condition.Last year, the civic body had issued an advisory for 20 bridges that were found dilapidated in a structural audit, prompted after the Himalayan bridge collapse at CSMT.The BMC has also urged Ganesh mandals in prominent areas of Mumbai to follow the concept of ‘one ward-one Ganpati’ during this year’s Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations in view of the coronavirus outbreak. Vishwas Mote, the assistant municipal commissioner of K-West ward which covers Andheri, Juhu, Versova and other such areas, made the appeal through a letter to the mandals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-issues-advisory-ahead-of-ganesh-chaturthi-urges-caution-on-13-dilapidated-bridges/story-ismQ4Loxr0kq6kfg6AP1CM.html

21-08-2020||Jaipur||Swachh Survekshan: Jodhpur gets ‘Fastest Mover Big City’ title||Jodhpur in Rajasthan has been adjudged as the “Fastest Mover Big City” in the Swachhata Survey 2020, results of which were announced by the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing on Thursday.Jodhpur has been accorded the 29th rank in the survey among 47 cities with a population of over 10 lakh, which is a huge jump from its 243rd rank in the previous survey. The ministry observed that Jodhpur has made tremendous improvement and has a huge potential for further improvements.Jodhpur has earned a total of 3,615 points out of 6,000. It had bagged 2,091 points in the 2019 Swachhata Survey.JMC Commissioner Suresh Kumar Ola attributed this quantum leap of 214 places in the ranking to immaculate working on all the aspects pertaining to the Swachhata Survey this year.Expressing gratitude to the staff of the Jodhpur Municipal Corporation (JMC) and the people of the city, he said, “We worked on various initiatives, ensuring active participation of people, and it was due to this that Jodhpur occupied the first place in Citizens’ Feedback in the entire state.” Ola said 4,000 “swachhata sainiks”, ward in-charge and chief sanitation inspectors of the JMC played a key role in making this feat possible.“The paintings on city walls, roads and city circles made by the swachhata sainiks kicked off an atmosphere for cleanliness and provided a radiance to the city,” Ola said, adding that because of this, Jodhpur got 1,045 points out of 1,500 in “Field Observation”.Besides, the city has a system in place for door-to-door waste collection, which is being monitored through GPS technology, he said.The ministry had included 4,242 cities in the survey with different categories corresponding to their population and Jodhpur was competing among 47 cities under the population category of 10 lakh-40 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/swachh-survekshan-jodhpur-gets-fastest-mover-big-city-title/story-k77175PuSMocyjxEvGvRVM.html
21-08-2020||Chandigarh||Moga car dealer arrested in 2014 foreign weapon smuggling case||Faridkot: Hours after the Punjab and Haryana high court granted regular bail to Moga-based car dealer Pankaj Bansal in the Behbal Kalan police firing case, the Punjab Police’s Organised Crime Control Unit (OCCU) arrested him in the court of the judicial magistrate on Friday in connection with the 2014 inter-state illegal foreign-made weapons smuggling case. Chandigarh-based Vishal Gun House owner Satish Kumar was arrested on Thursday and six people, including Bansal, were named accused in the case for buying illegal weapons and forging sales bills. A search is on for the remaining four accused, namely Raj Chopra of Karnal who owns the National Arms Company; Bhupinder Singh of Ferozepur, Amit Goyal of Delhi and Rohit Chabra of Kotkapura. The court of judicial magistrate Amandeep Kaur sent Bansal and Satish in five-day police custody. Bansal was presented before the court on production warrant. The special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 police firing incidents had arrested Bansal in the Behbal Kalan firing case on June 20. District attorney Rajnish Goyal said: “During investigation, OCCU found that involvement of purchasers of the weapons also pointed to their culpability in knowingly buying illegal weapons and forging sales bills.” However, in 2015 the police had given a clean chit to these persons, claiming that the accused pass the weapons as genuine in connivance with arms dealers and the buyers did not know the genuineness of the weapons, so those persons were innocent purchasers. At that time, the police chose not to disclose the names of the buyers, who they admitted were usually rich or influential. The case was registered under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 472 and 392 of the Indian Penal Code and the Arms Act at Faridkot city police station on August 18, 2014. OCCU has added Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) in the first information report. SEARCH ON FOR PRIME ACCUSED In October 2014, with the arrest of Ranjit Singh, alias Dupla, and his accomplice Gurcharan Singh Rinka, Faridkot police recovered 13 foreign-made weapons that gangsters sold to rich youngsters in Chandigarh and Delhi. Dupla and other persons were buying illegal foreign-made weapons from other states and selling them in Punjab by preparing false documents. The police had submitted a final report to the court against accused Ranjit Singh and others on January 17, 2015. A supplementary challan was also submitted against four other accused on April 30, 2015. Prime accused gangster Dupla has been declared a proclaimed offender in the case. Police sources said he has fled the country and OCCU is trying to locate him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/moga-car-dealer-arrested-in-2014-foreign-weapon-smuggling-case/story-otX14y60EabCxKjePc5NfM.html
21-08-2020||Delhi||Unlock 3.0: Boutiques, tailors register a surge in business||With unlock 3.0, there has certainly a surge in the number of people wanting to venture out to shop. But, under no circumstance are these shoppers ready do compromise on the safety of their health. In fact, most are taking more precautions than necessary, and therefore their love to buy new clothes has made them head to boutiques and tailors more than a trip to the market where apparel showrooms stock up hoards of ready made garments. “I always preferred to buy ready made dresses as one doesn’t have to struggle much in that case. But, in these corona times, I have become a little sceptical of buying a dress from a store and there are various reasons for this. First is that others could would tried the same dress, and it could have been touched and handled by various people right from other shoppers to store’s staff. So, when there came up a wedding to attend, I decided to get all my dresses stitched. The safe bet here is that the masterji in my boutique already has my measurements, and all I have to do is collect the dresses once they are ready; he will also get them sanitised and so will I do before I use them. But, at least I won’t be at the risk of wearing a garment that would have passed through many hands!,” says Sakshi Goyal, a resident of Faridabad. Boutiques are keeping all the safety precautions in mind while operating amid the festive rush. “We sanitise the entire shop before opening, and even at the time of closing. And since we have reopened in unlock, the number of orders have increased while the footfall of clientele has decreased. Hardly any customer is preferring to visit the store in person at this point in time as most of my clients are in touch with me on WhatsApp,” says Ishaani Khanna, a boutique owner in sector 51 of Gurugram. She adds, “For the karigars, we have in place strict some rules such as wearing masks, sanitising the inching tape after every few hours, and sanitising other tools once a dress is ready. We ensure to even sanitise the carry bag before handing it over to the customers.” Some are even using video conferencing to check out the designs and patterns, to place an order beforehand, for a perfect dress. Kavita Gupta, owner of Riddhi Creations in Shakti Nagar, Delhi, says, “The number of bookings for both bridal wear as well as day-to-day dresses has increased. People are ordering dresses through video conferencing and other such virtual mediums. We show them the trending patterns and designs, and they make booking over phone. They keep a tab on the status of their dress, alongside matching mask, they make repeated calls. This used to rarely happened before, but coronavirus had also not happened then. Now, thigs have changed much for everyone.”The designs are exchanged through mobile apps to keep the process contactless. “The number of orders we were getting earlier has been increased several times, and we are trying our best to keep our customers satisfied. We receive the designs on WhatsApp. Either we use the cloth that we have, after the client okays it, or else they purchase and bring us a cloth piece of their choice. Once the pattern is ready, we inform the respective clients and they collect it from the store. In case of a fitting issue, we do get it fixed, but only after sanitising the garment,” says Meenu who runs a boutique in Faridabad.

21-08-2020||Arts||World Senior Citizen’s Day: Artistes share how they are coping with Covid-19 era||Within the guidelines set for Covid-19, it has been said often that those above 60 years of age need to be mindful about maintaining high immunity level. Advised to stay indoors, and hence confined within their houses, the elderly have no doubt been facing a tough time dealing with isolation. So, on World Senior Citizen’s Day, August 21, we speak to some senior custodians of art and culture, and ask how they have been coping with these times. ‘Have seen the Partition, wars, but nothing like this virus’ Painter-photographer Gopi Gajwani, 82, says that the lockdown provided him with an opportunity to complete his half done canvases. “I had a great time [during lockdown]. The projects I could never finish because of some or the other work were finally completed. There has been a lot of me time on hands, and not just I finished the pending work, but also created many new artworks,” he says. Reminiscing about old times, Gajwani adds, “I used to click a lot of photographs, but with age it took a back seat. Now, while at home, I go through all those pictures [taken years ago] and spend some wonderful time with them. I even attended a few online series, lectures and live programmes. I feel aap chahe bujurg ho jaye par aapka kaam nahi hona chaiye. Your work should always be young and energetic... Besides the happy time I spent at home, I observed the problems that were faced by a lot of people in terms of job and livelihood. I’ve seen Partition [of India], and wars, but nothing like this virus!” ‘Touch, feel, smile, are missing in video conferencing’ Handicrafts curator, Jaya Jaitly, 78, who has been working from home since the lockdown was announced, says she misses human touch the most. “I’m very much confined at home since March 15. All the meetings and coordination that takes place between me and my staff has been happening with the use of technology. There are network issues and errors; the other side of technology we deal with. My whole work is with kaarigars (craftsmen) and I feel cut-off from them. I like to touch, feel, smile, and that’s missing in video conferencing. Sometimes when I feel restless, I go on a drive with my daughter; it makes me feel better. After five months (of working from home), I recently invited my staff home, while taking all the necessary precautions.” ‘Raising funds for artistes in Delhi and Manipur’ Going that extra mile is contemporary dancer, Padma Shri Astad Deboo, who has been helping the artist community during these testing times. The 73-year-old says, “I’m in touch with artists from Delhi and Manipur, and have been raising funds for them. I even choreographed some dance clips — with my Delhi-based artistes — and it [the lockdown] was a pretty busy period for me. I was also a part of an Instragram live, and even attended a session conducted by the University of Hawaii, which was based on the subject ‘Artists under Covid-19’. Besides, I’ve also been teaching the students of The Stephen High School for the deaf and Aphasic in Mumbai, which I started doing in 2019.” Author tweets @ruchikagarg271 Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/world-senior-citizen-s-day-artistes-share-how-they-are-coping-with-covid-19-era/story-fTuHoHOMAEg2fMhG554jSM.html
21-08-2020||Chandigarh||Swachh Survekshan 2020: Chandigarh misses Top 10 spot again, restricted to 16th position||The City Beautiful failed to make it to the top 10 cleanest cities in the country for the second year in a row, but improved its ranking from last year’s 20 to 16 in the latest Swachh Survekshan rankings announced on Thursday.Chandigarh was also adjudged the “Best State Capital/Union Territory” in citizens’ feedback.It was in 2018 last when Chandigarh was ranked among the top 10 cities – the third cleanest. The good run ended with UT dropping to the 20th position in last year’s rankings.Indore in Madhya Pradesh continued to reign as the country’s cleanest city (having population of more than 1 lakh). Surat in Gujarat, which was ranked 14 last year, jumped to the second position. Navi Mumbai in Maharashtra climbed to the third position from last year’s seventh.Indore scored 94.12% (5,647.56 out of 6,000), while Chandigarh got 82.83% (4,970), improving from 2019’s score of 75.74%.The Swachh Survekshan is conducted to study the progress of Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) and rank cities based on cleanliness and sanitation parameters. Four parameters were used for arriving at the overall ranking of a city – certifications (1,500), direct observation (1,500), service level progress (1,500) and citizen feedback (1,500).WHAT PUSHED CITY UP?A major factor in the city’s climb from 20th to 16th position was it doubling its score in the certifications parameter.There are two categories under this parameter - garbage free cities (GFC) star certification and open defecation free (ODF) certification.It achieved ODF++ from the earlier ODF ranking. Similarly, it gained 3-Star GFC status against the previous 2-Star GFC. Consequently, it improved its score from 40% marks last year to 73.33% this year in the certification category.Had the city got the 5-Star GFC certification, which it had applied for, it would have broken into the top 10 list. But, its claim was downgraded to a mere 3-Star rating.WHAT’S HOLDING CITY BACKMunicipal corporation’s poor solid waste management, particularly waste segregation and disposal, led to continued poor showing of country’s first planned city in the 2020 rankings.This was reflected in city’s marks dropping from 90% last year to 76.33% this year in the service level progress parameter, which is largely indicative of efficiency in solid waste management.DIFFERING VIEWSFormer Union railway minister and UT member of Parliament Pawan Kumar Bansal said, “According to a report of the Centre for Science and Environment, based on Swatch Bharat Mission inputs, Chandigarh has recorded 90% waste processing, 100% door-to-door garbage collection and 95% waste segregation in 24 of 26 wards. These high claims are not only untrue but border on the ludicrous and bizarre.”“It is shameful that even after spending crores on the segregation and disposal of waste, the BJP-led MC has failed miserably,” said Devinder Singh Babla, Congress leader of opposition in MC On the other hand, mayor Raj Bala Malik said, “Sanitation and cleanliness has improved since last year, which the positive citizen feedback substantiates. Only due to Congress’s legacy, the waste treatment plant and dumping site has slowed down our progress. We have started mining of legacy waste and taken over the plant. So, we will improve on these parameters also next year.”“We couldn’t be in top 6, because we didn’t get 5-star GFC certification. We have scored well in citizen feedback. The city has become much cleaner, but we need to improve on solid waste management, which we are working on,” said KK Yadav, MC commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/swachh-survekshan-2020-chandigarh-misses-top-10-spot-again-restricted-to-16th-position/story-2ekDbzFPz2LrlDKFmbobOM.html
21-08-2020||City||Swachh Survekshan 2020: Mohali slips to 157th spot in worst show ever||Continuing its image of Chandigarh’s poor cousin, in its worst show ever, Mohali further slipped to the 157th position in the Swachh Survekshan rankings declared on Thursday. The city even dropped to the seventh position in Punjab from the 4th spot last year. Mohali performed its best in 2018 when it was ranked 109, only to fare poorly at the 153th position in 2019. This year, the city scored just 46.5% marks (2,790/6,000), against the 94.12% scored by Indore, India’s cleanest city. Reflected in just 215 marks out of 1,500 in the service level progress parameter, failure to get garbage management projects off the ground became Mohali’s undoing.MC’s ambitious solid-waste management project at Samgoli village has remained a non-starter with the state government failing to expedite it.The city also failed to ensure an open-defecation free (ODF) status by constructing adequate mobile and public toilets – crucial for attaining a smart city status. MC’s plans to spend Rs 97.76 lakh on construction of public toilets in eight markets also remain only on paper. Due to this, Mohali scored just 300 out of 1,500 marks in the ODF certification. Besides, the civic body has failed to start garbage segregation at source in most areas, while door-to-door garbage collection also remains irregular.The city scored highest in citizen feedback (1,119/1,500), followed by 1,115 out of 1,500 marks in direct observation.“The city has literally gone to dogs. The municipal corporation has failed to sort out the garbage plant issue for over 10 years. There was no awareness campaign for Swachh Survekshan,” said CL Garg, president of Confederation of Greater Mohali Residents’ Welfare Associations.“We worked really hard, but could not achieve the required rank. We will focus on the grey areas and ensure the ranking is improved next year,” said MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-slips-further-to-worst-show-ever/story-24xPPs2oYBdsyqJTq60wrL.html
21-08-2020||City||Swachh Survekshan 2020: Panchkula ranks 56th in best performance in four years||Grabbing the 56th position, Panchkula has climbed 15 spots from last year’s 71st rank in the 2020 Swachh Survekshan rankings announced on Thursday.This is Panchkula’s best performance after improving its rank for the fourth time in a row. After its lowest position of 211 in 2017, the city rose to the 142nd rank in the following year and further to 71st in 2019.In Haryana, Panchkula has ranked third after Karnal (rank 17) and Rohtak (rank 35) in first and second positions, respectively.While none of the senior officials from the municipal corporation (MC), including commissioner Mahavir Singh, were immediately available for comments, Haryana Assembly speaker and local MLA Gian Chand Gupta gave the credit to the sanitation workers. “The ranking is the result of their hard work. I give special credit to the sanitation staff, who play a crucial role in the city’s cleanliness. Apart from this, residents’ active participation also helped,” he said.Gupta said they were already working on dealing with the dumping ground by setting up a solid waste management plant, which will further improve the city’s ranking in 2021.Former MC commissioner-cum-administrator Rajesh Jogpal said the better ranking this year was possible because of the efforts and active involvement of citizens and MC staff, especially sanitation workers.“However, the city could have achieved a much higher rank if the solid waste management plant was set up and people segregated waste at source,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/swachh-survekshan-panchkula-jumps-15-spots-in-best-performance-in-four-years/story-MHpi7U0r0RgMpEU7aBattI.html

21-08-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana to conduct written exam for physical training instructors on August 23||The Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) will conduct a written examination on August 23 to conclude the selection process that began in 2006 for recruiting physical training instructors (PTIs), in compliance with the apex court orders.The exam for the post of the instructors will be conducted in five districts -- Kurukshetra, Karnal, Panipat, Kaithal and Hisar -- in compliance with the orders of the Supreme Court, a state government statement said here on Thursday.According to the statement, the HSSC shall conclude the entire selection process initiated by an advertisement and the criterion notified on December 28, 2006, which is holding objective type written test of 200 marks and viva-voce of 25 marks.“As many as 9,273 candidates have been issued admit cards for which total 95 exam centres have been established across five districts,” it said.The district magistrates shall impose Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) banning assembly of four or more people in the vicinity of the exam centres.The statement said the instructors who were terminated due to court orders can also participate in the examination process.A single bench of the high court had on September 11, 2012 set aside the 2010 selections of PTIs on account of changes made in the selection process. The decision was upheld by a HC division bench and later by the Supreme Court on April 8, 2020. An apex court bench of Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice Navin Sinha had said that HSSC’s decision of June 30, 2008, to cancel the written examination, the July 11, 2008, decision to call candidates eight times the number of vacancies on minimum percentage of marks for interviews and the decision of July 31, 2008, to call all the eligible candidates for interviews were arbitrary. Decisions were taken without any reason to change the selection criterion published in 2006 which have the effect of downgrading the merit in the selection, the court said. The sacked instructors, who teach physical education and related subjects in government schools, have demanded that they be reinstated.Senior leader of opposition Congress, Randeep Singh Surjewala, had recently urged the Haryana government to reinstate the sacked PTIs by issuing an ordinance and ratifying it through a Bill passed by the state legislature.According to the state government statement, Haryana chief secretary Keshni Anand Arora had held a video conference on Wednesday with deputy commissioners and superintendents of police of all the five districts where the exams will be held.Arora directed the officials to maintain strict vigil and ensure foolproof arrangements for safety and security of candidates, maintaining the law and order and smooth conduct of the examination, the statement said.“The administration shall ensure proper frisking of candidates before allowing entry into examination centres. CCTV cameras shall be installed in each room with live streaming. The HSSC shall ensure proper scanning of QR code/, facial biometric attendance, videography and mobile jammers should be installed,” the statement said.The chief secretary directed the district administrations to depute flying squads for safe carrying of exam material and to maintain the law and order.Superintendents of police of the districts were advised to ensure adequate police force consisting of male and female personnel is deployed at each centre, as per the direction given by Arora.It was further directed that in view of the Covid-19 situation, all the exam centres will be thoroughly sanitised before the exam including classrooms, corridors and washrooms.To ensure social distancing, the number of candidates per room shall be reduced to half.Candidates will not be allowed entry if they do not have a face mask. The HSSC shall ensure thermal screening at entrance and proper hand sanitisation at entry points and in classrooms, according to the statement.“Any candidate with flu-like symptoms will be made to sit separately. A medical team/rapid response team will be deployed in all districts by district administration to deal with any case of medical emergency,” it said, while issuing other exam-related instructions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-to-conduct-written-exam-for-physical-training-instructors-on-august-23/story-4VT3qgUSvKNvZidMc1PMKJ.html

Then they sought some jewellery from the owner. He got suspicious and informed the police. The women showed us fake identity cards, but we asked them to get their senior on phone.

21-08-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana departments set to start sending official files to CMO electronically||The Manohar Lal Khattar government in Haryana has started the practice of sending official files to the office of chief minister ‘only through the electronic format’.Khattar, who himself is considered tech-savvy, has been pushing for introducing digital tools of e-governance at various levels for reducing delays and ensuring transparency.Now, not only the CM’s office (CMO) but the office of chief secretary (CS) and finance department (FD) will also apply formal brakes on receiving the files, bulky or otherwise, in physical form from at least 22 departments in next one week. A top government functionary said Khattar is likely to formally inaugurate this e-governance project within a week even as electronic movement of the files to CMO and chief secretary has started. “E-governance has been the top priority of the CM, who had been pushing for this major IT initiative being monitored on a daily basis by the chief secretary,” a senior officer, who is implementing this project, said. According to Mukesh Bajaj, assistant general manager of (HARTRON), the corporation training the employees, the government has already issued instructions to the departments to stop physical movement of the files to CMO, chief secretary and finance department. “They want the files to be moved electronically via e-office software developed by the NIC,” said Bajaj. At least 35 departments, Bajaj said, have started sending files electronically within their own branches. “The electronic inter-department movement of the files have also picked up pace now,” he added. On August 17, general administration department (GAD) had informed all administrative secretaries, heads of departments, and divisional commissioners that in phase 1, 22 departments will have to send their files to the government, to the offices of CM, CS and finance department ‘only through electronic format’ from that day itself. In phase 1, departments such as IT, panchayat, employment, HARTRON (corporation), higher education, housing, urban local bodies, and transport were included. From September 1 in phase 2, 20 other departments — agriculture, animal husbandry, civil aviation, forest, industries and commerce — have been directed to send the files electronically. “All the remaining departments are directed to send their files from November 1 onwards in the same manner,” the letter of GAD says, directing that these instructions be brought to the notice of all concerned for ‘strict compliance’. The GAD has said that the e-office software will significantly speed up file movement and improve the operational efficiency of the departments as now, the field offices and head offices can move files electronically. “We are bringing all departments on board, including the ministers who will start receiving the files electronically. While the files of the fresh cases are being prepared using the software, large volumes of the old files have been scanned and uploaded on the portal,” Bajaj said. The software will help in controlling the workflow, work allocation and tracking of the files, besides cutting delays in decision-making.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-departments-set-to-start-sending-official-files-to-cmo-electronically/story-ew3LwSGmUrxXF3fISrBqCN.html
21-08-2020||Chandigarh||Will introduce bill in coming assembly session: Dushyant||Following Haryana governor’s move to reserve the private sector job quota ordinance passed by the cabinet for the consideration of the President, deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala on Thursday said it was the prerogative of the governor. Dushyant also said he would follow up the matter with the Union government and the President. “However, we will be tabling a bill, a replica of the ordinance to provide 75% reservation to local candidates in private jobs, during the assembly session starting on August 26,” said Dushyant, who also holds the labour and employment portfolio. The governor’s move to reserve the ordinance for the consideration of the President is being seen as a setback for Dushyant, whose Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) had made a poll promise to implement the quota. Dushyant, though, on Thursday said the development will not have any impact on the JJP’s relations with its coalition partner, the BJP. “The proposed law has a clause which gives it an overriding effect over other laws. Probably, that’s why it was sent to the President,” he said. The law secretary had advised that the proposed law be reserved for the consideration of the President as its Section 23 gave it an overriding effect over other laws and has the potential to be repugnant to an Act of the Parliament. The second aspect was that provision providing for preference in jobs to the local candidates domiciled in Haryana seemingly was in contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution pertaining to equality before law and Article 19 (1)(g) that provides for protection of certain rights to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. Asked about the move of the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh to provide public employment only to local candidates, the deputy chief minister said the constitutional barriers cannot be overlooked. Responding to a query that the proposed law may die its own death as the BJP government at the Centre has a contrary viewpoint on the issue, Dushyant said he was optimistic about its prospects. ‘No bar on introducing a Bill’Legal experts said since it was the prerogative of the legislature and the government to introduce a bill in the assembly, there was no bar on tabling a private sector job quota bill even if the governor has reserved the ordinance for the consideration of the President. Former Haryana advocate general Ashok Aggarwal said the private sector job quota bill passed by the assembly will be sent to the governor, who will have to reserve it for the consideration of the President. Haryana’s move to introduce reservation for local youth in private sector jobs is on the lines of a law enacted by YS Jaganmohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh and challenged on the grounds of constitutional validity in the Andhra high court. The proposed law Titled Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Ordinance, 2020, it provides for 75% of the new employment to local candidates for jobs having monthly salary less than ₹50,000 in private companies, societies, trusts and limited liability partnership firms situated in the state. Employers will also have the option to recruit local candidates from one district to the extent of only 10%. The proposed law also contains a bailout clause for the industry if suitable local candidates are not available for a particular category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/will-introduce-bill-in-coming-assembly-session-dushyant/story-gBpEklwGLDr5zPOD1688UL.html

Both men were not wearing face masks or maintaining social distance. When the actor and her friend questioned them about the same, they started threatening them.According to Sakinaka police officers, the incident took place at around 1pm when Manasi Naik and her friend had gone shopping at Walkmart Supermarket in Andheri.

But Azmi, unlike others was not keeping social distance and was not even wearing a mask. He was standing very close to Naik and her friend,” said an officer from Sakinaka police station. “When Naik asked Azmi to stand properly at the pre-marked area and also to wear a face mask, he started arguing with her, and then also called his friend Dubey. They then threatened Naik and her friend saying ‘we will see how you both leave from here’,” said Kishor Sawant, senior inspector at Sakinaka police station.Naik then contacted the police control room and sought help. “Our team reached the spot and arrested both the accused,” Sawant said.Following Naik’s complaint, police registered a first information report (FIR) under section 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (2) (punishment for criminal intimidation), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-arrested-for-threatening-marathi-film-actor/story-yOhPIvZs7zxbHcOMCpXtuO.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||MNS attacks Mumbai mayor after son’s firm gets Covid centre contracts||The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has accused mayor Kishori Pednekar of favouritism after the contracts for providing labour to Covid-19 centres, constructed in various parts of the city, were given to her son’s company. Calling it a scam, the MNS has demanded Pednekar’s resignation from the mayor’s post. MNS leader Sandeep Deshpande alleged that Pednekar has misused her office to allot contract to Kish Corporate Services Private Limited, where her son Saiprasad is an additional director. “This is clear cut case of conflict of interest as the whole contract was tailor-made to be allotted to the firm of the mayor’s son. The BMC bypassed reputed manpower-providing companies citing emergency requirement and allotted the tender [to Saiprasad] due to the influence exerted by the mayor,” said Despande. “There was no thought given to the experience as well as the competency of this company and the contract was arbitrarily allotted,” he added. Calling it a case of political rivalry, Pednekar has refuted the allegations. “My son’s company has followed all the rules to bag the contract and there was no favouritism from my end. My son has been running the company from 2012 and he has the right to earn his livelihood like any other citizen,” said Pednekar. “Some cannot digest the fact that both, me and the Shiv Sena, have received accolades for our excellent handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and hence, are levelling baseless allegations to malign us,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mns-attacks-mumbai-mayor-after-son-s-firm-gets-covid-centre-contracts/story-1gZozxilRlLNBQEw8AsBnM.html

21-08-2020||City||UMC starts repairing roads ahead of Ganesh festival||A day ahead of the Ganesh Chathurthi festival, residents of Ulhasnagar are still complaining about the potholed roads in the city. Locals have raised concerns over the bad roads as repair works this year were delayed due to the lockdown. Social worker, Prashant Chandanshiv, 33, had written to the commissioner of Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) asking him to pay attention to the east-west connecting bridge in Ulhasnagar. “The bridge had several potholes and my car got damaged due to it. When I wrote to the civic body, they immediately responded and assured they would take action to repair the potholes. There are several such roads that have potholes and needs to be fixed without delay to avoid any accidents,” said Chandanshiv. The potholes on the bridge were repaired on Thursday by UMC. The roads outside Jawahar Hotel, Golmaidan Road and furniture market road, however, are still in pathetic condition. Every year the civic body initiates road repair works in March, however, this year work got delayed due to the lockdown. According to UMC, pothole filling work was initiated 10 days back and it is still being undertaken at many places. “Due to rain we have not initiated the asphalting work as it won’t last. We are just filling the potholes will stones. We are covering all the main routes that will be taken for immersion. Once the rain subsides we will start with asphalting,” said Mahesh Sitlani, engineer, UMC. This year, the budget for road repair is ₹5 crore, compared to ₹8 crore in 2019. “This time the work is delayed due to lack of labour and the lockdown. Last year 80% of the road works were completed before monsoon,” added Sitlani. Although the work has begun, the civic body is not sure when it will be completed due to the constant rains. Bhiwandi resident protest against potholesResidents and activists of Kamatghar in Bhiwandi staged a protest against the Bhiwandi-Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) on Wednesday, to highlight the numerous potholes in the area. The residents stood around potholes with fishing rods to indicate how large and deep the craters were. BNCMC commissioner Pankaj Ashiya said, “Work is already going on. Our team does this on a regular basis. Work is being done even during night for Ganpati festival,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/umc-starts-repairing-roads-ahead-of-ganesh-festival/story-IHmcJo03TUm2W8aRxtd1bI.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death probe: Another challenge ahead for MVA government?||Will the Supreme Court’s decision to hand over the probe into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) impact the stability of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government? SC on Wednesday allowed CBI to probe the SSR death case, taking it from the hands of the Mumbai Police. The state had consistently opposed the CBI takeover and insisted the Mumbai Police were competent to investigate the case. In Maharashtra’s political circles, discussions are rife over how CBI probe may heighten tensions within the former allies-turned-rivals, the Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and even challenge the tenuous alliance between the three ruling partners – Sena, Congress and NCP. A section of the senior leaders from the ruling parties feel that the handling of the case was solely responsible for the transfer of the probe. “Instead of completing the accidental death report, the police were busy calling the who’s who of Bollywood to probe nepotism and the home minister was over enthusiastic in issuing statements over it. The home department could not act swiftly even when the demand for a probe by CBI was first raised. It did not even challenge the FIR filed in Patna, when the probe was on in Mumbai,” said a senior minister, who did not want to be named. The home department is with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). He also said that with the CBI probe, there was a possibility of the BJP trying to pressure the Sena to join hands with them in the state, to avoid getting the investigation of SSR to the doors of Matoshree. He said the Sena was cornered by the BJP by creating doubts and suspicions about the Thackeray family scion and minister Aaditya through social media. “There is no involvement of any state minister in the case, but the whisper campaign put the government on the back foot. Everybody knows that nothing will come out of it, but the Opposition has succeeded in the maligning the party leader,” he added. Political analyst Hemant Desai said, “The transfer of the case is a setback for the state government, but I do not think it will affect the fate of the government. The three ruling parties, too, failed to put up a united face in the crisis. The NCP was seen as sulking, probably, to avoid any discredit to it because of the transfer of the case. The stand taken by Parth Pawar over the investigation by CBI has further created doubts over unity within the ruling parties.” However, NCP spokesperson and state minorities minister Nawab Malik said the government was stable and in full majority. “Why should one talk about the fate of the government which is in full majority?” Another NCP leader said party chief Sharad Pawar had cleared his party’s stand on statements by Parth. Arvind Sawant, Shiv Sena leader and South Mumbai MP, said the strategy of CBI probe was planned by the BJP to destabilise the state government. “They would want us to pressurise us to join hands with them again, but such tactics will not work. The bitterness between the BJP and Sena is growing further and the ruling alliance is emerging even stronger,” he said.Some Shiv Sena leaders feel the party has become “too tolerant” and failed to retaliate like in its earlier avatar. “There are limitations when one is in power. When the CM was referred to in an insulting language, we expected an aggressive reaction from within as well as other ruling partners, but there was no retaliation. There is apprehension if the Opposition will try something underhand to dissolve the government,” said a senior Sena leader, who did not want to be named. BJP leader Atul Bhatkhalkar, however, refuted the allegations that his party was trying to destabilise the government. “It was because of the ill handling of the case that Rajput’s father had to register a case in Patna and then came the SC order. It is the Shiv Sena’s imagination that we are trying to destabilise the government or would pressure them to join us. Why should they be worried if the government has the strength of 170 MLAs as they claim? As far as the allegations over defaming Aaditya are concerned, none of our leaders has even named him.” CBI STAFF EXEMPTED FROM QUARANTINE PROTOCOLThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday allowed the CBI team visiting Mumbai for investigation into the Sushant Singh Rajput death case to bypass the mandatory quarantine protocol. A senior civic official from the BMC told HT, “They are on official duty and they have sought exemption. We have given them the exemption. There is no time limit for it. ” A controversy had erupted after Bihar-cadre IPS officer Vinay Tiwari who had arrived in Mumbai on August 2 for the probe was asked by the civic authorities to remain under 14-day quarantine, as per the rule for domestic air travellers. Meanwhile, home minister Anil Deshmukh held a meeting with Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh at Mantralaya in the evening for update on the status of the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-probe-another-challenge-ahead-for-mva-government/story-sd8g2OT4ohHrmr947V9mbO.html
21-08-2020||City||Undertrial kills self in quarantine centre of Taloja jail||A 43-year-old undertrial arrested in the 191-kg drugs bust case by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) was found dead in the toilet of a quarantine facility of Taloja Jail in Kharghar on Wednesday night. The accused, who was shifted to the facility merely few hours ago before the incident, is suspected to have died by suicide. Another accused in the same case attempted to kill himself, but has survived. DRI busted the international drug racket and seized 191 kg heroin worth ₹1,000 crore from Nhava Sheva port on August 9, in what is being touted as the largest seizure in recent years in Maharashtra. DRI arrested three people from Delhi in connection with the case and brought them to Mumbai on August 10. The three accused were produced before a court on Wednesday and were remanded in judicial custody from Thursday. The accused — Mohammed Nouman Suleiman, Suresh Bhatia and Mahendra Nigam — were shifted to Namdar Gopal Krishna Gokhale Vidyanagar School around 3.30pm for a mandatory quarantine period.On Wednesday night, Suleiman went to use the toilet around 11pm and allegedly hanged himself using a towel, said police. He was found by the on-duty police officer who went to check as he did not return for a while. “The opaque glass of the door showed some movement but he was not responding to knocks. They broke the glass pane and found him there. A doctor was called for check-up, but Suleiman succumbed,” said Nilesh Jagtap, sub-inspector, Kharghar police station. Police sources also said that, during inquiry, they found Suleiman had attempted suicide while in DRI custody.“We found fresh unhealed cut on his wrist. He had sliced his wrist during DRI custody and was saved that time,” said an officer. It is unclear on what date Suleiman first attempted suicide.Meanwhile, the jail staff found that another accused in the case had consumed several pills to kill self. He was taken to the infirmary where he is recuperating, police sources said without revealing the identity of the accused. Pradeep Tidar, senior inspector, said an accidental death report has been filed following the incident. No suicide notes were found either on Suleiman or on the second accused. Sources in Taloja jail said the third accused has been depressed, but officials have not questioned him yet. He has been kept on suicide watch. Meanwhile, police have recorded statements of the on-duty constables at the facility. Both Bhatia and Suleiman have past criminal antecedents. Bhatia was convicted in a 1,200-kg hashish smuggling case in 2008.Suleiman was a close aide of Bhatia, who co-owns Delhi-based Sarvim Exports Ltd, which had allegedly ordered the seized narcotics to be smuggled in India from Afghanistan, as per DRI. Suleiman looked after the import operation and transportation routes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/undertrial-kills-self-in-quarantine-centre-of-taloja-jail/story-3N7WXt1TAnoPVCgtndCwTO.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||Saamana slams transfer of Sushant Singh Rajput death investigation||A day after the Supreme Court handed over the probe into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Shiv Sena in its mouthpiece said it was a conspiracy to malign the Mumbai Police and the state government. Rajput, 34, was found dead in his apartment in Bandra in Mumbai on June 14. The Mumbai Police did not register an FIR in the case and was investigating the matter as ‘accidental death’. Saamana expressed surprise over the apex court’s order even when it found no wrongdoing in the Mumbai Police’s investigation. “While handing over the probe to the CBI, the apex court said, “records of the case produced before this court do not prima facie suggest any wrongdoing by the Mumbai Police”. Then it is surprising that the reins of the case were given to the CBI,” the Saamana editorial remarked. The Mumbai Police’s probe in the case was in the final stages when it was stopped and handed over to CBI on recommendation of the Bihar government, the editorial said. “Getting CBI to probe the Sushant Singh Rajput case in this manner is an attack on the federal structure given by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar... Today, the Indian Constitution will be shedding tears if it is observed that quarantining a Bihar Police official in Mumbai gives rise to suspicion due to which the case is handed over to the case,” it added. It added that it is an “illusion” that only the Bihar police or CBI can unearth the truth in the case. “Several criminal cases in Bihar were investigated by CBI. How many real culprits did CBI arrest so far? Sushant’s case was politicised only to malign the Mumbai Police and the Maharashtra government,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/saamana-slams-transfer-of-sushant-singh-rajput-death-investigation/story-Ez10bOWjxyrn91PJrPEZfJ.html
21-08-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The poet of Galli Hakimji Wali||The works of poets may linger in some high unattainable altitude but they themselves live in ordinary unremarkable streets. Such as Iffat Zarrin. This muggy afternoon the verse writer is standing amusedly on the middle of this cramped lane that is going all the way to her house. A long-time dweller of Old Delhi’s Galli Hakimji Wali, Ms Zarrin writes poetry and also teaches Urdu literature—she is an assistant professor in Delhi University’s Mata Sundri College for Women. “These days I’m conducting classes on Google Classroom,” she informs, posing for a quick photo shoot—from a safe distance. “As a bimari (illness), coronavirus is certainly not good, but it does has given me sukoon (peace) for now I don’t have to go out much,” declares Ms Zarrin in her lecturer-like authoritative voice, which however is larded up with great dollops of friendly affection. In her 50s, she gamely agreed to become a part of the Proust Questionnaire series in which we nudge folks from diverse backgrounds to make “Parisian parlour confessions”, all to explore the lives, thoughts, values and experiences of Delhi’s citizens. Exercising the privilege of being a poet, Ms Zarrin obviously peppered her responses with her own verses. Her Urdu was translated into English by poet Saquib Hussain.Your favourite virtue or the principal aspect of your personality ‘It’s been ages since I started on a solitary inward journey, I’m unaware of my destination, but I’m still on the road.’ And while on the way, I try to be compassionate and empathetic to everyone, without an ounce of discrimination of any kindYour chief characteristic Loyalty, punctuality and respectWhat do you appreciate the most in your friends?

21-08-2020||Mumbai||Aviation ministry officials call Capt Singh’s allegations baseless||A day after an aviation professional and a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society (RAeS) in London raised questions about tampering of evidences from the accident spot at Kozhikode International Airport, officials from the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) termed the allegations as baseless. Captain Amit Singh, on August 17, wrote to the ministry demanding a court of inquiry into the Kozhikode Air India Express plane accident citing that stills from videos played by local media allegedly indicated tampering of evidences. The aircraft VT- AHX operating from Dubai to Kozhikode crashed inside the airport perimeter at 7.40pm on August 7. After the accident was reported, locals, airport staff and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) rescued the passengers. Ministry officials said CISF team cordoned off the area with thick Manila ropes on the night itself.A MoCA spokesperson said, “Insinuation of tampering of evidence is baseless. It shows total ignorance of the individual about the investigation process, insensitivity to the deceased, and lack of respect for villagers. The current team of experts from AAIB (Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau) and its experts are fully competent to investigate the accident.”According to an Air India Express official based in Delhi, the Go Team of AAIB had departed for the accident site by a special flight at 2.30am on August 8 and had reached the crash site by 6am. “The site, at that time, was cordoned off in the required manner and was guarded by CISF personnel,” the official said.An official present at the accident site said that immediate photos and videos of the wreckage were taken in ‘as is where is’ condition. “The documents and specific items were collected and preserved for investigation. The aircraft wreckage was packed and sealed on Sunday, August 9, and this activity was photographed. Ever since its occurrence, the wreckage is being guarded by CISF personnel as per their mandate,” he added.Senior Air India officials had also asked for suggestions on how to stop people from taking photographs while officials are busy in rescue operations to save lives of the passengers and crew. “Assuming the worst-case scenario during the rescue, even if any switches got moved from their position unintentionally while extricating both pilots from the cockpit, investigation would corroborate evidence with CVR, DFDR data. At that critical juncture, it is more important to save lives which the villagers and other locals along with CISF rightly did,” the airline official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aviation-ministry-officials-call-capt-singh-s-allegations-baseless/story-3NBbcHDsuUMywzyeBmJxMM.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||Amid losses, RInfra writes to Maharashtra govt for selling Mumbai Metro-1 stakes||Reliance Infrastructure (RInfra)-led Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd (MMOPL) has written to the Maharashtra government, saying that it wants to sell the stakes it owns in the company. Metro-1 has been shut for five months owing to the pandemic and had been suffering losses prior to lockdown. MMOPL is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that was constituted to develop and run the 11.5 km Metro-1 on a public-private partnership model. RInfra owns 69% stake in MMOPL; the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority’s (MMRDA) owns 26%; and Transdev (formerly Veolia Transport) owns 5%. Bhushan Gagrani, principal secretary, urban development confirmed that the department had received MMOPL’s letter. Reply to HT’s query, he said over text message, “Yes, we have just received [the letter]. [We have] not taken any view yet.” At the time of going to print, RInfra and MMOPL had not replied to HT’s detailed questionnaire, sent via email. A senior official told HT that the state has sought MMRDA’s views on the development. MMRDA is a nodal infrastructure authority implementing a 337-km Metro network in the Mumbai metropolitan region (MMR). Recently, MMRDA had invited bids to appoint an independent engineer to monitor the operations of Metro-1. “Since MMRDA is developing the entire Metro masterplan, it will be beneficial if Metro-1 is also under the same authority to provide an integrated and seamless network in MMR,” said the official. The state has also formed the Maha Mumbai Metro Operation Corporation Limited (MMMOCL) to operate and maintain all Metro lines. In March 2019, HT had reported that MMOPL was in talks with lenders to tackle its mounting debt of Rs 1,928 crore. MMRDA had then given a go-ahead to MMOPL, provided the authority’s equity was not diluted. Faced with losses since Metro-1 became operational in June 2014, MMOPL had planned to increase fares, but those plans faced roadblocks. In 2019, the second fare fixation committee rejected MMOPL’s proposal to increase fares and asked the company to re-look at innovative non-fare revenue methods. MMOPL is also in the middle of an arbitration against MMRDA over cost escalation during the construction of Metro-1. While MMOPL claims it cost Rs 4,026 crore to build Metro-1, MMRDA claims the cost is Rs 2,356 crore as per the original contract.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/amid-losses-rinfra-writes-to-maharashtra-govt-for-selling-mumbai-metro-1-stakes/story-NQ1B9dtqTAG0KTICq5GozN.html
21-08-2020||City||19 patients at Thane mental hospital test positive for Covid||Nineteen patients of the Thane Mental Hospital have been tested positive for Covid-19 since August 10, after hospital authorities and the civic body started rapid antigen testing in the hospital. All the Covid-positive patients have been admitted to different Covid Care Centres across the city and an attendant has been deployed to assist each of them with their daily chores. Dr Sanjay Bodade, medical superintendent of the Thane Mental Hospital, said, “As per ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) guidelines, we can conduct antigen testing only on those who have mild symptoms. We are also conducting the antigen tests on all those patients who are being admitted or discharged from the mental hospital. We also have an isolation ward in the hospital and are taking all the precautionary measures to curb the spread of the virus.” Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), informed that the civic body has provided antigen kits and training to the mental hospital staff to conduct the tests. “The hospital updates us with daily reports. Some of the patients who have been tested positive are recovering and will soon be sent back to the mental hospital. The testing process will help in providing timely treatment to the patients,” added Malvi. Bodade said that it is difficult to explain the safety protocol to the patients of the hospital. “We have to be very sensitive while dealing with them and approaching them after wearing PPE (personal protective equipment) kits is difficult. Making them wash their hands or wear masks at all times is also difficult. So we have to be careful with the interactions that we have with the patients. We have provided N95 masks, shields and face covers to all the staff members. They can also stay and have food within the premises of the hospital,” added Bodade The testing at the hospital commenced after two patients died of the virus in July. Until now, 178 of the 808 patients have been tested. All the 56 employees of the hospital have been tested negative. The deaths had raised several concerns. Kirit Somaiya, former Member of Parliament from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said, “With more than a thousand people living inside the hospital, only a handful had been tested. We had stressed the need for regular testing. The hospital is now conducting regular antigen testing and many patients have been found positive. Due to our timely action, they will get proper treatment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/19-patients-at-thane-mental-hospital-test-positive-for-covid/story-diKnsxBA75LhhvjzhlPlhP.html
21-08-2020||City||Only those below 50 years can opt for home isolation: Mumbai civic body||In a bid to reduce the city’s fatality rate, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has now mandated home isolation for patients only below 50 years of age, who are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms and have no co-morbidities. The civic body’s analysis done showed that the fatality rate of patients between 50 years and 60 years is very high. A circular issued by BMC’s health department on Wednesday said that Covid-19 patients above 50 years of age or anyone who has co-morbidities, irrespective of their age, will now have to go to Covid Care Centre 2 facilities for treatment and isolation. So far, the existing guidelines allowed home isolation for asymptomatic patients below 60 years of age with no co-morbidities and those having separate toilet facilities in their homes. Daksha Shah, deputy executive health officer in BMC, said, “We have observed that patients between 50-60 years of age are at high risk, especially those with co-morbidities. It has also been observed that in a lot of positive patients, the health deteriorates after seven to eight days. In most cases, patients do not follow home isolation properly and there are instances where people need immediate medical support, but are unable to find it while in home isolation. We need to avoid such cases and admit them to institutional quarantine.” The current average Covid-19 mortality rate of Mumbai is stagnant at 5.5%; it is way above than the national mortality rate at 1.90% and state average mortality rate at 3.3%. Another senior civic official said, “We have also seen that a lot of patients in this age group have diabetes and hypertension and we already know that they are at high risk. Considering all these factors, it was decided in a recent meeting to change the home isolation guidelines.” The circular further stated that officials from the solid waste management department should carry out sanitisation at least once in the society, where a Covid case is detected. The home of the patient and common areas of his residence are to be sanitised by BMC. On Thursday, Mumbai reported 1,275 Covid-19 cases, taking the total to 132, 822. The city saw 46 deaths, as the toll touched 7,314. As per BMC’s data, of the 46 deaths, 28 deaths were of patients above 60 years of age, and 18 patients were between 40 years and 60 years The data further stated that 976 patients were discharged on Thursday. A total of 107,033 patients have been treated and discharged, taking the recovery rate to 80%. The total number of active patients in the city is 18,172. The city’s average growth rate is 0.78% and the doubling rate is 90 days.Meanwhile, Dharavi witnessed a sudden spike in Covid cases on Thursday. After reporting single digit cases for the past two weeks, 17 Covid cases were reported, taking the total to 2,697. For the past two weeks, cases in Dharavi were plateauing to single digit and was seen as a sign of relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/only-those-below-50-years-can-opt-for-home-isolation-mumbai-civic-body/story-V49AP9X9OUxliOl7OVlF1O.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||In a first, companies set to conduct virtual interviews during placement season at IITs||In a first, Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) will conduct their placement season online in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. This year, recruiters scouting for talent at the premiere technology institutes will select candidates virtually. After going online for the autumn semester and convocation ceremonies, IITs are now exploring options to best enable students to participate in recruitment drives remotely, from their homes. Online software, tests and virtual or telephonic interviews are on the cards. Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) plans to maintain its placement calendar and kick off the drive on December 1. “The format of interviewing will be through online software via video conferencing and in some cases, telephonically,” said BV Ravishankar, training and placement officer, IIT-B. Over 1,700 students of the institute, from various programmes, will seek employment through the placement drive this year. IITs in Chennai, Delhi, Roorkee, Mandi and Guwahati confirmed to HT that their placements will be done online, in the interest of the students’ health and safety. “The student registration process has not yet started, but we expect around 900 students to register this year. We’ve clarified to students that placements will be conducted keeping in mind social distancing rules and regulations as prescribed by the government,” said Vinayak Kulkarni, head (Centre for Career Development), IIT-Guwahati. “Student registration is currently underway and in two weeks, we’ll know exactly how many students are opting for placements or deferring placements in 2020-21. The entire process will be conducted online this year keeping in mind Covid-19,” said C S Shankar Ram, advisor (training & Placement), IIT Madras. While the lockdown has eased in many parts of the country, IITs are working to ensure placement season is not affected by rising cases of Covid-19. “Lockdown or not, campus visits or face-to-face interviews will be tough at least for the next few months. Therefore, conducting online interviews and group discussions will be adopted by the institute,” said Dr Sunny Zafar, advisor (Career & Placement Cell), IIT-Mandi. The institutes are already readying students for online pre-placement tests and virtual interviews. Recruiters are likely to have the option of choosing from a host of online models. “Not every detail has been finalised, but we have given recruiters a free hand to decide on the hiring pattern,” Zafar added. Among students, the virtual process has added to the anxieties of a batch that is facing an unprecedented placement season. The slump in the economy, the pandemic, revised visa rules in the United States of America, lockdown and internet connectivity are among the concerns for many. “The season started with mock interviews and announcement of the complete timeline for the current season. There are certain changes in the timeline and we had to adjust our preparation schedule. As the complete process, tests and interviews will be online, I am quite worried about the problems I’ll face due to internet connectivity. Usually, preparation is something we do alongside friends, but we are having to resort to video calls for the same now,” said an IIT-B student. “Despite industry projections, we are expecting placements this year to be at par with previous years, if not better. The institute as well as recruiters are very keen on conducting interviews online this year,” said Vinay Sharma, professor in-charge, placement and internship, IIT-Roorkee. For two years in a row, IITs have boasted of at least one student being offered an annual package upwards of Rs 1 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/in-a-first-companies-set-to-conduct-virtual-interviews-during-placement-season-at-iits/story-CgCJ6VWUQUgD9ZG35thuXP.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||2 IIT-Bombay students in team that identified asteroid that flew past Earth||The SUV-sized asteroid, which zoomed past around 2,950km above the Earth’s surface on Sunday, was identified by an international collaboration that comprises two students from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B). Named ‘2020 QG’, it is the closest known asteroid to fly by the planet without impacting it.The students, Kunal Deshmukh and Kritti Sharma, who are part of a collaboration searching Near Earth Asteroids, identified this object just hours after it passed by Earth, using data from the robotic Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in California. While analysing ZTF data, the two reported five streaks as “potential asteroids”, unknown to the fact that one of it was the record-breaking asteroid. “The data looked like all other near-earth asteroids we have seen so far,” said Deshmukh, a final-year student in the department of Metallurgy and Materials Science at IIT-B.“Helping make a discovery like this, so early in my research project, is beyond what I had ever imagined,” said Sharma, third year student of mechanical engineering.The students reported their findings to the International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Center, after which several global telescopes followed up to learn more about the asteroid’s size and orbit. “We at IIT-Bombay are ratified by the Center and study the data recorded by ZTF, California. So when the students reported the discovery to the Center, the same had to be verified by other independent observers too,” said Varun Bhalerao, assistant professor, department of physics, IIT-B, and an advisor to the students. The feat has now been verified by observers.“The asteroid flew so close to the planet that earth’s gravity significantly changed its orbit,” says ZTF co-investigator Tom Prince, the Ira S Bowen Professor of Physics at Caltech and a senior research scientist at JPL, which Caltech manages for NASA. Asteroids of this size that fly roughly as close to earth as 2020 QG do occur about once a year or less, but many of them are never detected, he said.According to a release on the official website of Caltech, each night, machine-learning programs automatically sort through about 100,000 images in search of these streaks, and then narrow down the best asteroid candidates to be followed up by humans. This results in about 1,000 images that team members and students sort through by eye every day.“Asteroid 2020 QG was identified by Kunal Deshmukh, a student at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay. Deshmukh had been scanning that day’s images along with Kritti Sharma, also at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, and Chen-Yen Hsu at National Central University in Taiwan,” the release said.Arvind Paranjpye, director of Nehru Planetarium, called it a “very important discovery because it was so close to earth that the planet’s gravity could perturb its course”. “We need more such discoveries of inter-planetary missiles and this discovery is a matter of pride for the country,” he said.Asteroid 2020 QG is about 10 to 20 feet (3 to 6 metres) across, or roughly the size of an SUV, so it was not big enough to do any damage even if it had been pointed at Earth; instead, it would have burned up in the planet’s atmosphere. The previous known record of an asteroid that flew this close to the planet was in 2011. The asteroid, 2011 CQ1, discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey, was around 2,500km higher than 2020 QG.“We are very excited about our next phase: studying such objects with the robotic GROWTH-India Telescope at Hanle, Ladakh,” Bhalerao said. GROWTH-India is a partnership between the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bengaluru, and IIT-B, with support from the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST). It is a part of the international GROWTH collaboration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-iit-bombay-students-in-team-that-identified-asteroid-that-flew-past-earth/story-E5atLKZxYvCnJN7vmySJ9H.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||Swachh Survekshan 2020: Maha 2nd cleanest state; Navi Mumbai is 3rd among cities||Maharashtra was on Thursday ranked the second-cleanest state in the country in the Centre’s Swachh Survekshan 2020 — a survey to rank cleanest cities of India — bagging the highest number of awards for the third consecutive year. Mumbai, however, was ranked 35th nationwide (out of 47 cities with a population over 10 lakh), a relatively poorer performance from last year’s 49th (out of 100 cities with a population over one lakh). Chhattisgarh was given the ‘Cleanest State’ award in the category of states having more than 100 urban local bodies, followed by Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Indore was adjudged India’s cleanest city for a fourth straight year. Mumbai’s satellite town Navi Mumbai improved its performance from last year’s seventh position to become the third-cleanest city in the country.State urban development minister Eknath Shinde said the state performed a “hat-trick” by securing most awards for a third year in a row, with four from the 12 nation-wide categories and 13 from various other categories. Chandrapur was another city from Maharashtra to feature in the top 10, securing the ninth spot. Thane was ranked 31st, while Pune ranked 36th and Nagpur was 44th on the list. The fifth annual cleanliness survey of the country — were announced by Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, in which 129 awards were given in different categories. As per the final results, Mumbai scored 3,106.39 out of the total of 6,000 marks. In 2019, the city had scored 3,277 out of 5,000. Over 2.8 lakh citizens from the city gave feedback in this year’s survey, data said. The Swachh Survekshan ranks cities across the country in the categories of cleanliness and sanitation on four parameters— direct observations, citizen feedback, service-level progress and certification — with 1,500 marks allotted for each category. In the category of smaller cities, with a population of below 1 lakh, three cities from Maharashtra bagged the top three spots. Karad (Satara), Saswad (Pune), and Lonavla (Raigad) were the top three cleanest towns, while 17 other towns from Maharashtra features in the category.“From the 12 national categories, Maharashtra has got four awards, the most by a state. In the 100 Amrut Cities list, 31 cities from Maharashtra have featured in the ranking. While in the non-Amrut cities list, 20 cities and towns out of total 25 are from Maharashtra. It is a big achievement. Besides that, Maharashtra is the second cleanest state in India. This is a matter of immense pride for us. The entire state is now open defecation free. Of them, 216 are certified ODF+ and 116 are certified ODF++ [as per the sanitation protocol of the MoHUA,” Shinde told reporters in Mumbai.(with inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/swachh-survekshan-2020-maha-2nd-cleanest-state-navi-mumbai-is-3rd-among-cities/story-YP22gHcD60B8L6dL5nk7fM.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||State records sharpest Covid case spike for 2nd day in a row||Maharashtra on Thursday recorded its highest single-day spike case, second in a row, with 14,492 Covid-19 cases on Thursday. With the first daily caseload in excess of 14,000, the state’s case count now stood at 643,289, while active cases were at 162,491, nearly 25.25% of the total cases reported so far. On Wednesday, 13,165 cases were reported.The death toll of the state reached 21,359, after 326 deaths were reported. Of them, 231 were reported in the past 48 hours, another 63 deaths from past one week, while the rest 32 deaths were from the period before that, the health officials said.The surge in cases in Maharashtra is not going not down even after 165 days from the first case of Covid-19 detected on March 9. In fact, the average number of cases per day have increased to over 11,000.In 20 days of this month, the state has reported 221,610 cases, which accounts for 11,080 per day, on an average. For the month of July, it was 7,980 cases per day as the state has recorded 247,392 cases in that month, while in June it was 3,405 cases a day as cases recorded were 102,172.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a meeting with district-level officers held on Tuesday had said parts of Maharashtra have reached their peak of Covid-19 cases, while some parts are close to getting there. State health minister Rajesh Tope, too, has said they expect the downward trend of the Covid-19 infection after mid-September. “We have been witnessing peaks across the state, but are not sure how long it will last. We have been witnessing stabilisation of cases in Malegaon, Dharavi and the spread is in control in Aurangabad. In most places, the spread has plateaued and now the downward trend is expected after mid-September,” he said on Tuesday. “Most parts of the state are witnessing their peak as a result increased in daily caseload is observed. We are hoping for downward trend only in September as two festivals — Ganeshotsav and Muharram — are falling on August 22 and August 30 respectively,” said a senior official from health department, wishing not to be named.We have also been doing aggressive tracking and testing following the government orders, which ultimately led to spurt in daily cases, he added.This can be further explained as most of cases used to come from the 19 cities declared as red zones in the past. The scenario was situation changed ever since the lockdown was eased with ‘Mission Begin Again’ starting from June 3.Statistics showed that on June 3, the 19 cities had 67,885 cases, which was 90.68% of the total cases. While on August 20, they accounted for 412,402 cases (64.10% of the total cases). This suggests the rest of the areas have also started contributing in daily cases to a large extent.The 19 cities are Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli, Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Mira-Bhayander, Vasai-Virar, Pune, Solapur, Aurangabad, Nashik, Malegaon, Dhule, Jalgaon, Akola, Amravati and Nagpur.On Thursday, Mumbai recorded 1,275 cases, second-highest cases in the state, taking its tally to 132,822. Of them, active cases were 18,172. The city’s toll stood at 7,314 after 46 deaths reported on Thursday.Pune city continue to contribute maximum infections in the daily caseload as it recorded 1,682 cases on Thursday. Its tally stood at 84,589 cases. Pimpri-Chinchwad, satellite city in Pune Metropolitan Region (MPR), recorded 1,000 cases, third-highest contributor in the state. Its tally goes up to 37,736. Apart from them, Nagpur city and Jalgaon district have recorded 924 cases and 515 cases respectively.High number of casualties has become another cause of concern for the state. In the last 20 days, the state has reported 6,365 deaths, which indicates that it is going to record highest number of casualties his month. Maharashtra still has highest number of deaths across states in the country.The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state was recorded at 3.32% on Thursday. It is slightly less than Gujarat, which has the highest CFR in the country as present. On Wednesday, Gujarat’s CFR was 3.46% with 2,837 deaths (81,942 cases), according to the statistics shared by the state medical education department.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, public health expert, who is also heading the communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state, said Covid deaths are their biggest worry and there is a need for concentrated efforts to bring them down. “Number of deaths are our biggest worry as it is increasing. It is related to the spike in cases because if cases have risen, then a certain percentage of number of deaths will also increase at the same time. This needs concentrated efforts such as early hospitalization, identifying senior citizens and patients having co-morbidities, which I don’t see happening,” Dr Salunkhe said.As many as 459,124 infected patients have recovered and been discharged from various hospitals across the state till date. On Thursday alone, 12,243 recoveries were reported, taking the recovery rate of the state to 71.39%, against the national average of 73.91%.On Thursday, it has conducted 76,961 tests and total number of tests conducted so far are 3,414,809.Currently, 37,639 people have been kept at institutional quarantine facilities and 1,176,261 people were home quarantined across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-records-sharpest-covid-case-spike-for-2nd-day-in-a-row/story-RkUcxfnO2ArCSPyTZCGPvJ.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||CM Thackeray to appoint expert panel to study National Education Policy||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray has announced to appoint an expert committee to study the National Education Policy (NEP) introduced by the Centre, and recommend the steps to be taken for its implementation in Maharashtra. The committee will also recommend the changes needed in the existing laws to incorporate the new policy. The decision was taken during a review meeting held by Thackeray, which was attended by school education minister Varsha Gaikwad, Marathi language minister Subhash Desai, environment minister Aaditya Thackeray and officials from the other departments concerned. Thackeray has also asked the state education department to tap the idea of changing the academic year to January from June in the light of the delay in kicking off the academic year. The expert committee will consist of scholars and researchers from education and other departments from across the state. Thackeray said that the state government was willing to make the education system more student-friendly. “The new education policy has many new concepts which will require changes in the existing laws. The inevitable changes will have to be welcomed, while steps will have to be taken to weed out the difficulties in its implementation. Students should be enabled to ask more and more questions, to push their curiosity. The policy needs to be implemented by keeping all aspects, including technical education, vocational courses and education in mother tongue in mind,” he said. Thackeray has also asked the education department to weed out the difficulties the students are facing in online education during Covid-19 pandemic. Gaikwad has directed the department to consider the idea of reopening physical school for at least Class 10 students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-thackeray-to-appoint-expert-panel-to-study-national-education-policy/story-BK7G6f94HMmU8qAC2Q53jO.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||9 get life imprisonment for killing man after tiff over pet dog||A city civil and sessions court on Thursday sentenced nine people to life imprisonment for killing 30-year-old Anil Pandey, an alleged member of Kumar Pillai gang, after a tiff over his pet dog in 2015 at Bhandup. The nine accused — Sameer Chavan, 21; Gautam Ghadge, 25; Suraj Gawas, 26; Sameer Kadam alias Chintya, 26; Ravindra Wanare, 22; Shaurabh Khopade, 18; Vishal Parad, 21; Sachin Hatpale, 23; and Vishwadip Naik, 25 — were convicted after the prosecution, led by public prosecutor Iqbal Solkar, examined 25 witnesses including Pandey’s wife Priya. Apart from the life sentence, the accused were also fined ₹35,000 each. Priya, in her deposition before the court, said Pandey, who would generally return home by 8pm, was late on June 6, 2015. She later learnt from a friend that Pandey got into a tiff with a few local boys as Pandey’s pet dog caught hold of the cricket ball that the boys were playing with and refused to let it go. While trying to get the ball back, Khopade, one of the accused, got injured which led to the altercation, Priya told the court. Pandey was later brought back home in a drunken state by his friend around 10.30pm. Later that night around 2am on July 7, 2015, a group of men armed with knives and swords started banging their door. As the family did not let them in, the men broke their door and attacked Pandey. Before leaving, they also threatened Priya to not reveal their names to the police. Pandey was taken to a hospital soon after, but was declared dead on arrival. Later, based on the complaint lodged by Priya, all the accused were arrested by Bhandup police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/9-get-life-imprisonment-for-killing-man-after-tiff-over-pet-dog/story-jlMAMRdOcEDAREpE0xcVOJ.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||Pension a fundamental right, cannot be deducted without authority of law: HC||Pension constitutes a fundamental right and deprivation of even a part of it cannot be accepted, except in accordance with the authority of law, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) held on Thursday. The bench of justice Ravi Deshpande and justice NB Suryawanshi was hearing a petition filed by Naini Gopal, a Nagpur resident who retired as an assistant foreman from Ordnance Factory, Bhandara in October 1994. The petitioner complaining of action by the Centralised Pension Processing Centre of the State Bank of India in recovering an amount of Rs 369,035 from his pension by deducting it in monthly installments of Rs 11,400 The bank responded to the petition stating that an amount of Rs 782 was mistakenly being paid in excess to the 85-year-old since October 2007, due to a technical error. SBI maintained that it was because the petitioner’s pension was fixed, treating him as a personnel below officer rank, instead of a civil pensioner, and claimed that the Reserve Bank of India had authorised it to recover the excess pension paid mistakenly. HC, however, rejected the argument after noticing that the bank failed to demonstrate the technical mistake. The judges held that there was no good reason to deduct the amount from the petitioner’s pension, after the Ordnance Factory pointed that there was no error in fixing the the 85 year old’s pension. The bench struck down the action of the bank observing that it cannot fix pension payable to retired employees. “Pension payable to employees upon superannuation is ‘property’ under Article 300-A of the Constitution of India and it constitutes a fundamental right to livelihood under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The deprivation, even a part of this amount, cannot be accepted, except in accordance with and authority of law,” said the bench. “We, therefore, hold that the action of the bank to reduce the pension of the petitioner is unauthorised and illegal,” the bench said, and directed the bank to stop the recovery and credit the amount recovered so far to the pension account of the petitioner. Irked with the “insensitive” approach of the bank officers towards the senior citizen, HC has also imposed a cost of Rs 50,000 on the bank and directed it to deposit the amount in the petitioner’s pension account in eight days, failing which the bank will have to pay a fine of Rs 1,000 for every day of delay. In this regard, the bench said a bank is a trustee of its account holders like the petitioner, and has no authority in the eyes of law to dispute the amount of pension payable to an employee, other than those in its own employment. HC noted that the petitioner is of 85 years of age and has a huge liability of looking after his 45-year-old specially-abled daughter, who also requires costly medical treatment. “Instead of showing sensitivity to the problems of senior citizens, the bank has shown arrogance, and the petitioner was driven from pillar to post to know the reason for deduction of the amount from the pension payable to him,” said the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pension-a-fundamental-right-cannot-be-deducted-without-authority-of-law-hc/story-uek6f9KVD7LKn9JRGq80bI.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||HC restrains state from closing Nashik shelter for distressed women||In a relief to a shelter run by an NGO in Nashik for women in distress, the Bombay high court (HC) has restrained the state from taking any coercive action against the home as it would cause inconvenience to the residents. The NGO, which has been running the shelter from 2009 through funds provided by the Central and state governments under the Swadhar Greh scheme, approached the HC after the state issued them a notice in July asking them to close the shelter as it did not have an approval since 2019. The state refused to give approval to the shelter on the grounds that the NGO was not registered in the same district. The Aurangabad and Nagpur benches of the HC on Wednesday passed similar orders restraining the state from taking coercive action against another 11 such shelters. A division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Riyaz Chagla, while hearing the petition filed by Meenakshi Mahila Vikas Mandal (MMVM), was informed by advocate Satish Talekar that the shelter home housed women in distress and had been functioning since 2009. The shelter was being run under the Swadhar Greh Scheme and was also recognised by the Central government. Talekar further submitted that in 2018 the state government came out with a resolution wherein NGOs and private organisations would be allowed to run shelter homes only in those districts where they were registered. Based on this resolution, the approval of MMVM came to be cancelled in 2019 as the NGO was registered in Nanded whereas the shelter home was in Nashik. Talekar submitted that the NGO had filed a petition in the HC in 2019 but it was not heard. He said that as the state issued a notice of closure in July, there was an urgent need to restrain the government to take coercive action against it. The petitioner’s lawyer also argued that the state did not have powers to order closure of the shelter by passing a resolution as the shelter had the approval of the Centre. He also drew the attention of the bench to orders passed by the Aurangabad and Nagpur benches of the HC on Wednesday in identical petitions filed by 11 other NGOs wherein ad interim protection was granted and the state was restrained from taking coercive action against the shelters. In light of this, he sought similar reliefs. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that as the closure of the shelter would result in inconvenience to the existing residents and render them without a roof, the state should not take coercive action against MMVM. The bench also directed the state to file a reply justifying its decision to cancel the approval of the shelter and posted the matter for hearing after three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-restrains-state-from-closing-nashik-shelter-for-distressed-women/story-WobmWnOo1MfW7QHECSw95M.html
21-08-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC allows Rao Junior Colleges to conduct admissions||A few months after the state education department rejected the recognition to Rao Junior Colleges in the city, the Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday allowed them to conduct admissions for the current academic year. In response to a writ petition filed by Rao Educational Trust, a bench of justice Milind Jadhav and justice KK Tated observed that as per the Maharashtra Self-Financed Schools (Establishment and Regulation Act), 2012, “no order or withdrawal of permission shall be passed unless a reasonable opportunity of being heard is given to such trust or society or local authority”. According to the petitioner, the department had not given a chance to be heard. The court has further asked the education department to give a personal hearing to the college within a period of four weeks from the date of the order. Meanwhile, the HC has asked the department to direct the competent authority to ‘publish supplementary notification on the website of standard 11 Centralised Admission Process 2020-21 for Mumbai Metropolitan Region giving information about the petitioner’s colleges for admissions to FYJC Science’. The court order further states that while students are entitled to admissions in the five junior colleges run by the group, it will be ‘subject to outcome of the present litigation’. Similarly, students admitted for Class 12 in the colleges under Rao group can continue to study there. In July, the education department had cracked a whip against eight junior colleges, including five of the Rao group, in the city for not following norms with respect to infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-allows-rao-junior-colleges-to-conduct-admissions/story-8vrhI4FDtBcs56CANpesKM.html

Special public prosecutor Vaibhav Baghade said that the plea is scheduled for hearing on August 31, when the prosecution will have to submit its reply over the accused’s bail application. Vijay Rajbhar, another accused in the case, too, has moved a plea for interim bail, which will also be heard on August 31. Chintan was arrested on December 22, 2015 for the murders. Hema and Bhambani were allegedly smothered with a chloroform-laced cloth by another accused in the case, Vidhyadhar Rajbhar, at his warehouse on December 11, 2015. The alleged murderers then packed the bodies of the victims in cardboard boxes and dumped them in a sewer at Kandivli. The bodies were found a day later. The police believe that Vidhyadhar, who has been absconding since the murder, committed the crime at the behest of Upadyay. Vidhyadhar’s last call was reportedly traced to a location in Jammu. Police officers also claimed that Upadyay used a mediator — whose identity has not been established — to arrange meetings with the other suspects in the months leading up to the murders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/artist-chintan-upadhyay-accused-of-murdering-wife-and-her-lawyer-applies-for-interim-bail/story-907J53co1ZTct5knBIMoqK.html
21-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Three murders within minutes of each other in sector 9||Unidentified men shot dead three persons in two separate incidents in sector 9 within minutes of each other on Thursday evening. Police said all three dead men were linked to a criminal gang with a history of violence in the region, but added that it was too soon to conclude whether the killings were a fallout of inter-gang rivalry. Prima facie, they said, the two were not linked.According to the police, the first incident took place around 5pm outside Wings Apartments. Three armed persons arrived and attacked three others -- Anmol from Bhawani Enclave, Sunny from Basai and an unidentified person. Anmol suffered one gunshot wound and collapsed outside, while Sunny was chased and shot him multiple times inside the society after which the suspects fled. Both were rushed to a private hospital, where doctors declared them dead-on-arrival. The third person survived by hiding in the society. Police said preliminary probe had revealed that the Anmol and Sunny had a plot related dispute with the prime suspect Pavan Nehra, a resident of Bhora Kalan. The second incident was reported around the same time near a temple in Basai village three kilometers from the first incident. Armed suspects arrived on a motorcycle, and shot 18-year-old Sameer alias Vicky. He suffered at least four gunshot wounds and was rushed to civil hospital, where he died during treatment. Senior police officers and forensic teams visited the crime scenes and collected evidence. An officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, confirmed that the victims were associated with a gang. “Sunny and Anmol are associated with Moni Kataria and Joni Kataria gang. There has been a history of violence in Basai between gangs,” he said. Preet Pal, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, “We are investigating if the two killings are linked. Prima facie, there was enmity regarding a plot in Basai between two groups. We have initiated a probe and more will come out once statements of eyewitnesses, if any, are recorded. It would be premature to conclude a gang rivalry in the cases at this point.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-three-murders-within-minutes-of-each-other-in-sector-9/story-4fuw3ZNuiwxSsehNhcaLRJ.html

In its 199th board meeting on Tuesday, the authority sanctioned a budget of Rs 99.70 crore for work on a multi-jet water flow technology aimed at improving water flow to each consumer, said authority officials. The authority will initially install water meters in households of 10% of the total 79,210 consumers, they added.The new technology will enable the authority to charge the consumer on the basis of consumption, said officials, and will need installation of water metres. Bills will be generated on the basis of consumption of the water with the help of these metres, and officials hope this will deter residents from wasting water.“We aim to not only check wastage of water but also improve services to the consumers,” said Avinash Tripathi officer on special duty, Noida authority.As of now, the authority levies fixed charges on consumers on the basis of the size of a household. However, once the water metres are installed, the authority will impose a variable charge on the basis of consumption and a fixed charge, said officials.The authority is planning to hire a private agency that will be responsible for installing the meters and taking care of operations and maintenance for 10 years. While the authority has not fixed a deadline for the scheme, it hopes to roll out the plan fully by 2021.Once the metres are installed, the authority may also revise the water charges, said officials.

21-08-2020||Delhi||South-east, north, central districts have highest prevalence of antibodies in Delhi||The southeast, north and central districts of Delhi recorded the highest prevalence rate of antibodies – 33.2%, 31.6% and 31.4% respectively – in Delhi’s latest Covid-19 sero survey, the result of which was shared by the city’s health minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday.Southeast Delhi also recorded the highest increase (of 11.08 percentage points) when compared with the previous sero-survey for which blood samples were collected between June 27 and July 10 to assess the number of people who have developed antibodies against the coronavirus disease, including those who may have contracted the Sars-CoV-2 infection and overcome it without realising it.Follow latest updates on coronavirus hereSouthwest district was the one which recorded the lowest prevalence rate of the antibodies – 16.3%. And, at 24.6%, New Delhi district recorded the second lowest, according to the data released on Thursday which suggested that around 29.1% of the capital’s population has developed antibodies against the virus.The sero prevalence rate reflects the number of people out of a given sample size (around 15,000 in this case) who contracted the Sars-Cov-2 virus and recovered from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). When infected, individuals develop antibodies in their blood. The sample size is calculated by experts to ensure that at any given point it is fit for extrapolation for reflect trends inclusive of the entire population of a state, city or district, explained a senior official in the health department. Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know today“Sero survey helps in the analysis of trends and better assessment of asymptomatic population, case detection rate and infection-death ratio. The results can be used by the administration and experts ,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). HT on Thursday spoke with several district officials to get a better sense of how they interpreted the data in terms of actions that need to be taken in the days to come. Several of them suggested that both high and low prevalence rate of antibodies found through the sero survey in any district demand more or less the same efforts in testing, isolation and surveillance. “A high prevalence rate of antibodies means a large number of people were infected but they were not diagnosed, even after testing was scaled up. It means more tests need to be done and they have to cover more asymptomatic individuals. We have to scale up testing, with focus on special surveillance groups (SSGs) and individuals residing in densely populated areas,” said a district surveillance official who did not wish to be identified.Another district official said, “Low prevalence rate of antibodies means that a larger population in the concerned area are still vulnerable. This also demands that the district should continue with aggressive testing, surveillance and isolation mechanism to protect the population which is yet to contract the virus.”Also read| 3 in 10 Delhi residents have antibodies for Covid-19: New sero resultRahul Singh, district magistrate (southwest), which has the lowest prevalence of antibodies (16.3%) said the result means the district has the lowest infection rate in the entire city. “It’s a good thing. Based on the latest sero survey results, directions have been issued to all officials in the district to continue aggressive testing and strict enforcement. We are focusing on high-risk groups (HRGs) and SSGs and Covid-19 test is available at all dispensaries in the district. Proactive surveillance and additional camps at all markets and public places for testing have been set up,” he said.In a statement, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal lauded the ‘Delhi model’ of ‘test, track and treat’ and said the doubling rate of Covid-19 cases in Delhi has gone up to 101.5 days, compared to 28.8 days for rest of India. He also said there has been a significant drop in the positivity rate in two months, from 24.59% on June 18 to 5.25% on August 16.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage“The positivity rate has dropped for both RT-PCR tests and rapid antigen tests.

21-08-2020||Delhi||Areas under Delhi’s three civic bodies among dirtiest in country||Barring the Lutyens’ zone of the national capital -- administered by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) -- areas under Delhi’s three municipal corporations were among the dirtiest surveyed for the Swachh Survekshan 2020 rankings for cities with a population of more than one million. Swachh Sarvekshan is the central government’s annual survey on cleanliness under the Swachh Bharat Mission. This was the fifth edition of the survey introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2016. This year, the survey covered 4,242 cities across the country in which a total of 19 million citizens participated. The survey is conducted by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs. Areas under South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) ranked 31, the North corporation got the 43rd rank, and the East Delhi civic body stood 46th among the 47 cities surveyed -- Patna, incidentally, was in last place. All the three MCDs are controlled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).At the same time, NDMC, which does not follow the same election mechanism the corporations do, earned New Delhi the tag of the “cleanest capital city”. The category of cities with a population of more than one million was introduced this year in order to have a fair comparison among cities that have a major difference in their population indexes. In 2019, when the category it was a part of (425 cities with a population of more than 1 lakh) included more cities, SDMC was 138th out of 425, North MCD 282nd, and the East Delhi civic body was in 240th place.Rajiv Kumar Jain , superintending engineer and nodal officer of Swachh Bharat mission of SDMC said, “This time those cities above 10 lakh and below 10 lakh population were separated which is why it appears that we are lagging behind. However, if the marks scored are compared in the overall list, we are 120th in the 429 urban local bodies surveyed.” South corporation mayor Anamika Mithilesh insisted that the civic body has moved up slightly in the rankings. “We have been carrying out various campaigns to segregate waste, improve the condition of landfills by recycling more and more waste. We hope to get even better ranking next year,” she said.Officials in the other two corporations seemed more concerned.North Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said he will convene a meeting to look into the various aspects that need to be worked upon to improve the area’s ranking. “Though we have been working hard to clear dhalaos (garbage dumps) located on the main roads and have set up new compost plants, we need to improve segregation of waste at the source,” said Prakash. East Delhi mayor Nirmal Jain blamed the change in the criteria for poor ranking. He also said that they could have done better had the Delhi government released the due funds in time. “We have improved much from previous rankings. We could have done much better if the Delhi government had released funds,” said Jain.The government has maintainted that there is no delay in payments from its side.NDMC stood third in the rankings among the 382 cities surveyed in the ”Cities with 1 lakh to 10 lakh population” category. The council, which caters to a population of about 250,000, also got three stars out of five under the “Garbage Free City” award and two pluses in the “Open Defecation Free (ODF)” category -- the same as last year.“NDMC is a bin free city with volume sensor underground bins which are monitored at a command and control centre. Besides, we are carrying out 100% door-to-door collection. No garbage goes to landfill site and the entire waste is incinerated to produce power,” said a senior NDMC official in a statement.Delhi-based waste management expert Swati Singh Sambyal said except for the NDMC, the rankings of the three corporations are the manifestation of the ground realities. “It is high time that the corporations work out a system for sustainable waste management and reduce their dependence on the traditional method of dumping waste at landfills. They should rather focus on turning dhalaos into small waste processing centres for better results.”According to the government, a total of 4,242 cities in multiple categories, 62 Cantonment Boards and 97 Ganga towns were surveyed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/areas-under-delhi-s-three-civic-bodies-among-dirtiest-in-country/story-ierKS9XXZIlTCREjSxV58I.html
21-08-2020||Delhi||Repeat of flood, snarls trauma after heaviest rain this season in Delhi||The heaviest rain so far this monsoon lashed the national capital on Thursday morning, leading to a repeat of the water-logging and commuting hassles seen on Wednesday. At least 50 stretches were inundated and snarls choked parts of central, south and west Delhi.Delhi’s Aya Nagar weather station recorded 122.8mm of rain over 24 hours, the highest this monsoon so far and probably the highest in over a decade in Delhi. But this fact could not be established as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) does not have records for Aya Nagar station for the preceding years. “We don’t have (previous years) records available for Aya Nagar station. It received very heavy rainfall, as the monsoon trough is passing over Delhi and has shifted towards the south. This is the reason that the southern parts of Delhi and the neighbouring regions received heavy rain,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre. The IMD only keeps records for Safdarjung station (considered as representative of Delhi’s weather) and Palam station.Going by these, on August 20, 2010, Safdarjung had recorded 110mm rain within a span of 24 hours, which falls in the ‘heavy’ category. This, weather scientists said, was the highest rainfall recorded in the past decade so far. Rainfall between 64.5 – 115.5mm is considered “heavy” rain, while a reading between 115.6 – 204.4mm is considered “very heavy” rain.Also read: After 80% of season’s rain in 11 days, HS Puri says Delhi’s monsoon woes to be over soonOn August 2, 1961, Safdarjung had recorded an all-time high of 184mm rain over 24 hours. Palam’s all-time record of ‘very heavy’ rainfall was on August 6, 1963, when it registered 183.6mm of rain over 24 hours. On Thursday, Palam and Delhi Ridge stations received 89.1mm and 77.3mm rain, respectively, over 24 hours, both considered ”heavy” rainfall. The Safdarjung observatory recorded 54.8 mm rain over 24 hours, in the ”moderate” category. The IMD at 5am Thursday issued an ‘Orange’ alert, warning of heavy rain in isolated places and predicting moderate rain and thundershowers in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) between 5.30am and 8.30am. The Orange alert is issued to allow citizens and government agencies to prepare for heavy rain that may cause traffic disruption, increased chance of vehicular accidents and water accumulation in low-lying areas and on roads. Pul Prahladpur underpass submerged According to civic agencies and the public works department (PWD), at least 50 spots in the city reported water-logging. Some of the prominent locations where roads were inundated include Pul Prahladpur rail underpass, Bhairon Marg, near Hanuman Mandir Kashmere Gate, Rani Jhansi Road, near Vikas Bhawan ITO, the Ring Road near IP flyover, Maa Anandmayee Marg, Raja Garden flyover, Rohtak Road, Zakhira underpass, Joseph Tito road near Okhla Mandi, Kalkaji, Vikas Marg, Vishwas Nagar, Jhilmil underpass, Jangpura, New Friends Colony, Lal Kuan at Mehrauli-Badarpur Road, Paschim Vihar, and Pitampura, among others. Images of water-logging at Pul Prahladpur underpass, doing the rounds of social media, showed a cluster bus (orange bus) half submerged. Authorities, however, said no one was trapped in the bus and that there was no casualty. A senior PWD official said the heavy water-logging at the underpass was due to the unusually heavy rain, coupled with a Delhi Jal Board (DJB) sewer line overflow. “We have already asked the DJB to fix the sewer line. We have six permanent pumps installed there with a capacity to pump out 7,000 cubic metres of water per hour. It took us a few hours to clear the underpass,” the official said, requesting anonymity.Commuters were stuck in traffic on Mathura Road, Ring Road, Vikas Marg, Rohtak Road near Punjabi Bagh, Sarai Kale Khan, BRT Road, Raja Garden, Najafgarh-Uttam Nagar Road, and Tughlakabad among others. In the morning, traffic police had to shut MB Road, due to water-logging at Pul Prahladpur underpass. “Why can’t the authorities fix water-logging issues in the national capital? It’s a nightmare to drive on inundated roads and one gets stuck in jams for hours,” Kartik Kumar, a commuter and resident of Maharani Bagh, said.Civic officials said the incidents of trees falling were also reported from around 35 places in the city. They said incidents of building/roof/wall collapses were reported from at least 10 locations.Rain deficit made upIMD’s Srivastava said the good spell of rain this week has already made up the capital city’s rain deficit and it is now in the surplus category. Safdarjung now has a surplus rainfall of 15%. Until August 18, it had a deficit of 14%.The IMD data shows that after this week’s spell, the rainfall recorded in the month of August touched a surplus of 15%. Parts of west, central and south Delhi, which had received only traces of rain have also made up the deficit. At Palam, the monthly rainfall has reached a surplus of 40% over the past two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/heaviest-rain-this-monsoon-batters-and-floods-delhi/story-uC4NWUqSX0UPKqaXNwwWUM.html
21-08-2020||Education||Schools of excellence in each district, exchange plan for students in Delhi govt’s ‘Vision 2030’ plan||Creation of at least one school of excellence (SoE) in each district, teaching foreign language in government schools, connected classrooms, exchange programmes for students and corporate social responsibility (CSR) funding are among the projects shortlisted for the directorate of education’s (DoE) “Vision 2030”.The directorate on Thursday told different departments that it had approved their projects for the implementation of “Vision 2030” after consulting stakeholders and the secretary (education), and set tentative timelines. In the orders, copies of which are with HT, deputy director (administration) Ramchandra Shingare advised department heads to stick to the timelines. An advisor in Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia’s office said “Vision 2030” is a part of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s strategies to uplift public education in the national capital. “Many of these projects were also announced by the government during the budget speech earlier this year. We are targeting to achieve all this much before 2030,” the advisor said.To set up schools of excellence -- the English-medium schools of Delhi government -- in each district, the DoE has asked its SoE branch to identify existing school buildings where new rooms can be constructed and prepare a proposal to declare those institutes as schools of excellence by September 15. The tentative timeline for the introduction of foreign languages in SoEs and Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalayas (RPVVs) is December 31, 2020.Elaborating the plan on connected classrooms, the DoE order stated, “It is decided to convert all classes, including nursery, in all schools into connected classrooms in the period of four years. The project will be implemented in a phased manner.”Integrated digital devices will be installed in all classrooms. Primary and nursery classes will get smart/interactive TVs. In some classrooms, laptops will be provided to improve learning. The project is likely to be implemented by the end of this year, the DoE order said.Smart cards will be issued to all government school students tentatively by September 30. “The smart card will have multiple uses like entry in school, use of health services, utilisation of library services, etc,” it said. The DoE has also ordered its school branch to come up with a proposal by August 30 to send students to other countries for exchange programmes. The Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan branch has been told to develop a CSR portal of DoE by August 30. “It is decided to develop the CSR portal of DoE to facilitate NGOs and corporates willing to support education work in Delhi government schools,” the directorate said. Principals of government schools said these projects will help provide better facilities to students. “If there are schools of excellence in all districts, it will remove stigma attached to government schools. The smart cards will help students to access all government facilities,” said AK Jha, principal of Sarvodya co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/schools-of-excellence-in-each-district-exchange-plan-for-students-in-delhi-govt-s-vision-2030-plan/story-U54EmiLF0mWhaQwNjr5aHM.html
21-08-2020||Delhi||AAP criticises MCDs for poor score in cleanliness survey||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Thursday criticised the three municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs) citing their poor performance in light of the central government’s 2020 cleanliness survey – the report of which was released earlier in the day.While the AAP is in charge of the Delhi government, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rules all three municipal corporations of Delhi.“The central government’s 2020 cleanliness survey reveals that the BJP-ruled MCDs were the worst performers in the country. The south Delhi civic body was ranked 31, North MCD 43 and East MCD 46 in the cleanliness survey,” said Durgesh Pathak, the AAP’s in charge of MCD affairs.He further said, “PM Narendra Modi is campaigning for a clean India, but the BJP councillors and leaders have tarnished his image. From cleaning Delhi to providing primary education and health, the MCDs have miserably failed in all fronts.”The mayors of the three MCDs blamed the AAP for not releasing funds that were due to the corporations, for want of which major development works have remained stuck. Read: Areas under Delhi’s three civic bodies among dirtiest in countryEast corporation mayor Nirmal Jain said, “The AAP has no right to raise allegations when it has not released our funds and we cannot even pay our staff on time. Despite that, our sanitation workers continued to work even during the Covid-19 pandemic.” North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said that the Delhi government must release funds before pointing fingers at the civic bodies. South corporation mayor Anamika Mithilesh said the civic body is working with limited resources and is striving to more revenue so that it doesn’t have to depend on the Delhi government for funds to keep the city clean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-criticises-mcds-for-poor-score-in-cleanliness-survey/story-eWgykXv9QjJCASZBoBz1jK.html
21-08-2020||City||Swachh Survekshan 2020: Ludhiana declared best big city in innovation||Adding another feather to its cap, the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) has been declared the ‘best big city in innovation and best practices’ under the Swachh Survekshan- 2020 rankings released on Thursday. The results were announced during a virtual ceremony organised by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, Government of India, on Thursday, to celebrate the Swachh Mahotsav. The city stood 34th among 47 big cities (having a population 10 to 40 lakh) in the overall rankings with 3113.06 points out of 6,000. Amritsar, which also contested in the same category, secured the 39th rank. The Swachh Survey is divided into three quarters. In the previous two quarters, Ludhiana had secured the 40th and 38th positions. MC officials said that the city had adopted innovative practices such as composting, segregation of household waste, distribution of cloth bags to do away with plastic bags, encouraging vertical gardens, involvement of councillors and religious bodies for special drives among others. Congratulating the MC staff and residents for the feat, mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “It is an outcome of the hard work put in by sweepers, sewermen, MC officials, MC General House and residents of the city. We will put in more efforts for the Swachh Survekshan 2021 and hope that the residents will also support the civic body.” CITY’S RANKINGS IN THE PASTIn 2019, the city stood 163rd rank out of 4,237 cities, while in 2018, it had secured the 137th position out of 485 cities with over 1 lakh population. The city stood at the 140th position out of 434 cities in 2017 and 34th out of 50 cities in 2016. WHERE THE CITY LAGGED THIS TIME All cities are judged on four parameters-- direction observation, citizen feedback, service level progress, certification. Each parameter has a weightage of 1,500 marks. Ludhiana MC secured 1,115 marks under direct observation, 1,070.27 under citizens’ feedback, 627.29 in service level progress and 300 marks under certification. OPEN DUMPING STILL A PROBLEM HERE The Ludhiana MC is yet to finding a solution to open dumping in the city. Apart from that it has not been able to do anything about 24 lakh tones of legacy waste dumped at the main dumping site. MC officials say static compactors are being installed to do away with open dumping of garbage, however, as per residents, the problem is far from over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/swachh-survekshan-2020-ludhiana-declared-best-big-city-in-innovation/story-ANDCi6sBQ66ArUit3kZ0lI.html
21-08-2020||Chandigarh||2006 J&K sex scandal: HC upholds conviction of four, acquits ex-BSF DIG||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday acquitted former Border Security Force (BSF) deputy inspector general, KC Padhi and convicted four persons, including a former deputy superintendent of police (DSP), in the 2006 Jammu and Kashmir sex scandal.With this, the 10-year jail term to Padhi has been quashed but upheld against former DSP, Mohammad Ashraf Mir and three others Shabbir Ahmed Laway, Shabbir Ahmed Langoo and Masood Ahmed, all locals. All of them were convicted by a Chandigarh CBI trial court in 2018. The trial court had acquitted two persons named in the scandal ­former state law officer, Anil Sethi and Mehrajudin Malik. The ‘kingpin’ of the scandal, Sabeena, and her husband died during trial, who were accused of forcing minors into prostitution for ₹250 to ₹500 in Srinagar. The sex scandal came to light in 2006 after the police recovered some video CDs of minor Kashmiri girls being sexually exploited. The allegations were levelled against the security forces officers, police officials, ministers and other influential people. The names of 57 people had cropped up ,initially.The case was handed over to CBI amidst raging controversy. It was on intervention of the apex court that trial was shifted out of the state. Four victims had turned hostile during the trial and conviction has taken place in one minor girl’s case. As many as 60 witnesses were examined, said senior advocate, Bipan Ghai, who appeared for Padhi. Acquitting former BSF officer, the HC bench of justice Arvind Singh Sangwan took note of a witness statements that his wife used to reside with him and no lady had ever visited his house except Padhi’s two daughters when the alleged rapes transpired. Also, it took note of statements that the BSF cantonment was a highly vulnerable area and entry without proper authorisation was not possible . It also took note of accounts that 40 militants were killed on different occasions in operations led by Padhi. “...By using feeble shoulders of the minor as a pedestal some organisations tried to settle their own agendas against paramilitary forces. Therefore, false implication of Padhi under pressure cannot be ruled out,” the bench observed in its 140-page judgment. As of convictions of four others, the court said it is proved that the girl was minor at the time of incident and argument of convicts of not knowing her age was inconsequential. Don’t remain silent spectator if sexual crime victims are asked lewd questions: HC to trial courts The Punjab and Haryana high court has directed courts in both the states and Chandigarh to not remain a silent spectator if victims of sexual crimes are asked lewd questions by lawyers . The high court bench of justice Arvind Singh Sangwan gave these directions, taking note of such instances reported in trial court proceedings of the Jammu and Kashmir sex scandal. The registrar general will circulate observations made in this judgment to all the courts dealing with cases of crime against women regarding lewd, filthy and indecent questions put to the prosecutrix, which could not be allowed by the trial court, the bench said. While conducting the cross-examination of victims of sexual assault, the court should be vigilant that the defence counsel should not adopt a strategy of questioning the prosecutrix as to the detail of the rape, it said, adding that courts should not sit like a silent spectator while the victim of the crime is being cross-examined by the defence and it should effectively control the recording of evidence to avoid her victimisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2006-j-k-sex-scandal-hc-upholds-conviction-of-four-acquits-ex-bsf-dig/story-KGdyu4fnsFFduU1xbLEuxL.html

21-08-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER pegs Covid-19 test costs at ₹8 crore a month||The Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research estimates that its Covid-19 testing expenditure will come to Rs 8 crore a month, following the Union government orders to Centrally funded institutes to independently procure materials for the tests.Earlier provided by the Indian Council of Medical Research, the testing kits will now have to be procured by the institutes. “Soon after the outbreak there was a shortage of kits and reagents required for testing and thus a centralised system for distribution was set up. However, now there is no shortage and most of the products are available online through Government eMarketplace (GeM). Thus, the Central government is of the view that the institutes can buy as per their requirement directly, so we have started that process,” said a senior officer of the institute requesting anonymity.PGIMER conducts around 900 tests a day on samples from Chandigarh city, parts of Punjab and UT of Ladakh as well, conducting a total of more than 50,000 tests till now.The institute conducts reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), GeneXpert, and Rapid Antigen tests to detect and confirm Covid-19. Testing costs include Rs 2,300 for GeneXpert, Rs 1,300 for RT-PCR and Rs 600 for antigen. Being a costly test, GeneXpert is conducted only in emergency cases while RT-PCR is conducted routinely. Due to less reliability, antigen tests are not being promoted much. Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER, said the institute conducted nearly 30,000 tests a month for which estimated costs had been worked out and sent to the Central government.The amount also includes other items required for Covid-19 treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pgimer-pegs-covid-19-test-costs-at-rs-8-crore-a-month/story-kLJy2CEcDc4yd7ARcBSaUM.html

The Swargate and Shivajinagar ST stands saw passengers since early morning. “We were already running 100 buses within the district. From 8 am today, we resumed all types of buses running on various routes from all our ST stands. We are getting good response. Each bus is sanitised before allowed to ply and only 22 passengers with face mask are allowed to travel. Drivers and conductors on duty are given sanitizer and face mask. We hope to increase the number of buses and routes in the coming days,” said MSRTC Pune divisional controller Yamini Joshi. Passengers, including families, youth and senior citizens were seen visiting the Swargate ST stand since the first bus resumed service at 8 am on Thursday. Many were boarding buses to go to their hometowns for Ganesh festival. One such family of Mangesh Talekar who was travelling along with his wife and two kids said, “It is the first time that we are going back to our village in Kolhapur after the lockdown. As we come from middle class family and cannot afford to pay for private vehicle, we were unable to travel till now. It was a right decision to resume ST bus service before the Ganpati festival, so we are now going back home.” Many buses plied from Swargate ST stand to places like Kolhapur, Solapur, Baramati, Mumbai, Daund and other parts of the state. As compared to Shivneri or Shivshahi buses that mostly run on Mumbai routes, passengers for normal ST buses on Kolhapur and Solapur routes were more. One of the conductors of Pune-Dadar Shivneri bus said, “I was waiting for more than two hours for passengers, as minimum 10 and maximum 22 passengers can be taken. Finally, the bus departed with seven passengers.” “The day one response was good as we sent 18 buses from Swargate depot to various routes. Solapur and Kolhapur routes saw 400 passengers. We will increase the number of buses tomorrow and hope for more passengers,” said Swati Bandre, Swargate depot manager. The new Wakdewadi ST stand, which was earlier at Shivajinagar, also saw passengers since morning and buses were sent to several routes like Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Nagpur, Jalgaon and Nashik. The platforms, benches and toilets were sanitised by MSRTC. Shivnath Renuse, a senior citizen who travelled to Ahmednagar said, “I am happy today as I am going to my daughter’s place for Ganpati festival. I was stuck at a relative’s home in Pune and was waiting for ST to resume bus service. I am travelling by following all safety precautions.”PMPML service to resume from Sept 3Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) will resume its bus service from September 3. “It was decided to start the public transport from September 3.

According to the police, the deceased, identified as Shubham Janardhan Nakhate (22) of Nakhatenagar in Kalewadi, used to allegedly harass the accused by resorting to abuse and non-payment of snacks that he ate at their stalls.

21-08-2020||Gurugram||More families and couples seek mental health counselling||The psychiatry division in private hospitals of the city have been witnessing a significant increase in the number of people requiring family and couple counselling in the last four months. According to them, a majority of the cases were through tele-consultations and were related to anxiety disorders and depression arising out of issues between couples and family members.“During the entire lockdown phase, families or couples have lived under the same roof for the longest time. In some cases, psychological issues were pre-existing which augmented as inter-personal conflicts increased between the couples, fuelling extreme anxiety and depression,” said Kanishk Gupta, director and co-founder, Sukoon Health, a mental health unit under Fortis healthcare.“This has led to almost 20% increase in family and couple counselling sessions compared to the footfall of patients before lockdown in April.”According to Dr. Saurabh Mehrotra, consultant, mental health and quality of life division at Medanta Medicity, there have been two sets of patients with psychological disorder over the last few months. “One group comprises people whose anxiety disorders are due to the fear of the disease, while the other group is affected by the consequences of the lockdown and the economic meltdown,” said Mehrotra. Presently, Mehrotra is getting 15-20 new cases every day with mental health issues directly related to lockdown and current Covid-19 situation. “Nearly 80% of the cases are being handled through tele-consultations. Some inter-personal issues, which leads to domestic violence cannot be tackled online. Therefore, we have to call the patient to hospital,” he said.Dr. Jyoti Kapoor, senior consultant, psychiatry, Paras Hospital, said that interpersonal problems have also spiked in vulnerable population where conflicts among parents has caused rise of anxiety and somatization symptoms in children. “The novelty of the situation along with the uncertainty of how things will pan out for global health and economy has left people confused and even frustrated. New cases due to Covid-19 fear have also emerged and almost 25 percent of daily OPD is one or the other way affected by coronavirus fear or lockdown related issues.” She said that even with the unlock process, there is a significant increase in reappearance of anxiety and obsessive symptoms in previously treated stable patient population. The substantial increase is also due to sudden popping up of the middle class section of the society seeking psychological support, said Dr. Soumiya Mudgal, consultant, psychiatry, Max Hospital (Gurugram). “This has led to almost 20-30% increase in the family counselling sessions since April onwards. Before lockdown, there were cases mostly related to families and children. But now middle-class section with their job issues or businesses are coming up with mental disorders. Two out every 10 patients are coming with suicidal tendencies.” Experts are also noticing other consequences of the situation – de-addiction from alcohol. According to Gupta, hospitalization due to alcohol de-addiction has also increased by 35%. “In the last four months, there has been a spike in the hospitalization of patients, who have taken up alcohol again after quitting. Since they did not want any nurse or health staff to visit them at home, these patients prefer getting admitted,” said Gupta. Mudgal has been suggesting her patients not to consider themselves mentally or emotionally secluded from the global pandemic. “The current situation takes a toll mentally if it considered as an individual issue. People should accept that it has affected everyone globally. Second, they should try shifting or extending the time line of their plans made at personal and professional front,” she said. Other experts suggested to seek medical help if they are having severe anxiety, unexplained aggressive behaviour, excessive worrying leading to panic state or severe Obsessive Compulsive disorder (OCD).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/more-families-and-couples-seek-mental-health-counselling/story-A6vnEJXWx1Dkvg9AYXt5pI.html
21-08-2020||World||California fires claim 6 lives, threaten thousands of homes||Sky-darkening wildfires that took at least six lives and forced tens of thousands of people from their homes blazed throughout California on Friday as firefighting resources strained under the vastness of the infernos authorities were trying to control.Three major complexes encompassing dozens of fires chewed through a combined 780 square miles (2,020 square kilometers) of forests, canyons and rural areas flanking San Francisco on three sides.Statewide, nearly 12,000 firefighters are battling blazes that have scorched more than 1,200 square miles (3,120 square kilometers) in California, said Daniel Berlant, assistant deputy director for the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire.Crews from Oregon, Idaho and Arizona have arrived to relieve local firefighters, he said, with engines on their way from as far away as Maryland and New Jersey.Tens of thousands of homes were threatened by flames that drove through dense and bone-dry trees and brush. Many of the fires were sparked by lightning strikes from brief thunderstorms — nearly 12,000 since last weekend — as a high-pressure area over the West brought a dangerous mix of triple-digit weather and monsoonal moisture pulled from the south.Some fires doubled in size within 24 hours, fire officials said.And while some evacuations were lifted in the small city of Vacaville, between San Francisco and Sacramento, other areas expanded their evacuation areas. The University of California, Santa Cruz, was evacuated, and a new fire burning near Yosemite National Park also prompted evacuations.Santa Cruz itself, a coastal city of 65,000, wasn’t affected. But Mayor Justin Cummings urged residents Thursday evening to be prepared to evacuate by gassing up their vehicles and packing important documents, medicines and other belongings.“Prepare early so that you are ready to go at a moment’s notice,” Cummings said.More than 64,000 people have been ordered to evacuate in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties, which make up part of Silicon Valley and hug the coast south of San Francisco.With firefighting resources tight, homes in remote, hard-to-get-to places burned unattended. Cal Fire Chief Mark Brunton pleaded with evacuees to quit battling fires on their own, saying that just causes more problems for professionals.“We had last night three separate rescues that pulled our vital, very few resources away,” he said.An anxious Rachel Stratman, 35, and her husband, Quentin Lareau, 40, waited for word Friday about their home in the Forest Springs community of Boulder Creek after evacuating earlier this week. She knows one house has burned but has received conflicting information about the rest of the neighborhood.“It’s so hard to wait and not know,” she said. “I’m still torn if I want people to be going back to the area and videotaping. I know they cause the firefighters distraction, but that’s the only way we know.”The couple are in a San Jose hotel with medication she needs after undergoing a transplant surgery last month. She collected her mother’s ashes and some clothes while her husband closed windows and readied the home before they evacuated Tuesday.“I kept looking at things and kept thinking I should grab this or that, but I just told myself I needed to leave. I didn’t bring any official documents and I didn’t bring my house deed or car title. No passport,” she said.The ferocity of the fires was astonishing so early in the fire season, which historically has seen the largest and deadliest blazes when gusty, dry winds blow in the fall.But the death toll already had reached at least six since the majority of blazes started less than a week ago, with four deaths claimed by fires burning in wine country north of San Francisco.The bodies of three people were found in a home that burned in Napa, Henry Wofford, spokesman for the Napa County Sheriff’s Office, told the San Francisco Chronicle. In Solano County Sheriff Thomas A. Ferrara reported the death of a male resident there.Separately, a Pacific Gas & Electric utility worker was found dead Wednesday in a vehicle in the Vacaville area Wednesday. In central California, a pilot on a water-dropping mission in western Fresno County died Wednesday morning when his helicopter crashed.At least two other people were missing and more than 30 civilians and firefighters have been injured, authorities said.Smoke and ash billowing from the fires also fouled the air throughout California’s scenic central coast and in San Francisco. The fires have destroyed at least 175 buildings.Tim and Anne Roberts had gone to the beach with their two children on Monday to avoid the smoke at their home in Boulder Creek in Santa Cruz County. They packed a change of clothes, their children’s school supplies and their passports — just in case.They learned Wednesday that their house had burned. Birth certificates, legal documents and family heirlooms are gone. But in photos of the ruins, they were surprised by how many redwoods, oaks and fruit trees were still standing.“It’s a strange sort of comfort,” Tim Roberts said.The good news for Brookdale resident Larissa Eisenstein Thursday afternoon was that her five chickens, Kelly and The Nuggets, had been safely relocated into a stranger’s yard in a safer, neighboring community.The chicken evacuation came a day after Eisenstein, a Silicon Valley tech worker, had been forced to leave them behind during an overnight evacuation. She fled with her cats Mochi and Mini, driving from one hotel to the next only to find they were full before landing in a safe place where they could get some rest.The bad news Thursday was that the fire was burning down her wooded street as she adjusted to the idea that her worldly possessions may now be limited to photos of her parents, some jewelry she had grabbed, and fresh tomatoes from her garden.“After I got the cats, I realized there was very little important to me, and the priority is to try to remember how lovely things can be,” she said. “I’ve had a wonderful garden this year.”Although temperatures were predicted to ease slightly on Friday, they were also expected to be hot enough so that firefighters will not be able to count on cool evening weather aiding them. Erratic winds also could drive the fires unpredictably in multiple directions, state fire officials said.Winds gusting to 20 mph (32 kph) over ridge tops could challenge overnight firefighting efforts in Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties, said the incident commander, Cal Fire Assistant Chief Billy See. More firefighters were sent to battle the complex of fires, but “it’s still not enough,” See said.“We’re still drastically short for a fire of this size,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-fires-claim-6-lives-threaten-thousands-of-homes/story-kr1CtlgeoiHDthx7vWRfOK.html
21-08-2020||World||Kamala Harris’ dual identities challenge America’s race labels||It was just 20 years ago that the UScensus began to allow Americans to identify as more than one race. And now, the country is on the threshold of seeing the name of Kamala Harris -- proud daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother -- on the national ballot.Harris’ historic nomination for vice president on the Democratic ticket is challenging America’s emphasis on identity and labels.While her dual heritage represents several slices of the multicultural and multiracial experience, many have puzzled over how to define her — an issue people of diverse backgrounds have long had to navigate.Harris has long incorporated both sides of her parentage in her public persona, but also has been steadfast in claiming her Black identity, saying her mother -- the biggest influence on her life -- raised her and her sister as Black because that’s the way the world would view them.“My mother instilled in my sister, Maya, and me the values that would chart the course of our lives,” Harris said in a Wednesday night speech at the Democratic National Convention to accept her party’s nomination. “She raised us to be proud, strong Black women. And she raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage.”A 2015 Pew Research Center study found that multiracial people in the USwere growing at a rate three times faster than the general population. A majority said they were proud of their mixed-race background, but had been subjected to racial slurs or jokes. And about 25% said they were bothered by people making assumptions about their racial background.Harris herself has lamented how others feel a need to define her, despite how comfortable she is in her own skin.“I didn’t go through some evolution about who am I and what is my identity,” she said in a June interview with the Los Angeles Times’ “Asian Enough” podcast. “And I guess the frustration I have is if people think that I should have gone through such a crisis and need to explain it.”For others from multiracial backgrounds, however, the journey can be fraught. On her Instagram account, Amanda Neal proudly declares that she’s “HELLA BLACK, HELLA PINAY,” referring to the demonym for a woman of Filipino descent. But the 30-year-old voice instructor in Chicago says it’s taken much time and self-reflection to fully embrace both sides of her racial identity.As a young girl, Neal said people often tried to make her choose one identity over the other because her mother is an immigrant from Philippines and her father is an African American who grew up in Chicago and Hawaii. And she said some Filipino relatives told her to avoid sounding or acting “too Black.”“It turned into an anti-Blackness that I didn’t even know I had,” she said.Sheila SatheWarner’s two sons are Black and Asian, just like Harris. SatheWarner is Indian American, and her husband is of African Caribbean descent via St. Croix.While one boy looks more Indian and the other more Black, SatheWarner said she has stressed their Black heritage, much like Harris’ mother. She encourages them to embrace the natural texture of their hair and reminds them to never play with toy guns for fear of them being targeted by police.“We’ve always talked to them about both their heritages. We have been committed to visiting St. Croix,” said SatheWarner, a middle-school principal from Alameda, California. “They are both Black.”The subject is inextricably linked to the “one drop rule,” a legal principle rooted in slavery that anyone with even a drop of Black lineage could not own land or be free. Today, it manifests itself in the way people visually categorize others and the social hierarchy between races, said Sarah Gaither, a Duke University professor studying race who herself is Black and white.No one carries the same experience or should serve as “identity police,” said Gaither, who stressed the importance of allowing multiracial, multicultural people to define for themselves who they are, and accepting that a biracial person’s identity may evolve.Officially, the US census claims that about 3.5% of USresidents identified as two or more races in 2018, up from 2.4% in 2000. But when Pew conducted its own survey, its number increased five-fold when accounting for people who identified as one race but said that at least one of their parents was a different race or multiracial, as well as people who had at least one grandparent of a different race than themselves or their parents.And though respondents were allowed to identify as more than one race in the UScensus beginning in 2000, the race category options still are not all-encompassing.People of Middle Eastern or North African descent have long struggled with what to pick. Advocates had unsuccessfully pushed for a separate category for the 2020 census, but the Census Bureau for now encourages people in those categories to identify as white. And even though Hispanic identity isn’t a race, Latinos often aren’t sure how to answer the race question and select “some other race” on census forms.Aside from the way they outwardly present, how multiracial people are raised and conditioned by their families, their exposure to certain relatives and the makeup of their community surroundings also are important factors in how they identify.Former President Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan and mother was white, identifies as Black, while Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, whose father is white and mother is Black, has indicated a preference for being identified as biracial.Then there’s pro golfer Tiger Woods, who coined the term “Cablinasian” because his mixed-race parents were of white, Black, Asian and native American ancestry. Woods’ unorthodox choice has offended some African Americans, who view it as a rejection of his Black identity.For most of his childhood, Benjamin Beltran identified with his dad’s roots as a Filipino growing up in Saginaw, Michigan, with few other Asian Americans. At times, that made his white mother worry he was forgetting her ancestry, which traces to Scotland and Ireland. Still, most people assume he is Latino.The 26-year-old college administrator living in Washingon, D.C., said he started shifting to identify as multiracial and biracial when he began hanging out with more Asian Americans in college, because he found his life experience was not quite syncing with his former preferred label.“What I think is really cool is her identity is not simple,” Beltran said of Harris. “It’s complex and it’s nuanced and it’s reflective of more and more Americans in this day and age.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-dual-identities-challenge-america-s-race-labels/story-iCJgAGk1DgOgOOEFV5XfIL.html
21-08-2020||World||Judge rebuffs Donald Trump again on tax records; appeals under way||A federal judge turned down President Donald Trump’s newest move Friday to keep New York City prosecutors from getting his tax records, but Trump’s lawyers have already asked higher courts to step in.The developments came a day after US District Judge Victor Marrero ruled — as he had before in a case that has been to the US Supreme Court and back — that Manhattan’s top prosecutor could subpoena the records for a criminal investigation. Trump’s lawyers immediately appealed Thursday’s ruling.They also asked Marrero to delay enforcement of the subpoena while the appeal plays out. Marrero said no to that Friday.“The president has not demonstrated that he will suffer irreparable harm” if the records are turned over for a grand jury probe that would keep them secret, he wrote.However, Trump’s lawyers had already noted in a court filing Thursday that they were making the same request of an appeals court and the Supreme Court. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr.’s office has agreed to hold off enforcing the subpoena for a week.Messages seeking comment were sent Friday to Trump’s lawyers. Vance’s office declined to comment.Marrero has refused multiple times to block the subpoena. The US Supreme Court last month upheld one of his rulings, finding that the presidency in itself doesn’t shield Trump from Vance’s investigation.But the high court returned the case to Marrero’s courtroom to allow Trump’s lawyers to raise other concerns about the subpoena. They did, arguing that it was issued in bad faith, might have been politically motivated and amounted to harassment.Vance’s attorneys countered that they were entitled to extensive records to aid a “complex financial investigation,” citing public reports of “extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization.”Those arguments led to this week’s flurry of rulings and appeals.Trump blasted the long-running quest for his financial records Thursday as a “continuation of the most disgusting witch hunt in the history of our country.”Vance, a Democrat, began seeking the Republican president’s tax returns from his longtime accounting firm over a year ago, after Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen told Congress that the president had misled tax officials, insurers and business associates about the value of his assets.Congress is also pursuing Trump’s financial records, though the Supreme Court last month kept a hold on the banking and other documents that Congress has been seeking and returned the case to a lower court.Trump’s ongoing appeal makes it unlikely that Vance’s office could get Trump’s tax returns at least before November’s presidential election. In any event, because the records are being sought as part of a confidential grand jury investigation, they would not automatically be made public.The president has said he expects the case to end up back before the Supreme Court.Trump is the only modern president who has refused to release his tax returns. Before he was elected, he had promised to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-rebuffs-donald-trump-again-on-tax-records-appeals-under-way/story-YJXce33St0A5CJLXMHnl8M.html
21-08-2020||World||Donald Trump says Democrats’ convention was ‘gloomiest’ in history||President Donald Trump said Friday that where Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden sees “American darkness,” he sees “American greatness.”Anxious for his turn in the spotlight after the four-day Democratic National Convention, Trump is hitting his opponent hard.“Over the last week, the Democrats held the darkest and angriest and gloomiest convention in American history,” Trump said in a speech to the GOP-aligned Council for National Policy in Arlington, Virginia. “They spent four straight days attacking America as racist, a horrible country that must be redeemed. ”Trump in recent speeches has drawn his own stark images of unrest and violence in American cities and has positioned himself as a defender of law and order. Biden, in his nomination acceptance speech Thursday night, portrayed Trump as someone who tries to divide Americans. “United we can and will overcome this season of darkness in America,” Biden said.Trump and the Democrats agreed on one thing. Just as the Democrats had repeatedly contended Thursday night, Trump declared, “The future of our country and indeed our civilization is at stake on Nov. 3.”He chided the Democrats, saying their convention did not address the threat from China or bringing safety to Democratic-run cities. “Joe Biden grimly declared a season of American darkness,” Trump said.Vice President Mike Pence, interviewed Friday, said the Republican National Convention next week will focus on what Trump has accomplished, including on the economy and with his coronavirus response.Pence promised a heavy focus on GOP support for law and order and said the Democrats had failed to acknowledge violence plaguing some U.S. cities.“We’re going to make sure that the American people see the choice here,” Pence said.Both Trump and Pence have blamed outbreaks of violence on a radical left, which they have sought to associate with Biden and his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris.Trump made clear after the death of George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, and the protests that sprang up around the country calling for changes to policing that he sides with law enforcement.Pence said Friday, “We don’t have to make a choice between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African American families. We have done both from the beginning of this administration. We’re going to continue to do both.”“Get ready to hear a lot about that next week,” he said.Pence appeared on morning TV talk shows to counter Democrats and promote the Republican viewpoint hours after Democrats wrapped their four-day convention. Biden and Harris accepted the Democratic Party nominations for president and vice president, respectively.Republicans plan to nominate Trump and Pence at their four-day celebration.Pence promised a “great lineup of leaders” next week along with a “great number of voices from all across the country to talk about what this president has done.” Among known speakers are Trump, Pence and first lady Melania Trump.The Democrats argued at their convention that Trump is unfit to lead the country for another four years. Former President Barack Obama, a frequent target of Trump’s broadsides, warned that democracy itself is at risk under Trump.Pence said, “I didn’t watch much of it and, frankly, I couldn’t watch much of it. There was so much negativity, nothing but ad hominem attacks.”Pence appeared Friday on Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, ABC, CBS and CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-democrats-convention-was-gloomiest-in-history/story-OgB8BabDScDCXi5I5d0OyK.html

21-08-2020||World||Contact with Kamala Harris came to ‘abrupt halt’ after custody battle, says father||Donald Harris, the father of Indian-origin Senator and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris, has said that close contact with his daughters “came to an abrupt halt” after a contentious custody battle, according to a media report. The New York Times report said that the Jamaican-born economics professor expressed regret that the custody battle brought an end to the contact with his daughters. Harris’ mother Shyamala Gopalan, a cancer biologist came from India to the US at the age of 19 to pursue her dream of curing cancer.Also read: The importance of Kamala Harris | Opinion In her speech at the Democratic National Convention, Harris spoke fondly and profusely about her mother but had limited words for her father. She said her mother met her father, who had come from Jamaica to study economics, at the University of California Berkeley, and “the two fell in love in that most American way—while marching together for justice in the civil rights movement of the 1960s”. “My mother instilled in my sister, Maya, and me the values that would chart the course of our lives. She raised us to be proud, strong Black women. And she raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage,” Harris, 55, said in her acceptance speech on Wednesday. “When I was 5, my parents split and my mother raised us mostly on her own. Like so many mothers, she worked around the clock to make it work—packing lunches before we woke up— and paying bills after we went to bed. Helping us with homework at the kitchen table—and shuttling us to church for choir practice,” said the Indian-American Senator from California. “She made it look easy, though I know it never was. She taught us to put family first—the family you’re born into and the family you choose,” Harris said. The New York Times article said that her father Donald,81, is long retired from teaching and has remained mostly silent even as his daughter “has stepped into the national spotlight.” The report cited a 2018 essay by Donald, in which he says his early, close contact with his daughters “came to an abrupt halt” after a contentious custody battle. “This early phase of interaction with my children came to an abrupt halt in 1972 when, after a hard-fought custody battle in the family court of Oakland, California, the context of the relationship was placed within arbitrary limits imposed by a court-ordered divorce settlement based on the false assumption by the State of California that fathers cannot handle parenting…Nevertheless, I persisted, never giving up on my love for my children or reneging on my responsibilities as their father,” he wrote. The report said that his only recent comments about her, published on a Jamaican website run by an acquaintance, “express a combination of pride in his daughter and bitterness over their estrangement”. “He scolded her in a letter, which has since been removed from the site, for joking in an interview that, growing up in a Jamaican family, it was natural that she had smoked marijuana,” the report said. “Speaking for myself and my immediate Jamaican family, we wish to categorically dissociate ourselves from this travesty,” Harris’ father wrote in the letter, according to the report. The report added that the divorce between Harris’ parents was bitter. Harris recalls inviting both her parents to her high school graduation, “even though I knew they wouldn’t speak to each other,” and initially fearing that her mother would not show up, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/contact-with-kamala-harris-came-to-abrupt-halt-after-custody-battle-says-father/story-O4b5YqarQJYtViXGJjZ6SN.html

21-08-2020||World||China tells Pakistan it opposes ‘unilateral’ steps that complicate situation in Kashmir||China has told Pakistan it opposes any “unilateral” action that complicates the situation in Kashmir, after Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi briefed his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi of his country’s concerns regarding the situation in the Indian state. The Kashmir issue, as was widely anticipated, figured in the second strategic dialogue of the Chinese and Pakistani foreign ministers in the southern province of Hainan on Friday. Qureshi arrived in China on Thursday for the talks against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff. “The Pakistani side briefed the Chinese side on the situation in Jammu & Kashmir, including its concerns, position and current urgent issues,” said a joint statement issued at the end of the two-day strategic dialogue. “The Chinese side reiterated that the Kashmir issue is a dispute left over from history between India and Pakistan, which is an objective fact, and that the dispute should be resolved peacefully and properly through the UN Charter, relevant Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements. China opposes any unilateral actions that complicate the situation,” it said. China and Pakistan believe a “peaceful, stable, cooperative and prosperous South Asia was in common interest of all parties”, the statement said. It added: “Parties need to settle disputes and issues in the region through dialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respect.” There was no immediate response to the joint statement from Indian officials. India has traditionally bristled at China’s efforts to raise the Kashmir issue on Pakistan’s behalf, describing it as interference in its internal affairs. China had issued a similar statement immediately after India scrapped Kashmir’s special status in August last year. Since then, it has sought to raise the Kashmir issue at the UN Security Council on Pakistan’s behalf several times, but without much success. The dialogue between Wang and Qureshi took place at a time when the ties of both Beijing and Islamabad with New Delhi are at an all-time low, over the border tensions in eastern Ladakh, and India’s decision last year to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status. The joint statement was issued soon after President Xi Jinping was quoted as saying that China and Pakistan are “good brothers” and “good partners”, and that the economic corridor between the two countries, which passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), is key to forging even closer ties between Beijing and Islamabad. In a recorded message addressed to his Pakistani counterpart Arif Alvi, Xi said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), “a landmark project” under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), is of “great importance to promoting in-depth development of the China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperative partnership and forging a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future”. India has consistently opposed CPEC because it passes through PoK. Beijing has paid little attention to New Delhi’s reservations about trade and transit corridor and pumped in money and resources to building infrastructure such as power plants and highways. CPEC is among the new irritants and concerns for India’s ties with China, but Beijing has refused to address this issue, arguing it is only an economic project. State-run Xinhua news agency released Xi’s statement, which said: “China and Pakistan are good brothers and partners who share special friendship.” He added the frequent meeting of political parties from both sides is conducive to steadily advancing the construction of CPEC and high-quality cooperation under BRI. According to the joint statement, both sides also “agreed on continuing their firm support on issues concerning each other’s core national interests”. Beijing told Islamabad that China “firmly supports Pakistan in safeguarding its territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence, independently choosing a development path based on its national conditions, striving for a better external security environment and playing a more constructive role on international and regional affairs”. In a statement released separately, Wang said China and Pakistan had agreed on cooperation in research and development of a Covid-19 vaccine. Fu Xiaoqiang, an expert on South Asia at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told state media that India has a narrow approach to China-Pakistan friendship. “India has adopted a hostile attitude toward the cooperation between China and Pakistan and believes China and Pakistan will soon unite against India. It’s a rather ‘narrow-minded’ perspective that does not conform to India’s position of a big country in South Asia,” Fu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tells-pakistan-it-opposes-unilateral-steps-that-complicate-situation-in-kashmir/story-dCkWXOqrTD65W7YfjvEt9J.html

21-08-2020||World||Pakistan a ‘good brother,’ says Xi Jinping, claims CPEC corridor will help forge closer ties||China and Pakistan are “good brothers” and “good partners”, President Xi Jinping said on Friday adding that the economic corridor between the countries, which passes through territory claimed by India, holds great importance in forging closer ties between Beijing and Islamabad.In a recorded message addressed to his Pakistani counterpart, Arif Alvi, Xi said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), “a landmark project” under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is of “great importance to promoting in-depth development of the China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperative partnership and forging a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future”.New Delhi has consistently opposed the CPEC as it passes through Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir; Beijing has paid little attention to New Delhi’s serious reservations about the CPEC and has pumped in money and resources in building infrastructure projects under the flagship economic corridor.The CPEC is among the new irritants and concerns for New Delhi in its ties with Beijing, which China has refused to address, arguing it is only an economic project.Xi’s effusive message for Alvi was released at the end of the two-day 2nd China-Pakistan foreign ministers’ strategic dialogue held in the southern Chinese province of Hainan on Friday.Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi co-hosted the meet.In his message to Alvi, Xi was effusive about ties between the two “iron brothers” – a phrase often repeated by both countries to describe the snug bilateral ties.Xi said he appreciates that Alvi sent a congratulatory letter to the opening of the Second Conference of the CPEC Political Parties Joint Consultation Mechanism, which fully demonstrated that Alvi attaches great importance to and supports the China-Pakistan relationship and construction of the CPEC.The consultation was held simultaneously with the foreign ministers’ dialogue.The official news agency Xinhua released Xi’s statement.“China and Pakistan are good brothers and partners who share special friendship,” Xi said.He said the frequent meeting of political parties from both sides is conducive to steadily advancing the construction of the CPEC as well as high-quality Belt and Road cooperation.“Since the COVID-19 epidemic broke out, the global fight has fully demonstrated that mutual support, solidarity and cooperation present a sure way for humanity to defeat this novel coronavirus,” Xi said.“China stands ready to work with Pakistan to build a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future, jointly promote regional solidarity and cooperation, and safeguard the good momentum of peace and development in the region,” the Chinese President added.Fu Xiaoqiang, an expert on South Asian issues at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told state media on Friday that India has a narrow approach to Sino-Pakistan friendship.“India has adopted a hostile attitude toward the cooperation between China and Pakistan and believes that China and Pakistan will soon unite against India; it’s a rather ‘narrow-minded’ perspective that does not conform to India’s position of a big country in South Asia,” Fu told state media. Wang and Qureshi met at a time when the ties of both Beijing and Islamabad with New Delhi are at an all-time low over the Sino-India border tension in eastern Ladakh, and (with Pakistan) on the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir and terrorism.“This time the strategic dialogue is highly relevant and the two sides will take the opportunity to discuss ani-epidemic cooperation, bilateral ties and other regional and international issues of mutual interest,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian announced at the regular ministry briefing on Thursday.The first China-Pakistan foreign ministers’ strategic dialogue was held in March, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-a-good-brother-says-xi-jinping-claims-cpec-corridor-will-help-forge-closer-ties/story-3PwmQMHHVeRiTvPDVofsiO.html

Three people were arrested, police said in their statement.The violence came a day after protesters clashed with federal agents for the first time since July in a demonstration that also targeted the ICE building. Two people were arrested and several officers suffered minor injuries.Violent demonstrations have happened in Oregon’s largest city for more than two months following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.On Thursday police released information that showed during more than 80 nights of protests in Portland authorities declared riots more than 17 times and arrested more than 500 people.The riot declarations allow police to use tear gas, flash bang grenades and other non-lethal weapons to try to break up crowds.Portland police define riots as events “when six or more persons engage in tumultuous and violent conduct and thereby intentionally or recklessly creating a grave risk of causing public alarm, excluding persons who are engaged in passive resistance,” The Oregonian/OregonLive reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/portland-clashes-rage-again-outside-us-immigration-building/story-g7yUV7yyN1L5XkkNHKnw9J.html
21-08-2020||World||Spain seeks to shut brothels to curb coronavirus contagion||Spanish Equality Minister Irene Montero has asked regions to order the closure of brothels in a bid to prevent new coronavirus outbreaks, a week after the government shut most nightlife establishments and imposed various other restrictions.The ministry has sent a letter asking “regions to specifically act on places where prostitution is exercised, like brothels”, she told radio station RNE on Friday.Brothels operate in a legal grey area in Spain, which makes regulating their activities tricky, a ministry spokesman said.Prostitution is tolerated in Spain while sexual exploitation and pimping are illegal. Many brothels operate in the country as hotels or other lodging establishments.Montero said the same rules that apply to nightclubs should be imposed on brothels, while her ministry was working on regulation to protect people from sexual exploitation.She did not specify whether she was considering an outright ban on prostitution, as some people advocate, or to regulate the activity and give legal protection to sex workers.With more than 377,000 total cases and nearly 29,000 deaths, Spain is grappling with one of Europe’s most severe coronavirus epidemics, marked by a recent new increase in infections.Nightlife venues and informal parties have been linked to several clusters of infection since Spain emerged from a strict lockdown at the end of June.At least one cluster had been linked to prostitution, according to the equality ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-seeks-to-shut-brothels-to-curb-coronavirus-contagion/story-u4HLiTDUfMQmvYjHJ6wQ3K.html

There has been no word from Keita since Tuesday, when he dissolved parliament and then resigned after being detained at gunpoint, deepening the crisis facing a country struggling to fend off an insurgency by Islamist militants. The human rights team was given access to Keita and other detainees, the UN peacekeeping mission, known as MINUSMA, said on Twitter. It provided no details on what was said or on the condition of the captives.The streets of the capital Bamako were calm for the third straight day on Friday ahead of a mass rally planned by an opposition coalition that led protests against Keita before the coup and has since embraced the mutineers.Junta leaders have promised to oversee a transition to elections within a “reasonable” amount of time. But the military overthrow has dismayed international and regional powers, who fear it could further destabilise the former French colony and West Africa’s entire Sahel region.A coup in 2012 helped hasten a takeover of northern Mali by al Qaeda-linked militants, and al Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates are active in the north and centre of the country. A delegation from the 15-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is expected to arrive soon in Bamako, after the bloc held an emergency summit on Thursday aimed at reversing the coup. The mission, led by former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, intends “to negotiate the immediate release of the president and also ensure the restoration of constitutional government,” Jonathan’s spokesman said, adding that the timing of the visit is not yet confirmed.ECOWAS has already suspended Mali’s membership, shut off borders and halted financial flows to the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-team-meets-detained-mali-president-as-coup-supporters-plan-to-rally/story-du4NNLmBRS5bF74aHDhOjM.html
21-08-2020||World||Russian doctors say ‘no trace’ of poison in Alexei Navalny, refuse evacuation||Doctors treating Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny said Friday there was no evidence to back claims he was poisoned, as aides accused authorities of risking his life by refusing to allow his evacuation to Germany for treatment.Navalny, a 44-year-old lawyer and anti-corruption campaigner who is among President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest critics, was in a coma in intensive care in the Siberian city of Omsk after he lost consciousness while on a flight and his plane made an emergency landing on Thursday.Aides say they believe he was poisoned and that something was put in his tea at an airport cafe.Doctors treating him in Omsk said Friday that tests had shown no trace of any poison and that Navalny was in no condition to be moved, despite the arrival of an air ambulance sent to take him to Germany.“So far no poison has been identified in the blood and urine, there is no trace of its presence,” Anatoly Kalinichenko, the deputy head doctor of the hospital, told journalists in Omsk.“We do not believe that the patient suffered poisoning,” he said, adding that doctors “practically” had a full diagnosis that had been communicated to Navalny’s family.Kalinichenko said Navalny’s condition was “unstable”, making it too dangerous to move him.Navalny’s spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said the refusal was a ploy to hide the poisoning and put his life at risk.- ‘Play for time’ -“The ban on the transportation of Navalny is needed only to play for time until the poison in his body can no longer be traced,” she said on Twitter.“Every hour of delay creates a critical threat to his life.”Navalny’s team said earlier that the hospital in Omsk was ill-equipped and his doctor, Anastasia Vasilyeva, said she had asked for the Kremlin’s help to transfer him to a European clinic.An air ambulance dispatched by a German charity to bring Navalny to Berlin for treatment had landed in Omsk, after Chancellor Angela Merkel extended an offer of treatment.Foreign leaders including Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron have voiced concern for Navalny, who has faced repeated physical attacks and prosecutions in more than a decade of opposition to Russian authorities.The US embassy in Moscow said in a tweet on Friday that if the poisoning claim proved true it would represent “a grave moment for Russia, and the Russian people deserve to see all those involved held to account”.Navalny lost consciousness shortly after his plane took off on Thursday from Tomsk in Siberia, where he was working to support opposition candidates ahead of regional elections next month.Yarmysh said he had seemed “absolutely fine” before boarding the flight and had only consumed a cup of tea at the airport.She said she was sure he had suffered from an “intentional poisoning” and put the blame on Putin.“Whether or not he gave the order personally, the blame lies with him,” she said.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said claims of poisoning were “only assumptions” unless tests proved otherwise.He wished Navalny a “speedy recovery” after pledging Kremlin help to secure him treatment abroad if needed.Navalny has made many enemies with his anti-corruption investigations, which often reveal the lavish lifestyles of Russia’s elite and attract millions of views online.- Previous poisonings -He has suffered physical attacks in the past, including a 2017 incident where he endured chemical burns to his eye after green dye was splashed on his face.Last year Navalny said he suspected poisoning when he suffered rashes and his face became swollen while serving a short jail term after calling for illegal protests. He has been the target of multiple criminal probes and spent numerous stretches in police cells for organising illegal protests, while his Anti-Corruption Foundation was regularly raided by police and investigators.The latest incident follows several infamous poisonings of Kremlin critics in the past.Britain named two Russian spies as suspects after Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok in the city of Salisbury in March 2018.Former Russian security service agent Alexander Litvinenko was fatally poisoned with radioactive polonium in a cup of tea in London. Russia refused to extradite chief suspect Andrei Lugovoi, who became a nationalist MP after the 2006 attack.Several other opposition figures have suffered severe illnesses in Russia that they blamed on poisoning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-doctors-say-no-trace-of-poison-in-alexei-navalny-refuse-evacuation/story-wNZLk75xLfBx8DrBznAdwL.html

21-08-2020||World||Two tropical storms expected to form at opposite ends of Caribbean||Two newly formed tropical depressions at opposite ends of the Caribbean were expected to become tropical storms Friday, with forecasters projecting potential tracks for both that could take them toward the United States, possibly as hurricanes.Tropical Storm Genevieve in the Pacific, meanwhile, continued to weaken as it remained offshore from Mexico’s southern Baja California peninsula while sweeping the coast with strong winds and rain that carried the threat of dangerous flooding.The two tropical depressions formed Thursday, and tropical storm watches were posted for several islands at the eastern end of the Caribbean while a tropical storm warning was posted at the Honduras-Nicaragua border region at the western side of the sea. A hurricane watch was posted for the southern coast of Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula.The US National Hurricane Center said Tropical Depression 13 was likely to become a tropical storm Friday and then skirt the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Cuba. The early, still uncertain track showed it potentially being near Florida by Monday as a hurricane.Friday morning, the system was centered about 305 miles (490 kilometers) east of the northern Leeward Islands with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph) and it was headed briskly to the west-northwest at 21 mph (33 kph).Tropical Depression 14 was forecast to graze the Atlantic coast of Honduras, then curve northward to Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula possibly at hurricane strength and then potentially head for the Texas or Louisiana coast by Tuesday, again possibly strengthening into a hurricane. It is expected to become a tropical storm on Friday.Friday morning, it was centered about 30 miles (45 kilometers) north-northeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios on the Honduras-Nicaragua border, with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph). It was headed west-northwest at 12 mph (19 kph).Genevieve, which had been a powerful Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph (215 kph) on Tuesday, had weakened to a tropical storm Thursday as it moved northwestward in the Pacific off Mexico’s Los Cabos tourist resorts. The hurricane center said the storm was expected to continue weakening through the night, likely becoming a tropical depression by Friday evening.The hurricane center said Genevieve’s maximum sustained winds had dropped to 50 mph (85 kph) Friday morning, and it was centered about 130 miles (210 kilometers) west-southwest of Cabo San Lazaro. It was moving to the west-northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).The storm knocked out power and phone service to a large part of the Los Cabos area, flooded streets in poor neighbourhoods and toppled palms in the tourist zone. High surf claimed two lives Tuesday as the storm approached the area.Baja California Sur state officials said 15,000 foreign tourists were in the state, most in the Los Cabos region, which earlier had almost been emptied of visitors by pandemic restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-tropical-storms-expected-to-form-at-opposite-ends-of-caribbean/story-ZedtgYphlxj5NSU0siajuK.html

The reports emerging from Pyongyang say that the move is directed towards reducing strain on Kim and help him avoid any blame in case of failures.Ha Tae-keung, an Opposition party lawmaker on parliament’s intelligence committee, told reporters that Kim was helping to run the regime with mandated authority from her brother.Ha said that Kim still holds the absolute power.Kim Yo Jong won fame ahead of her brother’s 2019 summit with US President Donald Trump in Vietnam, when her efforts to ensure everything went well included holding an ashtray for the North Korean leader at a train station on his journey.More authority on economic and military policy has also been delegated to several other senior officials, although at a lower level, South Korean officials said.Kim Yo Jong’s rising powerHer prominence in the campaign against South Korea this year highlighted a substantive policy role that goes beyond being merely Kim’s assistant, analysts say.She issued her first public statements to spray criticism at the neighbouring nation, and the North’s state media portrayed her as playing a decision-making role.In July, she offered personal views on diplomacy with the United States in an unusual statement in state media, saying her brother had given her special permission to watch recordings of that country’s Independence Day celebrations.Kim’s most trusted advisorThe first statement issued in Kim Yo Jong’s name came only in March this year, but in weeks and months after that, she has been at the forefront of Pyongyang’s denunciations of defectors in the South sending leaflets across the border.Officially, she is only an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, but Kim Yo Jong is one of her brother’s most trusted advisors and among the most powerful women in the isolated regime.Born in 1988, according to the Unification ministry, Yo Jong is one of three children born to Kim’s predecessor Kim Jong Il and his third known partner, former dancer Ko Yong Hui.She was educated in Switzerland alongside her brother and rose rapidly up the ranks once he inherited power after their father’s death in 2011.Her existence was barely known to the wider world until his funeral, when she was seen standing right behind Kim Jong Un on state television, looking tearful and ashen-faced.But more recently she has seemed to be constantly at her brother’s side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-yo-jong-north-korea-s-most-powerful-woman-and-now-de-facto-second-in-command/story-YXyGKZnLzZPZPma8dheSKP.html
21-08-2020||World||In letter to UNSC, Iran says US has no right to demand restoration of sanctions||Iran’s foreign minister in a letter to the UN Security Council said the US has no right to demand the restoration of UN sanctions against Iran, the Foreign Ministry’s website said Friday.Mohammad Javad Zarif said the US lost the right to make demands in 2018 when it withdrew from the nuclear deal between Iran and major world powers. He also said America’s unilateral pullout violated a UN resolution that required signatories to avoid any damage to the deal.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday officially informed the UN it is demanding the restoration of all UN sanctions on Iran, but allies and opponents declared the US action illegal and doomed to failure.Pompeo insisted the United States has the legal right to “snap back” UN sanctions even though President Donald Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six major powers that was endorsed by the Security Council.He said UN sanctions will continue the arms embargo on Iran, set to expire on Oct. 18, as well as prohibit ballistic missile testing and nuclear enrichment that could lead to a nuclear weapons program — which Tehran insists it is not pursuing.The US insistence on snapping back international sanctions against Iran sets the stage for a contentious dispute. The US demand could be ignored by other U.N. members — calling into question the Security Council’s ability to enforce its own legally binding decisions.Zarif said the term “snapback” was never mentioned in the deal or in the UN resolution that supported the deal. “The US intentionally has applied the word to suggest speed and (an) automatic” return of sanctions, he said.The Trump administration wants to reimpose all international sanctions that had been eased under the nuclear deal. Other nations claim the US has no standing to make the demand because the Trump administration pulled the US out of the deal.Under the agreement, Tehran received sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme. The “snapback” mechanism was created in the event Tehran was proven to be in violation of the accord.Zarif said the Security Council should stop the US’s unilateral “misuses” of council resolutions, saying “the people of Iran expect the council to force the US to be accountable” for its “damages” to Iran.The US imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran and sent the country’s economy into free fall following its pullout from the deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-letter-to-unsc-iran-says-us-has-no-right-to-demand-restoration-of-sanctions/story-H9PqFRNmzlcQOLjdHOGUoK.html
21-08-2020||World||A simple guide to US elections 2020||The race for the White House has begun and the outcome of the 2020 US general election will have an impact around the world. On November 3, 2020, Americans will head to the polls and render their verdict on the Donald Trump presidency. A record number of Americans are expected to cast mail-in ballots this year because of the pandemic. Democrats have accused Trump of trying to sabotage the US Postal Service to help his re-election bid, while the president has already begun to try to sow public doubt about any outcome that results in a Joe Biden victory.Here’s your quick guide to the US presidential election 2020:•Election Day, as set by the US law, is always the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year it is November 3. The presidential election starts with a primary process for the major political parties, Republicans and Democrats, to pick their nominees (Donald Trump and Joe Biden this year). •Unlike many other countries, the US political system is dominated by just two parties, so the president always belongs to one of them. The Republicans are the conservative political party in the US and their candidate in this year’s election is President Donald Trump. The Democrats are the liberal political party and their candidate is Joe Biden.•The winner is not always the candidate who wins most votes. The candidates compete to win electoral college votes. Each state gets a certain number of electoral college votes based on its population and there are a total of 538 up for grabs, so the winner is the candidate that wins 270 or more.•Anyone who is a US citizen and 18 years of age or over, is eligible to vote in the presidential election. However, lots of states have passed laws requiring voters to show identification documents to prove who they are before they can vote. •It can take several days for every vote to be counted, but it becomes clear who the winner is by the early hours of the following morning.•The new president is officially sworn into office on January 20 in a ceremony known as the inauguration, which is held on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC. After the ceremony, the new president makes their way to the White House to begin their four-year term in office.•Most Americans vote for president and Congress, but November ballots will also include state and local elections, so they will differ from city to city and state to state. Every person voting in a US state can vote for president. But the options will be different depending on the state. Joe Biden and Donald Trump will be on every ballot, but there will be other smaller party options that vary depending on a state’s rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-simple-guide-to-us-elections-2020/story-InaqFLCTNEdNG6NTYeySHL.html
21-08-2020||World||Joe Biden’s elusive quest for ‘Biden from Mumbai’ continues||When Joe Biden was elected as one of the youngest US senators in 1972, one of the first letters that he received was from Mumbai, with the sender having the same last name as his. About five years ago, the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee learned that there are five Bidens living in Mumbai, but is probably yet to make a connection with them. The ‘Biden from Mumbai’, then known as Bombay, had congratulated Biden on his election as the senator from Delaware and told him that they were related to each other. Biden, then 29, wanted to follow up on the letter and get in touch with the ‘Biden from Mumbai’. However, his family and active life in politics meant that this wish remained a wish, something he still wants to fulfil nearly five decades later. The wish may have remained unfulfilled, but the 77-year-old Biden never misses a chance to narrate the ‘Biden from Mumbai’ story when he meets Indian-Americans and the Indian leaders. The former vice president assures them that he too has an India connection, however, distant it might be. In his address to the Bombay Stock Exchange, Mumbai, on July 24, 2013, during his maiden visit to India as the Vice President of the US, he went off-script to narrate his story of the ‘Biden from Mumbai’. “It’s an honour to be back in India and to be here in Mumbai. Off script for a second here, I was reminded - I was elected to the United States Senate when I was a 29-year-old kid back in 1972, and one of the first letters I received and I regret I never followed up on it. Maybe, some genealogist in audience can follow up for me, but I received a letter from a gentleman named Biden - Biden, my name - from Mumbai, asserting that we were related,” Biden had told the audience amidst peals of laughter. “Seriously. Suggesting that our mutual, great, great, great, something or other worked for the East India Trading Company back in the 1700s and came to Mumbai,” Biden said. A few years later at another speech in Washington DC, Biden said that their forefathers were same, who worked for the East India Company and visited India then. “He (Biden from Mumbai) went back to our mutual great, great, great grandfather, 1848, who was a British captain in the East India Tea Company. And he married I believe an Indian woman. And he settled in India,” Biden said in his address to the US India Business Council on September 21, 2015. “And so I was thinking about it, if that’s true, I might run here in India for office. I might be qualified (to run for elected office in India). But I’ve never followed up on it (the letter from Biden from Mumbai),” Biden told the Mumbai audience in 2013, who could not stop laughing at it. “But now that I’m back for the multiple times, I’m going to follow up to find out whether there is a Biden and whether we’re related. I hope he’s in good standing if we are,” he said, evoking bouts of laughter from the audience. In the Washington DC event hosted by US Indian Business Council, Biden said that a day after his Mumbai speech, a journalist gave him a list of five Bidens living in Mumbai. “The next day the press, I guess trying to prove that I was probably making this up - because I never followed up. It was right after I got elected, and then some things happened in my family, and I never followed up. One reporter stood up and gave me the names of five Bidens in Mumbai,” he said. “So, show me more respect,” Biden has told the Washington DC audience while asserting his Indian connection “You know what I mean? I didn’t realise I had so many... And I haven’t actually followed up and embarrassed the Bidens in Mumbai. But the point is, it makes it even clearer what a small, small world this is and how this global economy is suited for, quite frankly, the two largest democracies in the world,” Biden said in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-elusive-quest-for-biden-from-mumbai-continues/story-UBGz9ZKHCEO5UBbZNIpUrO.html
21-08-2020||World||Joe Biden praises tough Kamala Harris in Democratic nomination acceptance speech||As Joe Biden accepted the Democratic Party nomination for the White House on Thursday, he praised his running mate Kamala Harris during his acceptance speech, describing the senator from California as a “powerful voice” in the US as he pointed out to her “American story.” Harris is the first Indian-American and Black woman to get a major party’s vice presidential nomination. The 55-year-old former California attorney general got the nomination on the third day of the virtual Democratic National Convention on Wednesday.“It will be the work of the next president to restore the promise of America to everyone. And I am not going to have to do it alone. I will have a great vice president at my side,” Biden said in his acceptance speech on Thursday.The 77-year-old Biden talked about Harris’ diverse family, her parents are Jamaican and Indian, heritage and her perseverance to “overcome every obstacle she has ever faced.” “Her story is the American story. She knows about all of the obstacles thrown in the way of so many in our country. Women, Black women, Black Americans, South Asian Americans, immigrants. The left out and the left behind. She has overcome every obstacle she has ever faced,” he said on the last day of the four-day Democratic National Convention.“No one has been tougher on big banks and the gun lobby. No one has been tougher on calling out the current administration for its extremism, its failure to follow the law, it’s failure to simply tell the truth. Kamala and I both draw from our families. That is where we get our strength. For Kamala, it is Doug, and their families. For me, it is Jill, and ours,” Biden said.Introducing herself as the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants at the virtual convention on Wednesday, Harris fondly remembered her Chennai-born mother who she said taught her two daughters to “be conscious and compassionate about the struggles of all people” and to believe that “the fight for justice is a shared responsibility.”“One of the most powerful voices we hear in the country today is from our young people. They’re speaking to the inequity and injustice that has grown up in America. Economic injustice. Racial injustice. Environmental injustice,” Biden said.“I hear their voices and if you listen, you can hear them too. And whether it’s the existential threat posed by climate change, the daily fear of being gunned down in school, or the inability to get started in their first job — it will be the work of the next president to restore the promise of America to everyone,” he said.Later, Harris said in a tweet that Biden will be an incredible president. “Tonight, Joe Biden spoke to the moment. Just like he’ll do as president for our country,” she tweeted.“You’re going to make an incredible president. America, we need your help to make that happen. As Joe Biden reminds us, character, compassion, decency—they’re all on the ballot in November. Who we are and who we want to be are on the line,” she also said in a fund-raising email and tweet.Soon after Biden concluded his speech, Harris and her husband Douglas Emhoff joined him and his wife Jill Biden. The couples stepped onto an outside stage and embraced as they watched the fireworks light up the sky.Biden delivered his speech inside a largely empty arena in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, at the conclusion of a Democratic convention held virtually because of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 170,000 Americans.Before Biden stepped off, reporters shouted: “How do you feel?”. he pulled down his face mask and yelled: “Welcome to Wilmington!”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-praises-tough-kamala-harris-in-democratic-nomination-acceptance-speech/story-8zHisPcyIHYvQCuK01ZFkL.html

Some said the mask made them feel safe, while others said social pressures to wear the masks were also a factor. “I think I can take off my mask anytime, but I’ll need to see if others accept it. Because I’m afraid that people would be scared if they see me not wearing mask,” one 24-year old Beijing woman surnamed Cao told Reuters. It’s the second time Beijing’s health authorities have relaxed guidelines on mask wearing in the capital, which has largely returned to normal after two rounds of lockdowns brought it to a standstill.Beijing’s municipal Centers for Disease Control first said residents could go without masks in outdoor areas in late April, though the rules were swiftly reversed in June after a new outbreak in a large wholesale market in the city’s south. China has reported no new locally transmitted cases on the mainland for five days after successfully controlling flare ups in the capital, Xinjiang and elsewhere. Experts say the key to the country’s success in controlling the disease has been the strict enforcement of local rules, including wearing masks, mandatory home quarantine and participating in mass testing.Authorities reported 22 imported cases in the mainland on for Aug. 20, and has closed its borders to most non-Chinese citizens. The country has reported a total of 84,917 cases since the outbreak began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-health-authorities-allow-residents-to-go-mask-free-as-covid-19-cases-drop/story-6UYU3UpEpJEo5ka0Kk5m6N.html

Navalny is fighting for his life after drinking tea that his allies believe was laced with poison. Doctors treating him, at a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk, have not yet confirmed that diagnosis, but said it is one of several versions they are considering.Kira Yarmysh, his spokeswoman, cited a head doctor as saying on Friday that his condition was unstable and that the hospital deemed his relatives’ desire to move him to another facility insufficient to justify such action. A German air ambulance with a team specialised in treating coma patients was due to land in Omsk at around 0600 GMT, she said. “The ban on transporting Navalny in an attempt on his life being carried out right now by doctors and the deceitful authorities that have authorised it,” Yarmysh wrote on social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-hospital-refuses-to-move-kremlin-critic-navalny-after-suspected-poisoning-report/story-wPWv5qEceizCDL7esgPd7N.html

21-08-2020||World||Fight with South Korea outbreak church fuels rebound for Moon Jae-In||South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s approval rating rose for the first time in three months after he took on a church at the center of a new coronavirus wave -- a jump similar to one in March when he confronted a separate sect over an outbreak.Moon’s support surged 8 percentage points to 47% in a weekly tracking poll released Friday from Gallup Korea -- the highest level since mid-July and up from a record low last week. The rebound may be temporary with many respondents faulting Moon for not doing enough to tackle runaway housing prices, an issue that had driven a recent decline in his approval rating.The jump came after the Moon administration implemented measures against the Sarang Jeil Presbyterian Church, which has been connected to the latest surge in infections. South Korea this week saw its biggest daily tally since March and the flareup has raised concerns that the country -- once seen as successfully containing the virus -- could be losing control.Moon’s administration has been lauded globally for containing outbreaks without a lockdown, relying on rapid testing and contact-tracing. His progressive camp scored a landslide victory in paramilitary elections in April, showing to political leaders around the world that effective virus management can translate into votes.Authorities said they would charge the pastor of Sarang Jeil for violating public health laws, accusing him of breaking self-quarantine rules and failing to provide lists of parishioners for testing. Almost 4,000 members of the church have been gathering for recent services, despite government requests to stop. The pastor has tested positive for the virus, Yonhap News Agency reported, citing an unidentified health official.Moon pledged to “take decisive actions, including coercive measures” against the church. He has also said the outbreak linked to Sarang Jeil was the biggest challenge faced by health officials since a similar incident involving the Shincheonji sect five months ago briefly made South Korea the country with the second-most infections in the world.As of Thursday, 739 people linked to the Sarang Jeil church were confirmed positive for the virus, health authorities said. Thousands of members gathered for a weekend rally in central Seoul, sparking a new backlash and raising worries those attending could spread infections to more parts of the country. So far, at least 60 of those who took part have tested positive, according the country’s health ministry.Sarang Jeil pastor Jun Kwang-hoon, a critic of Moon, took out advertisements in major newspapers trying to stem public anger. In them, he said he was being mistreated by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fight-with-south-korea-outbreak-church-fuels-rebound-for-moon-jae-in/story-CAg0WKShuYJflysKpJPvGI.html
21-08-2020||World||In moving speech, boy says Joe Biden helped him overcome stutter||Even in a week filled with emotional endorsements of Joe Biden, Brayden Harrington’s stands out.The 13-year-old boy sat in his home, speaking to a cellphone camera and reading, carefully, from a piece of paper. He looked up and told the world how the former vice president, by speaking about his own experience, had helped him overcome a difficult challenge.“We stutter,” Brayden said in a video that aired Thursday, shortly before Biden accepted his party’s presidential nomination on the final night of the Democratic National Convention. The Concord, New Hampshire, teen got stuck briefly on the “s” sound and bravely worked his way through the word. His face showed strain but also determination to force out the sound.“It’s really amazing to hear that someone became vice president” despite stuttering, Brayden said. “He told me about a book of poems by Yeats that he would read out loud to practice.”Biden has spoken frequently about how overcoming a stutter was one of the hardest things he’s done in life. Brayden and Biden met at a February CNN town hall in Concord, where Biden spoke about overcoming a severe childhood stutter. He’s talked frequently publicly through the years about the anger and frustration of being mocked by classmates and a nun in Catholic school — and how that motivated him to work to overcome it.“It has nothing to do with your intellectual makeup,” he said at the town hall.After the event, Biden invited Brayden backstage to talk more about learning to control a stutter. Biden noted that he’d practiced by speaking as he looked at himself in the mirror. He also gave the boy a speech he’d prepared for delivery, complete with markings he’d made on its pages that showed where he had time to take breaks and pauses so that the words would come out more smoothly.Brayden held up that speech for convention viewers on Thursday.“I’m just trying to be a kid,” Brayden said. “And in a short amount of time, Joe Biden made me feel more confident about something that’s bothered me my whole life. Joe Biden cared. Imagine what he could do for all of us.”“Kids like me are counting on you to elect someone we can all look up to,” he added.Biden has talked about his stutter frequently on the presidential campaign trail and how it sometimes returns on certain words, especially if he’s tired.After he talked about it during a Democratic primary debate in December — and even started to make the sounds of a stutter — then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders ridiculed Biden on Twitter. The tweet was later deleted and Sanders apologized. Biden said afterward that he had no regrets “because I know what it’s like to be humiliated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-moving-speech-boy-says-joe-biden-helped-him-overcome-stutter/story-0T3hCSK5T4yO7dvI9OzPAM.html
21-08-2020||World||Joe Biden accepts Democratic nomination, vows to end ‘season of darkness’||Joe Biden accepted the Democratic party nomination for president Thursday, the last day of the first ever virtual convention held in the shadow of a raging Covid-19 epidemic, with a promise to heal and unite the nation and help it “overcome this season of darkness”.Biden, a former vice-president and six-term senator before that, directly criticized President Donald Trump for his handling of the epidemic that has infected more than 5 million Americans and killed 170,000 and the cratering of the economy.Biden said Trump had “cloaked America in darkness for much too long. Too much anger. Too much fear. Too much division.”Biden offered himself as a contrast: “Here and now, I give you my word: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us not the worst. I will be an ally of the light, not of the darkness. …(and) United we can, and will, overcome this season of darkness in America. We will choose hope over fear, facts over fiction, fairness over privilege.”Calling the upcoming elections in November 3 “life-changing” with the potential to determine America’s future for a long time, the Democratic nominee laid out his case for the White House in stark terms: “Character is on the ballot. Compassion is on the ballot. Decency, science, democracy. They are all on the ballot.”Biden accepted the party’s nomination in a speech from a hall in Wilmington, Delaware. He was joined by wife Jill Biden on the stage after he finished, and by his running mate Kamala Harris and her spouse Doug Emhoff. They stood socially distant before walking out for celebratory fireworks.Biden waited 32 years for this moment, having first run for the party nomination in 1987. He had dropped out then even before the primaries over plagiarism allegations. He tried again in 2008, but pulled out after a poor showing in the first of the nominating contests, the Iowa caucus.The 2020 race did not start well either. He fared poorly in the first two nominating contests, Iowa and New Hampshire. He did somewhat better in Nevada, the third contest and went to South Carolina, the fourth, with the fate of his campaign in balance. He crushed it with the overwhelming support of the state’s Black Democrats and went on to sweep the Super Tuesday contests, winning 11 of the 14 states, toppling Senator Bernie Sanders, the frontrunner. He never looked back.Also Read: In moving speech, boy says Joe Biden helped him overcome stutterBiden turned the Democratic presidential ticket historic with his pick for running mate: Kamala Harris. She is the first Indian American and Black woman to run for vice-president. In fact, she is the first woman of color to run for this high office.She accepted her nomination on Wednesday with a rousing tribute to her Indian-born mother and values inherited from her.Biden leads Trump by 7.6 points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls nationally and by 8.8 points in FiveThirtyEight’s weighted average of national polls. He also leads the incumbent in all the swing states.Trump’s mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak is his key vulnerability in his re-election bid — 58% of Americans disapprove of it in a new high, according to a CNN poll. And 68% felt embarrassed by the US response to it. The United States is the country hit the hardest by the virus.Also Read: Joe Biden says would implement Covid-19 plan on ‘Day 1’ if electedDemocrats have thus chosen to attack Trump singularly on Covid-19. “Just judge this president on the facts,” said Biden in his acceptance speech. “5 million Americans infected with Covid-19.

More than 10 million people are going to lose their health insurance this year. Nearly one in 6 small businesses has closed this year.”President Trump will make his case for a second term at the Republican party convention starting Monday, which might, or not, be a mix of in-person and virtual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-accepts-democratic-nomination-vows-to-end-season-of-darkness/story-MdE2jZ0bdhEjrU2jrGmfTN.html
21-08-2020||World||Pfizer virus vaccine on track for regulatory review in October||Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE said the Covid-19 vaccine they are jointly developing is on track to be submitted for regulatory review as early as October, as they released additional data from an early-stage study.The companies said the vaccine was well tolerated with mild to moderate fever in fewer than 20% of the participants. The companies are continuing to analyze data from the Phase 1 trials in the U.S. and Germany, they said in a statement.The confirmation of their October goal, first announced last month, would make the vaccine one of the fastest-moving in the world. Some analysts expect a vaccine to be approved for use by November in the U.S., a move which may give President Donald Trump a new foothold in the election.Pfizer and BioNTech last month clinched a $2 billion deal to supply an initial 100 million doses of the vaccine to the U.S. Governments around the world are looking to lock up supplies of still-experimental candidates in hope of stabilizing local economies and stopping spread of the virus that’s taken almost 800,000 lives globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-virus-vaccine-on-track-for-regulatory-review-in-october/story-87xnL2SaM4m0tdk3ah162I.html
21-08-2020||World||US demands restoration of UN sanctions against Iran||The Trump administration on Thursday formally notified the United Nations of its demand for all UN sanctions on Iran to be restored, setting off an immediate confrontation with Russia and other Security Council members, including America’s European allies, who called the US move illegal.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered the notification to the president of the UN Security Council, citing significant Iranian violations of the 2015 nuclear deal, a requirement to “snap back” UN sanctions.“The United States will never allow the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism to freely buy and sell planes, tanks, missiles and other kinds of conventional weapons ... (or) to have a nuclear weapon,” Pompeo told a UN press conference.He said the US action will extend the arms embargo, which is set to expire Oct. 18, and also prohibit Iran from ballistic missile testing and enrichment of nuclear material.Russia’s deputy ambassador to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, shot back on Twitter: “Looks like there are 2 planets. A fictional dog-eat-dog one where US pretends it can do whatever it wants without ‘cajoling’ anyone, breach and leave deals but still benefit from them, and another one where the rest of the world lives and where intl law and diplomacy reign.”At the heart of the dispute is President Donald Trump’s 2018 withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal between six global powers and Iran.The US maintains that under the Security Council resolution endorsing the agreement it retains the right as an initial party to invoke the provision to “snap back” sanctions. Russia, China, Britain, France and virtually all other council members say the Trump administration does not have the right since it is no longer a party to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.The US action sets the stage for a showdown that could lead to a crisis of credibility for the Security Council.In a letter presented to Indonesia’s ambassador to the UN, Dian Triansyah Djani, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the council, Pompeo said the US was notifying the body of “significant non-performance” by Iran related to the nuclear deal. As a result, Pompeo said the process leading to the re-imposition of UN sanctions had been initiated.The UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has reported some Iranian violations of the agreement, but Tehran says those are the result of the US violating the accord by withdrawing from it and then re-imposing harsh unilateral sanctions.Pompeo noted that the European participants in the deal had attempted to bring Iran back into compliance. But he said “despite extensive efforts and exhaustive diplomacy on the part of those member states, Iran’s significant non-performance persists.”“As a result, the United States is left with no choice but to notify the council that Iran is in significant non-performance of its JCPOA commitments,” Pompeo wrote.Pompeo’s letter was accompanied by a six-page explanation of why the US believes it retains the right to invoke snapback.The US insistence that it can authorize snapback has already been rejected by virtually all other members of the 15-nation council. Germany, a participant in the Iran deal, is currently serving a two-year term on the council, and is also opposed.“France, Germany and the United Kingdom note that the US ceased to be a participant to the JCPOA following their withdrawal from the deal on May 8, 2018,” the group said in a statement released after Pompeo presented the letter. “We cannot therefore support this action which is incompatible with our current efforts to support the JCPOA.”Pompeo lashed out at the Europeans, accusing them of privately agreeing with the US concerns but lacking the courage to say so publicly. “Instead they chose to side with ayatollahs,” he said. “Their actions endanger the people of Iraq, of Yemen, of Lebanon, of Syria and indeed their own citizens as well.”Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, meanwhile, told UN chief António Guterres in a Thursday phone call that the Security Council must resist the US demand.“This would have dangerous consequences for international law, it will bring nothing but the destruction of international mechanisms and it will discredit the Security Council,” Zarif said.Under the terms of the Security Council resolution that enshrined the nuclear deal, Thursday’s notification starts a 30-day clock after which pre-2015 UN sanctions on Iran that were eased will be re-imposed unless a resolution specifically extending their suspension is passed. The US, however, would use its veto power to block any resolution extending the sanctions relief.Pompeo said a Security Council resolution will be introduced as required under snapback, but he wouldn’t say which country would initiate it.Because of the legal debate over US standing, it is possible that the snapback demand will simply be ignored by the other members, which could call into question the Security Council’s relevance and ability to enforce its own legally binding decisions.Security Council president Djani is holding one-on-one consultations with members on the legality of the US action, council diplomats said, and the vast majority of members are virtually certain to agree that the US not legally entitled to invoke snapback — meaning snapback has not been triggered and the US action will have no effect.In these circumstances, the Security Council president would not be obliged to introduce a resolution to extend sanctions relief, which would face a US veto, the diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity because consultations have been private.Russia asked for an open council meeting Friday to discuss implementation of the resolution endorsing the nuclear deal. But deputy ambassador Polyansky tweeted Thursday evening, “After groundlessly claiming that they triggered #snapback our US colleagues objected to holding a SC meeting to discuss what’s happening around implementation of Resolution 2231.”Trump and Pompeo had made no secret of their intention to pursue snapback, particularly after the administration’s embarrassing defeat last week at the Security Council on extending the arms embargo on Iran that expires in October. The US won just one other “yes” vote, with China and Russia opposed and the 11 other members abstaining.The Europeans are hoping to preserve the nuclear deal in the event Trump loses his bid for a second term in November’s presidential election. Democratic Joe Biden has said he would try to revive the agreement.The Europeans fear that the re-imposition of sanctions may lead Iran to quit the deal entirely and plow ahead with efforts to develop atomic weapons. The Trump administration says it withdrew precisely because the deal eased sanctions, opening major revenue streams for Iran while gradually easing restrictions on its nuclear activities that money could pay for.___Lee reported from Washington.

21-08-2020||World||JetBlue Airways deplanes woman, her 6 children as 2-year-old refuses to wear mask||Two recent incidents involving young children who refused to wear face masks show how airlines are struggling to balance safety with compassionate treatment of all their customers during a pandemic.JetBlue Airways forced a woman and her six children off a plane this week when her 2-year-old daughter wouldn’t keep her mask on.“It was horrible, the whole experience was traumatizing,” the mother, Chaya Bruck, told the New York Daily News from the airport in Orlando, Florida, where the Brooklyn family was stranded.Last week, a Texas woman said Southwest Airlines booted her family off a plane after one of the children, a 3-year-old with autism, refused to wear a mask. Alyssa Sadler said her son became upset because he does not like to have his face touched.All major U.S. airlines have mask rules and have banned at least a couple hundred passengers who have refused to comply. Typically, the violators are adults who argue that there is no government requirement to wear a mask — there isn’t; the Federal Aviation Administration has declined to impose one, leaving it up to the airlines.JetBlue and Southwest both require masks for all passengers except those under the age of 2.A JetBlue spokesman said the company’s policy mirrors guidelines on masks from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“During these unprecedented times, our first priority is to keep crew members and customers safe, and we’ve quickly introduced new safety policies and procedures throughout the pandemic,” the airline spokesman, Derek Dombrowski, said in an email.Dombrowski said customers get an email before their flight that details safety rules including the one on face masks, and employees are ready to help customers who need assistance.Bruck and her family weren’t making a political stand against masks, “she and her other children were wearing them,” said Gary Leff, who writes about travel on his View from the Wing website. “She was doing her best, but some young children aren’t going to keep a mask on and fly much better with a pacifier.”Leff said “it seems reasonable” to exempt 2- and 3-year-olds from the mask rule.Sadler, the Houston-area woman kicked off a Southwest flight home from Midland, Texas, said she had a doctor’s note explaining her son’s autism condition, but it didn’t help.“I think there needs to be something in place for children or even adults with disabilities who can’t wear a mask. They should have some kind of exemption,” she told Houston TV station KPRC.Southwest is among several airlines that recently tightened the mask rules by ending an exemption for people who claim a medical reason for not covering their face. Southwest’s president said last month the change was made because passengers were uncomfortable seeing other people on board without masks.Southwest spokesman Dan Landson said Thursday that the airline regrets any inconvenience to the Sadler family. He said passengers 2 and up who can’t wear masks are given refunds and will be welcome on the airline “if public health guidance regarding face coverings changes.”Airlines have tweaked other pandemic-safety policies such as aircraft cleaning and leaving some seats empty to create more space between passengers.On Thursday, Delta Air Lines announced that it will continue blocking middle seats during the holidays and through at least Jan. 6. The Christmas season normally means packed planes, but it’s hard to know what flights will look like later this year. U.S. air travel during the peak summer season has been about 70% lower than a year ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jetblue-airways-deplanes-woman-her-6-children-as-2-year-old-refuses-to-wear-mask/story-Gyqzh2qlWshZrkJHkLIkXP.html
21-08-2020||World||Kim Jong Un warns on economy, promotes sister, in sign of crisis||Kim Jong Un issued a dire warning for North Korea’s economy amid reports that he delegated some power to his sister, including responsibility for relations with the USKim told a gathering of ruling party leaders that the country “faced unexpected and inevitable challenges in various aspects” and that his development goals had been “seriously delayed,” state media said Thursday. The unusually candid assessment came as sanctions, flooding and the coronavirus pandemic pushed the North Korean economy toward what was expected to be its worst contraction in more than two decades.Hours later, South Korean lawmakers told reporters that the country’s spy agency determined that Kim had delegated responsibility for relations with Seoul and Washington to his younger sister, Kim Yo Jong. While she had taken an increasingly public role in diplomatic matters, such as responding to a letter from U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this year, one lawmaker described a more formal power-sharing arrangement.Intelligence committee member Ha Tae-keung, who was among National Assembly lawmakers briefed by the spy agency Thursday, said the move didn’t indicate that Kim was adopting a “collective leadership” system similar to China’s Communist Party. “The absolute power of Kim Jong Un is being shared under the current leadership style of North Korea,” Ha said, adding that Kim still retained ultimate control.North Korea also announced plans for the first national congress of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea since 2016 next year. The key party meeting in January would provide another platform to promote prominent officials such as his sister, and purge others. Last week, Kim replaced the premier he appointed a little more than a year ago, in another sign of political tension in Pyongyang.Duyeon Kim, a senior adviser for Northeast Asia and Nuclear Policy at the International Crisis Group, expressed skepticism that Kim would relinquish authority as supreme leader. “To say there is a partial transfer of power seems to be an exaggeration, given the system in North Korea,” she said.The statement on the economy was the latest in a series of complaints by Kim Jong Un about the pace of key policy goals. In recent months, he has lashed out at cadres over what he saw as lax virus management and blasted the people responsible constructing his showcase Pyongyang General Hospital, saying they were flouting party policies and being “careless” with spending.The North Korean leader also pledged to unveil a new five-year economic development plan at the upcoming party congress. The last meeting in 2016 of what is ostensibly North Korea’s highest-level decision-making assembly ended a 36-year lull when Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il, ignored party rules requiring such a gathering every five years.“Planned attainment of the goals for improving the national economy have been seriously delayed and the people’s living standard has not been improved remarkably,” Kim told a gathering of the party’s Central Committee, according to the official Korean Central News Agency.While state media made no mention of the U.S.-led sanctions regime on the country, Pyongyang has repeatedly lashed out at the campaign. In December, Kim similarly told the Central Committee that “the conditions of the national economy have not turned better,” adding “the role of the state as the organizer of the economic work has not been enhanced.”Kim is facing difficulties on various fronts, and a reported health scare earlier this year raised questions about succession. His nuclear discussions with Trump have ground to a halt without him winning any sanctions relief, and the U.S. and South Korea this week kicked off joint military drills.At a campaign stop in Pennsylvania, Trump repeated his claim that the U.S. would have been at war with North Korea if not for him. Democrats have accused Trump of fueling tensions with Pyongyang to a point where conflict seemed possible.The economy was already under pressure from his decision to shut borders in January due to the coronavirus, which slammed the brakes on its minuscule legal trade. This year, the troubles could send the economy into its biggest contraction since 1997, according to Fitch Solutions.Torrential rains that hit his state this summer have wiped out farmland, increasing food insecurity in the country where the United Nations World Food Program says about 40% of the population is undernourished. North Korea has boasted that it doesn’t have any confirmed cases of Covid-19, a claim doubted by U.S. and Japanese officials.“Unless there is a major change -- such as pushing for economic reform or improving relations with South Korea, China and/or Russia -- it would be difficult for North Korea to deliver the economic prosperity it vowed,” said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul who has advised the South Korean government over the years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-warns-on-economy-promotes-sister-in-sign-of-crisis/story-4dZ4ms783XPk7AbrsjbpZO.html
21-08-2020||World||TikTok pulls 380,000 videos in US for hate content||TikTok on Thursday said it has removed more than 380,000 videos in the US this year as part of a part of a mission to “eliminate hate” on the platform.TikTok also banned some 1,300 accounts for breaking rules against hateful content or behavior, and deleted 64,000 comments on similar grounds, according to the video-snippet sharing sensation.“These numbers don’t reflect a 100 percent success rate in catching every piece of hateful content or behavior, but they do indicate our commitment to action,” TikTok US head of safety Eric Han said in a blog post.“Our goal is to eliminate hate on TikTok.”Han’s overview of what TikTok is doing to combat hate comes as the app defends itself against what it calls “rumors and misinformation” about its links to the Chinese government.President Donald Trump has issued executive orders giving TikTok parent ByteDance, which is based in China, deadlines to stop running the app in the US and divest TikTok.“TikTok has never provided any US user data to the Chinese government, nor would it do so if asked,” the company said in a recent post.“Any insinuation to the contrary is unfounded and blatantly false.”US user data is stored in this country, with a backup in Singapore, according to TikTok.Han on Thursday outlined rules and actions being taken to make it more difficult to find threatening, violent, or dehumanizing content on TikTok.TikTok has a zero-tolerance stance against accounts linked to white nationalism, male supremacy, anti-Semitism and “other hate-based ideologies,” Han added.As tensions soar between the world’s two biggest economies, Trump has claimed TikTok could be used by China to track the locations of federal employees, build dossiers on users for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.The US leader early this month also ordered a ban on the messaging app WeChat, which is used extensively in China.China meanwhile has slammed Washington for using “digital gunboat diplomacy” in the TikTok case.US technology firms Microsoft and Oracle are reported to be looking into the potential of buying TikTok.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-pulls-380-000-videos-in-us-for-hate-content/story-AhP3YO9I2lRf0Wm9CuPhKO.html
21-08-2020||World||Republican who drew lines called gerrymanders faces charges||A Republican who played a prominent role in drawing North Carolina districts that were declared gerrymanders by courts resigned Thursday from the state House after being accused of federal fraud and tax violations.State Rep. David Lewis, chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee since 2015, conducted a scheme to transfer money from his campaign committee to help his ailing farm, prosecutors said.Lewis, 49, entered a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Charlotte. According to the agreement, he will plead guilty to making false statements to a bank and failing to timely file a 2018 tax return. Government prosecutors won’t recommend active prison time.“The plea agreement signifies my commitment to put an unfortunate chapter behind me,” Lewis said in a news release. “These are my mistakes, and my mistakes alone. I am very sorry for these mistakes, and I apologize.”A formal plea hearing is scheduled for next week, a court record shows.The Harnett County Republican already had announced last month he wouldn’t be seeking a tenth term this November.As rules chairman, Lewis served as a top lieutenant to House Speaker Tim Moore, controlling the flow of legislation within the chamber.He was a chief legislative author of Republican redistricting plans in recent years and the resulting litigation that followed. One lawsuit involving congressional maps that went to the US Supreme Court pivoted on Lewis’ public comments about attempts to keep 10 of the US House seats in Republican hands.A document released by prosecutors and signed by Lewis’ attorney laying out the facts for the agreement said that Lewis made $300,000 in transfers from his campaign account to his bank account for Lewis Farms between January and May of 2018. While the campaign was later repaid in full, the expenditures were not reported to the State Board of Elections.In the summer of 2018, according to prosecutors, Lewis opened a bank account for an entity called “NC GOP, Inc.” and signed a document attesting it was a North Carolina corporation of which Lewis was president. But it wasn’t a legal entity, the document says.He subsequently deposited $65,000 from a Lewis campaign account, seemingly payable to the entity, into the “NC GOP, Inc.” bank account. Almost all of it ultimately went to Lewis Farms, the document says. Lewis later paid $65,000 from a personal bank account to the state Republican Party, in keeping with his campaign reports that described contributions to the state party, the court document said.The State Board of Elections had no information late Thursday about whether it was investigating Lewis’ campaign committee.Recent financial troubles had surfaced for Lewis, especially after Hurricane Florence in 2018, which he said last year had caused “catastrophic damage.”“Farming has been tough for me for the past six years in a row and the financial stress I’ve been under has been tremendous,” Lewis said in Thursday’s release. “However, that is the reality facing many family farms, and it does not excuse my mistakes.”By last fall, Lewis had taken out well over $1 million in loans to address his farm problems, including $500,000 from John Gray, a political consultant and fellow farmer, WRAL-TV reported last year. Gray was one of four people indicted during a federal investigation into attempts to bribe state Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey.A jury convicted Gray in March and he was sentenced on Wednesday to 2 1/2 years in prison. There is no mention of Gray in Thursday’s documents involving Lewis. Former state GOP Chairman Robin Hayes, who was among those indicted in the bribery case, accepted a plea agreement and received probation on Wednesday.Moore, who has known Lewis since college, wished “the Lewis family well moving forward from this.”“While people make mistakes they must be held accountable, particularly as public servants,” Moore said in a news release.Democrats hoping to retake control of the House for the first time since 2010 in November jumped on the news about Lewis.“North Carolinians cannot trust ... Moore and House Republicans to legislate in the people’s best interest when key members of his team put their own personal interests first and foremost,” Democratic state Rep. Graig Meyer said in a release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republican-who-drew-lines-called-gerrymanders-faces-charges/story-gTCkQfpEmUNWq1Rf6K5PxL.html
21-08-2020||World||Donald Trump reaffirms plan to withdraw all US troops from Iraq||President Donald Trump on Thursday reaffirmed his plan to withdraw all US troops from Iraq as quickly as possible as he met with the prime minister of Iraq to discuss ways to rein in pro-Iran militias in the country and counter residual threats from Islamic State sleeper cells.“We look forward to the day when we don’t have to be there,” Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi.“We were there and now we’re getting out. We’ll be leaving shortly and the relationship is very good. We’re making very big oil deals. Our oil companies are making massive deals. ... We’re going to be leaving and hopefully we’re going to be leaving a country that can defend itself.”Asked about a timetable for a full withdrawal, the president turned to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who replied: “As soon as we can complete the mission. The president has made very clear he wants to get our forces down to the lowest level as quickly as we possibly can. That’s the mission he’s given us and we’re working with the Iraqis to achieve that.”There are more than 5,000 American troops in Iraq now. Last month, the top U.S. general for the Middle East said he believed the U.S. will keep a smaller but enduring presence in the country. Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, the commander of U.S. Central Command, said he believes the Iraqis welcome the U.S. and coalition troops, especially in the ongoing fight to keep IS fighters from taking hold of the country again.McKenzie has not said how many U.S. troops might stay. But he said Iraqi conventional forces now operate on their own. U.S. and coalition forces continue to conduct training and counterterrorism operations, including with Iraqi commandos. Any final decisions, he said, would be coordinated with the Iraqi government.Al-Kadhimi, who is backed by the United States, assumed office in May when Baghdad’s relations with Washington were precarious following the U.S. killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike at the Baghdad airport. The prime minister “has my ear,” Trump said.Al-Kadhimi has often had to walk a tightrope due to the U.S.-Iran rivalry. Asked if he was bringing any messages from Tehran following a recent visit there, al-Kadhimi told The Associated Press before he left for Washington, “We do not play the role of postman in Iraq.”The U.S. recognizes the cultural and religious ties that exist between Iran and Iraq, but the administration wants to decrease Iran’s destabilizing influence in Iraq, often exercised by pro-Iranian militias.Al-Kadhimi’s administration inherited many crises. State coffers in the crude oil-dependent country were slashed following a severe drop in prices, adding to the woes of an economy already struggling with the aftershocks of the global coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. wants to make sure the Baghdad central government’s limited resources also find their way to the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq.State violence used to quell the mass protests that erupted in October brought public trust in the government to a new low. Tens of thousands of Iraqis marched, decrying rampant government corruption, poor services and unemployment, leading to the resignation of the previous premier, Adel Abdul-Mahdi.As al-Kadhimi held strategic talks with Trump, which were expected to shape the future of the U.S.-Iraq relationship, human rights monitors on Thursday sounded the alarm over a recent spike in killings targeting civil rights activists in the southern part of the county.In addition, rockets have continued to strike at the seat of al-Kadhimi’s government. Iran-backed Shiite militia groups are widely suspected of being behind both types of attacks.Pompeo, who met Wednesday with Iraq’s foreign minister, Fuad Hussein, said the U.S. was committed to helping Iraq regain and maintain security, despite Trump’s desire to reduce and then eliminate American troops’ presence there. Armed groups are not under the full control of the Iraqi prime minister, Pompeo said. He said those groups should be replaced by local police as soon as possible and that the U.S. could and would help.The Iraqi prime minister told Pompeo that Iraq currently does not need direct military support on the ground, and that the levels of help will depend on the changing nature of the threat. Three years since Iraq declared victory over IS, sleeper cells continue to stage attacks across the country’s north.Pompeo and the Iraqi foreign minister expressed hope that as the security situation improves, there will be greater economic cooperation between the two countries, particularly in the energy sector.On Wednesday, Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette announced energy agreements worth up to $8 billion between the Iraqi minsters of oil and electricity and five U.S. companies — Honeywell, Baker Hughes, GE, Stellar and Chevron. Brouillette said U.S. private investment will help Iraqi’s energy sector and stressed a need for Iraq to reduce its dependence on energy from Iran.___Associated Press writers Matthew Lee and Lolita C.

21-08-2020||World||World Bank chief warns extreme poverty could surge by 100 million||The coronavirus pandemic may have driven as many as 100 million people back into extreme poverty, World Bank President David Malpass warned Thursday.The Washington-based development lender previously estimated that 60 million people would fall into extreme poverty due to Covid-19, but the new estimate puts the deterioration at 70 to 100 million, and he said “that number could go higher” if the pandemic worsens or drags on.The situation makes it “imperative” that creditors reduce the amount of debt held by poor countries at risk, going beyond the commitment to suspend debt payments, Malpass said in an interview with AFP.Even so, more countries will be obliged to restructure their debt.“The debt vulnerabilities are high, and the imperative of getting light at the end of the tunnel so that new investors can come in is substantial,” Malpass said.Advanced economies in the Group of 20 already have committed to suspending debt payments from the poorest nations through the end of the year, and there is growing support for extending that moratorium into next year amid a pandemic that’s killed nearly 800,000 people and sickened more than 25 million worldwide.But Malpass said that will not be enough, since the economic downturn means those countries, which already are struggling to provide a safety net for their citizens, will not be in a better position to deal with the payments.- Recession or depression? -The amount of debt reduction needed will depend on the situation in each country, he said, but the policy “makes a lot of sense.”“So I think the awareness of this will be gradually, more and more apparent” especially “for the countries with the highest vulnerability to the debt situation.”The World Bank has committed to deploying $160 billion in funding to 100 countries through June 2021 in an effort to addresses the immediate emergency, and about $21 billion had been released through the end of June.But even so, extreme poverty, defined as earning less than $1.90 a day, continues to rise.Malpass said the deterioration is due to a combination of the destruction of jobs during the pandemic as well as supply issues that make access to food more difficult.“All of this contributes to pushing people back into extreme poverty the longer the economic crisis persists.”Newly-installed World Bank Chief Economist Carmen Reinhart has called the economic crisis a “pandemic depression,” but Malpass was less concerned with terminology.“We can start calling it a depression. Our focus is on how do we help countries be resilient in working out on the other side.”- More debt transparency -Malpass said he has been “frustrated” by the slow progress among private creditors in providing comparable debt suspension terms for poor countries.While the Institute for International Finance has set up a framework to waive debt service payments, as of mid-July member banks had not received any applications.Having a clear view of the size of each country’s debt and the collateral involved also are key to being able to help the debtor nations, Malpass said.China is a major creditor in many of these countries, and the government has been “participating in the transparency process,” but he said more needs to be done to understand the terms of loans in nations like Angola, where there are liens on the country’s oil output.Governments in advanced economies so far have been “generous” in their support of developing nations, even while they take on heavy spending programs in their own countries, Malpass said.“But the bigger problem is that their economies are weak,” Malpass said of the wealthy nations.“The most important thing the advanced economies do for the developing countries is supply markets... start growing, and start reopening markets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-bank-chief-warns-extreme-poverty-could-surge-by-100-million/story-Sm3GzNO9UkfxULjGd3pIiK.html
21-08-2020||World||Humans overshoot 2020 planetary ‘budget’ on August 22||Humanity will have burned through all the natural resources that the planet can replenish for 2020 by this Saturday, according to researchers who said the grim milestone is slightly later than last year after the pandemic slowed runaway overconsumption.So-called Earth Overshoot Day - the date when humanity has used all the biological resources that Earth can renew annually - has crept steadily earlier since the 1970s, according to the Global Footprint Network.The group calculates the point will be reached on August 22, compared to July 29 in 2019, marking a rare reversal after lockdowns to slow the coronavirus caused a temporary decline in emissions and wood harvesting. This reduced humanity’s footprint by 9.3% compared to last year, they said. But that is “not something to celebrate”, said Mathis Wackernagel, president of Global Footprint Network, in an online presentation on Thursday. “It’s not done by design, it’s done by disaster,” he added. Researchers calculate the date humanity overshoots its planetary budget by looking at “all the human demands” for food, energy, space for houses and roads and what would be needed to absorb global C02 emissions, Wackernagel said. “It’s like with money. We can spend more than what we earned, but not forever.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/humans-overshoot-2020-planetary-budget-on-august-22/story-9imlytpzLfCbQMdHlfQYVO.html
21-08-2020||World||Former Trump advisor Steve Bannon arrested for fraud||Steve Bannon, a former senior advisor to President Donald Trump, and three others were arrested on Thursday for allegedly defrauding hundreds of thousands of donors in connection with an online crowdfunding campaign for one of the president’s pet projects of building a wall along the border with Mexico.“As alleged, the defendants defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors, capitalizing on their interest in funding a border wall to raise millions of dollars, under the false pretence that all of that money would be spent on construction,” said acting US attorney for the South District of New York in a statement announcing the arrests and charges.The project was called “We Build the Wall”. “While repeatedly assuring donors that Brian Kolfage, the founder and public face of We Build the Wall, would not be paid a cent, the defendants secretly schemed to pass hundreds of thousands of dollars to Kolfage, which he used to fund his lavish lifestyle,” the US attorney added.Bannon was chief executive of the Trump campaign and after election joined the White House staff as chief strategist. He did not last long, and left the administration in August 2017.The other two arrested and charged are Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-trump-advisor-steve-bannon-arrested-for-fraud/story-vpLMEIk8f8B9v5AjbSuXQO.html
21-08-2020||World||Libya’s government announces cease-fire, calls for elections||Libya’s UN supported government Friday announced a cease-fire across the oil-rich country and called for demilitarizing the strategic city of Sirte in an initiative supported by the rival parliament in the east.The development could mark a breakthrough following international pressure amid rising fear of a new escalation in the chaotic proxy war as rival sides mobilize for a battle over Sirte. The gateway to the country’s major oil export terminals has been under the control of forces loyal to military commander Khalifa Hifter since January.Libya was plunged into chaos when a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was later killed. The country has since split between rival east- and west-based administrations, each backed by armed groups and foreign governments.Hifter is supported by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Russia. Turkey, a bitter rival of Egypt and the UAE in a broader regional struggle over political Islam, is the main patron of the forces loyal to the Government of National Accord based in the capital Tripoli, which are also backed by the wealthy Gulf state of Qatar.Hifter’s forces launched an offensive in April 2019 to try and capture Tripoli. But his campaign collapsed in June when the Tripoli-allied militias, with heavy Turkish support, gained the upper hand, driving his forces from the outskirts of the city and other western towns.Emboldened by Turkey’s support, Tripoli-allied forces vowed to retake Sirte and the Jurfa area, which includes a vital inland military base, from Hifter’s forces, leading Egypt to threaten to send troops to Libya.The chaos in the oil-rich country has worsened in recent months as foreign backers increasingly intervene, despite pledges to the contrary at a high-profile peace summit in Berlin earlier this year. Thousands of mercenaries including Russian, Syrians and Sudanese are fighting on both sides of the conflict.“Achieving an effective cease-fire requires the demilitarization of Sirte and Jurfa areas, and that police forces from the two sides agree on security arrangements there,” said Fayez Sarraj, head of the Government of National Accord in Tripoli.In a separate statement, Aguila Saleh, speaker of the rival east-based House of Representatives, supported Sarraj’s proposal of demilitarization, an idea floated earlier this month by the United States as a compromise to prevent an escalation in the more than 9-year-old conflict.Sarraj also called for parliamentary and presidential elections to be held in March according to a “a constitutional base agreed on by the Libyans.”Saleh, the parliament speaker, called for Sirte to be a temporary seat of the new government.Both Saraj and Saleh said they want an end to an oil blockade imposed by the camp of military commander Khalifa Hifter since earlier this year. Hifter is an ally to the parliament speaker. They also called for oil revenues, the country’s main source of revenue, to flow into the bank account of the National Oil Corporation outside Libya.Powerful tribes in eastern Libya loyal to Hifter closed oil export terminals and choked off major pipelines at the start of the year in an effort to pressure the Tripoli-based government, which is accused of using oil revenues to fund militias and mercenaries.There was no immediate comment form Hifter’s army, but Hifter agreed on an Egyptian initiative in June that included a cease-fire.The U.N. support mission in Libya welcomed both statements and called for the expulsion of all foreign forces and mercenaries in Libya. Both sides of the conflict are supported by thousands of mercenaries.“The two initiatives have created hope for forging a peaceful political solution to the longstanding Libyan crisis, a solution that will affirm the desire of the Libyan people to live in peace and dignity,” said Stephanie Williams, acting head of the U.N. mission.Previous efforts to secure lasting cease-fires have stalled. But this time could prove different with heavy foreign interference in the conflict-stricken country, and the possibility of direct military confrontation between Egypt and Turkey, both allies to the U.S.“It sounds more like an announcement that tried to tick all the theoretical boxes, with a clear American influence,” said Jalel Harchaoui, a Libya expert at The Netherlands Institute of International Relations. “But is it fully implementable? That will be hard.”The chaos in the oil-rich country has worsened in recent months as foreign backers increasingly intervene, despite pledges to the contrary at a high-profile peace summit in Berlin earlier this year.Hifter’s offensive on Tripoli deeply polarized the already divided country and aborted U.N. efforts to hold a peace conference more than a year ago.Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi on Twitter welcomed both statements as “an important step on the path of achieving the political settlement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/libya-s-government-announces-cease-fire-calls-for-elections/story-q8YgVniSRVNyRI1mFkEFrJ.html
21-08-2020||India||Two held over ₹2 crore ‘donation’ to AAP ahead of 2014 assembly poll||New Delhi: Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing (EOW) on Friday arrested two men for allegedly using “fabricated documents and photographs” to form four “shell companies” that were used to make a donation of Rs 2 crore to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the run-up to the 2014 Delhi assembly elections.The AAP said it is continuing to cooperate with the agencies in their probe and that nothing “amiss” has been found against the party. OP Mishra, joint commissioner of police (EOW), said that the money trail followed by Delhi Police revealed that the funds for the donation were generated from the account of a company named M/S Antara Purukul Senior Living Limited. “It is a subsidiary company of Max Group,” Mishra said. The Max Group, a business conglomerate that works in real estate and senior living, said that was dragged into the investigation needlessly, and that it had no long-term association with the two people arrested, who merely did some work for it and were duly paid. The officer identified the arrested men as Mukesh Kumar and his “employee” Sudhanshu Bansal. “Bansal is a chartered accountant by profession. Kumar is an accommodation entry operator and the mind behind all the four shell companies,” Mishra said. The two have been arrested under Indian Penal Code sections of cheating, forgery, and criminal conspiracy. Police did not specify whether AAP knew about these shell companies, or if the party had any knowledge of any problems with the donation. “The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is committed to honest and transparent politics and has changed the political discourse in India in the last eight years of its existence. AAP will never compromise on its integrity. This is a six-year-old case, which has been investigated by almost all agencies. So far, nothing amiss has been found against AAP by any of the agencies. AAP has cooperated with all agencies and will continue to cooperate with them,” a party spokesperson said.The controversy over the Rs 2 crore donation first erupted in 2015, when the AAP Volunteer Action Manch (AVAM), a breakaway faction of AAP led by Karn Singh, alleged that the donations were hawala transactions that were accepted by the party. The AAP dismissed the allegations and said it was open for a probe. “In February, the Registrar of Companies (ROC) in Delhi started a suo motu enquiry about the donations. They approached us with a complaint on which we had registered an FIR and took up the investigation,” said OP Mishra. The ROC, in its complaint, alleged that the four companies from which donations were made -- in the form of Rs 50 lakh cheques -- were “bogus” and not located at the addresses according to the ROC’s records, the officer said. Max said the people involved in the case were not associated directly with the group, and were once hired for a temporary construction job by one of its subsidiaries. “We have been needlessly dragged into this investigation. Antara (M/s Antara Purukul Senior Living Limited) hired a contractor through local contacts in Purukul (a place in Dehradun) for mud excavation for its senior living community. Given the basic nature of the job, it is normal not to do detailed diligence on contractor’s background, or his intended use of payments received from us. We have provided to the police clear proof of the work executed and fairness of payment. We are clear that we have done nothing wrong. We have no other association with the individuals concerned beyond a one-time work contract in the past,” a statement by Max India said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-held-over-2-crore-donation-to-aap-ahead-of-2014-assembly-poll/story-mEJMy23Z4hYoTdqnptwGCO.html
21-08-2020||India||EC issues guidelines on polls during pandemic||From putting a cap on the number of people involved in door-to-door campaigning to allowing the submission of nomination forms online to providing voters with gloves before they use electronic voting machines (EVMs) — the Election Commission of India (ECI) on Friday released a set of broad guidelines for holding elections in the time of the coronavirus disease pandemic. While standard safety measures such as social distancing and wearing of masks, among others, will be followed, ECI also said those with high temperature will have to vote in the last one hour of the polling process and that there will be fewer voters at a booth.HT reported on Wednesday that the poll watchdog was finalising the guidelines to hold the first set of elections, especially that in Bihar, in the wake of Covid-19. In the guidelines, ECI also decided to “decentralise” the training of officials in charge of the polling process. This effectively means that their training will either happen online or will be conducted face-to-face in a staggered manner. “Hand gloves shall be provided to all the electors for signing on the voter register and pressing button of EVM for voting,” the poll watchdog said, adding that face masks, sanitizers, thermal scanners, gloves, face shields and personal protective equipment kits “shall be used during the electoral process ensuring social distancing norms”.Also, the number of tables in a counting hall has been slashed by half — from 14 to seven. The commission also said a maximum of 1,000 people will be allowed to cast their votes at a polling station, a significant reduction from the earlier figure of 1,500. At polling booths, electors will stand six feet-apart, in line with health ministry guidelines. Soap, water and hand sanitizers will be made available at the entry point. Thermal scanners will also be there. Covid-19 patients, those in quarantine for symptoms and those with temperature higher than normal will be made to wait and vote in the last one hour, in keeping with safety norms prescribed by the health ministry. Extra face masks will be kept for those not carrying one. During the identification process, voters will require to lower the face mask, the document said. “Earmarking circle for 15-20 persons of 2 yards (6 feet) distance for voters standing in the queue depending on the availability of space. There shall be three queues each, for male, female, and PwD (people with disabilities)/ senior citizen voters,” the guidelines said. A group of just five people, including candidates but excluding security personnel, is allowed to take part in door-to-door campaigning. For road shows, a convoy of vehicles should have an interval after every five vehicles instead of 10 vehicles (excluding security vehicles, if any). The interval between two sets of convoys of vehicles should be half-an-hour instead of a gap of 100 metres. The commission’s guidelines added: “In all, such identified grounds (where public rallies are to be conducted), the District Election Officer should, in advance, put markers to ensure social distancing norms by the attendees.” Nomination forms will be available online on the website of the chief electoral officer and district election officer. The number of persons to accompany a candidate for submission of nomination has been restricted to two. The number of vehicles for the purposes of nomination is also restricted to two. While elections have taken place in other countries since the pandemic, including in Sri Lanka recently, elections in India have only been confined to polls to the Rajya Sabha and legislative council seats, which involve a limited set of voters. Experts believe that the election guidelines adopted for Bihar, where elections are due in October-November, will have significant implications for political contests. ECI, which reviewed suggestions received from state officials and political parties before releasing the final guidelines, is also likely to hold polls to the Samastipur parliamentary constituency and 56 assembly constituencies (across eight states) from September. The Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) were critical of the guidelines. The Congress issued a statement saying that the guidelines were not enough for the conduct of “free, fair and independent elections” in the time of Covid-19, and in ensuring the smooth elections in “free, non-partisan & fair fashion”. “Despite having sought comments from political parties such as the Indian National Congress and in response to which detailed recommendations were given, the ECI has overlooked almost all the suggestions given and prepared guidelines that are inadequate in dealing with the challenge of Covid-19,” said party general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal. RJD spokesperson Manoj Jha said the guidelines appeared to have been formulated keeping a country “other than India in mind”. “These guidelines will not ensure maximum voter participation,” said Jha. “As an incentive, perhaps, a health insurance for voters can be offered, in case it is being offered to poll officials. An election with a 25% turnout is hardly an election.” “It seems the ECI is more invested in the idea of an election, than in its democratic potential,” he added. There was no immediate response by the Centre’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). But former chief election commissioner SY Quraishi said the guidelines were “very sensible” and have “drawn from the experience of other elections”. “They are in conformity with the health ministry guidelines...,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-issues-guidelines-on-polls-during-pandemic/story-3LqW3xWfYlgl32pt0ZhFUM.html
21-08-2020||India||Kapil Mishra ‘guest of honour’ at launch of book on Delhi riots||: The Saturday virtual launch of a book on the February Delhi riots has turned controversial with Bharatiya Janata Party leader Kapil Mishra being named in invitations as one of the guests of honour at the event, and the publisher claiming it was not organising or sponsoring the event.  The clashes between Hindus and Muslims in different parts of north-east Delhi left at least 53 dead and around 400 injured. A copy of the invite, doing the rounds of social media, says that two other guests of honour are filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri and OpIndia editor Nupur Sharma. It adds that BJP’s national general secretary Bhupendra Yadav will launch the book. Responding to the comments on social media about his role in the book launch, Mishra said: “Freedom of Expression ke thekedar ek kitab se darr gaye (the custodians of freedom of expression are getting scared of a book). Because they know this book will expose their lies and will bring the truth of Delhi riots.” He also tweeted about the event on Friday. While Mishra has not been charged by the police, he delivered a speech ahead of the riots -- between pro- and anti Citizenship (Amendment) Act protestors that snowballed into a Hindu-Muslim communal riot -- that people would take matters into their own hands if the police did not remove anti-CAA protestors from near the Jafrabad Metro station. Sonali Chitalkar, one of the authors of the book took, to Twitter to urge people to read the book before criticising it . “The book is available for pre-order. I would love to debate side after you have read the book,” she tweeted. She also said that Mishra’s speech was unobjectionable. “I have heard his speech. He has only told the police officials that if they did not clear the stretch occupied by anti-CAA protesters within two days, then they would take matters in their own hands. There is nothing inciting or objectionable in it. The police in its affidavit has found that Kapil Mishra’s speech did not incite the violence. Then what’s wrong in him being in the guest list?” Monica Arora, another author of the book said the “messiahs of freedom of speech” are criticising a book even before it has released. “No one has read the book, then how can anyone decide its tone or tenor? At least, read the book first and then we can have a debate.” .While the book is being published by Bloomsbury India, the publishing house denied organising the launch event. “Bloomsbury India is publishing the book Delhi Riots 2020: The Untold Story by advocate Monica Arora, Sonali Chitalkar, Prerna Malhotra in September 2020. We are not organising any launch event for the book tomorrow and there are no events being planned yet. If you have come across any event information for the above book, please note it is not being organized or sponsored by Bloomsbury India,” read a statement from Bloomsbury India on Friday. Senior advocate Rebecca John, who has represented several of those accused in various cases related to the Delhi riots said: “At least 53 people lost their lives in the riots and they deserve better than this. Those who made inciting speeches or were held responsible for the violence as per the account of several victims, should be investigated for their roles and not allowed to use platforms to further their agenda. Bloomsbury said that their logo was inappropriately used but the fact is that they published the book and this, to me, amounts to further lowering of standards in public life. “||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kapil-mishra-guest-of-honour-at-launch-of-book-on-delhi-riots/story-bpUC05xBwWv7XXX4YmyXLN.html

Senior state officials, however, clarified that it is not a weekend lockdown as there is no restriction on the movement of people and traffic. The decision was declared by the state home minister, Anil Vij, on Twitter on Friday evening. “All offices and shops except essential will remain closed in Haryana on every Saturday and Sunday due to Covid-19.”Keshani Anand Arora, chief secretary, who is also the chairperson of the executive committee of the state disaster management authority issued an order in the evening in this regard.A senior state official privy to the matter said that the decision has been taken as citizens are taking a callous approach in dealing with the pandemic. “No curfew has been imposed. Since gatherings are taking place and huge rush of people is seen in market complexes, we are noticing citizens are taking the pandemic lightly,” the official said.The state tally has reached 52,129, with the death toll at 585.  In a press statement issued from Chandigarh, an official spokesperson said that these orders shall remain in force till any further notice is issued. It will have no effect on public and private transport.Shopping malls and market associations in the city, however, expressed disappointment on the move. Aman Bajaj, member, Metropolitan Mall Association, said that they never anticipated the move by the state government. “Shop owners are disappointed with the step taken by the state government to close shops on weekends. The business is already affected as malls opened in the later stages of the unlock phase. In a week, there are nearly three to four days with no sale at all. We were gradually regaining our customers on Saturdays and Sundays as people are occupied during the weekday due to work from home. The decision will affect us badly.”Harinder Rana, president, Palam Vyapar Kendra Market Association, said that the business will be affected. “But nothing can be done as it is a government order and we cannot go against them. We have been informed that challans will be issued if shops except those dealing in essential goods are opened on weekends,” said Rana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shops-offices-to-remain-shut-on-weekends-in-hry/story-N2Enpb6xmG2FT5oWx4bWoM.html

We will send a reminder to the chief secretary and inform the concerned court about this,” a senior officer familiar with the matter said. The recordings were sought after reports emerged that Suresh was a frequent visitor to the secretariat and many officials helped her widening her contact base.Meanwhile, the opposition Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party have accused the government of deliberately delaying the hand over of the videos. “Suresh was a frequent visitor to the secretariat and CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s office. So, the government is really scared that truth will come out,” said BJP state president K Surendran.The NIA had written to the chief secretary seeking the footage from July 5, 2000, to July 2019. In response, initially the officials said that cameras had been damaged. Later, officials had said that the videos can be retrieved. In a related development, a special court in Kochi on Friday rejected the bail plea of the main accused, Swapna Suresh, in a case filed by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with the money trail in the smuggling case. Opposing her bail plea, the ED counsel said that she wielded enough influence and her release at this juncture would affect the ongoing probe. The court accepted the ED’s contention and rejected her bail application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-yet-to-give-cctv-videos-in-gold-smuggling-case-nia/story-07rd2BOcOErR64iYv23ZOK.html
21-08-2020||India||China stepping up military activity near Lipulekh pass, new satellite imagery suggests||New open source satellite imagery suggests China has stepped up work on military infrastructure, including a surface-to-air missile site, in the area opposite Lipulekh region in Uttarakhand amid the standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The mobilisation of a battalion by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) near Lipulekh Pass, one of the locations outside of the Ladakh sector that have witnessed movement of Chinese troops in recent weeks, was first reported by Hindustan Times on August 2. The satellite imagery, shared by the open source intelligence analyst who uses the name @detresfa on Twitter, show what appears to be two sites at which the PLA is creating new infrastructure and accommodation. Both sites are not very far from the Kalapani-Lipulekh region that is at the heart of a new border row between India and Nepal. According to a tweet from @detresfa, a surface-to-air missile facility is being constructed at one of the two sites on the banks of Mansarovar Lake in Tibet. A graphic included in the tweet said: “While India & China border tensions in Ladakh have been ongoing for over 3 months, new inputs suggest the India-China-Nepal tri-junction border area near Lipulekh Pass is feverish with Chinese military activity.” The two sites are located within a radius of 100 km of the Kalapani-Lipulekh region that has been depicted as Nepalese territory in a new political map issued by the government of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. The India-Nepal border row erupted after New Delhi opened a new road to Lipulekh region to facilitate pilgrims travelling to Kailash-Mansarovar. Nepal responded by lodging a protest and then issuing the new political map that included Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura, which are all controlled by India. India has disputed Nepal’s claims and the border row affected bilateral ties. However, Oli spoke on phone with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 15 and said Nepal looks forward to meaningful bilateral cooperation with India. India and Nepal also held a meeting of a high level mechanism that oversees bilateral projects on August 17, though there is no sign as yet of the two sides holding talks on the border issue. In a separate tweet, @detresfa posted open source satellite imagery that appeared to show Chinese troop deployments in Gar county of Tibet, south of Pangong Lake, one of the key friction points in the current standoff. The tweet said these Chinese deployments were “suspected to either resupply or respond to potential issues arising from the dispute”. A graphic attached to the tweet said the PLA’s deployments “across its western military theatre continue to remain on alert” and on the field. At Gar county, located 180 km south of Pangong Lake, there has been “auxiliary construction & development in progress meant to aid pre-existing military infrastructure, along with a large volume of tents sprawled across the city”. “Assisted by logistical and mechanical support the area is a suspected military basing prepared to respond to potential issues arising from the border dispute,” it added. Among the infrastructure reportedly being created in Gar county is a helipad, other military sites and barracks. HT had earlier reported that PLA had moved a battalion – about 1,000 soldiers – at some distance from the border in the area opposite Lipulekh. India had matched the strength of PLA troops and was also keeping a close watch on Nepal in the context of its border claims. India had on Thursday emphasised the need to speedily resolve “outstanding issues” related to the standoff after it was unable to bridge differences with China on the disengagement and de-escalation process along the LAC during diplomatic talks under the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-stepping-up-military-activity-near-lipulekh-pass-new-satellite-imagery-suggests/story-VQ9A0eNFaJWqdzSk5F6oFO.html

Gandhi in her letter to the bereaved family recalled Sudiksha as a girl who brought glory to the country. “The incident that happened with Sudiksha and her death shook me. She was a sincere and brave girl. I have heard some of her speeches. Sudiksha could feel the difficulties felt by other girls. She was passionate for the cause of girls’ education and for her family. And this is why she brought glory to India at world stage,” Gandhi wrote.“I can feel it is a moment of grief for you and your family. I want to assure you, that we all are with you. Do not feel alone in your fight for justice,” she wrote in the letter addressed to Sudiksha’s parents Jeetendra Bhati and Geeta Devi.Congress secretary Rohit Chaudhary led the delegation which reached Deri Scanar village around 2.30 pm and met the family, party’s district unit office-bearer Deepak Bhati said.“The delegation handed over Rs 5 lakh as a token of support to the family and also the condolence letter by our general secretary and state in-charge Priyanka Gandhi Vadra,” Bhati told PTI.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had on August 11 attacked the Yogi Adityanth government in Uttar Pradesh over the alleged lack of security for women in the state and asserted that there should be zero tolerance to crimes against women in the wake of Sudiksha’s death.Sudiksha, who hailed from Deri Scanar village in Gautam Buddh Nagar’s Dadri, had died on August 10 in a road accident in Bulandshahr district.

Three firms L&T Construction, MEIL and railways’ PSU Ircon International Limited (IRCON) had been shortlisted by NHIDCL on Tuesday. Hindustan Times has reviewed a copy of the notification. “MEIL has emerged as the lowest bidder and is likely to be awarded but no official award letter has been issued yet,” a senior official said requesting anonymity. According to the tender, generally, the lowest bidder shall be the selected bidder. HT has reviewed a copy of the tender. The project which will be implemented in two sections involves the construction of a connecting road from Z-Morh Tunnel to Zojila Tunnel and a 14.150 km long bi-directional tunnel across Zojila Pass on the Sonamarg-Kargil section of NH-01 on Engineering, Procurement, Construction mode in the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. The completion period for the first section is 2.5 years and 6.5 years for the second section. The project has been estimated to cost Rs 4429.83 crore. The long-pending project has gone through many design changes. In its previous tender a ‘parallel escape (egress) tunnel’ was also included earlier but has been done away with to reduce the cost of the project, another official said. The project got further delayed after it was stranded by IL&FS Transportation Network amid its financial crisis which was awarded in 2017.The Zojila Tunnel for connecting Srinagar with Leh will be Asia’s longest 14.2 km long two-lane tunnel road and the strategically important tunnel is aimed to drastically reduce travel time from three and a half hours to just 15 minutes. The 14.2 km long road tunnel under Zoji La pass lies between Sonmarg and Drass town in Kargil district of the Indian Union Territory of Ladakh. The tunnel was a strategic requirement for the armed forces given its proximity to the Line of Control. “MEIL has become an L-1 in the most prestigious Zoji-la pass tunnel in Jammu Kashmir-Ladakh in Himalayan region. National Highways and Industrial Development Corporation (NHIDCL) has opened the bids on Friday, and MEIL topped the list by quoting less than other companies. MEIL topped as L-1 by quoting a lesser amount than the other two companies. On July 30, three companies submitted the bids to NHIDCL, and the finance bids opened on August 21. The project to be constructed in 2 divisions in two sections of about 33 kilometres,” MEIL said in a statement on Friday.“The road from Srinagar to Leh in Ladakh is not suitable for vehicular traffic throughout the year. The Srinagar-Ladakh highway is completely closed for six months, especially during the winter season. Even the military vehicles are unable to move under these conditions. Travelling long distances on alternate routes has become a costly affair and a waste of time. Under these circumstances, the road tunnel was proposed between Sonmarg to Leh and Ladakh via Kargil long back,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-moves-to-expedite-pending-work-on-zojila-tunnel-in-j-k-selects-firm/story-N8Z2QfD8664thXcwL4yZbM.html

The state government has allocated just Rs 11 crore or Rs 1.6 per day for feeding over 1.80 lakh cows in government run shelters in the state and the Rs 22,000 received as donation from people is not helping much either, resulting in the department seeking immediate release of additional funds to feed the cows, said government officials.In the budget for 2020-21 financial year, the state government slashed the allocation of the animal husbandry department to Rs 11 crore from Rs 132 crore in the previous financial year, a cut of 90%, show budget records.A Madhya Pradesh government official, who asked not to be named, said, “This budget of Rs 11 crore means Rs 1.6 per day only to feed a cow. A steep cut from the Rs 20 per day, per cow, given earlier. Not only this, the first of its kind scheme of inviting people for donation for cow-protection has led to collection of only Rs 22,000 so far and has proved to be a flop show.” After the failure of the scheme and the reduction in budget, the animal husbandry department, which has been given target to construct 7,000 new cow shelters, has been left in a lurch, said the officer. “The department’s one month budget requirement for cow protection, which includes running of shelters, procuring cow feed, maintenance of bio-gas plants and vermi compost and other expenses, amount to Rs 11.5 core, but this year the government allocated the total budget of Rs 11.80 crores. With this budget, even if we stopped all other work except providing cow feed, we have just Rs 600 per year to feed a cow in the shelters, which house 1.80 lakh cows,” said another officer who was also not willing to be named. “In the absence of the budget, we are taking help of NGOs and gram panchayats to run more than 1,300 cow shelters in Madhya Pradesh. The department is facing a budget shortage and we have requested an additional budget of Rs 129 crore from the state government and are hopeful that will get it,” said RK Rokde, director, Animal Husbandry department. Experts feel that the cow protection programme, always a priority for the Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government, has now taken a back seat as Congress hijacked the issue during the assembly elections in 2018.

It clearly shows that the BJP leaders and ministers work only to earn name and fame in the name of cows. They are not really concerned about cows.” Animal husbandry minister, Prem Patel, said, “We have requested the finance department to release the additional budget and we are very much concerned about cows and their protection. The previous Congress-led state government set a target of 3000 cow shelters and failed to construct even 1000 shelters but we will construct 7000 shelters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-budgets-rs-1-6-daily-for-1-8-lakh-cows-in-state-shelters-department-sends-sos/story-qyVVHz6Mf4BjhdwwdxbT5O.html

21-08-2020||India||Bombay HC asks for stricter norms to curb inflammatory posts on social media||Observing that “a trend is clearly discernible that in the name of exercise of a right, the liberty of free speech is being abused with bad faith” the Bombay High Court has said that people need to exercise some degree of restraint on their liberty of free speech and expression, particularly during these testing times. The court also said “it is time that the State introduces a regime of conduct with stricter norms but satisfying the test of reasonableness,” to deal with the rapid rise of absolutely avoidable, uncalled for and unwarranted inflammatory posts/messages on social media. The observations were made by the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Madhav Jamdar while passing its judgement in the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Mumbai resident Moin Khan through advocate Vivek Shukla.The PIL had sought a restraint and action against Abu Faizal, the supporter of a political party, who was uploading communally sensitive material on social media sites, which the petitioner argued could lead to communal disharmony. The PIL had sought the removal of the content as well as a permanent ban on Faizal from accessing social media platforms. During arguments, Shukla had submitted that Faizal was a supporter of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) party and was spreading hatred through posting of malicious material on social media to create hatred among two communities.In May, the court had asked Facebook and Youtube-- on which Faizal had uploaded the communally sensitive material-- to delete the same and directed Mumbai police to investigate the matter. The bench had also observed that under the Information Technology Act, the petitioner could approach the nodal officer and lodge a complaint against the objectionable content and hence would not interfere further in the matter. On its part, Facebok and Youtube through senior advocate Darius Khambatta and advocate Naresh Thakker had informed the court that they could block Abu Faizal if the court or the Central government ordered them to do so under the IT Act. Thereafter, the court had reserved judgement which was pronounced on Friday, August 21. Also Read: ‘We are open, transparent and non-partisan,’ says Facebook. Complete statement hereWhile directing the petitioner to pursue his complaint with the nodal officer, the 22 page judgement further said, “The right cannot be exercised to sow seeds of hatred and to create disharmony among religious communities. Since inflammatory posts/messages have the potential of disturbing public peace and tranquility, strong action ought to be taken against those responsible to uphold the high values aimed at by the Constitution.

State govt was given a fair chance and the Right of First Refusal (RoFR) if their bid was within 10% below the range of the highest bid. However, they bid 19.64% below,” Puri tweeted on Friday.“Then they approached Hon’ble Kerala High Court which dismissed the petition in Dec 2019. Petitioners then filed a SLP in Hon’ble SC. Apex Court remitted the matter back to Hon’ble Kerala High Court. There is no stay in the case either by Hon’ble SC or Hon’ble Kerala High Court,” he added.The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved proposal for leasing out three airports - Jaipur, Guwahati and Thiruvananthapuram - of the Airports Authority of India through the Public Private Partnership model.On Thursday, the Kerala government, controlled by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI (M), said it would explore legal options against the Union Cabinet’s decision. After an all-party meeting, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the state assembly will also pass a resolution opposing the move. The chief minister had also written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi deploring the move on Wednesday, announced soon after a Union cabinet meeting in New Delhi.Kerala is the pioneer as far as airports under Public Private Partnership are concerned, Puri said.“First PPP airport in India came up in Kochi in Kerala. It is a successfully run airport with a capacity of 13 Million Passengers Per Annum and was handling 9.62 MPPA in 2019-20 before Covid-19. Another very successful example of PPP mode is Kannur, also situated in Kerala. In fact, it was during the UDF regime in Kerala that the foundation for Kochi airport was laid in 1994 & the airport was inaugurated in 1999 during the LDF regime. Now, the Kerala Government, running two very successful airports in PPP mode, is opposing the handing over of Thiruvananthapuram airport under PPP mode. It has come to my knowledge that an all-party meeting in Kerala has opposed the PPP model at Thiruvananthapuram airport,” he said.Puri said that the Union Cabinet gave its nod for awarding the airport to the private party subject to the outcome of the writ petition and in accordance with provisions of undertaking given by the Concessionaire.“If the petitioners succeed and the outcome of litigation leads to annulment/cancellation of the bidding process then the Concessionaire will hand over the possession of airport to AAI. They will be entitled to refund of the amount paid to AAI and additional investments made in the assets,” Puri said.“The Concessionaire will also not demand any damages from AAI. Here it should be borne in mind that these airports will come back to AAI after the lease period of 50 years. Further, sovereign functions like Customs, Security, Immigration, Plant & Animal Quarantine, Health Services, Communication & Navigation Surveillance / Air Traffic Management services will continue to be provided by Government agencies,” he added.The Centre’s move also got support from Congress MP Shashi Tharoor who represents the Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha constituency.“My position on the airport has been consistent since before the elections. I am not a politician who says one thing to the voters and something else afterward for political convenience. Had my colleagues consulted me before taking a negative stand, I would have explained my views to them,” he had tweeted on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puri-questions-kerala-govt-s-stance-on-airport-privatisation-asks-why-they-bid-for-it-earlier/story-dWGOXFJSpAQbSS9oAs0w5H.html

21-08-2020||India||Video of TMC leaders eating tricolour cake goes viral, invites criticism||A row has broken out in West Bengal’s Malda district over a video showing some local leaders of the ruling Trinamool Congress cutting and eating a cake that resembles the tricolour to celebrate India’s 74th Independence Day. The widely circulated video has been criticised by the Congress and the BJP said it amounted to insulting the national flag.The two-and-a-half minute video was shot at a public programme in the district’s Ratua area on Independence Day. It found its way to social media on Friday, and triggered a sharp reaction.In the video, senior TMC leader Shehnaz Qadri, a cousin of Rajya Sabha MP and the party’s Malda unit president Mausam Noor, senior leader of Ratua, Sheikh Yasin, and head of the party’s Jai Hind Bahini unit in Malda, Krishna Das, could be seen enjoying the cake with local leaders. Malda Congress chief Mostak Alam said the video reflected that the Trinamool Congress leaders didn’t respect the national flag. “The Indian flag is our pride. Our soldiers are dying at the border to keep the flag flying high while in Malda some senior leaders of the ruling party have forgotten their sacrifice,” he said.The Bharatiya Janata Party’s Lok Sabha MP from Malda (North), Khagen Murmu, also condemned the incident. “No Indian is supposed to disrespect the national flag in this manner,” he said, stressing that people did not expect any better from Trinamool.TMC’s district vice-president Dulal Sarkar distanced the party from the controversy. “I haven’t seen the video but our party does not support this kind of an act. Nowadays many doctored videos are also doing the rounds. I don’t know whether this video is a genuine one,” he said. .Also Read: Bengal governor alleges ‘multi-crore scam’ TMC’s Shehnaz Qadri, who is facing a barrage over the video, called it a conspiracy to malign him.“I had gone to Ratua to attend an Independence Day programme involving children. I was about to board my car and leave the venue when some people told me that they had brought a cake and urged me to cut it. I merely kept their request… We are all proud Indians and owe our allegiance to the nation,” Qadri told HT on Friday evening. Yasin, another Trinamool leader spotted in the video, said the cake was brought by Krishna Das and other members of the Jai Hind Bahini, an outfit launched by Mamata Banerjee last year to boost the party’s outreach.“Everybody was in a celebratory mood as the names of the Bahini’s unit leaders were also announced on that day. Nobody paid attention to the colour of the cake,” Yasin said. Das and Mausam Noor could not be contacted despite several attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/video-of-tmc-leaders-eating-tri-colour-cake-goes-viral-invites-criticism/story-mMzD8avxWma2PCmhNZSJQJ.html
21-08-2020||India||‘We are open, transparent and non-partisan,’ says Facebook. Complete statement here||Social networking site Facebook on Friday said that it is “open, transparent and non-partisan”. The social media giant is currently in the midst of political row in India after a Wall Street Journal report claimed that Facebook ignored its hate speech rules when it came to posts by politicians of BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party).The WSJ report cited interviews with unnamed Facebook insiders and claimed the company’s senior India policy executive Ankhi Das intervened in internal content review processes to stop a ban on BJP’s Telangana lawmaker Raja Singh, whose posts targeted the Muslim community. It said Das told staff members that punishing violations by BJP politicians would damage the company’s business prospects in India.Below is the complete statement released by Ajit Mohan, Vice President and Managing Director, Facebook India.Facebook is and always has been an open, transparent and non-partisan platform where people can express themselves freely.Over the last few days, we have been accused of bias in the way we enforce our policies. We take allegations of bias incredibly seriously, and want to make it clear that we denounce hate and bigotry in any form. We take this opportunity to offer clarity on policy development and enforcement at Facebook.Our Community Standards define what stays on our platform and are enforced globallyFirst and foremost, we want to make it clear that we denounce hate in any form. Our Community Standards, which outline what is and isn’t allowed on Facebook, have clear and very detailed policies against hate speech, which prohibit attacks on people on the basis of protected characteristics, including religion, ethnicity, caste and national origin.We do not develop these policies alone. We follow an open and transparent process around policy development and rely on the expertise of both internal teams and external voices -- our community, experts and organizations outside of Facebook such as academics, safety and human rights NGOs, and activists -- to make sure we understand different perspectives on safety and expression, as well as the impact of our policies on different communities.These policies are ever evolving to take into account the local sensitivities especially in a multicultural society such as India. An example is the inclusion of caste as a protected characteristic in our global hate speech policy in 2018.We uphold the principles of democracy. This also reflects in our organizational set up - like a truly diverse organization, our employees represent a varied political spectrum who have either served in many administrations or have political experience and take immense pride in being active contributors to public service. Despite hailing from diverse political affiliations and backgrounds, they perform their respective duties and interpret our policies in a fair and non-partisan way. The decisions around content escalations are not made unilaterally by just one person ; rather, they are inclusive of views from different teams and disciplines within the company. The process comes with robust checks and balances built in to ensure that the policies are implemented as they are intended to be and take into consideration applicable local laws.Removing hateful content from public figuresMany questions have been raised specifically about enforcement of our policies around hate speech. There is no place for hate speech on our platform. We have an impartial approach to dealing with content and are strongly governed by our Community Standards. We enforce these policies globally without regard to anyone’s political position, party affiliation or religious and cultural belief.We have removed and will continue to remove content posted by public figures in India when it violates our Community Standards.Decisions about designating people or groups as “dangerous individuals or organizations” are different - these are based on a combination of signals and are made by our dangerous organizations team who have deep expertise in terrorism and organized hate and pay attention to global and regional trends.Individuals who are designated as “dangerous” under our policies are removed from our services altogether, and all praise, support and representation of them is taken down, as well. Because the penalty associated with designation is so severe, it’s important that our analysis is comprehensive and detailed, and that our process applies consistently and fairly around the world.In addition to the external input that informs our designation process, we also solicit input from cross-functional teams internal to the company when we’re making decisions about individual designations. These decisions cannot and are not made unilaterally by just one person; rather, they are inclusive of different views from around the company, a process that is critical to making sure we consider, understand and account for both local and global contexts. And the process is dynamic and ongoing based on newly available information or activity.We’ve made progress on tackling hate speech on our platform, but we need to do moreWe have made significant progress in removing hate speech and other harmful content over the past few years. Last week, we shared our latest enforcement numbers, reporting that we removed 22.5 million pieces of hate speech content in the second quarter of 2020 (up from just 1.6 million pieces of hate speech removed in the last quarter of 2017).Still, we know this work is never over, which is why we will continue to invest in our efforts to combat hate speech on our services. We welcome the opportunity to engage with all parties - political or otherwise - who want to understand our content policies and enforcement more.Facebook’s commitment to India and its people is unwavering. With some of our largest thriving communities in this country, we recognize our responsibility to keep our platforms to be places where people feel empowered to communicate safely. Our aim is to be an ally for India where our platforms preserve the pluralistic character of a democracy by offering the freedom for people to express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things while also protecting society from broader harm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-are-open-transparent-and-non-partisan-says-facebook-read-complete-statement/story-G8laLgsyx3M2LFrTkqlNmK.html

21-08-2020||India||Manav all set to debut as a novelist||Actor-writer-director Manav Kaul started the year 2020 with a break from shooting to launch his new play ‘Giving up on Godot.’ The play was scheduled to be staged in mid-March when the lockdown happened and he got stuck in enforced extended break. Making best use of the lockdown Manav released his short story collection and also completed his debut novel that he was longing to write. “The plan was prefect — to launch my play, to shoot multiple projects and release my book but here I am sitting home stuck in ongoing crisis. I was home before the lockdown but that was by choice whatever followed was due to the pandemic. All our prefect plans went haywire! Now I am looking forward to start shooting from next month,” said the ‘Tumhari Sullu’ and ‘Wazir’ actor. Manav is pleased that he has finally completed his novel ‘Antima’. “I had a wish to write a novel someday, so I utilised these four months and wrote my first novel. I have completed and sent it to the publishers and hope that soon it will be out on shelves. ‘Keh saktey hain kismet se yeh…waqt mila shayad isi ke liye,’ I am happy,” he said over the phone. He also released his fifth book ‘Chalta Phirta Pret’, a collection of short stories, during lockdown. “The book was ready but then the lockdown happened. Initially, we thought of waiting but then thought that it may sell less but as a writer it’s my responsibility to give readers some fresh content as there are many who went back to reading during this period. Despite problem in distribution it did reach places.” The shoot for Shubhash Kapoor’s film ‘Madam Chief Minister’ that he shot with Richa Chadha in Lucknow is also complete. “Its post-production is on and it will release soon either on OTT or in theatre, let’s see. I have also shot for Saina’s (Nehwal) biopic where I play her coach (P Gopichand) on screen. The film is in it’s post production as it has a lot of computer graphics in it.” Manav also has two OTT series lined up for release ‘The Others’ and ‘Government’. “We can say production has stopped but supply is still on,” he said. When asked does he want to go back to directing films, Manav said, “I am missing acting. My new found love, which I discovered in 2013, is all I want to do now. That is why I am reading new scripts, watching new shows and working more on my performances so that I can add something new to my craft. I have said yes to two new projects and hope by next month we will start shooting.” He feels fortunate to have sustained on financial front. “I had worked lot in last few years so I was able to survive with my team. But the fact is that be it actors or technicians, everyone is financially stressed at the moment. I know so many of them from the industry who have left for their native place. Had it been ten years back I too would have left.” The actor is all praise for Mumbai and industry folks. “All these debates on nepotism and groupism are for different pursuits. The truth is industry people are always there helping each other in tough times. I know people who are themselves struggling but still running community kitchen. We all are doing best in our capacity. I made an appeal on my FB for someone and within a day he got Rs 50,000. People are really doing amazing work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/manav-all-set-to-debut-as-a-novelist/story-DRsvbJHFom9SD3CCHKd3wJ.html

The data is relevant in the context of the fierce debate around the Citizenship Amendment Act that provisions for the grant of Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. The opponents of the act have argued that the law is discriminatory as it makes religion the basis of citizenship. The act has been challenged in the Supreme Court of India. The Central government has defended the legislation citing instances of persecution of minorities of Indian origin in these countries.“Among 2,664 foreigners, who applied for Indian citizenship, over 77 percent were Pakistanis followed by (citizens of) Afghanistan.

This is bolstered by 33 states and Union Territories reporting recovery rate more than 50 per cent, it said.The ministry further added that India’s Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is maintained below the global average. It is on a continuous positive slide and currently stands at 1.89 per cent.So what about India hitting the peak of the Covid-19 infection? Has it already happened? Or are we close to it? The State Bank of India (SBI) analysed these aspects in its Ecowrap where it presented the latest Covid-19 situation in the country.The SBI report, released on August 17, said that India has reported 10 lakh cases (or 58,000 daily cases on an average) from July 30 to August 15. “Still it’s a major question as to when will India reach its peak? Based on the select countries peak data and recovery rate we believe that India can technically reach its peak when its recovery rate will cross 75% mark, the average benchmark across countries,” the SBI Ecowrap said.Also Read: What you need to know today on Covid-19The report further said that there is no link between recovery rate and peak rate “as Brazil reached its peak rate at a recovery rate of 69 per cent”.It also described the situation in different states. “In India the situation of every state is quite unique. In some states it is expected that the peak has already been passed (like Delhi, Tamil Nadu, etc.) while in other states (like Maharashtra, WB, etc.) it is yet to arrive.”The SBI report further said that at least 22 of the 27 states are yet to witness a peak. “The states that seems to have crossed the peak are: Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, J&K and Tripura.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-india-records-highest-recoveries-research-talks-about-when-it-will-hit-covid-19-peak/story-XRNO1HXeGAPCKBB3214UQM.html
21-08-2020||India||I enjoy doing roles that challenge me as a performer: Kanchan Awasthi||Lucknow girl Kanchan Awasthi is back in action. The actor was recently in state capital for a work trip. During her stay she shot for an untitled web-series in UP. She had earlier shot for a film in Lucknow with co-stars Pawan Malhotra, Priya Prakash Warrier and Brijendra Kala.“For now we shot for the web series in Prayagraj where as the schedule next month will be set in Lucknow. The story of the web show revolves around a middle-class family based in a small town. We will also shoot a portion in Mumbai, afterwards. Sanjay (Mishra) sir will join the shoot later on,” said the actor who has been part of films like ‘Meeruthia Gangster’, ‘Gunwali Dhulhania’ along with a TV show ‘Amma’. Earlier too Kanchan had shared screen with veteran actor Sanjay Mishra for the web series ‘Runaway Lugai’ directed by Avinash Das, the maker of OTT series ‘She.’ “We shot for the series in Patna before the lockdown. I play a bold, glamorous yet an emotional character. The role has shaped up really well,” she shared. The young actor states that she is comfortable being part of bold subjects. “As an actor it’s my job to do justice to characters I’m offered and give my best as a performer. I enjoy doing roles that challenge me both mentally as well as emotionally. I have a theatre background and so it’s important for me to give my best shot to all my roles.” In the film ‘Love Hackers’ that was extensively shot in Lucknow, Kanchan plays the second lead, “The best part of the film is that it gave me a chance to shoot in my hometown. Then working with the best lot of actors was an add-on for me. The film’s shoot and post-production is all complete. Seeing the current scenario I feel it may get an OTT release,” she said. Kanchan is glad that this time she was home for a long stretch of 25 days. Talking more about her stay, she said, “It was great to be home on a work trip. I got time to spend with my family and celebrate Rakshabandhan after a long time. Besides, I picked up my old hobby of painting during my home stay. I created four works of art and got a good appreciation on social media. It was after many years I tried my hand at painting.” During the lockdown she was stuck in Mumbai. “I went back to singing after ages. I have completed first part of ‘Visharad’ from Bhathkande Music Institute Deemed University but due to work and shooting schedules I lost touch with music. So, I utilised the time in ‘riyaaz’ (practice). Music gave me a lot of strength to survive the ongoing phase. I’m happy that the phase is more or less over now and despite so much uncertainty around we are getting back to work — slowly and steadily,” Kanchan concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-enjoy-doing-roles-that-challenge-me-as-a-performer-kanchan-awasthi/story-CgMsLGGS6SD1mJeZo64g1K.html
21-08-2020||India||Modelling days discipline helps me till today: Parinitaa Seth||Actor/model Parinitaa Seth is glad to have started her career as a model. “What you learn as a model – the discipline in daily life – is something that sticks with you throughout life. Today, whatever I am, is all because of my modelling days. Be it our fixed fitness regime, healthy diet and disciplined lifestyle, all of this is an inseparable part of my lifestyle since I started modelling and simultaneously took up TV shows way back in 2001.” Talking about her early days, she said, “I’ve been in Mumbai for 30 years now. I came to study fashion in the city and then got married. I joined my family production house that was being run by my maternal family. I used to design clothes for their shows. It was then one of my friends suggested that me to try my hand at ad films. And till date, I have done over 300-odd commercials along with TV, travel shows and now web series.“Once in front of the camera, I decided to train myself as an actor and did acting workshops with coaches like Divya Palat and Saurabh Sachdeva to polish my craft. But consciously I stayed away from mainstream projects as they demanded too much time and my priority was home, family and of course my commercial assignments.” Pariniita has appeared in shows like‘Dil Kya Chahta Hai,’ ‘Kasauti Zindagii Kay,’ ‘CID’, ‘Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah’, ‘Mayavi Malang’, along with web shows like ‘Mind The Malhotras’, ‘Pooja & Pawan’. She will be seen as a negative character for the first time in the upcoming web-series ‘Aashram’. “I am a model and I was apprehensive whether I would be able to do the role just as it was expected. So, I asked Prakash (Jha) sir if he was sure that he wanted me to play this character and he was so sure. I called Saurabh (Sachdeva) to guide me about how to add the right nuances to this grey role I was going to play. This is the first time I have used very raw language (on camera),” she said.The show was extensively shot in Ayodhya, UP. “Yes, we shot from October 2020 to January this year and I loved the winter there. The city looks beautiful in winter and has its own charm. The food, especially phirni and jalebi is something I still have a craving for. The series has shaped up very well and is based on gurus and the ashrams they run. It’s definitely not based on any real guru. The story is quite interesting and I am sure the audience will love this thriller.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/modelling-days-discipline-helps-me-till-today-parinitaa-seth/story-lqM2OwLGjQhIwp61OZipPJ.html

In a letter addressed to the city top cop Kamal Pant, Shivakumar said that there was serious variation while calls were coming in or going out.He has furnished two cell phone numbers in which he says his calls are being tapped given the various background sounds he is hearing. Shivakumar has asked the police to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter and take action against those responsible.A senior BJP leader who did not want to be named ‘as the police will respond to Shivakumar’s complaint and it is not a party related matter’ turned down the claim of the state Congress leader. “If the calls aren’t going or coming properly, maybe it is better for him to complain to his telecom company about network quality issues,” he said sarcastically.Reacting to Shivakumar’s claims of phone tapping revenue minister R Ashoka hit out at the KPCC chief. “Those who have expertise in phone tapping are now claiming that there phones are being tapped. It is like the devil quoting the scriptures. It is not our government’s culture to indulge in such antics. Our government is stable and safe. It is their (Congress) party which has internal problems,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mobile-phones-are-being-tapped-alleges-karnataka-congress-chief-dk-shivakumar/story-xClFzhmXa5r9W0QQgavSUM.html
21-08-2020||India||Supreme Court allows prayers in 3 Jain temples in Mumbai for 2 days||New Delhi: The Supreme Court (SC) on Friday allowed the entry of limited number of devotees to three Jain temples at Dadar, Byculla and Chembur in Mumbai over the weekend (August 22 and 23) to offer prayers on the pious occasion of the Jain festival of Paryushana. A three-member bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI), SA Bobde said that the entry would be subject to the undertaking given by the petitioner trust, which said that it would allow only five devotees at a time inside the shrines and a maximum of 250 would be permitted on a day during the festival because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. “We are of the view that if the undertaking given by the petitioner is faithfully complied with, it would not be hazardous to permit prayers at the three temples in Dadar, Byculla and Chembur,” said the bench, which also comprised Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. The court was also critical of Maharashtra government in allowing other economic activities to continue but imposing restrictions on activities connected with religion. “We find it strange that you are allowing every activity involving economic interests and money. But if it involves religion, you say you cannot do it because of Covid-19,” CJI Bobde remarked. The court made it clear that its order allowing entry into the three temples would be limited to this particular case and would not apply to any other temples or festivals involving large congregation, including the annual 10-day Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations, which start on Saturday (August 22). “Our order will not act as a precedent and will not apply to any other plea for worshipping in congregation by any other community or religion, particularly the congregation that happens during Ganesh Chaturthi in Mumbai and other places in Maharashtra,” the apex court said. Requests with respect to other such temples or festivals would have to be dealt with by the Maharashtra government, the court added. The order was passed on a plea by Shri Parshwatilak Shwetamber Murtipujak Tapagacch Jain Trust, which is dedicated to the Jain community and had approached the apex court against a Bombay high court (HC) order of August 13 that had declined to grant interim relief. The plea before the HC had sought permission to visit Jain temples to perform puja during Paryushana, which is being held between August 15 and 23. The HC while refusing to pass any interim order had listed the case for further hearing in September. Paryushana, which literally translates to “abiding and coming together” is a major festival for the Jain community, where the members of the faith take vows, observe fast and come together to pray. Maharashtra government had opposed the plea in the SC, stating that the state is the worst affected as far as Covid-19 outbreak is concerned. The government reasoned with the apex court that it would be difficult for the authorities concerned to ensure compliance with Covid-19 precautions, if places of worship are opened to the public. “Maharashtra is the state most affected by Covid-19 in India. I am opposing the plea vigorously due to the unimaginable situation in the state and keeping in mind the interests of the state,” said senior counsel AM Singhvi, who appeared on behalf of Maharashtra government. CJI Bobde, however, pointed out that if the standard operating procedures (SOPs) laid down by the Central government and the undertaking given by the petitioner could be enforced, then the plea could be granted. The Central government through solicitor-general (S-G) Tushar Mehta supported the plea on condition that all precautions and SOPs are adhered to. “This is the same choice we had faced with the Jagannath Ratha Yatra in Puri. We had held that if the congregation can be avoided, then mere pulling of the rath (chariot) will not worsen the situation. And nothing worse happened after that. Lord Jagannath forgave us. We will be forgiven in this case, too,” CJI Bobde said. Earlier on June 22, the SC had allowed the annual Hindu festival of Rath Yatra at Jagannath temple in Odisha’s Puri district to be held without public participation and subject to stringent restrictions owing to the pandemic. Senior counsel Dushyant Dave, who was representing the Jain trust, submitted on Friday that he was seeking permission to allow only five devotees inside a temple at a time subject and a maximum of 250 per day. He also pointed out that the state government was allowing other economic activities such opening of shopping malls, liquor outlets, etc, while pleading for the Jain devotees to visit their shrines. Singhvi argued that a leeway given to one religious group could lead to similar petitions from other faiths as well. “We are satisfied that if only five people are allowed, it will not cause any problem,” CJI Bobde said. The SC had also heard another similar case from Jharkhand to open Baba Baidhyanath Jyotirlinga Temple at Deoghar and Baba Basukinath Temple at Basukinath to the public and to allow the Shravani Mela devotees to offer prayers during Hindu holy months of Shravan and Bhado. The Jharkhand government had opposed the plea, the citing the Covid-19 threat and the fact that it would be streaming the temple rituals online. The apex court, eventually, did not pass any direction. Instead it had requested the Jharkhand government to explore the possibility of allowing at least a few devotees to visit the temple every day on the auspicious occasion. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-allows-prayers-in-3-jain-temples-in-mumbai-for-2-days/story-QTMdDxAtfBZzlJ8yyBLdhP.html

Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has announced an ex gratia of Rs 50 lakh to the family of deputy engineer Venkatesh Goud and Rs 25 lakh each to the families of the eight other deceased. He also assured that one member of every bereaved family will be given a job, apart from other departmental benefits.The SLBHP is on the Telangana side of the Srisailam reservoir on Krishna river-- a joint irrigation project between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The power house was constructed inside a two-km long tunnel under the Nallamala hill range adjacent to the reservoir. Though the authorities initially said there were 30 employees inside the power plant when the accident occurred at 10.30 pm, an official statement from TSGenco said there were only 17 employees inside. “Eight of them managed to come out of the station with injuries, nine others remained trapped inside as they were trying their best to put out the fire and save the power plant from being burnt completely,” the statement said. The deceased employees of TSGenco were identified as deputy engineer Srinivas Goud, assistant engineers Venkat Rao, Mohan Kumar and Uzma Fathima, plant attendant Rambabu, junior attendant Kiran and Sundar Kumar. Two other employees of Amaron Batteries, Hyderabad – Vinesh Kumar and Mahesh Kumar-- were also trapped inside the power plant and were among those found dead. “All of them tried to come out of the escape tunnel, but they did not succeed due to the thick plumes of smoke that engulfed the entire tunnel,” the statement said. Also Read: President Kovind, PM Modi condole loss of lives in fire at Telangana hydroelectric plantTelangana power minister G Jagadeeshwar Reddy, agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy, TSGenco chairman and managing director D Prabhakar Rao rushed to the spot along with other senior officials. Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has ordered a comprehensive probe by the Crime Investigation Department (CID) into the fire accident at SLBP. He appointed CID additional director general Govind Singh as inquiry officer to probe into the cause of the accident and submit a report to the government. The chief minister expressed deep shock over the loss of nine lives in the mishap and said despite best efforts, those trapped inside could not be rescued. Describing the accident as the most tragic, he conveyed his condolences to members of the bereaved families. He wished speedy recovery to those critically injured in the accident. Jagadeeshwar Reddy, who supervised the rescue operations, said the fire possibly erupted due to a short circuit in one of the electric panels of the power house and it spread to other parts. “Thick smoke engulfed the tunnel, making it difficult for the rescue teams to reach the place,” the minister said. Fire extinguishers could not control the fire and ambulances could not reach the area. Teams from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and from the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) were pressed into service. Rescue teams from Singareni Collieries also joined the rescue operations. According to TSGenco authorities, the power plant is located inside the tunnel at about 1.2 km from the entrance and the only way to reach the plant was through the tunnel. “But because of flames and heavy smoke, it was not possible to enter the tunnel. The rescue teams could enter the power house only by Friday afternoon. But by that time, all the nine employees were unfortunately found dead,” the official statement said. Out of the eight persons who managed to escape in the initial hours, three persons were seriously injured and they are being treated, the statement said.

21-08-2020||India||I-T dept raids Bhopal builder’s premises, gets incriminating documents; Cong demands CM’s resignation||The Income tax department’s raids on the establishments of a real estate developer and close associates has led to recovery of documents related to a number of properties and unaccounted for transactions in Bhopal and neighbouring district Sehore, as per officials. The raids in what is supposed to be a major action by the department against income tax evasion began on Thursday and are still continuing. About 140 officials and personnel of the department assisted by more than 100 police personnel are involved in the raids conducted at about 20 establishments, as per officials. The raids proved a shot in the Opposition Congress’ arm and the latter launched an attack on the ruling party leaders as the real estate developer happens to be close to a state minister from the Gwalior-Chambal region. The minister played a key role in the fall of the then Congress government. He stayed all the time with the 22 Congress MLAs in a Bengaluru resort who had rebelled against then chief minister Kamal Nath. The MLAs resigned from the state assembly to join the BJP, an act that led to the BJP dislodging the Congress from power. The state Congress leaders have circulated on social media several photos of the real estate developer seen with the minister and several other BJP leaders. In a screen image of the builder’s tweet he is seen with the minister and several others in a chartered plane while returning from Bengaluru in March and with a message which said - ‘Mission Accomplished’. Though Income tax officials refused to make any formal comment on the raids going on, an officer who didn’t want to be named said more than Rs 1 crore in cash and documents concerning more than 100 properties, including documents on two cricket stadia in Bhopal were recovered till Thursday night. Bank lockers were yet to be opened. ECHOES OF VYAPAM SCAM State Congress leader KK Mishra alleged, “The builder who is close to a minister and certain top leaders of the BJP had played a key role in Vyapam Scam but later under the pressure of the then government he was made an approver in the case. That he was seen in a photo driving the car of a top BJP leader showed his proximity with the BJP leaders. The minister with his wife stayed in the Academy of the builder for several days recently when they turned positive for coronavirus.” Mishra said chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan should immediately step down from his post as the raids had brought to light the role of black money in dislodging of the then Congress government and BJP forming its government. However, state BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai said, “The Congress leaders have forgotten the fact conveniently that Income Tax raids are being conducted during BJP regime only. However, making a comment just on the basis of raids and without knowing the outcome is the habit of Congress leaders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-t-dept-raids-bhopal-builder-s-premises-gets-incriminating-documents-cong-demands-cm-s-resignation/story-xyjCg9arLNYsmwZzt76vaN.html
21-08-2020||India||Supreme Court allows prayers in 3 Jain temples in Mumbai amid Covid-19, cites Rath Yatra example||The Supreme Court on Friday allowed limited entry of devotees to three Jain temples in Mumbai’s Dadar, Chembur and Byculla on August 22 and 23 (Saturday and Sunday) to offer prayers on the occasion of Paryushan festival.A bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said that entry into temples will be subject to the undertaking given by the petitioner - a trust dedicated to Jain community - as per which they agreed to allow only five people at a time inside the temple with an upper limit of 250 people per day.“We are of the view that if the undertaking of faithfully complied with, it would not be hazardous to permit prayers at the three temples,” the bench which also comprised justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said.It cited the example of allowing Odisha Rath Yatra and said, “This is exactly the choice we had with Odisha Rath Yatra. We believe that if we can ensure that distancing is maintained and people do not gather then merely putting the Rath is not damaging.”The court also made it clear that its order will not apply to any other temples or festivals involving large congregation.“We are referring in particular to the congregation that happens during Ganesh Chaturthi in Mumbai and other places,” the court noted.The Maharashtra government had opposed the plea saying that the state is worst hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and it will be difficult for authorities to ensure adherence to precautions to check the spread of the coronavirus disease.The bench was, however, critical of the stance by the state pointing out that the government was allowing other economic activities but disallowing religious activities.“We find it strange that you are allowing every activity involving economic interests. But if it involves religion, you say you cannot do it because of Covid,” CJI Bobde said.The Bombay high court had earlier rejected the interim prayer by petitioner to allow entry to Jain temples during the days of Paryushan festival from August 15 to 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-allows-prayers-in-3-jain-temples-in-mumbai-amid-covid-19-cites-rath-yatra-example/story-Gs3DTxgjQdWztm5gyALRLJ.html

21-08-2020||India||All 9 trapped in fire at Telangana hydroelectric plant killed||All nine trapped inside a hydroelectric plant in Telangana’s Srisailam after a fire broke out late Thursday night were killed, the officials said on Friday.Of nine bodies recovered, three were identified as assistant engineers -- Sundar Naik, Mohan Kumar and Fathima. Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao ordered a comprehensive enquiry by Crime Investigation Department (CID) into the cause of the accident. Govind Singh, CID’s additional director of police, has been appointed as the inquiry officer. Singh has been asked to submit a report at the earliest.The chief minister expressed anguish over the loss of lives in the Srisailam power station fire. Describing it as unfortunate, KCR said all the efforts were made to rescue the trapped engineers and bring them out alive, but in vain. He expressed his deep condolences to the bereaved families.Telangana power minister G Jagadeeshwar Reddy, who rushed to the spot along with top TSGenco officials, told reporters that the fire erupted possibly due to short circuit in the electric panels of the power house and it spread to other parts of the power house.There were 30 employees of TSGenco inside the powerhouse when the accident took place late on Thursday night. While six employees were rescued and brought out of the tunnel, 15 others managed to come out through the emergency exit route of the project.However, nine others were trapped inside as thick smoke engulfed inside the tunnel, making it difficult for the rescue teams to reach the place, Reddy said.The rescued employees, including deputy executive engineer Pawan Kumar, plant junior assistant Ramakrishna, junior engineers Mathru, Krishna Reddy and Venkataiah and driver Palankaiah were shifted to TSGenco Hospital at Eegala Penta closer to the power house. They are out of danger.SLBP is on the Telangana side of the Srisailam reservoir on the Krishna River, a joint irrigation project under Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The power house was constructed in the huge tunnel under the Nallamala forests adjacent to the reservoir, which is presently brimming with heavy inflows into the river forcing the authorities to lift all the gates to discharge water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-bodies-recovered-from-srisailam-power-plant-fire-mishap-6-still-trapped/story-a4SsxbJX2Dq4pLtnT3dcYO.html
21-08-2020||India||UK issues urgent call for more Indian, South Asian Covid-19 plasma donors||The UK’s state-funded National Health Service (NHS) on Friday issued an urgent call for people of Indian and South Asian heritage who have recovered from Covid-19 to donate their plasma to help save lives of others infected with the deadly virus.According to experts, people from a South Asian background are around twice as likely to have high enough antibodies for their donations to be used in life-saving treatment trials, compared to white people. The NHS said that this antibody-rich plasma, which could save the lives of people with coronavirus, is being sought urgently ahead of a feared second wave of the pandemic in the country later in the year.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“We have had a fantastic response from the Asian community. Covid-19 is attacking the Asian community more than the wider community and donating plasma could save a life,” said Rekha Anand, a Consultant Haematologist for NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), which is a Special Health Authority in charge of blood and organ donation.NHSBT said that its data shows that people of an Asian heritage have been donating in strong numbers, at over 7 per cent of all plasma donors so far, and also sought to highlight the donation as a safe and easy procedure.“Plasma donation is safe, clean and easy. It takes about 45 minutes and your body quickly replaces the plasma and the antibodies,” explains Dr Shruthi Narayan, a Consultant Donor Medicine for NHSBT. “Because your red blood cells are returned to you, you can carry on with your day as normal,” she said.A Public Health England (PHE) report had concluded that people from South Asian communities who have Covid-19 have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill and the emerging evidence is that the more seriously ill people become, the more antibodies they produce.  This seems to be borne out in statistics as NHSBT found that among first-time donors from an Asian background, 44.1 per cent (330 out of 749) had high enough antibodies for the trial, compared with 22.4 per cent (2,126 out of 9,509) of white donors. “Some people may feel nervous about donating, particularly if they’ve had a tough time with coronavirus. Our donation team will look after you and people usually feel fantastic after donating, knowing they are doing something to help the community,” said Dr Suhail Asghar, from NHSBT’s Clinical Support Team.Plasma donor centres have been set up across all major towns and cities of the UK, especially those with a significant South Asian population, including London, Birmingham, Leicester and Manchester.Dr Naim Akhtar, a Consultant in Donor Medicine for NHSBT, added: “Plasma donation is a way to help those who are in need. By donating plasma, you could help someone to survive from Covid and spend more time with their family.” The NHSBT campaign involving experts from a South Asian heritage for more plasma donors follows the UK government’s appeal earlier this week for more people of Indian and South Asian origin to sign up for Covid-19 vaccine trials, after a low rate of sign up from these communities to the Vaccine Research Registry. A targeted recruitment programme broadcast in Gujarati, Punjabi, Bengali and Urdu is among the measures being deployed to reach out to different communities to ensure any future vaccine that clears all trials works for everyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-issues-urgent-call-for-more-indian-south-asian-covid-19-plasma-donors/story-gZHTxMR2tYGxIEcSOxJsMM.html

21-08-2020||India||Bengal governor alleges ‘multi-crore scam’||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) got into a war of words again on Friday after he said a three-member inquiry panel set up to probe corruption allegations in the purchase of medical equipment to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic was an attempt to cover up the truth. He alleged a multi-crore scam in purchase.Also read:Guv hits out at WB govt over I-Day eventDhankhar said the panel includes top bureaucrats, who lack credibility and that only an independent probe could track the “money trail and ill-gotten gain”. Home secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay heads the panel.“Multi Crore Scam-Pandemic Purchase @MamataOfficial. Cover Up Probe-Lacks credibility. Decision Makers (-one) probing to shield culpability #MAP. Post facto saviour mechanism! Independent Probe can alone fasten culpability. Need Probe to track money trail and ill gotten gain,” tweeted Dhankhar.A state government official this week told HT the West Bengal health department has purchased several items over the past few months. “More than Rs 2,000 crore have been spent. The allegations relate to corruption in this expenditure.”TMC reacted sharply to Dhankhar’s allegation saying if he has proof of the corruption, then he should give it to the government instead of making statements. “Nobody knows how to deal with the governor’s propensity to go public every day. Can he prove what he is alleging? If he has proof, he should give it to the government instead of making public statements. His statements degrade the dignity of the office he holds,” said TMC spokesman Saugata Roy.The West Bengal Medical Services Corporation Limited usually purchases medicines and equipment in bulk. But the government formed a committee for procuring these items during the pandemic to avoid delays.Some of the items were allegedly purchased from particular agencies bypassing rules. The quality of the products has also been questioned. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee ordered the probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-governor-alleges-multi-crore-scam/story-SYMY30bT0EgTh9nA3akQ6H.html
21-08-2020||India||I-Day celebrations: Maoists assault tribals for taking part||The outlawed Communist Party of India (CPI)-Maoist rebels assaulted and inflicted injuries to over 30 residents of Chikpal village in Chhattisgarh’s Dantewada district for taking part in the 74th Independence Day celebrations on August 15, the police said on Friday. Around 40 Maoists reached the Chikpal village under the jurisdiction of Katekalyan police station on Wednesday night to take revenge against the local residents for wearing patriotism on their sleeves on the occasion of the Independence Day. The rebels thrashed them with sticks and butts of their guns, the police said. ‘The villagers were assaulted for attending the 74th Independence Day celebrations and flag-hoisting programme at Marjum village, which took place after 30 years. The Maoists had been hoisting black flags on Independence Days for all these years,” said Abhishek Pallav, superintendent of police (SP), Dantewada. He said 10 villagers, including a woman, have lodged a first information report (FIR) at Katekalyan police station, following which a case has been registered. “Many villagers were beaten. However, they are not coming forward due to fear of being targeted by the Maoists again. We are sending a team of doctors along with security forces for the treatment of the injured villagers,” said the SP. The Maoists have other reasons to be unhappy with the villagers, according to the SP. “There has been an active participation of these villagers in developmental activities that have been initiated by the district administration. The Left-wing Extremists (LWEs) are facing a gradual erosion of discipline and poor command-and-control mechanism, which have led the junior cadres to target innocent villagers for no rhyme or reason. Besides, several local youths had joined the Chhattisgarh Police last year. As a result, the Maoists are apprehensive that the new recruited police hires are leaking information about them,” the SP added.Intelligence sources said that in 2014 a Maoist meeting was held in Chikpal- Marjum, which was attended by over 10,000 villagers. Both the villages had boycotted last assembly, parliamentary and assembly by-elections. “Chikpal and Marjum were cut off from mainland in 2008, when Maoists had dug up the Katekalyan -Chikpal road at 40-50 places. This area used to be the hotbed of Katekalyan area committee of Darbha division of the Maoists,” said a police official. On July 19, 25 people were injured in a similar attack by the Maoists in Parcheli village of the Dantewada district. Chikpal-Marjum is a key strategic conduit for the Maoists, who freely move between Odisha and southern Bastar, and they are determined to maintain a stranglehold over these villages, the police said. Soni Sori, a tribal right activist from the Maoist-hit Bastar region, has also condemned Wednesday’s incident. “The Maoists’ assault of innocent tribals should be condemned. The police authorities must understand that when they (villagers) were planning to celebrate the 74th Independence Day in Marjum, the invitation should have been also extended to local leaders, sarpanchs and other activists, who have consistently resisted the Maoist aggression. Local leadership that acts as a pressure group cannot be ignored for any anti-Naxal campaign to become successful,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-beaten-more-than-30-tribals-for-taking-part-in-independence-day-ceremony/story-gzaWBUDS2GzajfCcc8TG7J.html

21-08-2020||India||In Bihar, 65-yr-old had 8 kids in 18 months in govt records||Leela Devi (65), a resident of Chhoti Kothia village in Musahari block of Muzaffarpur district, last gave birth to a boy 21 years ago, her fourth child. She is one of the many beneficiaries of National Maternity Benefit Schemes (NMBS) under the National Health Mission (NHM) in the district. NMBS is a scheme to boost institutional delivery of babies. Under the scheme, Rs 1,400 is given to the mother, while Rs 600 is paid to ASHA worker for assistance. Leela, however, is surprised. Her husband, a small farmer, is too. Documents in HT possession show Leela has given birth to babies eight times in the last 18 months. “My last baby is a boy and was born 21 years ago. I came to know I had been included as a beneficiary and money had been given to me nearly a week ago. When I approached the operator of a CSP (customer service point) centre, where my account is, I was asked by the operator not to lodge a case and that they will return the money withdrawn in my name,” she says. Leela is not the lone elderly woman to have “benefited” under the scheme. Money has been deposited into and withdrawn from the accounts of more than 50 women fraudulently in the district. Another woman, Shanti Devi (66), has been shown having given birth to two babies the same day, within an interval of 10 hours, despite the fact the babies are not twins. Sabina Khatoon (59) of the same village also has been shown as a beneficiary of the scheme. After the embezzlement came to light, district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh on Thursday ordered a probe. When approached for comment, Charanjit Kumar, branch manager of State Bank of India’s branch at Musahari the CSP center is attached with, feigned ignorance. “I don’t know how the CSP operator has managed all this even after the transaction system has been attached with finger print enabled system and Aadhaar identification. He can tell more about this,” he said. The CSP operator, Sushil Kumar, has gone into hiding soon after the matter came to the light. The DM could not be contacted despite repeated calls and messages. Civil surgeon and chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Shailesh Prasad Singh termed it a very serious matter. “I, along with some of my subordinates, met the DM and discussed the matter. He expressed his concern over the entire episode and asked me to set up an inquiry committee, led by a senior doctor and account experts,” he said. Senior gynecologist Dr Indu Kumari said, “No woman can give birth to baby after menopause.” However, superintendent of Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital, Dr Sunil Kumar Shahi, said woman older than 50 years giving birth to a baby cannot be ruled out altogether. “It has been seen that some elderly woman have given birth. But these are rare cases,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-gives-birth-8-times-in-18-months-gets-money-under-nhm-say-records/story-mSGVlodb7DyPKVkpech9CK.html

21-08-2020||India||HC issues notices to Siddhivinayak Trust, Maha govt over funds transfer||The Bombay high court on Friday issued notices to the Maharashtra government and Mumbai’s Siddhivinayak Temple Trust in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging latter’s transfer of Rs 10 crore to the former for the fight against Covid-19 pandemic and the state’s Shiv Bhojan Scheme for subsidised food for the poor. It has directed them to file their respective replies within four weeks. The court granted one week thereafter to the petitioner to file rejoinders to the replies and posted the PIL for further hearing in the first week of October.A bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Revati Mohite-Dere said “prima face case was made out for admitting the PIL”.Petitioner Leela Ranga, a lawyer, has questioned two recent transfers of Rs 5 crore each and said the trust has “donated” about Rs 30 crore to the state government.Ranga has called the transfers illegal and impermissible under provisions of the Shree Siddhivinayak Temple Trust (Prabhadevi) Act, 1980, which governs the trust’s functioning.Ranga’s lawyer, Pradeep Sancheti, said Rs 5 crore each have been transferred to the government for the fight against the pandemic and for the Shiv Bhojan Scheme. He cited the Act’s section 18 and added the trust’s funds can be utilised only for the maintenance, management and administration of the temple. Sancheti added the section allows use of surplus funds only for development of the trust properties like rest houses for devotees and for maintenance of educational institutions, schools, hospitals or dispensaries.Sancheti said the law does not allow transfer of the trust funds to the government. He pointed out the proposals for transferring the amounts have been initiated by the government and not even by the trust. “This is systematic way of transferring the trust funds to the government,” he said, urging the court to pass an interim order to stop any further transfers.A bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Revati Mohite-Dere refused to consider the prayer, saying no one appeared on behalf of the temple trust. It added the court can direct transfer of the funds back to the trust if, after final hearing, it finds that the transfers were illegal.The court rejected Sancheti’s request to restrain the government from renewing appointment of certain trustees, whose terms are ending this month. Sancheti claimed the chairman of the temple trust has got extension of three years after the transfers under challenge in their plea.“This is also not the stage for appointing a retired judge,” the bench said referring to the petitioner’s interim prayer for appointment of a retired high court judge to inquire into the affairs of the trust in view of “impermissible transfers”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-refuses-to-stay-fund-transfer-from-siddhivinayak-trust-to-maha-govt/story-6Y6wFcXrTaequ8AHDpPk9K.html
21-08-2020||India||Cops planning case against girl, 16, for wrongly accusing neighbour of rape||A 16-year-old had wrongly accused her 21-year-old neighbour of raping her in Bhopal, said police on Thursday, adding that another person who had sex with the girl has been arrested on charges of rape. The police are also looking to file a case against the girl for wrongly identifying an innocent person of rape.The neighbour was found innocent during police investigation. Another accused who was arrested on Wednesday later tested positive for coronavirus, said police. He was produced before the court through video conferencing and later hospitalised, said police. Family members of the girl had filed a missing report with the police on August 4. She returned three days later, on August 7, on her own, said the police.“When a police team recorded her statement, the girl said she had been drugged and kidnapped by two persons, including her neighbour, who raped her for two days. Later, they let her go. On the basis of her statement, her medical examination was conducted and her neighbour was questioned intensely,” said Nagendra Pateriya, City superintendent of police (CSP).“Shahjahanabad police found several discrepancies in the statement of the girl and upon investigation it was found that the man who was accused by the girl for kidnapping and raping her was in fact present in his office at the time when the crime took place as was alleged by the girl. This man had CCTV footage too to corroborate his statement,” said Pateriya. The girl was counselled and was asked to give a statement again.“The girl then said she had told a lie as she was scared. She said her brother had spotted her talking to another youth a few days back and thrashed both of them. That’s why when police asked her about the name of the accused who had kidnapped and raped her she took the name of her neighbour. She thought if she named her neighbour her family members would believe her statement as there had been a feud between the neighbour and her family,” said the police officer. Since the girl is a minor, the officer said, the youth arrested has been booked under rape charge. The girl’s medical report confirmed that the girl had sex.Police are looking into the matter to decide if the girl should be booked for accusing an innocent person for her rape, said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cops-planning-case-against-girl-16-for-wrongly-accusing-neighbour-of-rape/story-w7gHcEUSsA7hTpL1wGWn6N.html

DJ Elena Emelyanova, who goes by her stage name ‘Sunrise Dark’, was a popular attraction at Russian rave parties in Goa. She was among the three foreigners and 20 Indian nationals, including an actor, who were arrested by the police at night on August 15 on charges of possession of narcotics. The Crime Branch authorities had kept the local police in the dark and busted a rave party at a hired villa in Vagator. Altogether, 23 people were arrested and narcotics, including cocaine, hashish and ecstasy, etc, worth Rs 9 lakh were seized. The arrested accused have been booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985. The arrested accused include actor Kapil Jhaveri whose photographs with several ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) leaders such as Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant and state party president Vinay Tendulkar have gone viral on social media. Also read: Cop shoots gym owner dead in Delhi’s RohiniShailesh Shetty, a close aide of independent Goa lawmaker Rohan Khaunte, was also arrested later. Eva Ova (29), a Czech Republic national, and Ana Nucamendo (28) from Mexico are the other two arrested accused foreigners. The social media campaign that has been launched in several Russian cities is appealing to the public to donate generously for the release of Emelyanova on bail. The drive claimed that she has been falsely implicated. “Our beloved friend Lena (Elena) is a good person. She is an incredibly bright DJ, who gives us only positive emotions and music … she was invited to play at a party on August 15 ... her love for music is boundless … suddenly, the police came and arrested her,” said the appeal shared by Viktoriya Uvarovska, a Russian national. “I ask for your help in collecting money for the release of an innocent girl. She has been charged with organising an illegal party. But she is a DJ, who was invited to play at the party. She didn’t even get a chance to be at the console,” it stated. The appeal contains three bank account numbers, including two in Russia and also the State Bank of India’s Porvorim branch in Goa, where the donations can be sent to get legal redressal for Emelyanova.Agni Pavalonka, another Russian national, is also part of the social media campaign to ensure Emelyanova’s release on bail. There was a free-for-all at Pavalonka’s farewell party in early August that had spilled on the streets in Goa. Later, police had booked the party organisers for the unruly scenes and violation of law and order. The social media campaigners for Emelyanova have cited that the other two accused were released on a bail bond of Rs 1 lakh each, but the DJ would need more money because she has been held on charges of possession of cocaine. However, the police contradicted Emelyanova’s supporters’ version. Shobit Saksena, superintendent of police (SP), anti-narcotic cell (ANC), Goa, said none of those booked under the NDPS Act, 1985, has been released on bail yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russian-dj-held-in-goa-friends-back-home-launch-crowdfunding-for-her-release/story-slwWHNqQvUGiuvKtIcmxXO.html

Union information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar had said the decision will allow job seekers to take one common test and save costs and time spent on writing multiple exams.“Madhya Pradesh is the first state in the country to take this unprecedented decision of giving government jobs to youths of the state on the basis of their NRA score. Other states can also emulate it to give relief to their sons and daughters,” Chouhan tweeted.“We had already decided that only the youth of the state will have the right to government jobs in Madhya Pradesh. Now you will also get rid of the wasteful expenditure and travelling due to repeated examinations. My children my priority is to make your life enjoyable and better,” he said.The chief minister also released a statement saying the country’s youth will now be able to appear in just one test, CET, in place of individual examinations such as Staff Selection Commission (SSC), Railway Recruitment Board (RRB) and Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS). “This will not only save candidates’ time but also enable transparency in the recruitment process. The examinations will be conducted online and every district will have at least one examination centre,” Chouhan was quoted as saying in a statement, according to news agency ANI. He also said that efforts were being made to make Madhya Pradesh self-reliant and the main priority was for the state’s resources to be given to the children of the state. “A remarkable decision has been taken to implement the decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and to provide jobs only on the basis of marks obtained in the examinations conducted by NRA. We will give shape to the dream of Atmanirbhar Bharat of PM Modi by realising the dream of Atmanirbhar Madhya Pradesh,” he added.NRA will set up examination centres in every district of the country, according to a statement issued by the Union ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions on Wednesday.The agency will conduct a separate CET each for graduates, higher secondary (Class 12) students and Class 10 candidates for non-technical posts to which recruitment is currently carried out by SSC, RRBs and IBPS. It will benefit around 25 million aspirants who apply for multiple government jobs every year and have to apply for each exam separately.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-first-state-to-offer-govt-jobs-on-basis-of-nra-test-score-shivraj-singh-chouhan/story-mOu0g5S7doFgQN6En5YrKL.html

While it is taken for granted that a wrong server command generated from the centralized control and command centre caused all the problem, those probing the issue are clueless as to who gave the wrong command and why. According to UPPCL chairman and additional chief secretary, Arvind Kumar, the departmental technical committee and the STF are examining the issue from all possible angles but not much headway has been made yet. “It is clear that the problem occurred because of a wrong command from the server. The issue before us, however, is to find out whether the sending of a wrong command was due a technical error or it was given deliberately as a mischief,” he said. The STF that has been looking into the issue primarily from the conspiracy or sabotage angle for the last several days has not been able to make any headway. “There is a state of utter confusion so far largely because we are not being provided with the details we are looking for,” a top STF official told HT. He said it was too early to make a comment but the possibility of sabotage could not be ruled out. The departmental technical committee, led by Lucknow discom managing director, SP Gangwar, is learnt to have submitted its report to the UPPCL management on Wednesday. “The committee has not reached any definite conclusion though it has blamed some wrong command as the reason for making smart meters defective causing blackout in consumers’ residences,” they revealed. The Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL), company that has partnership with Union power ministry, purchases smart meters for UP and also manages the UPPCL’s control and command centre in Lucknow. The company had suspended two of its command centre officials the same night. UPPCL has already installed around 10 lakh smart meters and is in the midst of purchasing 40 lakh more. One of the features of these meters is that power supply of a consumer gets automatically disconnected if they do not pay their bills by the due date but on August 12 a large number of consumers went powerless even though they did not have any arrears pending against them. The EESL has admitted in one of its correspondences with the UPPCL that around 1.60 lakh smart meters went powerless on Janmasthami. Though UPPCL bosses claim all the meters had been rectified the next day, sources claim a large number of meters were still defective. UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad chairman, Awadhesh Kumar Vera, meanwhile, on Wednesday, filed a public interest litigation with the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) seeking strict action against the UPPCL, EESL and other stakeholders in the smart meter blackout matter. “The installation of outdated technology-based smart meters in UP is a clear violation of the Central Electricity Authority’s Advanced Metering Infrastructure Rules,” he pointed out in his complaint.Meanwhile, the work of installing smart meters in the state has been deferred for the next 15 days, minister of energy Shrikant Sharma said on Thursday. After the power cut on the day of Janmashtami, the quality of smart meters installed by the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation has been questioned by the experts. He said , “Around 40 lakh electronic smart meters are to be installed in the state. Till now around 12 lakh smart meters have been installed in cities like Lucknow, Varanasi, Meerut and Kanpur, but after the blackout on Janmashtami, I have directed the officials only to install meters with advanced technology which cannot be tampered with either by officials or by consumers.” Sharma said it is important to learn lessons from the past. “That’s why only advanced smart meters would be installed so that such incidents may be avoided,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stf-uppcl-experts-still-clueless-on-janmasthami-blackout-in-up/story-05cAlErWds4EA7bJJAYOcP.html

Last week, a man from Dubai got in touch with the SP seeking help for nonagenarian parents living without food in Alwar because their maid wasn’t visiting them. The SP sent police to deliver food and medicines to the house and also offered to arrange for domestic help. These are some examples of how Alwar SP Tejaswani Gautam is helping people who reach out to her through the e-sunwai initiative started to integrate technology with core policing. Through this, the SP reaches out to those in need and help of police but are stuck in containment or lockdown zones. “We are trying to get in touch with those who are unable to come to my office or any police station due to the corona situation or lockdown in their area,” said Gautam. For e-sunwai, one has to register at Alwar Police’s e-sunwai WhatsApp number. People receive links to join the virtual conferencing platforms after this. “We are getting many requests, but for now we are sticking to helping only those who have Covid-19 or are in containment zones; the others can come to my office or visit a police station,” she added. The initiative started on August 12 and two sessions have been conducted until Wednesday. “We plan to do this twice a week,” she said. In the second session on Wednesday, there were 11 people, including one from Agra, who registered out of curiosity. “The man is from Alwar and had heard about the initiative. He said he wanted to check if this was actually happening or was just a publicity gimmick,” the SP said. Later, he said he was overwhelmed with the interaction with the SP and also gave her some suggestions for effective policing in Kathoomar area of the district. After talking to the Aravali Vihar family, the SP said she was thinking of starting a campaign against discrimination against Covid-19 patients. Gautam said video conferencing gives complainants a real feeling and is extremely convenient as they can communicate with the SP sitting at their homes. During her previous posting in Churu, she used social media and online platforms for sessions with celebrities to provide entertainment to people who had been in lockdowns. After Alwar started reporting a rise in cases, she came up with the idea of e-sunwai to help people in home or institutional quarantine, or those who had issues related to the police and needed her intervention. Meanwhile, the Aravali Vihar family has sent her a recorded video message over WhatsApp to thank her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-those-in-lockdown-alwar-cop-helps-through-e-sunwai-wins-praise/story-YBbEwv1kTeP1fdA0kFBnDN.html
21-08-2020||India||Govt merges Centre for Glaciology with Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology||The department of science and technology (DST) under Ministry of Science and Technology and Earth Sciences has decided to discontinue the project of Centre for Glaciology (CFG) in Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) in Dehradun, officials said.The decision was communicated with the WIHG officials in a letter dated June 25 which was received in July. Under the letter, the DST also mentioned that CFG to be merged with WIHG from July 1 and all its activities to be managed by the existing staff of WIHG. The letter also asked WIHG to relieve all the staff involved in the project from July 1. HT has a copy of the letter. The Centre for Glaciology was set up in 2009 during the UPA regime in WIHG, which was appointed as its nodal agency. It had aimed to carry a coordinated research initiative on Himalayan glaciology to understand the effects of climate on glaciers in order to develop strategies for climate change adaptability. The Centre for Glaciology was also assigned to carry programmes in setting up a specialised institute on glaciology named Indian Institute of Glaciology in Mussoorie. The then government had planned a fund of about Rs 500 crore to develop the institute of which about Rs 23 crore was released. Confirming the development, director WIHG, Kalachand Sain, said, “We were asked to discontinue the project in a written communication from the DST. It has asked us to carry all its activities in WIHG and relieve the non-permanent staff involved in the project.” Sain, however, said that the ‘research on glaciology will not be stopped’ as they will continue in WIHG. “The move doesn’t mean that scientific researches on glaciology will stop. Apart from the Centre, researches were also being done in WIHG which will continue and the researches done in the project will now be done in our institute,” said Sain. The director also said that the project which was started in 2009 was initially for about 4-5 years after which it was extended every year. “As in the case of other scientific research projects, this was being extended every year on our request as the desired output was received. This has now stopped with the Centre’s letter on which we cannot comment anything as it is purely the prerogative of DST,” said Sain. The experts, however, feel that the move will affect the studies on Himalayan glaciers in the country, because the Centre would have been the first such institute in the whole country. Dr BR Arora, former director of WIHG who was involved with the CFG project from the starting said, “Discontinuing it will surely affect the glaciology research. It will slow down glacial researches, as it was a completely scientific project to study the dynamics of glaciers which were not known yet.” Arora said the major implication will be the loss of trained manpower for glaciology study. “When the project was started, we at WIHG were tasked to train manpower to study glaciology as it is not being taught in the country anywhere. The trained manpower was to be then deployed in the glaciology institute to be set up in Mussoorie for which land was also earmarked. We trained about 7-8 people for the institute since last 6-7 years who will now be lost as the project itself is discontinued. Loss of trained human resource will be the biggest implication of this move,” said Arora. He said that till the project was continued, there were many significant studies being done under him. “We all say that the Himalayan glaciers are melting but nobody exactly knew why they are melting. Whether it’s all because of only global warming or any other man-made factors also? Under the CFG project we were studying all this. We had also studied the difference between North facing glaciers and South facing glaciers and the reason of their melting accordingly,” he said. He also said that there were plans to invite foreign scientists working on glaciology to the Centre in Mussoorie. “There was plan to send our trained researchers for training to countries like China, Norway and Switzerland which have expertise in studying glaciers and ice-scoring in which frozen gas particles in glacial ice are being studied to analyse the climatic conditions in earlier years and ages. There was also a plan to invite the researchers from there to help is develop laboratories in the centre in Mussoorie under the project,” said Arora. “I hope there will be a solution to be brought up at WIHG after this recent move to compensate the loss in glacial research. But the loss of trained manpower couldn’t be compensated as this study needs in-depth knowledge and expertise which comes after years of training,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-merges-centre-for-glaciology-with-wadia-institute-of-himalayan-geology/story-CU2MFZKQsjxOqiHSm3RAYI.html

21-08-2020||India||Maha proposes Mayani Lake cluster as Conservation Reserve||The Maharashtra forest department has proposed to designate the Mayani Lake cluster of four water bodies and forest patches spread across 996.16 hectares (ha) in Satara district as a conservation reserve. Conservation reserves are protected areas, which act as buffer zones or migration corridors between established national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, reserved and protected forests.What is a conservation reserveAccording to the Union environment ministry, conservation reserves are protected areas that act as buffer zones or connectors and migration corridors between established national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and reserved and protected forests of IndiaThese protected area categories were first introduced in the Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Act, 2002. These categories were added because of reduced protection in and around existing or proposed protected areas due to private ownership of land and land useThere are 92 conservation reserves in India across 12 states. Jammu and Kashmir has the maximum reserves (34), followed by Karnataka (15) and Rajasthan (11)(Source: National Wildlife Database, Wildlife Institute of India)Officials said the proposal was mooted after residents of four villages around the proposed reserve gave their consent for it on Wednesday. “The informally known Mayani Bird Sanctuary was never declared [so] on paper by the forest department,” said chief conservator of forest (Kolhapur) V Clement Ben.Also read: Lesser human interference leads to more nestings in Surajpur wetlandBen said they will submit the proposal to the state’s principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) for the declaration of this area as a conservation reserve following the completion of the provisional public consultation under Section 36 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. He added they received a positive feedback from the residents.List of birds at Mayani wetland clusterThe CR proposal has 57 resident and migratory speciesSome of the major migratory birds include: Greater and lesser flamingos, Black-tailed Godwit, Bar-tailed Godwit, Little-ringed plover, Black stork, Whiskered tern, Northern shoveller, Eurasian marsh harrier, Eurasian wigeon, Northern pintail, common teal, cormorant, and the endangered Steppe eagleMajor local migrants include: Wooly-necked stork (vulnerable), River ternNative birds include: White-breasted waterhen, common coot, Black-headed ibis, Purple heron, yellow-eyed babbler, pied kingfisher, oriental honey buzzard, little grebe and comb duck (Source: Proposal for the Conservation Reserve)The area proposed as the conservation reserve includes Mayani dam (227.11 ha), and Yeralwadi dam (709 ha) and is interspersed by 74 ha of forest area.It is located 100 km from Sahyadri Tiger Reserve and 65 km from Satara city, and is home to a wide variety of migratory and resident birds of 57 species. The species include the greater flamingo (taller, pink bill with black tip) and lesser flamingo (shorter, dark crimson bill), endangered steppe eagle, black-tailed godwit, bar-tailed godwit, the vulnerable woolly-necked stork, Eurasian marsh harrier, osprey among others.Satara’s honorary wildlife warden, Sunil Bhoite, who has prepared the proposal, said the flagship species for the reserve will be flamingos, and protection of this habitat for native 35-40 bird species is the focus . “Flamingos have a lot of roosting and nesting areas along the west coast. However, near-threatened local species such as painted stork, black-headed Ibis among others have nowhere to go if this habitat is lost.”Maharashtra’s 7 Conservation Reserves180.72 sq km Kolamarka Conservation Reserve (Gadchiroli) - declared in 2013122.74 sq km Muktai Bhawani Conservation Reserve (Jalgaon) - declared in 201493.42 sq km Tornamal Conservation Reserve (near Nandurbar) - declared in 201654.46sq km Mamdapur Conservation Reserve (near Nashik) - declared in 20145.69 sq km Anjaneri Conservation Reserve (near Nashik) - declared in 20173.49 sq km Borgad Conservation Reserve (eastern Nashik) - declared in 200829.53 sq km Tillari Conservation Reserve (Sindhudurg) - declared in 2020Bhoite said apart from not having any protected status, the threat to this habitat was from illegal soil or silt excavation. “The silt is used for making bricks and other construction activity. This eventually leads to uneven depth of the water bodies and lake peripheral areas.”The proposal entails conservation of the strategically located wetland cluster acting as a stopover for water birds. Being one of the driest regions in the state, conserving the area would help recharge ground water, protect endangered species such as the Indian wolf, and the overall lake habitat as a major water source for birds and local residents.“A committee for this CR [conservation reserve] will help provide a restoration plan for the lakes, identify and avoid threats, and build it as an eco-tourism destination involving the local community,” said Bhoite.Bombay Natural History Society interim director Deepak Apte said the clusters are crucial. “If some ecosystems are under threat, water birds can take refuge in such areas. This is a good quality wetland cluster and such decisions are the need of the hour.” Once approved, the proposal for the reserve will be presented before the State Board of Wildlife and the Maharashtra government. This will be the second such reserve along the Konkan coast and the eighth in Maharashtra. On June 23, the state granted the status to the 2,953 ha Tillari Conservation Reserve.Conservation reserves many be protected areas, but they do not have surrounding eco-sensitive zones (protected buffers) like sanctuaries or national parks. Also, any developmental or agricultural activity proposed within a reserve needs approval from the state and Central Wildlife Board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-proposes-mayani-lake-cluster-as-conservation-reserve/story-YphlCUqsuOht1o6Jp71jpI.html

For the past five years, a local NGO and district administration had been trying to find her parents but they didn’t succeed. Many couples claimed themselves as her parents but they failed to establish their parenthood due to DNA mismatch,” said Monica Purohit, whose NGO is taking care of Geeta for the past one month. Purohit said, “In a conversation with Geeta, we tried to know about her childhood memories. With some important information regarding her childhood, we approached Indore police and they have taken a scientific approach to find her parents.” Police have short-listed Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand as Geeta’s possible home but her responses so far have not given the police any concrete indication of her place of origin.Deputy inspector general (DIG) of police in Indore, Harinarayanchari Mishra said, “We are seeking help of food, culture and face features experts who can tell us about the area or state which she may belong to. As of now, we have zeroed in on three states- Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. This will help us in inquiring about missing children from these states at the time when Geeta went missing.” “After having an idea that she may belong to any of these states, we showed some pictures of these areas, local movies, regional songs, food and traditional dresses. She identified paddy fields, some south Indian superstars and also showed familiarity with Telugu and Chhattisgarhi music but her memories related to culture matched with that of Jharkhand,” said Mishra. The Indore police will also seek data from these three states of hearing and speech impaired children who went missing in 2000.“Now, we are going to write to all these states to share old data related to missing deaf and speech impaired kids. As she says that she boarded a wrong train in New Delhi and reached Pakistan we will also write to government railway police (GRP) in Delhi to check old data to see the complaints of missing kids related to these states,” he added. Geeta had gone missing 20 years ago. According to documents provided by Edhi foundation of Pakistan which took care of her for 13 years, she was found sitting alone in Samjhauta Express in Lahore in 2000. She was then about 9 years old.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-cops-new-initiative-to-find-parents-of-hearing-impaired-woman-repatriated-from-pakistan/story-c3lEY3sPOaodecdyEwFERK.html

They would earlier have four to five Delhi tailors empaneled with the House stitch the pieces. The annual uniform allowance is being introduced for the first time and it will be up to Rs 17,000 for women and Rs 16,000 for men depending on the nature of their jobs and ranks.Employees from five key branches of the Parliament secretariat, including reporting, table office, and security, will be eligible for the allowance. “These branches deal with MPs [members of Parliament] and other visitors. They are the face of the Parliament secretariat and so they have a set uniforms that add to the dignity and glamour of the Indian Parliament,” said an official on condition of anonymity.Officials said the benefit of the allowance system is that the employees will be able to buy their new uniforms whenever they want, instead of getting it every two years. They are free to buy clothes, which must adhere to the fixed colour patterns of quality.Also read: Parliament monsoon session may start around September 10The dress code for women employees is a fixed pattern saree. For the men, it is a range of safari suits—blue, fawn, Prussian blue, charcoal—depending on the section an employee works in. In the winters, both men and women wear blazers and buttoned up coats.The table office handles the entire range of paperwork for the House, and receives notices for debates, and introduction of bills. It also sorts questions for the Question Hour. The Parliament security branch handles all security aspects.The reporting branch takes verbatim notes of all discussions inside the House and parliamentary committees. Chamber attendants, who are also eligible for the allowance along with drivers, are on duty at the Speaker’s chamber. They handle VIP guests. The drivers drive the lawmakers from their residences to the House.The chamber attendants will get Rs 8,000 annually and the drivers Rs 9,000 as uniform allowances. Women officers in the Parliament security service will get Rs 17,000 and their male counterparts Rs 16,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lok-sabha-employees-to-have-greater-say-in-choosing-new-uniforms/story-4zswGXXnGVK5yaApM6okoJ.html
21-08-2020||India||Stranded in Pakistan, Hindus on long-term visas desperate to return to India||Thirty-three-year-old Janta Mali has been stuck in Pakistan since February after she went there with her husband and three children to see her ailing mother in Mirpur Khas before the Covid-19 lockdown was clamped.In the last week of June, India and Pakistan operated a shuttle service for people stuck on both sides of the border due to the pandemic. Being Indian citizens, the husband and the children returned to Jodhpur but Janta Mali, a Pakistani living in Jodhpur on long-term visa since 2007, was denied permission to travel. Like her, several Pakistani immigrants, who visited Pakistan to meet relatives or renew passports and other identity cards, are stranded. The immigrants visited Pakistan on No Objection Return to India (NORI) visa valid for 60 days. That period is long over. In 2017, Rajasthan High Court had taken suo motu cognisance of the deportation of Pakistani nationals from minority communities. During hearing on it on Wednesday, amicus curiae Sajjan Singh Rathore raised this issue in the division bench of justices Sangeet Lodha and Rameshwar Vyas. “Due to the expiry of the (NORI) visa and closure of international routes, many people are stranded in Pakistan,” he told the court. The court has sought response from the Central and state governments on this. Rathore said the NORI visa of Janta Mali and others who went to Pakistan was not extended by the MEA. Many Hindus in Pakistan immigrate to India to escape religious persecution and stay here on LTV until they become eligible for Indian citizenship. The extended stay in Pakistan may jeopardise that, said Hindu Singh Sodha, president of Seemant Lok Sangthan, an organisation working for Indian citizenship to Hindus from Pakistan. “The period of NORI is 60 days. If they do not return in these 60 days, their NORI gets expired and they have to apply fresh for the visas. When this happens, their previous stay in India will not be counted for grant of citizenship,” he said. “Their NORI visas should be extended and they should be allowed to return to India,” Sodha said. The Seemant Lok Sangthan also wrote to the Central government on July 11, requesting intervention in the matter. It also wrote to Subodh Agarwal, the Rajasthan official in charge of coordination cell overseeing return of Indian nationals. The state government had written to the Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of External Affairs last month to intervene in the matter of stranded people.Meanwhile, the responsibility of raising the three children – Kuldeep (9), Mohit (8) and Chanchal (6) – has now fallen on Leelaram, Janta Mali’s husband. “The children talk to their mother through WhatsApp video call but she starts crying on seeing them,” Leelaram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stranded-in-pakistan-hindus-on-long-term-visas-desperate-to-return-to-india/story-07D16Wp09h1qrenq48vGeL.html

21-08-2020||India||4 electrocuted as heavy rain lashes south Bengal, flood low-lying areas||At least four people died of electrocution and one was seriously injured in Kolkata and Howrah on Thursday as intermittent heavy rain continued to lash the districts of south Bengal since Wednesday night. In the coastal district and in the Sunderbans a few hundred families had to be shifted to local schools as many rivers breached their embankments and entered the villages. The heavy rain coupled with the spring tide triggered high waves in the sea which entered nearby towns and popular beach destinations. The India Meteorological Department had warned on Wednesday of heavy rain in south Bengal because of two back-to-back low pressure systems over the Bay of Bengal. While one had formed on Wednesday, another is likely to form on Sunday. Two labourers were killed inside the Alipore Zoo in Kolkata and one was seriously injured when they accidentally touched a live wire while repairing a hoarding near the elephant enclosure. Two more persons were electrocuted at Shibpur in Howrah when they touched an exposed live wire. Many rivers across south Bengal swelled and the water gushed into some villages in South 24 Parganas, East Midnapore and Bankura districts. “The water of rivers Muriganga and Kalindi entered in a few villages over the embankments as there was heavy rain during high tide. Our officials have rushed to the spot to pump out the water,” said a senior official of the irrigation department. At Sagar block in South 24 Parganas, more than 250 families had to be shifted to schools after river water entered their houses through breaches in the embankments, said S Mondol, BDO of Sagar Island. At Digha, a popular beach destination in East Midnapore, high waves crashed on the guard walls and entered the shops along the beach. “During high tide the sea water entered the marine drive running parallel to the beach in places like Shankarpur, Digha, Shyampur and Jamra after high waves crashed on the guard walls,” said S Bhattacharya, SDO of Contai, a subdivision in East Midnapore district. At Malda and Murshidabad districts, there has been large erosion by the Ganga amid the rain. While thousands are spending sleepless nights as the river is gobbling more land every day, a few hundred families have moved to safer places. “Even though erosion is an old problem in Murshidabad, this year it has taken a serious shape. The erosion at Hossainpur, Kulidear and Parsujapur has taken serious shape. We have requested the administration to shift some families from those villages. From the TMC party we have provided them relief materials,” said Ejarat Ali, the Trinamool Congress’ block president of Farakka in Murshidabad. In Bankura at least about a dozen villages were cut off after water started flowing over a bridge. People had to take a detour of more than 10 km to reach the village. “Heavy rains would continue in an intermittent manner till August 25 as another low pressure is expected to form. The monsoon trough is also very active which is triggering heavy rains in south Bengal,” said an IMD official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-electrocuted-as-heavy-rain-lashes-south-bengal-flood-low-lying-areas/story-CyB4GInJTS1jx2sYwiHsMJ.html
21-08-2020||India||Highest monsoon rain of the season recorded last week: IMD||The week of August 13 to 19 recorded 42% excess rain compared to the long period average (LPA) for the week, according to India Meteorological Department data. This is the highest rainfall received in a week during this monsoon.The average rainfall recorded during the August 13 to 16 week is 60.2mm, but the country recorded 85.7mm last week, with 93% excess rain over central India; 56% excess rain over south peninsula; 12% excess rain over northwest India and 23% deficiency over east and northeast India. LPA is the average monsoon rain recorded between 1951 and 2000. “All the classical monsoon components were being met. A low pressure area had formed over Bay of Bengal. The monsoon trough (line of low pressure) was south of its normal position (Ganganagar to Bay of Bengal). There were moist, strong southwesterly winds blowing over the northwestern region. In fact, within a week, we had two low pressure systems—one on August 13 and another on August 19. Monsoon conditions are very active now,” said RK Jenamani, a senior scientist at national weather forecasting centre, IMD. This also shows that we may have an extended monsoon season this year. “Normally by the last week of August, rainfall reduces very gradually. But this time, the monsoon in July was very weak. It picked up in August, and as of today no monsoon model is showing any likelihood of a reduction in rainfall. A fresh low pressure area is forming over the Bay of Bengal around August 23, which will bring another round of excess rainfall,” Jenamani added.Also read: After 80% of the season’s rain in 11 days, HS Puri says Delhi’s monsoon woes to be over soonIMD had issued a data sheet titled “New Normal Dates of Onset/Progress and Withdrawal of Southwest Monsoon over India” based on the analysis of monsoon data from 1961 to 2019 and dates of withdrawal of monsoon based on data from 1971 to 2019 by scientists in IMD Pune. As per the new normal, monsoon withdraws from northwest India around September 17, which is a delay of over two weeks compared to the earlier normal date of September 1. Monsoon withdrawal is much faster now. By September 20, it withdraws from most parts of Rajasthan and some parts of north Gujarat and some western areas of Punjab and Haryana with a delay of only around five days compared to earlier.IMD had declared the beginning of monsoon retreat only on October 9 last year, and within only five days, it had withdrawn from most parts of the country. The withdrawal took only eight days. Earlier, monsoon would withdraw over about 45 days.“Modified onset and withdrawal dates have already been issued by IMD. Our forecast also shows that we will record excess rain of about 106% of LPA in August and September so it’s very difficult to say when monsoon will retreat,” said K Sathi Devi, the head of national weather forecasting centre.Many parts of northwest India, including Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi, are likely to record heavy to very heavy rain till Friday afternoon, India Meteorological Department (IMD) authorities said in their Thursday bulletin.Heavy to extremely heavy rainfall, measuring over 20 cm, is likely to be recorded on Thursday over parts of central India such as Odisha, Chhattisgarh and eastern Madhya Pradesh (MP). It has been raining in many parts of the national capital since early morning on Thursday. Delhi recorded moderate rains on Thursday.Also read: Five reasons that led to Delhi’s monsoon messThere is a well-marked low-pressure area over northern coastal Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. It is likely to move westwards gradually and concentrate into a depression during the next 24 hours, the IMD bulletin said.Due to these favourable conditions, widespread and very heavy rain is likely over Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and Vidarbha during the next three-four days.Extremely heavy rain is likely over southwest Odisha, Chhattisgarh and eastern MP on Thursday; western MP on Saturday and Sunday; eastern Rajasthan on Saturday and Gujarat over the weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highest-monsoon-rain-of-the-season-recorded-last-week-imd/story-mqA2ADL1PZrSFveXoKiySI.html

It can be taken under a doctor’s guidance for a proper dose,” said Dr PK Gupta, former president of the Indian Medical Association, Lucknow. Doctors said the medicine was found effective against the virus in a lab in-vitro study (study on a microorganism outside its normal biological context). “In Australia, researchers claimed the viral load went down 5,000 times in 48 hours with this medicine taken in combination. Also a Bangladesh scientist claimed a similar effect. At present, research on this medicine is going on at 28 places,” said Dr Kauser Usman, senior faculty at King George’s Medical University (KGMU). Doctors said people who tested positive for Covid-19 and were in home isolation and their contacts may take the medicine. “But children and pregnant women should avoid taking it,” Lucknow’s chief medical officer Dr RP Singh said in a press statement on Thursday. Dr Sandeep Kapoor, director, Healthcity Hospital, said, “It would be better if anyone consuming this medicine takes doctor’s advice first.” “Ivermectin is a medication that has been used to treat worms for years. There are no known side-effects. But its consumption should not be taken as a complete safety against infection as research is still going on,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors. Residents are finding it difficult to purchase the medicine from chemists, but traders say the situation is temporary. In the next two or three days, at least 1,000 chemist shops in Lucknow will have this medicine, they added. “Sale of Ivermectin has been limited (previously) as it is required for deworming by people once in six months or even more. Hence, not all chemists keep it. But with its role in Covid-19, we have placed orders and at last 400 chemists shops have this medicine,” said Giriraj Rastogi, president of the medicine traders association. He said at least 2,000 chemists in Lucknow will have the medicine by Monday and even more would stock it later next week. Lucknow has about 4,000 retail medicine shops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deworming-drug-a-supporting-medicine-for-covid-19-patients-say-doctors/story-srH4xsaI5flGZ4wL8T3BCI.html
21-08-2020||India||India performs 900k Covid tests for 2nd consecutive day||India performed 900,000 tests for Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for the second consecutive day on Thursday, taking the total number of tests in the country to 36,671,613 so far.With 900,000 samples being tested in close to 1,500 labs spread across India, the country seems to be right on track to meet the target of performing one million Covid-19 tests in a day by August-end.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is in the process of making arrangements to further ramp up testing in the country.“Recovery of 2,096,664 patients has been made possible because of effective implementation of the policy of testing aggressively, tracking comprehensively and treating efficiently. Focus on Standard of Care protocol including use of non-invasive oxygen, better skilled doctors in the intensive care units (ICUs) and hospitals, and improved ambulance services have culminated in yielding the desired results,” said the Union health ministry in a statement.Also read:Serum Institute registers its Covid vaccine trialAt 109,516, Uttar Pradesh performed the maximum number of tests on Thursday. A close second was Bihar with 107,945 tests, followed by Maharashtra that performed 76,591 tests.Among states or Union Territories with low testing, Meghalaya had zero tests performed on Thursday, followed by Andaman and Nicobar Islands (366), and Sikkim with 387 tests in a day. “Early identification through testing, surveillance and contact tracing along with focus on timely and appropriate clinical treatment of Covid-19 patients have ensured that not only is the Case Fatality Rate is lower than the global average and progressively declining (current figure is 1.89%), but also a small proportion of the active cases are on ventilator support,” the ministry statement further read.ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava, in a recent Covid-19 briefing, had also said that the research body had adopted an intelligent and calibrated approach as far as Covid-19 testing in India was concerned to meet the testing requirement.All states in India are currently are performing at least 140 tests per day, per million population as prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as minimum requirement for adequate Covid-19 testing. Most states are performing much higher numbers, with the national average being 580 tests per day per million population.Experts also agree that it is important to keep the testing momentum high to know the exact disease burden.“The more you test, the higher will be the number of infected that you will be able to identify. To curtail an infectious disease from spreading, one must be able to identify, through testing, as many infected individuals as possible in time so that they are isolated and put on treatment. It will also ensure they don’t roam around freely within the community and transmit the infection,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-performs-9-lakh-covid-tests-for-2nd-consecutive-day/story-qGpUicXlPrE3hBQTnVYbUP.html
21-08-2020||India||For Qureshi’s China visit, Imran Khan scripted a 3-point proposal for Prez Xi||Pakistan foreign minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi landed in the island province of Hainan late on Thursday to begin a “very important” visit that is designed to deepen the strategic partnership between the two countries that often call themselves ‘iron brothers’. Qureshi and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi are expected to hold a one-on-one meeting as well as delegation-level discussions as part of the second round of China-Pakistan foreign ministers’ strategic dialogue.“The visit aims to project Pakistan’s political and military leadership’s vision,” Qureshi said in a video message before boarding the Pakistan Air Force flight to the island in the South China Sea. The province, sometimes marketed to tourists as the ‘Hawaii of China’, is also home to China’s strategic submarine base.Qureshi, who has been in news for the past fortnight over his broadside at Saudi Arabia that led Prime Minister Imran Khan to depute Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa to firefight in Riyadh, added that he had discussed the China visit with PM Khan.Qureshi and the accompanying team of officials led by foreign secretary Sohail Mahmood are also expected to prepare for President Xi Jinping’s visit to Islamabad. President Xi’s visit, initially expected earlier this year, was deferred due to the Covid-19 pandemic and is expected to take place soon next month.A Pakistan watcher in New Delhi said Qureshi was travelling with a three-point plan in hand that included scaling up military cooperation between the two countries. The People’s Liberation Army and Pakistan army had, in August last year, signed a pact in Rawalpindi army headquarters for defence cooperation and capacity building of Pakistan Army. Islamabad is keen to upgrade this relationship to provide for what is being broadly referred to, in some quarters, as a joint military commission.This idea, he said, appeared to be centred around setting up a mechanism to take strategic decisions on a military-to-military level so that the armed forces on the two sides are on the same page.The Imran Khan government is also looking at discussions to expedite implementation of phase 2 of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC projects.Qureshi, people familiar with the matter said, wants China to help upgrade the infrastructure in Sindh, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and the Gilgit-Baltistan region, the last two regions controlled by Pakistan but claimed by India.The $60 billion infrastructure projects in Pakistan proposed under CPEC are central to China’s wider Belt and Road Initiative to develop land and sea trade routes in Asia and beyond. Just two weeks back, Pakistan’s top economic body National Economic Council cleared a $6.8 billion project - its costliest CPEC project till date.- to upgrade its railway lines for the Islamabad-Beijing link. The CPEC seeks to connect Gwadar Port in Pakistan’s Balochistan with China’s Xinjiang province.Qureshi is also expected to seek some sort of transport corridor between Nepal and Pakistan for trade with Kathmandu. Nepal had last year signed nearly 20 infrastructure-building agreements with China during President Xi’s visit including an upgraded all-weather road connection that includes building tunnels through the Himalayas.India is expected to figure prominently in the discussions, given that the two ministers are meeting when Beijing and Islamabad’s ties with New Delhi are at an all-time low due to tensions along the Line of Actual Control and the Kashmir issue.According to information available with New Delhi, China has already assured Islamabad full coordination and support over the Kashmir issue to Islamabad. The Imran Khan government wants Beijing to go one step further and raise the Kashmir issue at the forthcoming UN General Assembly session next month. Last year, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and then Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad were the only ones to go this far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-qureshi-s-china-visit-imran-khan-scripted-a-3-point-proposal-for-prez-xi/story-gBx636mEZY26sfDQwiqaKL.html
21-08-2020||India||National Recruitment Agency: All you need to know||The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved the plan to set up a National Recruitment Agency (NRA) on Wednesday. NRA will conduct a Common Eligibility Test (CET) for all non-gazetted posts, including Group B and C (non-technical) jobs.Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday announced that government jobs will be allowed to the youth of the state on the basis of their score in the National Recruitment Agency (NRA) test.He said Madhya Pradesh has become the first state in the country to take such a decision.“We have taken an important decision that the state government jobs will be only given to youngsters, who belong to MP. We are putting in place necessary legal provisions to this effect. MP’s resources are only for the state’s children,” the CM said in a video clip released to the media.In a tweet, the CM said: “From today, the children of Madhya Pradesh will have the first right over the resources of Madhya Pradesh. All government jobs will be reserved only for the children of Madhya Pradesh. Our aim is to involve the local talents in the upliftment of the state”.Also read| National Recruitment Agency to be boon for youngsters, will boost transparency: PM ModiHere’s all you need to know about National Recruitment Agency test:•The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved creation of a National Recruitment Agency (NRA) to conduct an online Common Eligibility Test (CET) for selecting candidates for majority of central government jobs.•The decision will allow job-seekers take one common test and save costs and time spent on writing multiple exams, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar had said.•Madhya Pradesh is the first state in the country to take this unprecedented decision of giving government jobs to youths of the state on the basis of their NRA score.•The NRA will set up examination centres in every district of the country, said a statement issued by the Union Personnel Ministry in New Delhi.•The NRA will conduct a separate CET each for the three levels of graduate, higher secondary (12th pass) and the matriculate (10 th pass) candidates for those non-technical posts to which recruitment is currently carried out by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), the Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs) and by the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS).•According to a press release issued by the government, NRA has been envisioned as ‘a specialist body bringing the state of the art technology and best practices to the field of central government recruitment’.•NRA will benefit around 25 million aspirants who apply for multiple government jobs every year and have to apply for each exam separately.Here’s how National Recruitment Agency will benefit government job aspirants:• Aspirants do not have to apply and appear separately for multiple recruitment exams. They will be able to apply once for a single or multiple recruitment exams in various departments and take the Common Eligibility Test (CET). CET will be a preliminary level test. Its score will be valid for 3 years. After the CET is conducted, NRA will send the scores of eligible candidates to the respective agencies to continue the recruitment process. So, those who clear the CET will have to appear for the mains or second level of the recruitment.•CET would significantly reduce the lengthy recruitment cycle as some of the recruitment departments have decided to skip their tier -2 or second level test and go ahead with the recruitment based on CET score which will be the preliminary level test followed by physical tests and medical examination. This will reduce the time taken by the agencies to hire the candidates.•CET will be conducted separately for graduate, higher secondary (12th) and matric (10th) levels. Each level of exam will have a common syllabus and will serve as screening (preliminary) test for that level.•Candidates who clear CET once, will be eligible to attempt for the second level exam (mains) thrice (once every year). They will not have to appear for the PT/ screening test again for three years. Currently, those who pass the PT and fail in Main exam (tier 2) have to again appear for the PT next year and start afresh. This way, CET will save their time and energy.•There shall be no restriction on the number of attempts to be taken by a candidate to appear in the CET subject to the upper age limit. Relaxation in the upper age limit shall be given to candidates of SC/ST/OBC and other categories as per the extant policy of the Government.•Candidates will have the facility to give a choice of centres and they would be allotted the chosen centres, based on availability. They will be given an option to schedule their own tests at their choice centres. “The ultimate aim is to reach a stage wherein candidates can schedule their own tests at Centres of their choice,” the press statement reads.•Government has sanctioned a sum of Rs 1517.57 crore for the NRA. The expenditure will be undertaken over a period of three years. The cost will also be incurred for setting up exam infrastructure in 117 districts with large numbers of aspirants. The proposal is expected to ease the access to aspirants residing in rural areas.•Candidates will not have to incur additional expenses for travel, boarding, lodging to reach their exam centres that are usually far from their home town. Single exam will reduce the financial burden on candidates.•The availability of exam centres in every district would benefit the female candidates as well. Girls generally depend on a guardian (father/brother/ husband) to accompany them in reaching their exam centres if it is far away from their home town. The location of test centres in every district would benefit the candidates, particulary women.•CET would be available in a number of languages, benefitting aspirants from different regions of country. Presently, most of the exams are conducted in English and Hindi languages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-recruitment-agency-all-you-need-to-know/story-896VyTk9ePb6uQIJplDEOO.html
21-08-2020||India||Chandrayaan-2 completes a year around Moon, adequate fuel for 7 more years: ISRO||India’s second lunar mission Chandrayaan-2 completed one year in orbit around the moon on Thursday and all instruments are currently performing well and there is adequate onboard fuel to keep it operational for about seven more years, space agency ISRO said. Chandrayaan-2 was launched on July 22, 2019 and inserted into the lunar orbit on August 20, exactly one year ago. “Though the soft-landing attempt (of the lander carrying the rover) was not successful, the orbiter, which was equipped with eight scientific instruments, was successfully placed in the lunar orbit. The orbiter completed more than 4,400 orbits around the Moon and all the instruments are currently performing well,” the Indian Space Research Organisation said. The agency in a statement said the spacecraft was healthy and the performance of subsystems normal. “The orbiter is being maintained in 100 +/- 25 km polar orbit with periodic orbit maintenance (OM) maneuvers. So far, 17 OMs are carried out since achieving 100 km lunar orbit on 24th September 2019. There is adequate onboard fuel to remain operational for about seven years,” it added. Chandrayaan-2 mission was India’s first attempt to make a softlanding of a rover on the unchartered South Pole of the lunar surface. However, the lander Vikram hard-landed in September last year. The scientific payloads, including high resolution camera, onboard the oribter for mapping the lunar surface and study the exosphere (outer atmosphere) of the Moon. The city-headquartered ISRO said raw data from the payloads have been downloaded at the Indian Space Science Data Centre (ISSDC) during the year. Public data release was planned by end of this year, after validation by a formal peer review, it said adding the first-year observations from Chandrayaan-2 demonstrate the in-orbit performance of payloads, strongly indicating its ability to contribute significantly to lunar science. “The anticipated long life of this orbiter can contribute much to the current resurgence of interest among the global scientific community for a sustained presence on the Moon,” the space agency said. Chandrayaan-2 was launched to further expand the knowledge about the moon through a detailed study of its topography, mineralogy, surface chemical composition, thermo- physical characteristics and atmosphere, leading to a better understanding of the origin and evolution of the moon. Indias first mission to the Moon Chandrayaan-1, launched in 2008, had given clear evidence on the extensive presence of surface water and the indication for subsurface polar water- ice deposits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chandrayaan-2-completes-a-year-around-moon-adequate-fuel-for-7-more-years-isro/story-msz7eBAC70aIYWCHbiZMrK.html

21-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Delhi’s second sero survey (blood test for Covid-19 antibodies) has shown that 29.1% of the roughly 15,000 people surveyed across the Capital’s 11 districts have been exposed to the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes the coronavirus disease – and are, therefore, immune. That’s a 6.2 percentage point jump from the last survey (which was conducted in late June and early July; this one was conducted in early August). In a sign of how our understanding of Covid-19 is increasing by the day, at the time when the first results were declared, it wasn’t clear what kind of immunity these antibodies would provide against the disease.At least four studies since then have added to our knowledge on immunity. As HT’s Binayak Dasgupta put it in an article summarising the key findings of several immunity-related studies, and their importance: “…a person once infected may be immune to reinfection; this protection may last for at least 3-6 months; the immune system is likely to remember the virus to offer protection in a highly infectious situation; and the level of protection may be strong even if the infection was mild”.Also read: ICMR looks at private medical colleges to ramp up Covid-19 testing infraThe 29.1% number should be cause for some cautious celebration – just as Mumbai’s 57% (in slums), and Pune’s 36%-65%, both the results of similar surveys, albeit with smaller samples should be. For it means almost a third of the Capital’s population has immunity against the infection, and will likely be protected when the second wave of infections emerges (that one will, is a given).Delhi has decided to conduct a sero survey every month (in the first week). It should also consider expanding the sample. Earlier this week, New York City published the results of 1.46 million antibody tests (yes, 1.46 million of a population of roughly 8.4 million, around 17.5%) that showed that while a disproportionate number of people in low-income neighbourhoods were exposed to the virus, far fewer people in the richer ones were. Overall, 27% of those tested were exposed to the virus – based on the presence of antibodies. That qualifier is important. This column has referred to a study from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden that showed that some people exposed to the virus develop T-cell based immunity, but do not test positive in antibody tests. Also read: Front-line workers must be vaccinated first, says reportAccording to the study (published in Cell), the number of people with such immunity is around double those who show antibodies. To be sure, the sample of the study was small (only 200), but this is a finding of phenomenal significance. And it could explain why Covid-19 infections appear to taper off when the proportion of those exposed to the virus reaches roughly 25% (again, this writer has put forth this hypothesis before, with a caveat that still holds – it needs to be studied). Interestingly, a mathematical model developed by researchers at the University of Nottingham and Stockholm University (it has been referred to in this column before, as have most things to do with Covid-19; this is, after all, instalment 137) argues that the herd immunity level for Covid-19 could be around 40%.Also read: Serum Institute registers its Covid vaccine trialHow reliable are antibody tests? From the perspective of assessing the prevalence of disease in a population, they are very reliable. Sure, they may not pick antibodies (which show up a few days into the infection) in some cases, but this only means a high false negative rate of 20-30%. A false negative means the test identifies someone who has been infected as uninfected. This means that such tests typically understate exposure (and therefore immunity) – which is always better than overstating it.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Last word: While Delhi’s sero survey results are good news, it is important that the state government and people guard against complacency. The latter would do well to maintain mask discipline and practise social distancing. And the former would do well to continue to test aggressively – using molecular tests such as the RT-PCR ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-7zf7dTQ9wDgKofYTEAL7kJ.html
21-08-2020||India||180 million PANs may be defunct without Aadhaar||At least 180 million permanent account numbers (PANs) could become defunct unless linked with Aadhaar numbers by the March 31 deadline, as the income-tax (I-T) department, which is equipped with artificial intelligence (AI), is all set to nab tax evaders who use multiple PANs and conduct high-value transactions, two officials said, requesting anonymity. The government may also track expenditure patterns of individuals who spend large sums on luxuries but underreport their income and evade tax, they said. The I-T law provides for a statement of financial transaction (SFT), earlier known as an Annual Information Return (AIR), to track prescribed high-value transactions undertaken by taxpayers. The department gets such expenditure details through banks, financial institutions, mutual funds, credit card companies, and other entities. “It is surprising that in a population of 1.3 billion only 15 million contribute to the I-T kitty. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also pointed this out recently. Available data suggest that there is an urgent need to expand the tax base,” one of the officials said. PM Modi unveiled India’s first charter of taxpayers’ rights and duties on August 13 and had appealed to the public to introspect on the fact that only 15 million people in a population of 1.3 billion pay income tax. The official quoted above said there are 509.5 million (50.95 crore) PAN cardholders in the country as on June, but only 64.8 million (6.48 crore) of them file income-tax returns (ITR), and only 15 million actually pay tax. “Around 49.8 million people file ITR. But they either show zero tax liability or claim the full amount of tax paid through ITR,” he added. A second official said some use multiple PAN cards to hide their high-value transactions and manage to keep themselves out of the tax net. “As a result, only 327.1 million PANs are linked with Aadhaar. More than one-third PANs could be under the scanner unless linked with Aadhaar before March 31,” he said. Naveen Wadhwa, deputy general manager at Taxmann, a consultancy, said: “ If PAN is not yet linked with Aadhaar, there is a possibility to obtain multiple PANs. Once a PAN is linked with an Aadhaar, it will not be possible to obtain multiple PANs.” A PAN and Aadhaar linkage will help tax officials to keep a tab on tax evaders, the officials said. The government may expand the list of such high-value transactions that the I-T department tracks. According to the second official, the list may grow to include payment of education fee above Rs1 lakh annually, consumption of electricity above Rs1 lakh per annum, domestic air travel in the business class, purchase of jewellery or white goods above Rs1 lakh, payment of property tax above Rs20,000 per annum, life insurance premium above Rs50,000 and health insurance premium above Rs20,000. However, these details will be collected from the third party only and taxpayers would not be required to provide expenditure details in their ITRs, the second official said. “The proposed move is to bring tax evaders into the tax net and not to harass honest taxpayers, as they are not required to file details of high-value transactions in their ITRs,” he said. Citing an example of a person paying Rs5 lakh per annum school fee, including donations, without paying any tax, the second official said, “By claiming that his income is not taxable he is trying to dodge the I-T system. Similarly, a person, who has made purchases of luxury items or spent sizeable amount on hotel bills, is a potential taxpayer.” Kapil Rana, chartered accountant and founder of HostBooks Ltd, a cloud-based accounting platform, said, “There is a possibility and proven cases, where multiple PAN numbers have been acquired fraudulently and used to evade tax.” Wadhwa said the proposed move of the government to expand the list of expenditure would not cause any incontinence to honest taxpayers. The government zeroes in on only those cases that manifest a larger gap between the returned income and expenditures, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/180-million-pans-may-be-defunct-without-aadhaar/story-7RgsRz2rOC4HctmaYh7yUO.html
21-08-2020||India||CWC to meet soon as clamour for Rahul Gandhi’s return as party chief grows||The Congress Working Committee (CWC) is expected to meet soon amid growing clamour for Rahul Gandhi to lead the party once again, people familiar with the development said. A Congress functionary said the party’s highest decision-making body will primarily deliberate on organisational matters and also discuss current political situation in the country. The proposed meeting assumes significance as Sonia Gandhi completed one year as the party’s interim chief on August 10. The party had then said that she will continue on the post till a new president is elected. Reports also suggested that many Congress leaders, including former chief ministers and Members of Parliament, have written to Sonia Gandhi seeking an early settlement of the leadership issue. Leaders such as Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari have demanded internal elections if Rahul Gandhi does not return to the post he gave up in May 2019, owning responsibility for the party’s rout in the general elections. The functionary quoted above said Sonia Gandhi, 73, is not ready to continue in the post and had agreed to be the party’s interim chief last year only on one condition that it will be a temporary arrangement. On Wednesday, the Congress dismissed Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s remark that she agreed with her brother that a non-Gandhi should become the party chief. The party claimed that millions of Congress workers want Rahul Gandhi to return as the party chief as he is suited best for the post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cwc-to-meet-soon-as-clamour-for-rahul-gandhi-s-return-as-party-chief-grows/story-RydJDfEl3MqCHUsSfsarCN.html
21-08-2020||India||In June, EPFO records 6.55 lakh net new enrolments||The Employees Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) saw a rise of 4.83 lakh new enrollments in the month of June, in comparison to the last month when 3.18 lakh people had joined the formal workforce, according to data released by the retirement fund body.In June, net new enrolments with EPFO rose to 6.55 lakh, according to its latest payroll data. Almost 50% of the new enrollments are in the age group of 18-2, according to the EPFO figures. The latest figures provided a perspective on employment in the formal sector amid the Covid-19 crisis. EPFO said that the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak had adversely affected the enrolments in the month of April and May 2020. However, in the month of April and May this year, around 0.20 lakh and 1.72 lakh net new subscribers were added to social security schemes of EPFO, despite the lockdown.The month of June has seen speedy recovery with addition of 6.55 lakh net subscribers, registering a remarkable 280 per cent month-on-month growth. The EPFO has been releasing the payroll data of new subscribers since April 2018, covering the period starting from September 2017.The data also showed that during September 2017-June 2020, the number of net new subscribers was around 1.63 crore.Meanwhile, the exits from EPFO subscriber base declined by nearly 33 per cent from 4.45 lakh in May to 2.96 lakh in June 2020. The number of members who exited and then rejoined, indicates switching of jobs by subscribers within the establishments covered by EPFO.This has also increased by approximately 44 per cent for the month of June over May 2020, with more subscribers choosing to retain membership by transferring funds rather than opting for final settlement.

21-08-2020||India||PM Narendra Modi, Prince Charles hail 25 years of iconic London temple||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prince Charles on Thursday joined British MPs, charity organisations and others to mark the 25th anniversary of the first Hindu temple in the western hemisphere: the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in London, which has become a centre of community events, worship and festivals over the years.Inaugurated on August 20, 1995, the temple in Neasden in the borough of Brent has been visited by several world leaders, including former US President Jimmy Carter. Modi visited the temple when he was the chief minister of Gujarat.Modi tweeted: “Neasden Temple marks its silver jubilee. The Temple has been at the forefront of many community service initiatives. It has brought people together and inspired them to work for humanity. When I was Gujarat CM, I had the honour of visiting the Temple”.Prince Charles issued a video message, recalling visiting the temple with his wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, during festivals. He said: “The first of its kind outside India, Neasden Temple serves the local community as a place of worship, learning, celebration, peace and community service”.The temple, built with pillars and stones intricately carved by traditional craftspeople in Gujarat and Rajasthan and shipped to London, is one of the most visited places in London by tourists from India and elsewhere.According to the temple’s history, its ground-breaking ceremony was held in July 1991, as almost 3,000 tonnes of Bulgarian limestone were shipped 3,900 miles to India along with 1,200 tonnes of Italian Carrara marble, which made its own journey of 4,800 miles.With a further 900 tonnes of Indian Ambaji marble, the over 5,000 tonnes of stone was hand-carved by more than 1,500 skilled artisans at 14 different sites around India into 26,300 pieces.Also Read: 55-year jail term for brother of Manchester terror attack bomberThey were then coded, packed and sent on their final 6,300-mile journey to London where each piece – the largest weighing 5.6 tonnes and the smallest only 50 grams – was assembled like a giant 3-dimensional jigsaw puzzle in two and a half years.MPs Dawn Butler and Gareth Thomas (both Labour) and Bob Blackman (Conservative) were among those hailing the anniversary of the temple, where leading politicians invariably join ‘arti’ and other rituals before elections to seek support of the community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-prince-charles-hail-25-years-of-iconic-london-temple/story-S2nUcXQcyILqI3AFMQatQP.html
21-08-2020||India||Don’t punish Prashant Bhushan in contempt case, says AG KK Venugopal||Attorney General of India KK Venugopal told the Supreme Court on Thursday that lawyer-activist Prashant Bhushan should not be punished for criminal contempt of court, in an unexpected twist to the proceedings even as the court reserved its judgment and gave time to Bhushan till August 24 to tender an unconditional apology for his tweets criticising it and Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde. During the hearing before a three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra, Bhushan stuck to his position saying speaking up was his duty as a citizen, refused to tender an apology, and indicated he was unlikely to change his mind. Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for Bhushan, cited the range of public interest causes Bhushan has been involved in. Also read| Prashant Bhushan case: Spotlight on AG’s role after hearingThe Supreme Court, on August 14, held Bhushan guilty of contempt of court for two tweets — the first, on June 27, where he was critical of the top court and the role of the last four chief justices, and, the second, on June 29, where he criticised the current CJI. The hearing on Thursday was to decide on the sentence to be imposed on Bhushan.Appearing in his personal capacity before the three-judge bench, Venugopal — whose consent was not obtained before the matter was taken up and who was not heard by the Supreme Court during the contempt hearings — said that while he is not seeking a review of the court’s judgment, the court should be magnanimous in not imposing any punishment on Bhushan.“I request your lordships not to punish him (Bhushan),” AG Venugopal said, adding that Bhushan had done a lot of public good.Also read: What KK Venugopal said in 1987 speechThe AG also attempted to draw the attention of the court to previous instances when judges of the Supreme Court have criticised the functioning of the court and raised concerns of corruption in higher judiciary. “I have a list of five judges of Supreme Court who said democracy has failed. I have a list of nine judges who said there is corruption in higher judiciary. Of these nine judges, two made statements while they were sitting judges and seven immediately after they retired. I myself gave a speech in 1987 at the Indian Law Institute…”The bench, however, cut short the AG’s arguments, stating that its judgment of August 14 will not be reconsidered and the AG should not make arguments on the merits of the case since the case had already been decided. The bench asked the AG to restrict his submissions to the sentencing aspect.“We are not on merits here. We are not hearing any review. Our judgment of August 14 stands,” justice Mishra said.The bench, which also comprised justice BR Gavai and justice Krishna Murari, maintained that it can show leniency only if Bhushan expressed regret and reconsidered his statement where he declined to apologise.Bhushan had prepared a statement which he read out to the court when the hearing of the case began on Thursday. He expressed dismay at the judgment of August 14, which, he said, arrived at a conclusion against him without providing any evidence of his motives. He said he stood by his tweets, and invoked Mahatma Gandhi’s stance in a case slapped against him by the colonial British government.“I can only humbly paraphrase what the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi had said in his trial: I do not ask for mercy. I do not appeal to magnanimity. I am here, therefore, to cheerfully submit to any penalty that can lawfully be inflicted upon me for what the court has determined to be an offence, and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen,” Bhushan said, reading out from his statement.The bench, however, said, “We can become lenient only if the person enters an apology in the real sense. Let us give him some more time to think over his statement.” Justice Mishra told Bhushan, “We can give you time to consider it. We will give you 3 to 4 days time to think about the statement made today.”AG Venugopal said that Bhushan was unlikely to change his stance, while Bhushan maintained that his statement was “well considered and thought out” and it was unlikely that he will make any substantial changes to it. He, however, said he would consult his lawyers and get back to the court. The role of the AG — the government’s most senior law official — has come into sharp spotlight in the case. The case itself has its genesis in a petition filed on July 9 by Mehek Maheswhari, an advocate. As per section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act and Rule 3 of Rules to Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of Supreme Court, a criminal contempt petition filed by a private individual can be heard by the court only if the petitioner has obtained the consent of the AG.Maheswari had not obtained such consent, which would have normally led to the registry of the court rejecting the petition outright without listing it before the judges. But the court proceeded suo motu (on its own) with the contempt case after the registry brought the petition to the notice of the court on the administrative side. The court listed the case for the first time on July 22 and issued notice to Bhushan the same day. The court also issued notice to AG Venugopal that day. However, when the case was heard on merits on August 5, the AG was not heard though he was present throughout the day-long hearing.The hearing on Thursday regarding sentencing also witnessed a repeat of the same, as the bench heard the AG only towards the end of the hearing and did not allow him to complete his arguments.Experts believe this is unusual. “There is a reason why the AG’s consent is required before a private individual can prosecute a criminal contempt case. It is a safeguard which ensures application of mind by an independent person because in a contempt case, the court is both the prosecutor and the judge. In this case, since the AG’s consent was not taken, they issued notice to him so that they could hear him in case they need his advice. In such cases, the AG acts as a guardian and a guardian has to act or speak only when called upon to act or speak. Therefore, the AG was seen but only heard almost at the very end,” senior counsel Sanjay Hegde told HT.Senior counsel Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for Bhushan, pointed to the activist-lawyer’s credentials and his contributions to the cause of public interest. He mentioned the coal mining case, the Odisha mining case, the case on removal of the Central Vigilance Commissioner, the 2G case, the police reforms case, the euthanasia case, the street vendors case, the Singur land acquisition case, and the RTI cases as Bhushan’s work. “All these cases are pro bono (work undertaken without charging fees). He has not received any advantage out of these,” Dhavan said.The court appreciated Bhushan’s work but said there are limits and boundaries to the freedom to criticise courts and judges.“We appreciate all your efforts in filing good public interest cases; we welcome all that. But there is a ‘lakshmana rekha’ (limit). Why do you cross it? You are part of the system. You forget it,” justice Mishra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-punish-bhushan-in-contempt-case-says-ag/story-8h4l3zSegrwtYd16Wb6tFI.html
21-08-2020||India||3 in 10 Delhi residents have antibodies against Covid-19: New sero result||Almost 30% of 15,000 people surveyed in the Capital had antibodies for the Sars-Cov-2, according to the second serological survey that suggests approximately 1.2 million people more may have silently contracted, and recovered, from Covid-19 between July and early August. The data showed that prevalence of the disease may be higher in women (32.2%) than men (28.3%), while the youngest age group (0-18) showed the highest rates of past infection (34.7%). Among the 18-50 age group, 28.5% had antibodies and for those 50, this number was 31.2%.Also read: ICMR looks at private medical colleges to ramp up Covid-19 testing infraThe data also indicated that the outbreak may be less deadly than previously feared, and that a large chunk of infections are going undetected by the existing testing mechanism in the Capital.  “It is relieving to know that around 29% of the city’s population has recovered after being infected by the coronavirus. On the other hand, 71% of people in Delhi have not developed antibodies, which means that they are still vulnerable,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain while releasing the results.“The people of Delhi are being very careful in taking precautions against Covid-19. So, this is a very positive development. It shows that the Covid-19 infection numbers are no longer rising exponentially in Delhi,” Jain said, while adding that the Capital “is heading towards herd immunity, but experts say that should be at least 40%”. Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe minister said the higher prevalence, which also indicates a larger proportion is now immune to the disease, does not mitigate the risks of resurgence. “We cannot rule out a second wave because only yesterday India saw the highest ever spike in daily fresh Covid-19 cases,” he added.A serological survey involves testing of blood for the presence of antibodies. The city has held two till now and the latest findings suggest the rate of silent spread has been slower than expected given that activity increased in recent weeks following the lockdown.The first such study, involving 21,837 people, was carried out in early July and revealed close to 23% had antibodies. This number corresponded to infections that took place over roughly 120 days, an average monthly infection rate of 5.7% of the population. The latest 6.2% figure for the month is only marginally higher. “We had expected that in the second sero survey the seroprevalence would increase considerably. But it has increased by around 6-7% since July,” said Jain.Also read: Serum Institute registers its Covid vaccine trialThe findings also underscore the challenge posed by the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which experts believe largely does not cause symptoms in those infected, but all infected people can pass it on to others. The July 10-August 7 period had roughly 33,500 confirmed infections, compared to the 1.2 million who may have actually had it if the survey findings are extrapolated. It also suggests that the infection fatality rate (IFR) – a measure of how many people will succumb to the disease from all infected person, not just known cases – was at 0.07%. The CFR, based on known cases, comes to about 2.7% for the Capital.Government officials said the latest findings that those under 18 had the maximum antibodies compared to other age groups and would play a crucial role in the Delhi government’s decisions on opening schools and colleges. Click here for complete coronavirus coverageChief minister Arvind Kejriwal, in his Independence Day speech on August 15, said that the government will not open schools until it is fully convinced about the city’s Covid-19 situation.Giving the district-wise break-up, the health minister said the south-east district has seen the biggest increase in people developing antibodies. The lowest increase was seen in north-east Delhi, which once had the highest number of Covid-19 cases.“Antibodies are found in high numbers anywhere between three and six months after the recovery of a patient. In the process, the person also develops T-cells because of which the chances of contracting Covid-19 again become extremely low,” Jain said.In the south-west district, 16.3% of the people have been found to have developed antibodies, which is the lowest of all the 11 districts in Delhi. The second-lowest was the New Delhi district (24.6%).A day after the high court directed the Delhi government to do a comparative analysis of the two serological surveys conducted in Delhi so far, the health minister on Thursday said the government will comply with the order.Jain said Delhi has a population of around 20 million and the findings of the latest survey suggest that around 5.9 million have contracted the Sars-Cov-2 virus and recovered from the disease. He pointed to subsequent spike in other nations to stress on the need to maintain precautions. “In Europe or the USA, numbers have started rising again. Our country saw the highest rise in cases at 69,000 cases. So, we cannot believe that coronavirus is over in Delhi,” he said. Jain said there was a time when the cases in Delhi were increasing by 4,000 daily and the test positivity ratio was 30%. “It is also reassuring to see that the positivity rate in Delhi has reduced to nearly 7%, which is much lower than the national average. The situation in Delhi is improving.” Charoo Hans, a former head of the microbiology department at Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, said if 71% of people are still vulnerable, it is quite a high number. “It suggests that the government should continue with its efforts on aggressive testing, contact tracing, surveillance, isolation, and providing good treatment. It also suggests that people should continue ensuring strict compliance with social distancing, wearing masks, washing their hands frequently, and following respiratory etiquettes. There is no room for any complacency,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-in-10-delhi-residents-have-antibodies-new-sero-result/story-PvMP8qgPhCmDNBnTKpGsRL.html
21-08-2020||India||India, Bangladesh to create new mechanism to monitor bilateral projects||India and Bangladesh will create a new mechanism to regularly review the progress of bilateral development projects, with five such ventures, including an oil pipeline and three cross-border rail links, set to be completed in 2021. The setting up of the high-level monitoring mechanism to review ongoing projects was discussed during foreign secretary Harsh Shringla’s meeting with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in Dhaka on Tuesday, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said. People familiar with developments said the monitoring mechanism will be jointly chaired by the Indian envoy in Dhaka and the Bangladesh foreign secretary. It will be on the lines of a similar mechanism India has created with Nepal, the people said on condition of anonymity. India’s developmental assistance for Bangladesh and connectivity and power projects were discussed during the meeting between Hasina and Shringla, who made an unannounced two-day visit to take forward the bilateral relationship. Shringla also delivered a message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Hasina. “Several of these projects, including the Rampal Maitree power plant, India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline, and rail links between Akhaura-Agartala and Chilahati-Haldibari and Khulna-Mongla rail line are expected to be completed next year,” said Srivastava. India also proposed that the next meeting of the Joint Consultative Commission at the level of the foreign ministers should be convened shortly to review the entire gamut of bilateral ties and the development projects, he said. India’s proposal to launch a travel air bubble between the two countries with limited flights for official, business and medical travellers was appreciated by the Bangladesh side, Srivastava said. The two sides also discussed the celebrations of the 100th birth anniversary of Mujibur Rahman in 2020 and 50 years of the liberation of Bangladesh and the establishment of diplomatic ties in 2021. India plans to issue a commemorative stamp on Rahman during Mujib Barsho and the two sides propose to hold joint events. India has also provided Covid-19 related assistance to Bangladesh and organised capacity-building courses for Bangladeshi medical personnel following the video conference of Saarc leaders and creation of the Saarc Emergency Response Fund. Bangladesh has committed $1.5 million for the fund. Also Read: Speakers’ conference: India asks international community to isolate Pakistan“In the last few years, India and Bangladesh have amicably resolved complex issues, including the land and maritime borders, and have taken several initiatives to boost connectivity and trade, including commencement of movement of Indian cargo from Agartala to Kolkata via Chattogram, expansion of the scope of the protocol that governs trade and transit on inland waterways, India’s gifting of 10 locomotives to Bangladesh, and introduction of parcel and container train services between the two countries,” Srivastava said. Shringla’s visit was useful in discussing specific initiatives in key areas of mutual interest and also reflected the priority that India accords to Bangladesh as part of its “neighbourhood first” policy, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-bangladesh-to-create-new-mechanism-to-monitor-bilateral-projects/story-I1f7uV1GrTKpFuD4m4onHM.html
21-08-2020||India||IMD’s heavy rainfall forecast accuracy improves to 70%||New Delhi: The Indian weather office has become more accurate on all four measures it uses to audit the accuracy of its predictions, the top government officer overseeing it said, adding that it got seven of every 10 forecasts of heavy rainfall right between 2017 and 2019, up from under five between 2002 and 2016 -- a change weather scientists attribute to superior weather models, better quality of input data, and more computing power. The so-called probability of detection (POD) used to forecast heavy rainfall has made a significant progress, said M Rajeevan, secretary, Union Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) at an Indian Meteorological Society lecture on Wednesday, going up from 45% in 2002-16 to 70% in 2017-19. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration describes POD as the number of accurate forecasts divided by the total number of events observed. “We are using the global forecasting system (GFS) at 12km resolution which is a very good model. We have also started with a probabilistic forecast which tells us which forecast would have more probability. This has given us much better skill and confidence. We are also providing good input for the model by using data from satellite, radar and ground data. To run the model we need higher computing power which has also been made available in recent years. The combination of all three have helped IMD improve,” DS Pai, senior scientist, India Meteorological Department (IMD)Similarly, the false alarm rate (FAR) has reduced from 42% to 32% over the corresponding period for heavy rain episodes during monsoon season. The four measures of forecast accuracy documented by IMD are false alarm rate, miss rate, probability of detection and critical success index (CSI).Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting company claimed it has 80% accuracy in forecasting heavy rain during monsoon. “We are around 80% accurate with heavy rain forecast. Our forecast system is also model based which is then improved on by our meteorologists. World over, forecasts are improving because data points are increasing. We have around 7000 automatic weather stations for surface data,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology at Skymet Weather.HT couldn’t independently verify the claims of both IMD and Skymet. Apart from an overall improvement in forecast reliability, IMD scientists can now make monsoon rainfall forecasts for five days instead of three days when IMD launched its monsoon mission (in 2012). The mission, which involved an expenditure of Rs 400 crore involved IMD acquiring the capability to make accurate short-, medium-, extended- and seasonal-monsoon forecasts, critical in a country where much of agriculture is still rain-fed. “We can forecast with the same accuracy, but for five days now, as far as the short-range forecast for monsoon season is concerned,” Rajeevan said during the virtual lecture, which was attended by scientists from across the country. The first phase of the monsoon mission was completed in 2017. IMD and other teams from MoES are working on the second phase of monsoon mission , which is focused on extreme weather events and development of applications for various sectors such as renewable energy (solar and wind energy projects require accurate forecasts). agriculture and hydrology.For example, Rajeevan said IMD has already developed a percentile-based forecast of extreme weather. Similarly, IMD is coming out with 550 new automatic weather stations and state-of-the-art sensors for soil moisture and soil temperature detection. “These can help us understand landslides and help immensely with forecasts,” he added. Importantly, the weather office has now started issuing forecasts that look at impact and outcome. “I remember the 2013 Uttarakhand floods. We did forecast very heavy rain. But what does it mean for the common man? What action should he take when he has heavy or extremely heavy rain warning? The impact-based warning takes into account all these factors,” said Rajeevan.The MoES secretary, however, conceded that though the 25 June lightning events in Bihar was predicted by IMD and Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), several people still died because of the natural disaster.Independent experts maintained that more long-term data is needed to measure improvements in making accurate predictions. “These three years are not sufficient enough to judge improvement in forecast skill. There is a method called hind-cast verification. Where you run the current model for earlier years and generate the skill score ...,” said a climate scientist who spoke on condition of anonymity.Meanwhile, climate change is increasingly making a prediction of extreme rain and seasonal forecasts a difficult proposition. In an article, co-authored by Rajeevan, published in Nature in 2015, titled: “Rethinking Indian monsoon rainfall prediction in the context of recent global warming,” the authors said: “Despite enormous progress having been made in predicting ISMR (Indian summer monsoon rainfall) since 1886, the operational forecasts during recent decades (1989–2012) have little skill. Here we show, with both dynamical and physical–empirical models, that this recent failure is largely due to the models’ inability to capture new predictability sources emerging during recent global warming.” “Some extreme rain events pull up or down the average leading to deviation from the seasonal forecast. We have seen it happening,” the MoES secretary said.“Undoubtedly, the overall weather forecasting accuracy in India has improved in recent years and a 70% POD of heavy rainfall events during 2017-19 is impressive considering challenges associated with the prediction of tropical rainfall. However, verifying forecasts for more years in the past (such as 10 years) is essential since it will add to the robustness of results and eliminate any statistical biases due to below average seasonal rainfall in 2017 and 2018. In addition, exploring other skill scores and regional biases in them will help in further improving forecasting capabilities,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at University of Reading, United Kingdom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-s-heavy-rainfall-forecast-accuracy-improves-to-70/story-6iTyJQt1KKMUj4C7xKEZdI.html
21-08-2020||India||Haryana to approach Centre, President over pvt sector job quota||Haryana’s deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said on Thursday he will follow up with the Union government and the President the issue of approval for the state’s ordinance that reserves 75% of private sector jobs for those who belong to the state.The remarks came after Haryana governor decided to send the ordinance to the President, a move Chautala said was the governor’s prerogative. “However, we will be tabling a Bill, a replica of the ordinance to provide 75% reservation to local candidates in private jobs, during the assembly session starting on August 26,’’ said Chautala who holds the portfolio of labour and employment department as well. The governor’s move to reserve the ordinance for the consideration of President is being seen as a setback for Chautala whose Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) made a poll promise to implement the quota. Chautala though on Thursday said the development will not have any impact on JJP’s relations with its coalition partner, the BJP. “The proposed law has a clause which gives it an overriding effect over other laws. Probably, that’s why it was sent to the President,” Chautala said. The Law secretary had advised that the proposed law be reserved for the consideration of the president as its section 23 gave it an overriding effect over other laws and has the potential to be repugnant to an Act of the Parliament. The second aspect was that provision providing for preference in jobs to the local candidates domiciled in Haryana seemingly was in contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution pertaining to equality before law and Article 19 (1)(g) which provides for protection of certain rights to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. Asked about the move of the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh to provide public employment only to local candidates, the deputy chief minister said that the constitutional barriers cannot be overlooked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-to-approach-centre-prez-over-pvt-sector-job-quota/story-KGj7XRYE2c7MReeiKINK3H.html
21-08-2020||India||Pak wanted Davinder Singh to find contact inside MEA: NIA chargesheet||Davinder Singh, the dismissed Jammu and Kashmir Police deputy superintendent of police (DSP), not only played a key role in providing safe passage to the terrorists and leaking information about the deployment of Indian security forces, but also hid Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) terrorists in the J&K police’s guest house a day before his arrest, according to the charge sheet filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) last month. The charge sheet, exclusively reviewed by HT, states that apart from the Hizbul Mujahideen, Singh, 59, was in touch with the Pakistani establishment through Shafkat Jatoi alias Hussain , an officer of Pakistan high commission in New Delhi through secure messaging platforms. Revealing Singh’s closeness to the Pakistani official, NIA’s charge sheet says that Singh saved the mobile number of Shafkat Jatoi as “Bhai Pak” . Shafkat was using Singh to gain some access to other arms of the government and tasked him (Singh) to find a contact in the ministry of external affairs (MEA), NIA adds. Singh was arrested on January 11 this year when he was ferrying HM Commander Syed Naveed Mushtaq alias Naveed Babu, an advocate, Irfan Shafi Mir, and another terrorist, Rafi Ahmad Rather, from Shopian to Jammu -- in his car. He had done this before, NIA adds, commenting that people like Singh have played a “crucial” role in making HM one of the region’s most active terror groups. The charge sheet, filed on July 6 in a special court in Jammu, claims that Singh transported Naveed Babu with another HM militant in February 2019 from Shopian to Jammu and later back to Shopian in April same year. “His ( Singh’s) level of commitment in the execution of conspiracy is established by way of the fact that he harboured the HM militants – Babu and Rather on January 10 (a day before they were arrested this year) in a guest house meant for stay of J&K police personnel -- by making forged entries in the records of the guest house,” the charge sheet says. The location of guest house is not mentioned in the charge sheet but Singh, Mir, Babu and Rather left Shopian for Jammu on January 11. It adds that Naveed Babu once asked Mir to confirm from Singh as which social media and messaging platforms they should use to avoid surveillance by Indian agencies. Mir, who enjoyed clout with the HM leadership and Pak’s spy agency ISI, was using the official position of Singh for collection of information about the deployment of security forces, and engaged in getting arms and ammunition for further supplying to the active militants in the valley, the NIA charge sheet says. “The evidence on record reveals that Singh was in constant touch with Irfan Mir for providing all kind of support including supply of arms and ammunition for which he was receiving funds at different point of time,” it adds. For supplying arms, Singh used to receive money from Mir and another HM operative Syed Irfan Ahmad. It was Mir who had introduced Singh to Naveed Babu and Pakistan high commission officials. The NIA has stated that Mir became part of conspiracy to help Naveed Babu further the agenda of HM sometime in June-July 2018 in the valley. During his four trips to Pakistan since 2016, Mir met HM chief Syed Salahuddin, the terror group’s operation head Khurshid Alam and several ISI officers according to the charge sheet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/davinder-hid-hizbul-terrorists-nia-charge-sheet/story-SKjT5YUNwCRV8HYv8sj7LO.html
21-08-2020||India||Manjhi’s HAM(S) exits Oppn coalition||PATNA: The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), led by former Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, announced on Thursday its decision to leave a five-party opposition coalition that includes the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD).The party, also known as the HAM(S), did not announce as to whether it would contest the upcoming Bihar assembly elections — due in October-November — alone or become part of some other alliance. “HAM is no longer a part of the grand alliance. The party’s executive committee has authorised Manjhiji to take a call on the future,” party spokesperson Danish Rizwan said. “Politics is full of probabilities and possibilities,” he added. Manjhi, a former leader of Bihar’s ruling Janata Dal (United), quit the party in 2015 after he was forced to step down as the chief minister to make way for the return of Nitish Kumar to the post. He later formed the HAM(S) and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA). With Kumar returning to the NDA in July 2017, Manjhi quit the alliance and became part of the opposition grouping. HAM(S) unsuccessfully contested three Lok Sabha seats in 2019 general elections. HAM(S) leaders indicated that Manjhi could return to the NDA. “The party has laid no pre-conditions on seats,” said a senior party leader who did not want to be named. BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said the grand alliance “mistreated” Manjhi. “They didn’t pay adequate respect and even ignored his phone calls. He was feeling down and out — which ended in him quitting the grand alliance,” he said.Manjhi has a big following in the Maha Dalit and Dalit communities, which form 16% of Bihar’s population of 104.1 million as per the 2011 census.The HAM(S) issued an ultimatum to its alliance partners — the RJD, Congress, Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) and Bollywood set designer Mukesh Sahni’s Vikassheel Insan Party (VIP) — for the formation of a coordination committee by June 25 to begin seat-sharing talks, according to Rizwan. Though there were some efforts by the Congress to broker peace, the panel was not formed, he added.Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee president Madan Mohan Jha said: “It is an unfortunate development. He was getting his due respect but it seems he did not learn from his earlier experience about the treatment meted to him...(by the NDA).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manjhi-s-ham-s-exits-oppn-coalition/story-09CyBqXRO0YfrqiPmDIArO.html
21-08-2020||India||Girl raped, killed by sibling, three friends in Jaipur||The police charge sheet in the gang rape and murder of a 10-year-old disabled girl in Jaipur on May 17, filed Thursday, has revealed horrific details, about how she was kidnapped by her own brother (20 years old) and raped by him and three of his friends, and then killed. Sulesh Choudhary, additional deputy commissioner of police ( organized crime) in Jaipur City, completed investigation into the case. She was additional SP in Jaipur Rural when she investigated the case under Manoharpur police station.“During investigation, we found that the brother of the victim, who is the prime accused in the case, hated his sister because he thought that she was a burden on the family. She was dependent on the family for everything. The statements of neighbours and other relatives show that he preferred to be out of house most of the time to avoid seeing her,” the police officer said.The family is from Uttar Pradesh and worked at a brick kiln in Jaipur. “On May 17, the victim was very happy as her mother had got her a new pair of jeans and a T-shirt. In the evening around 4.15pm, the brother along with his three friends, all between 18 and 20, kidnapped her,” Choudhary said. She added that the accused confessed to watching pornography on a mobile phone during the act. The family registered a missing person complaint the following day. In the evening, police found the body. Choudhary said that the police traced the locations of the mobile phones of neighbours and family-members at the approximate time of the crime. One phone was present near the scene of the crime -- it belonged to a friend of the girl’s brother. When he was interrogated, he confessed to the crime, and named three others, including the brother of the girl. The accused were arrested on May 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/girl-raped-killed-by-sibling-three-friends/story-cf3jsVa7Pb202UKjr0pMWN.html
21-08-2020||India||Bihar polls may cost Rs 625 cr, one fifth of funds for Covid-19 preparations||The upcoming Bihar Assembly polls, the first such exercise in the country to be held amid the Covid-19 pandemic, will cost the state exchequer an estimated Rs 625 crore, more than double the amount spent to hold the last state polls in 2015, and one-fifth of the total amount is estimated to be spent in ensuring safety arrangements for voters and polling personnel at booths as per guidelines to be issued by the Election Commission soon, officials in the state election department have said.Compared to the 2015 polls, when around Rs 270 crore was spent on the exercise, there will be an estimated increase of 131.48% in the expenses of holding elections this year, thanks to the raging pandemic.Also read: Curbs at rallies, booths likely in first Covid-19 pollsThe expenditure for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections was Rs 535 crore, as per state government records.While the cost of holding Lok Sabha elections is borne by the central government, respective states foot the bill for holding Assembly elections.According to officials familiar with the matter, the drastic rise in poll expenses this time is on account of safety measures like purchase of PPE kits for six lakh polling personnel, besides gloves and masks, and sanitizer for voters before they enter the booths.The Election Commission of India (ECI) is also considering other proposals for safety of electors, including putting circles outside the booths where voters would be asked to stand before casting their vote to ensure social distancing.Also read: Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM-S exits Grand Alliance ahead of Bihar assembly pollsThe expected expenditure on transportation of polling personnel and central armed police force (CAPF) is another factor for cost escalation. “This time, requirement of buses, trucks, SUVs and other vehicles will be much higher than previous elections to ensure there is no crowding inside vehicles ferrying polling personnel,” said an official engaged in poll preparations.“This time, counting centres will be much bigger so that polling agents and poll personnel can maintain proper social distance during the counting process,” he said.The increase in number of booths by 45%, with creation of 33,797 auxillary booths apart from 72,727 booths to cap the number of voters to 1000 or below in each booth for maintaining safety norms, is another reason behind cost escalation, sources said.Bihar has a total 243 assembly constituencies.“There is an assessment that Rs 2 crore-plus per assembly constituency would be spent on election-related activities. Besides, an additional Rs 125 crore will be spent on purchasing safety gears and implementing various measures for social distancing. The figure can even go up,” said the official.The assessment of high cost to be incurred in the coming polls is also reflected in the budget 2020-21. While the initial budgetary provision for the state’s election department in this year’s budget was Rs 627 crore, an additional allotment of Rs 250 crore was made in the recently approved supplementary budget by the state government, based on the election department’s revised cost estimates.This means the state government has made a total budgetary provision of Rs 877 crore, of which Rs 122 crore has been provisioned for payment to central security forces to be engaged for poll duty.Bihar’s chief electoral officer H R Srinivasa refused to comment on the projected cost of Rs 625 crore. “Sufficient budgetary provisions have been made for the election expenditure. We have adequate funds,” he said.Principal secretary (finance) S Siddharth said the state election department had been allotted funds as per demand for conduct of polls. “ The state government has made additional allotment in supplementary budget for election purposes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-polls-may-cost-rs-625-cr-one-fifth-of-funds-for-covid-preparations/story-SKRgydDHmGv2MFc0aFl81L.html
21-08-2020||India||Swachh Survekshan 2020: Indore ranked cleanest city fourth time in a row||Madhya Pradesh’s Indore has been ranked India’s cleanest city for the fourth consecutive year by Swachh Survekshan 2020, the central government’s annual cleanliness survey to promote sanitation in urban centres under the Swachh Bharat Mission. The findings were released on Thursday.While Indore ranked first among cities with more than one million population, Patna in Bihar was ranked the lowest at 47.Surat in Gujarat and Navi Mumbai in Maharashtra were ranked the second and third cleanest cities, respectively. In the category of cities with a population of less than 100,000, Karad won the first position, followed by Saswad and Lonavala. All three are in Maharashtra.  The survey’s findings were based on assessments by field officers and citizens’ feedback on garbage disposal, open defecation free ratings, functionality and maintenance of community toilets and safe management of faecal sludge from the toilets and ensuring that no untreated sludge is discharged into open drains or water bodies.Also read| Swachh Survekshan Awards 2020: List of winning citiesChhattisgarh was ranked the cleanest state of India in the category of states with fewer than 100 urban local bodies (ULBs) category. Jharkhand was adjudged the cleanest state of India in the above 100-ULBs category. Among cantonment boards, Jalandhar was rated the cleanest followed by Delhi and Meerut. The announcement of this year’s rankings was delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the ministry of housing and urban affairs said. The survey, performed in January before the lockdown to curb the outbreak, was completed in 28 days, covering 4,242 cities, and saw the participation of 18.7 million citizens. “When the Swachh Bharat Mission- Urban (SBM-U) was launched in 2014, it was with the objective of making urban India 100% open defecation free (ODF) along with 100% scientific solid waste management. With no concept of ODF in urban areas and solid waste processing standing at a mere 18%, it was clear that an accelerated approach was necessary if the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s dream of a Swachh India was to be achieved within the time-frame of five years ,” housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Puri said at a virtual press conference on Thursday. Also read: Indore India’s cleanest city, Surat and Navi Mumbai bag 2nd, 3rd spot“A framework was therefore needed to bring about rigour in the progress in monitoring and a spirit of healthy competition amongst states and cities to improve their performance in key cleanliness parameters. It was this underlying thought that led to the conceptualization and subsequent implementation of Swachh Survekshan (SS), a competitive framework to encourage cities to improve the status of urban sanitation while encouraging large-scale citizen participation,” he added. Every year, cities and towns across India are awarded the title of “Swachh Cities”’ on the basis of their cleanliness and sanitation drives as a part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission) that was launched in 2014. “Overall, I feel, the Survekshan assessments have been very holistic addressing different categories of cities and also including and acknowledging different city models on waste and sanitation. The focus has been on sustainable management and interventions and maximum citizen participation,” said Swati Singh Sambyal, a Delhi-based waste management expert and former programme manager , environmental governance (municipal solid waste), at the Centre for Science and Environment. Sambyal said the waste generation had increased manifold as the cities battle the pandemic and wondered how things may change in the next Swachh Survekshan. “How do we address behaviour change at the same time strengthen waste management,” Sambyal added.The ministry of housing and urban affairs is the nodal agency for the Swachh Bharat Mission, conducted its first survey in 2016, ranking 73 cities (urban local bodies). To expand the coverage, the ministry conducted its second survey the following year, ranking 434 cities. In Swachh Survekshan 2018, the scale increased to 4,203 cities.In the 2019 Swachh Survekshan 4,237 cities were covered.“Mainstreaming of informal waste workers, provision of social security schemes and safety gears to all sanitation workers, dignity and recognition and welfare of sanitation workers and their families was accorded due importance” in the latest survey, Puri said. He added that the survey team visited over 58,000 residential and over 20,000 commercial areas covering over 64,000 wards – all in 28 days.“I think if the methodology is expanded to include processes in the full cycle of waste {generation and disposal} , and not merely outcomes, we can get a more holistic picture of the Mission. Repeated winning by some of the cities also indicates that the competition can improve if the methodology is fine-tuned,” said KT Ravindran, urban planning expert and former chairman of Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC).This year, the ministry also introduced a new category called Ganga Towns, ranking the cleanliness of towns situated along the river’s banks. Among them, it ranked Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh the cleanest of towns with a more than 100,000 population and Kannauj, also in UP, the first among towns with population of 50,000 to 100,000. “We have gone through the methodology of the survey conducted this year thoroughly and we really believe there has been a vast improvement in the methodology from the past few years. When they started with the survey a few years back ,they focused only on doorstep collection of waste. Now the focus has grown from that to the process of waste collection and recycling. What is even better is the emphasis this is year is also on landfills and how to minimise them. They have not only included solid waste but also liquid waste management. The indicator have improved tremendously and now the cities should work on them,” said Sunita Narain, director general of the Centre for Science and Environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indore-ranked-cleanest-city-fourth-time-in-a-row/story-YJNbYNKLNeyXVYOYMGHPAO.html
21-08-2020||India||In talks with China, India emphasises ‘outstanding issues’||New Delhi/Beijing India and China were unable to bridge their differences on the disengagement and de-escalation process along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) during diplomatic talks on Thursday, with New Delhi emphasising the need to resolve “outstanding issues” speedily. People familiar with developments during the meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs dismissed an assertion in a readout from the Chinese foreign ministry that the two sides had “positively evaluated the progress” in the disengagement process. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a virtual media briefing the two sides will continue to work towards “complete disengagement” on the LAC. He added: “In this context, they agreed to resolve the outstanding issues in an expeditious manner and in accordance with existing agreements and protocols.” The WMCC meeting was co-chaired by joint secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry and Hong Liang, director general of the boundary and oceanic department of China’s foreign ministry. This was the body’s fifth virtual meeting since the standoff along the disputed border emerged in the open in May. The people cited above, speaking on condition of anonymity, rejected the Chinese foreign ministry’s assertion that the two sides had “positively evaluated” the progress in disengagement of troops at friction points on the LAC. “That’s their assessment. It isn’t our assessment,” said one of the people. “The disengagement process is a work in progress and more needs to be done.” The people pointed to the external affairs ministry spokesperson’s comments on August 14 about “some progress” being made in the disengagement process, and that translating the principles of disengagement on the ground is a “complex process that requires redeployment of troops by each side towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the LAC”. This, they said, continues to be India’s position. Spokesperson Srivastava characterised the discussions during the WMCC meeting as “candid and in-depth” and said the two sides “reaffirmed that in accordance with the agreements reached between the two foreign ministers and the two Special Representatives (SRs), the two sides will continue to sincerely work towards complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC in the western sector”. He added, “The two sides were in agreement that restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas would be essential for the overall development of bilateral relations.” The two sides acknowledged the need to maintain close communication through diplomatic and military channels to ensure complete disengagement, and agreed to continue ongoing engagements, including the meetings of WMCC, he said. The Chinese foreign ministry’s readout, issued in Mandarin, said the two sides reviewed the situation in the border areas and “positively evaluated the progress made in the disengagement of the frontline forces of the two countries”, and had a frank and in-depth exchange on “remaining issues on the ground”. The two sides “agreed to earnestly implement the consensus reached by the two countries’ foreign ministers and Special Representatives on border issues, continue to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels, promote further relaxation and cooling of the Sino-Indian border situation, properly handle remaining issues on the ground, and jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas,” the readout added. Experts believe India now has no other option but to prepare for deploying thousands of troops along the LAC during the winter as several rounds of talks at the military and diplomatic level haven’t led to the restoration of the status quo as it existed in April. Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the University at Albany, said: “It’s been over 100 days since the first clashes at Pangong Tso and more than two months since the Galwan clash. While modest progress has been made, and it is a good sign both sides are talking, the reality is India shouldn’t expect talks will achieve much.” India’s strategy of having “more video teleconferences with various Quad countries is probably insufficient to change China’s cost-benefit calculus”, he said. “India can hope the nasty winter of eastern Ladakh might nudge China toward somewhat more disengagement, but it seems more likely Indian troops are facing additional long, cold months of forward deployments to prevent future Chinese land grabs,” Clary added. ...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-talks-with-china-india-emphasises-outstanding-issues/story-CQMeaWInzzvJaksS0OtINJ.html
21-08-2020||India||House panel calls Facebook execs on Sept 2||The parliamentary standing committee on information and technology has summoned representatives of social media company Facebook to appear before it on September 2 to present their views on the issue of safeguarding citizens’ rights and prevention of misuse of social and online news media . The summons come in the backdrop of the controversy that has erupted after a Wall Street Journal report that showed that Facebook’s top lobbyist in India recommended against taking down hate speech posts of a BJP leader on the ground that this could spoil the media company’s relationship with the government. The committee headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has also summoned representatives of the ministry of communications (department of telecommunications), ministry of home affairs and the representatives of the state of Bihar, union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and union territory of Delhi on September 1 to discuss the subject of suspension of telecom services/ internet and its impact. On the same day it will also hear the views of the representatives of news broadcasters Association, press Council of India and Prasar Bharati on the subject of ethical standards in media coverage. While the BJP has denied the allegations made in the WSJ report, its Lok Sabha MP Nishikant Dubey on Thursday wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker, Om Birla seeking the removal of Tharoor from the position of chairman of the standing committee on IT. Former union minister and BJP MP, Rajyavardhan Rathore has also written separately to the Lok Sabha speaker complaining against Tharoor. Dubey’s letter comes a day after he and Tharoor filed breach of privilege notices against each other following a disagreement over the Congress leader’s remarks on summoning Facebook India executives. In his letter to Birla, Dubey has said “speaking in ‘Spenserian’ English with a foreign accent does not give freedom to an individual to not only disregard our glorious parliamentary institutions/organs to meet his own political ambitions but also to abuse our constitution.” Rathore, who, like Dubey, is also a member of the IT committee said members have no issue on “summoning whosoever the committee feels needs to be summoned for the protection of the rights of citizens of our country” but added that the matter should be discussed in the panel first. Responding to the allegation leveled against Tharoor, the Congress said Dubey made “disparaging remarks” on social media over the decision to summon a panel meeting to discuss the alleged “misconduct” of Facebook. The Congress-BJP spat over the issue exacerbated when BJP’s IT cell head Amit Malviya alleged that Congress leader Manish Tewari “wrote a letter to Facebook management on 18th August, where he says that Facebook management can get in touch with his senior policy advisor Bharat Gopalaswamy in the USA”. “Can Indian MPs hire lobbyists in US masquerading as advisors? Whose interests do these US based lobbyists serve when they advise Congress MP Manish Tewari?” Malviya tweeted. Tewari shot back, “Reactions of both @BJP4India & @Facebook demonstrate that the @WSJ story has probably opened a can of worms. Employees at @Facebook are asking serious questions as to why hate speech rules were bent by @Facebook & overlap between government relations & businesses interests.” He also said, “Nothing demonstrates alleged collusion between certain elements @Facebook & certain elements in @BJP4India than tweeting of my letter to Facebook Senior Management sent-18th August 2020 in the evening by @amitmalviya. Who in Facebook gave letter to @amitmalviya without it being even formally acknowledged by @Facebook. “ He said Dr. Bharat Gopalaswamy is director of South Asia Centre at Atlantic Council and advises him pro bono on policy issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-panel-calls-fb-execs-on-sept-2/story-im7gyfwWXnpYtEpyGhzpgK.html
21-08-2020||India||Prashant Bhushan case: Spotlight on AG’s role after hearing||Senior advocates on Thursday expressed concern over Attorney General (AG) KK Venugopal not being heard in detail during the Prashant Bhushan contempt-of-court hearings in the Supreme Court.Venugopal, 89 — whose consent, which is otherwise required, was not obtained before the matter was taken up by the Supreme Court and who was not heard by the court during the contempt hearings — appeared in his personal capacity before the bench on Thursday and argued the judges shouldn’t impose any punishment on Bhushan. The activist-lawyer was found guilty of contempt of court for two tweets on August 14. “The Attorney General (AG) is the pre-eminent member of the Bar and generations of judges have known and understood the high constitutional authority of that office. The manner in which he was ignored for four-and-a-half hours during the conviction hearing and then interrupted repeatedly today by the presiding judge is a slight against the entire Bar. Under the Constitution, the AG doesn’t need anybody’s permission to appear -- the fact that the present incumbent is a gentleman should not be taken as a sign of weakness,’’ said senior advocate Gopal Shankarnarayanan, who was following the proceedings of the court.Other lawyers said they were glad that Venugopal spoke up on the matter and tried to argue against his sentencing. “I am relieved the AG has appeared before the court now, and has taken a stand which befits his position,’’ said senior advocate Anjana Prakash. “On the first hearing, he sat there for four hours and he wasn’t heard,’’ said Dushyant Dave, senior advocate and one of the lawyers appearing for Bhushan. In court, Dave cited the Contempt of Court Act of 1972, which makes it mandatory for the AG to give his consent to a contempt petition in writing. Also read: Law has to be fair and balanced: Congress on Prashant Bhushan contempt case“I requested the court twice to hear him but they didn’t,’’ said Dave. “Fortunately for the country , the AG made himself heard but the way they treated him was a grave miscarriage of justice. Mr Venugopal is one of the most respected, knowledgeable and wise lawyers in the country today. Any court would have deferred to his assistance and advice.’’Venugopal has been practising since the 1950s and was appointed additional solicitor general by Prime Minister Morarji Desai after 1977. He was appointed AG in 2017. When the single-page order in the case heard by the justices Arun Mishra, BR Gavai and Krishna Murari was published on Thursday evening, the record of proceedings mentioned all lawyers who appeared but for Venugopal.Senior advocate Chander Uday Singh, who was appearing for activists such as Aruna Roy in the case, contended that the bench did not give Venugopal a fair hearing. “I think it was improper of the court of having called the AG, having issued him notice, not to give him fair hearing,” Singh said. In court on Thursday, the three-judge bench cut short the AG’s arguments and said its judgment of August 14 will not be reconsidered, and that the AG should not make arguments on the merits of the case. The bench later gave Bhushan 3-4 days to reconsider his stand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhushan-case-spotlight-on-ag-s-role-after-hearing/story-KcQe0VtBKXxNgIPHBl1zPP.html
21-08-2020||India||What KK Venugopal said in 1987 speech||On Thursday, the Attorney General of India, KK Venugopal, during a hearing in the Supreme Court on the Prashant Bhushan contempt matter, said that Bhushan should not be punished. He then referred to critical speeches about the judiciary made by some former judges, and mentioned a 1987 speech he had delivered on the judiciary — before the three-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra told him that it would not reconsidering its judgement (the bench has already held Bhushan guilty) and that the AG should not make arguments on the merits of the case.What then was the 1987 speech that Venugopal was referring to? While the exact text of the speech is not available, in a separate speech in 2002, while calling for a National Judicial Commission, Venugopal mentioned the issue of corruption in the judiciary. Then, too, he went back to his 1987 speech, which, he said, was delivered during a discussion organised by the Bar at the Indian Law Institute. Quoting from that 1987 speech, he said: “However, like distant thunder, we start hearing rumours of corruption, nepotism and favouritism entering the portals of the courtroom as well. The subject is taboo and like the Chinese monkeys, one does not see, hear or speak of this evil; but if there is a likelihood of this nightmare ever becoming a reality, then it is necessary to hunt down the causes and neutralise the same before it becomes a reality.” In the 2002 speech, Venugopal went on to then quote retired SC chief justices who, too, had flagged the issue of corruption in the judiciary. Thirty-three years after Venugopal made a speech which had more than a hint of criticism of certain tendencies in the judiciary, as AG, he pointed to it to suggest to the court that it should review its approach to the current case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-venugopal-said-in-1987-speech/story-GoFZ2pnBdc209yZhv34sSO.html
21-08-2020||India||Farooq Abdullah holds 1st meeting of leaders after Article 370 move||National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah met senior party leaders at his residence at Gupkar Road in Srinagar on Thursday. The move came in the backdrop of the Jammu and Kashmir administration denying in court the NC’s contention that several party leaders were in illegal confinement at their homes.Abdullah said the meeting — the first at his Gupkar residence since the nullification of Article 370 on August 5, 2019 — was called to find out whether his party colleagues could come out of their homes.NC general secretary Ali Mohammad Sagar and former ministers Mohammad Shafi Uri, Abdul Rahim Rather and Nasir Aslam Wani attended the meeting. Baramulla MP Mohammad Akbar Lone, Anantnag MP Hasnain Masoodi and NC treasurer Shammi Oberoi, too, were seen entering the residence of Abdullah, the Srinagar parliamentarian.“Today, they came out from their homes and came here. I am hopeful this is not for just one meeting. They should now be free people,” Abdullah said, briefing the media.Abdullah also said all detained leaders should be set free. “...when all the leaders are set free, we will sit and discuss all the things, and then media will be briefed on future plans about J&K.” On July 13, Abdullah and his son, Omar Abdullah, filed a habeas corpus petition in the high court, contending that several NC leaders were being held in “brazen violation” of constitutional guarantees of the right to liberty.The party decided to convene Thursday’s meeting after the administration told the court that none of the 16 leaders, who the party said were in illegal confinement, were detained.“How sad that we have normalised this illegal detention! That we have to be “allowed” to meet freely in spite of the government claiming in court that none of these leaders are detained is a blot on Indian democracy & rule of law,” Omar Abdullah tweeted.An NC spokesperson said the party president chose to call “all the incarcerated leaders in batches of four to meet him at his residence” keeping in mind Covid-19 protocols and government advisories.As part of the programme, five other party leaders — Mubarak Gul, Choudhary Mohammad Ramzaan, Shameema Firdous, Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi and Basharat Bukhari —will call on the party president at his residence on Friday, the spokesperson said.The government nullified Article 370, which accorded special status to Jammu and Kashmir, last August and bifurcated the erstwhile state into two Union territories – Jammu and Kashmir with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one. As protests erupted in the wake of the announcement, several political leaders and activists including former chief ministers were detained as a preventive measure. While prominent politicians such as ex-CMs Farooq and Omar Abdullah have been released, about 20 leaders, including Peoples Democratic Party’s Mehbooba Mufti, are still in detention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farooq-holds-1st-meeting-of-leaders-after-art-370-move/story-8vLLn5Nc7EYULwCoyUOvOO.html
21-08-2020||India||Why Delhi sero survey findings do not mean you’re safe||Close to 1.2 million people more may have silently contracted the Sars-Cov2 virus between July and August, if the results from Delhi’s second round of antibody surveys are extrapolated. This suggests that while the city has turned a corner on its peak, and the impact of the disease appears to be less dire than previously thought, the outbreak is far from under control, and there is little scope for rules to be relaxed or people to become less cautious.Data released by the Delhi government showed 29.1% of the 15,000 people sampled in the beginning of August appeared to have antibodies for the virus, which means that they likely recovered from the disease and are immune to it for now. This proportion was 22.9% in the beginning of July.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said the findings indicate the city was inching towards the herd immunity threshold, but cautioned that a resurgence of the virus cannot be ruled out. “It is relieving to know that around 29% of the city’s population has recovered... but 71% of people in Delhi have not developed antibodies, which means that they are still vulnerable... We cannot rule out a second wave because only yesterday India saw the highest ever spike in daily fresh Covid-19 cases,” he said.The herd immunity threshold is a point in infection prevalence where the spread of a virus slows down as the proportion of immune population increases, but experts cautioned against pinning hopes on this just yet. Also read| 3 in 10 Delhi residents have antibodies for Covid-19: New sero result“The concept of herd immunity does not hold when you talk about natural infection. Herd immunity is calculated as 1-1/R0 only in the case of vaccine-induced immunity. In case of a natural infection, anyone who is infected also passes it on to others, which is not the case with vaccinations. So talking about herd immunity in this case, when we don’t have a vaccine yet, will be a mistake,” said T Jacob John, former head of clinical virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.R0 is the basic reproduction number of a virus, or the number of people each infected person can infect. This number can vary based on how people reduce or increase social contact. This fluctuation is noted as the effective reproduction number, or Rt, which for Delhi was estimated to be below 1 for over a month till August 10.Also read: ICMR looks at private medical colleges to ramp up Covid-19 testing infraIf Rt falls below 1, it means not every infected person is passing the virus on, which effectively begins to reduce the size of the outbreak. “As more and more people are getting infected, assuming you cannot get reinfected, the number of susceptible people is going down. So, if an infected person goes out, their chance of meeting someone who already had it is increasing, so it is now indeed harder to spread the disease than in March. But we cannot let the virus run through like wildfire in a forest, we have to let the slow burning continue,” said Bhramar Mukherjee, professor of epidemiology and the head of biostatistics at University of Michigan, which tracks state-wise Rt numbers for India. “Herd immunity may be achieved but cannot be actively pursued,” Mukherjee added. The numbers also underscore the scale of silent spread, which makes infection control harder. In the time when roughly 1.2 million silent infections took place, only 33,583 – or 2.79% -- were officially recorded.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayThis, Mukherjee added, makes it important for people to continue with precautionary measures, which are likely getting harder as fatigue sets in. “This is not going away very soon,” she said, adding that the public and authorities need to focus on a “survival and prevention strategy”. For this, she suggests, people could carry out some social contact while being careful. “Think of outdoor evening gatherings while maintaining social distancing, forming pods with families and friends who are self isolated and meeting them exclusively, washing hands, wearing masks, etc. All of this is part of our defence mechanism,” she said, adding that the stigma around a Covid diagnosis should also be fought so that people can be tested and treated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-delhi-is-not-out-of-woods-yet/story-deMbXCbBj5vMutMrT9uVBN.html
21-08-2020||India||Serum Institute registers its Covid-19 vaccine trial||The Serum Institute of India (SII) has registered for Phase II/III clinical trials on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine candidate, Covishield, being developed by Oxford University-Astra Zeneca, with the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI). The trials will be conducted on 1,600 healthy participants across India. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, is one of the 17 sites selected to conduct the trial-- a Phase II/III, observer-blind, randomized, controlled study, to check the safety and immune response of the Covid-19 vaccine candidate on healthy Indian adults. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The study is planned for a duration of seven months, and the date of first enrolment will be August 24, as reported to the CTRI. Serum Institute, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by number of doses produced and sold globally, has entered a manufacturing partnership with AstraZeneca to produce the vaccine, if and when it is approved for use. On August 3, India’s drugs controller gave approval to SII for conducting Phase II and III clinical trials of the vaccine candidate in the country. The trials will be overseen by Dr Prasad Kulkarni as the principal investigator for SII. Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayConfirming that the trial process has started, representatives of SII declined to reveal any more details on the development. The 17 hospitals that will be conducting these trials are Andhra Medical College, Visakhapatnam; JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research, Mysore; Seth G. S. Medical College and KEM Hospital, Mumbai; KEM Hospital Research Centre, Vadu; B J Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital, Pune; All India Institute Of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur; Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna; Institute of Community Medicine,Chennai; Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh; Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University Medical College and Hospital, Pune; Jehangir Hospital, Pune; All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Gorakhpur; Sri Ramchandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Chennai; TN Medical College & BYL Nair Hospital, Mumbai; Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Sewagram; and Government Medical College, Nagpur.

Institute ethics committee clearance is a mandatory criterion to begin any clinical studies in India. The vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold adenovirus taken from chimps and genetically modified. “The Oxford University-Astra Zeneca vaccine candidate seems like the best bet at the moment but the stages at which all these vaccines candidates are currently, it could go either way. There is always a possibility that none of these might eventually work out but that doesn’t mean there should not be any planning for procurement or distribution,” says Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India. Healthy participants, both men and women, selected for the trial are above 18 years of age. Those who are not eligible include people with acute illness with or without fever at the time of study vaccine administration, history of laboratory confirmed Covid-19 disease in household contacts or close workplace contacts, IgG seropositivity (antibodies) to Sars-Cov-2, history or currently positive for Sars-Cov-2 by real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR), history of severe allergic reactions after previous vaccinations or hypersensitivity to any component of study vaccines, any confirmed or suspected condition with impaired/altered function of immune system, and pregnant women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serum-institute-registers-its-covid-vaccine-trial/story-I7USDU7cfvIYYjUV2RK8sN.html
21-08-2020||India||Daily deaths best way to assess Covid-19 pandemic | Opinion||The release of antibody-based serological surveillance studies from Delhi and Pune have revealed high rates of viral dissemination in the urban populations. Delhi‘s recently completed repeat survey, which took place in July-August , reported that 28.3% of Delhi’s residents had tested positive for anti-Covid-19 antibodies. This indicated a rise from the previously reported figure of 23.4% a month earlier. A survey conducted during the same period in five highly affected wards of Pune reported a prevalence of 51.5%. A sewage sampling study, of viruses excreted in faeces, estimated that 6.6% of the population in Hyderabad were probably infected. Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here The exact number of persons infected, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, is uncertain as the antibody tests can yield false positive tests due to cross-reactive antibodies produced by other coronaviruses. The false positivity rates get amplified when mass surveys are done, due to variable rates of pre-test probability between the hospital cases and the general population (Bayes Theorem). To some extent, the false positives may be balanced by false negative results in persons who were infected early in the epidemic, as the antibody levels decline in about three months. Despite these uncertainties, we may assume that at a fifth of Delhi’s population may be already infected, if not a fourth. Even in other big cities, a far higher number of persons would have been infected than identified by viral testing methods (Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction and Rapid Antigen Tests). While debates continue on how short these numbers are from the herd immunity threshold, there are pertinent questions on how this information affects our reliance on some widely used statistical measures for tracking the course of the epidemic. Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe popular measure is for infectivity in the population R, expressed as Ro or Rt. The number provides an estimate of how many others are infected by an infected person. The number used in the initial part of the epidemic is Ro. This assumes that everyone in the population is equally susceptible and derives its estimates from the numbers of cases and deaths being reported. However, susceptibility varies over time as some people get infected and recover and are presumed to be no longer susceptible. So a different number (Rt) is used when the epidemic advances and estimates of numbers recovered are also available. Though this is called ‘effective R’ (Re) by some, the term Rt is more conventionally used. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage However, both these estimates of R are dependent on testing rates and other diagnostic criteria employed to identify ‘cases.’ Infected individuals who are asymptomatic and untested do not enter into these calculations. The antibody tests now tell us that these ‘missed’ numbers are far higher than conventionally identified cases. So, the total numbers of infected and recovered persons are very difficult to estimate and the reported statistics are at a far distance from the actual. The numbers of infected, untested and recovered persons will vary from location to location in the country, and even within a state or city. Therefore, we cannot even assume a uniform or constant ratio of diagnosed to undiagnosed persons who were infected and have recovered, from estimates provided by an antibody survey in a part of the population. A generally applicable ‘correction factor’ is not possible to use, given such variability from place to place and over time. So, how much reliance should we place on the estimated R (even when measured as Rt) when the epidemic is advancing? Also read: Covid-19 vaccine deals in the works with candidates, producers says Harsh VardhanThe value of R will vary with the freedom the virus has to move in a population. It is higher in a crowded location-- especially an urban indoor one. It will be lower in a rural area where people are more mobile and meet in open areas. To derive a single value for a state, with a collage of urban and rural populations, is untenable. The added uncertainty, of the numbers infected but untested, makes it even more imprecise to draw conclusions on the changing rates of infectivity in any state just based on estimated R values. The same problem arises with the ‘Doubling Time’, or ‘’Doubling Rate’, which has been popular on the social media. It has also been referred to by our officials to report progress. However, it must be noted that the US, where the epidemic has been raging, now has a doubling rate four times higher than India’s. That demonstrates the effect of the high cumulative base count. When the base count rises to a high number, its doubling time takes longer than when the count was low. Even if we consider only the time taken to add each increment of 100, 000 new cases, do we know how the numbers of infected but asymptomatic and untested persons changed in between? If the numbers of such persons are very high, as the antibody surveys suggest, how do we estimate the rates of increase in the actual numbers of infected persons? We will be painting a portrait looking only at changing shadows. What then can we measure to track deaths? A comparison of daily case counts is subject to variations in the numbers and types of tests, as well as the criteria employed for testing persons. The uncertainty is compounded by the false positives (‘dead viruses’) and the false negatives (modest sensitivity of RT-PCR and even lower sensitivity of Rapid Antigen Tests). In any case, there is likely to be a big gap between the measured daily case count and total number of persons infected on that day if we go by the surveillance estimates. We are left to depend on the one variable which is least subject to time-dependant variations in measurement methods. That is the ‘daily death count’ in a defined population. Is that count consistently falling? Or, how is a 7- day moving average of deaths behaving? Admittedly, there will be some undercounting of deaths. However, that proportion is unlikely to change over time. Even if the absolute numbers are short of the mark, time trends will be clearly discernible. We should try to improve the measurement of both in-hospital and out-of-hospital deaths, with clearly defined criteria for certification of death supplemented by ‘verbal autopsy’ techniques when needed. The cause of death assignment should not depend only on test results but also take into account the clinical history and any other investigations such as chest X-Rays or CT-scans. Even as we try to improve our measurement of Covid19 related deaths, the changes in daily death counts over time will be the best indicator for us to gauge whether the epidemic is waning in a city, district or a state. With deaths, we will not be questioning “what R we measuring?” The author, a cardiologist and epidemiologist, is president, Public Health Foundation of India.

21-08-2020||India||Kerala govt to fight privatisation move||The Kerala government, controlled by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI (M), on Thursday said it would explore legal options against the Union Cabinet’s decision to lease the Thiruvananthapuram airport, along with two others,to Adani Enterprises Limited of billionaire businessman Gautam Adani . After an all-party meeting on Thursday, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the state assembly will also pass a resolution opposing the move. “The all-party meeting decided to explore all options. We will not allow this to happen. We firmly believe {that} without the state’s consent nobody can take over it,” the CM said. The chief minister also wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi deploring the move on Wednesday, announced soon after a Union cabinet meeting in New Delhi. The cabinet meeting approved a proposal to lease out three airports run by the Airports Authority of India, in Jaipur, Guwahati and Thiruvananthapuram ,on a public- private partnership model.The state Congress unit has supported the Vijayan government, but Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has sided with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), saying that handing over the airport to a private entity would benefit growth in the Kerala capital. “My position on the airport has been consistent from the beginning itself and I stick to it. I am not a politician who says one thing to voters and something else afterwards for political convenience. The reality is that a private entity running the operations competitively is the only way the airport could flourish,” he tweeted.Pradesh Congress Committee chief Mullapally Ramachandran, however, said, “Congressmen can’t support the move to loot a public property by an industrialist close to PM Modi.” All India Congress Committee general secretary K C Venugopal also slammed the cabinet’s decision, calling it “a sell-out”. Responding to comments made by the Congress, civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri tweeted, “Make up your minds, my friends. By the way, do you remember what the Left said when you privatised Delhi & Mumbai airports?”The BJP, however, dismissed the state government’s opposition to the move. “One of the oldest airports of the country, it is in bad shape. The CPI(M) and Congress want to sabotage its development,” said BJP state secretary S Suresh. “The state was consulted on every occasion. It also participated in the bid. Now the CM is crying hoarse as investigating agencies are coming close to his office in gold smuggling case,” said minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedhran, criticising what he called a “new-found bonhomie between the Congress and CPI(M)”.He was referring to the seizure of 30 kg gold at the airport delivered in the name of an employee of the UAE consulate last month. The Airports Authority Employees Union (AAEU) has decided to move a petitioner before the high court against the federal cabinet’s decision. “Employees were not consulted by anyone at any stage,” said AAEU convenor S Ajith Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-govt-to-fight-privatisation-move/story-wVP6PZYPIvHGgtFzWYeWQL.html
21-08-2020||India||27.7% in Punjab’s containment zones have antibodies against Covid-19||A total of 27.7% people in Punjab’s containment zones were found positive for Covid-19 antibodies, indicating that they were infected by and had recovered from the novel coronavirus. The sero survey was conducted by the state health department in containment and micro-containment zones where the risk of people getting infected was very high. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The survey findings, submitted to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh during a Covid-19 review meeting on Thursday, showed the SARS-CoV2 antibody prevalence in containment zones was the highest in Amritsar district at 40%, followed by 35.6% in Ludhiana, 33.2% in SAS Nagar, 19.2% in Patiala district and 10.8% in Jalandhar. This was Punjab’s first exclusive sero survey, and was conducted in the five cont ainment zones from August 1 to 17, in a systematically selected random sample population of 1,250. The earlier surveys were more generalised and were conducted by the state governments in coordination with the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), the result of which were never released. For the Punjab survey, the selected containment zones had reported the highest number of Covid cases and were located one each in Patiala, SAS Nagar, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Amritsar districts. Also read| 3 in 10 Delhi residents have antibodies for Covid-19: New sero resultThe sample included 250 people from each zone, and from each selected household, one adult above the age of 18 years was randomly chosen for the survey. Overall, the seroprevalence of SARS CoV-2 antibodies was found to be 27.8% in the containment zones. “However, in the remaining parts of the cities, prevalence of SARS CoV-2 would be lower, and in rural areas, the prevalence would be much more lower than that in urban areas, as per the report of the survey, which was aimed at finding out the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgM/IgG) using rapid antibody testing kits,” said a government spokesperson. Can’t determine herd immunityThe Punjab government’s health advisory expert group chief Dr KK Talwar said not many conclusions should be drawn from the survey as it reflects the scenario only in containment zones and micro-containment zones. “This survey only shows us the results of our containment strategies. The herd immunity can only be determined by a state level survey of the general populace, which the ICMR is expected to start in all states this week,” said Dr Talwar.

21-08-2020||India||Kulbhushan Jadhav should get an Indian lawyer: Govt||India on Thursday insisted that Kulbhushan Jadhav, a former naval officer given the death sentence in Pakistan for alleged involvement in spying, should be represented by an Indian lawyer for filing a review petition to ensure a “free and fair trial”. The issue of filing a review petition in the Islamabad high court to challenge the death sentence given to Jadhav by a military court has run into trouble because of differences between the two countries on legal formalities. Islamabad has said only Pakistani lawyers and those entitled to practice in the country can be appointed to represent Jadhav. Asked about the issue during the weekly news briefing on Thursday, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said India is in touch with Pakistan through diplomatic channels on this issue. “For a free and fair trial in keeping with the letter and spirit of the ICJ [International Court of Justice] judgement, we have asked for Jadhav to be represented by an Indian lawyer,” he said. “However, Pakistan has to first address the core issues – giving copies of relevant documents of the case and providing unimpeded consular access to Jadhav,” he added. Earlier this month, the Islamabad high court directed the Pakistan government to inform India to appoint a lawyer for Jadhav, 50, so that he could file a review petition against his conviction. The court also directed the Pakistan government to again inform Jadhav of his rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the ICJ’s order of 2019 staying his execution and calling for a review of his conviction. A larger bench of the Islamabad high court is set to hear Jadhav’s case again on September 3. India has accused Pakistan of coercing Jadhav not to file a review petition and of not complying with the ICJ’s verdict. Jadhav was arrested by Pakistani security agencies in Balochistan in March 2016 and charged with involvement in spying. India rejected these allegations and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kulbhushan-jadhav-should-get-an-indian-lawyer-govt/story-asWNVWzpTbspxMDHRf3VXI.html
21-08-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccine agreements in the works with candidates, producers: Harsh Vardhan||Union health and family welfare minister Dr Harsh Vardhan spoke to Sanchita Sharma about when Covid cases will peak in India, whether Delhi and Mumbai have already crossed their peaks, a possible second wave of infections, the low fatality rate in the country, and India’s vaccine procurement plan, among other Covid-related issues. Edited excerpts:Have Covid-19 cases already peaked in metro cities such as Delhi and Mumbai? The current level of outbreak is showing a decline in new infections in both Delhi and Mumbai. This is also corroborated by the fact that hospital admissions of Covid-19 cases have come down. Moreover, the number of tests being offered continues to be high in these cities. Based on these evidences, it appears that the spread of Covid-19 has slowed down in these two cities. A big part of the credit goes to people practising precautions. Is a second wave expected? A second wave has not yet been observed with its prior intensity globally. This is a seven-month-old infection. We still have many gaps in understanding the natural history of the outbreak. So far, a few countries that were reported to have “controlled” the infection have reported smaller second waves in comparison to the first outbreak. It is still not clear whether the second wave of infection is smaller due to implementation of effective public health implementation and/or a proportion of people continuing to follow precautions. When are infections projected to peak across India, following which there will be a fall in new cases? It is difficult to predict. India is a large country, and the outbreak is heterogeneous in different states in terms of their vulnerability, the maturity of outbreak, and the number of confirmed cases. The outbreak is likely to peak at different points in different cities and states.Also read: Why Delhi is not out of woods yetAlso, different states are continuing to implement different measures for containment, and the proportion of people following preventive precautions differs in different places. All this makes it difficult to say when the outbreak will peak, and when a drop in new cases will occur. With multiple peaks, what is the strategy going forward? “Test, Track, Treat” will remain our strategy to move forward. When is India going to cross one million tests a day?India has rapidly upgraded its Covid-19 testing capacity and is very near to crossing the mark of one million tests a day. In last past 24 hours, 918,470 tests have been done. When we promised to take testing to 1 lakh a day by 31st May, we achieved the goal on the 10th of May. Just a few weeks ago, I promised to reach the one million mark in 12 weeks, but within three weeks, you can see the progress. We are working ahead of targets. The case fatality ratio (CFR) is under 2% and falling every day. What are we doing right on that front?CFR depends on the number of tests conducted, test positivity rate, improved management strategies, and the improved health systems responses. On charting the seven-day moving average of CFR, it is observed that there was an inflection point on 23rd June, when the crude CFR was noted to be 3.27%. Beyond this point, there has been a steady, almost linear trend of reduction in the CFR. The current CFR (on August 20) is 1.9%.Also read: What Delhi sero survey means | HT EditorialThe effective containment, aggressive testing with contact tracing and standardized clinical management protocols based on a holistic standard-of-care approach continues to result in a progressively reducing CFR and keep it well below the global average. Three India-made vaccines have entered advanced stage trials. If successful, by when will a vaccine be ready for use? Vaccine trials against Covid-19 are being fast-tracked globally. It is expected that the trials of India-made vaccines would be completed by the end of this year. We will know the efficacy of vaccines by then. The Oxford vaccine produced by Serum Institute of India is already being produced parallelly, so that the time required to market it will be reduced to a larger extent. The other two vaccines may require at least a month more to produce it and introduce in the market in a phased manner. It is expected that if the vaccine trial results are good, we could be ready to use the vaccine by the first quarter of 2021. Human trials of Covaxin, which has been developed and manufactured in Hyderabad by Bharat Biotech, started about two week back and it may be available by end of the year. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Serum Institute of India said it is ready to begin human trials in India this month and is hoping to have the AstraZeneca vaccine available by the year-end. ZyCoV-D from Zydus Cadila has started clinical trials with the first human dosing and is likely to complete clinical trials in few months. Several countries have preordered millions of doses of Covid-19 vaccines. What are India’s procurement plans? The details of the procurement plan are being developed by the ministry of health and family welfare, but it is important to note that India has the world’s largest vaccine manufacturing industrial base that provides two-thirds of childhood vaccines used across the world. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is collaborating with Bharat Biotech and has entered into an MoU that clearly states that priority will be accorded to provide vaccines, if successful, to the Government of India at an affordable and subsidised rate. A similar agreement is in the advanced stages of negotiation with the Serum Institute of India for three Covid-19 vaccine trials to be supported by ICMR. Serum institute and ICMR are to undertake the trials of Oxford vaccine and two others – one produced by Novavax-Serum and another by Serum Institute by itself. Once the results of Phase I and II will be available, the detailed contours of plan to roll out will be finalised. Who will be vaccinated first? Health care workers, front-line workers and vulnerable subgroups such as persons over the age 65 years and those with chronic morbidities will be prioritised. Then, depending on the number of available doses, a special drive to provide vaccines to all will be developed and implemented.Editor’s Note: A previous version of this article gave the incorrect name for the company Novavax.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-deals-in-the-works-with-candidates-producers-harsh-vardhan/story-62dsK6jUCrAV3GtNovpJUK.html

Gandhi, who was speaking to party workers in Chhattisgarh via video conference on the birth anniversary of his father and former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, said the he was mocked when he had warned about the impact of Covid-19 on the country’s economy, but his comments were proven to be correct.“… The people who are running small and medium industries will be destroyed after this lockdown and this country will not be able to give employment to its youth…You will see it… Just like when I said that coronavirus would have a severe impact on the economy, media laughed at me..Wait for six–seven months you will see this happening,” Gandhi said. He added that 90% of employment in India is generated by an unorganised economy. “Modi ji destroyed this system...one by one companies will fall and small and medium businesses will collapse which has already started…This country will not be able to provide employment to youth in the coming days. It will be for the first time in the Indian history, our country will not be able to give jobs to its youth because the small and medium business sector will be destroyed,” he said. Reacting to his remarks, senior Chhattisgarh Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and spokesperson Sacchinand Upsane, said: “ Rahul Gandhi is should first settle the problems of his own party and the states where his party is ruling. Secondly, the most of the problems which the country is facing is because of Congress party, and everyone knows this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-ll-be-no-jobs-in-a-few-months-rahul/story-SQ6TePLhCcv4qxmDLbd8iP.html

Tamil Nadu has clocked the best usage, completed 96% of the projects, followed by Uttar Pradesh which finished 88% of works. On the other hand, West Bengal has not completed a single project, the data shows. The rural welfare programme was launched in October 2014 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to develop model Gram Panchayats under the leadership of Members of Parliament (MPs). The project allows MPs to cherry pick a village to push development projects. So far, 1,418 Gram Panchayats have prepared Village Development Plans (VDP) with 72,720 projects. “But around 300 GPs identified under SAGY-II are yet to prepare VDP,” said a document of the rural development ministry. With 38% incomplete work and 17% plans not available, the progress of the scheme will be reviewed later this month by officials and experts. Adding to problems, official records also say that in 2014, the first phase of the programme saw adoption of 1,493 Gram Panchayats, but in the second phase with 2019, MPs adopted 348 Gram Panchayats, showing a sharp decline in the rate of adopting a village. A senior Opposition MP maintained that picking one village over another is always a tricky choice. “There is always a fear that residents of villages left out in the scheme would be upset. After all, only five villages can be adopted in five years.” Apart from West Bengal, Assam (25% work completed in each of these), Bihar (36%), Punjab (37%), Odisha (42%) and Maharashtra (44%) are the bigger states where large number of projects are pending. The rural development ministry has also identified that only 30% of utilization certificates or statement of expenditure have been shared by States/UTs till July 15, 2020. These documents are necessary for release of next instalment of funds and delay is submitting these proofs of expenses, further delays the work. The official document also points out that after the union rural development ministry asked the states to organize orientation programmes for MPs to make the scheme more successful, only 4 states/ UTs have done it. Along with the schemes such as cooking gas and electricity connections, rural housing and roads, the SAGY forms an important component for development of Indian villages. Officials emphasize that the scheme attempts to develop the value chain in rural India. Officials added that despite the difficulties in the scheme, there is no plan to shelve the programme. But the situation will be reviewed on August 28-29 to plug the loopholes and ensure a better delivery system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/63-work-under-model-village-scheme-over-tn-tops-the-list/story-ktqk91Tsl7BWZ68x3fwdmO.html
21-08-2020||India||68.7k fresh Covid-19 cases take tally near 3 million||India on Thursday reported a spike in new cases, with close to 70,000 (68,797 to be exact) coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positives taking the total number of cases to close to 3 million (29,02,178). Maharashtra continued to top the list of states with higher case load, as it saw a jump of 14,647 cases, which is the highest in weeks. Andhra Pradesh has been a close second with 9393 new cases, followed by Karnataka with 7,385 cases.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Of the 981 deaths reported from across the country in the corresponding period, maximum deaths were also reported from Maharashtra (326), followed by Tamil Nadu (116) and Karnataka (102). On the positive side, more patients are recovering, and being discharged from hospital and home isolation (in case of mild and moderate cases), with India’s total Covid-19 recoveries having reached nearly 2.1million (2,154,879) as on Thursday, of which new recoveries are 61,221.According to the Union health ministry, improved recoveries have been made possible because of effective implementation of the policy of testing aggressively, tracking comprehensively and treating efficiently.Also read: Covid-19 vaccine deals in the works with candidates, producers, says Harsh Vardhan“Focus on standard of care protocol including use of non-invasive oxygen, better skilled doctors in the Intensive Care Units and hospitals, and improved ambulance services has culminated in yielding the desired results,” health ministry said in a statement on Thursday. India’s recovery rate amongst the Covid-19 patients has reached nearly 74% (73.91%) reflecting that the number of patients recovering is on a steady rise over the past several months.“This is a good sign that people are getting better and our mortality is low. Most positive cases do not require hospitalisation, and those needing intensive care is actually a minuscule number. Most people in hospitals have moderate disease with good chances of recovery,” says Dr Rommel Tickoo, senior consultant, department of internal medicine, Max Healthcare.Also read:| Covid-19: 10 biggest hotspots of the disease in IndiaThe record high recoveries have ensured that the actual caseload of the country in terms of the active cases, has reduced and currently comprises only 24.19% of the total positive cases since the first case was diagnosed on January 30, 2020.The case fatality ratio (CFR) is lower than the global average of about 3.5%, and is progressively declining. India’s current case fatality rate stands at 1.89%, and a very small proportion of the active cases (0.28%) is on ventilator support.“The need is to take care of our old and vulnerable population with co-morbidities that is at high risk of developing severe illness,” says Dr Tickoo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/68-7k-fresh-cases-take-tally-near-3mn/story-WIR7jlM53kgfHq5eU5Z5rI.html
21-08-2020||India||Glittering Golf Course Road at centre of Gurugram’s regular flooding woes||Gurugram: Golf Course Road (GCR) is a seven-kilometre, signal-free corridor that boasts some of the toniest residential apartment blocks and imposing steel-and-glass office facades in Gurugram, with wide driving spaces and underpasses leading into and out of the city . Underneath all the glitter, the stretch between Ghata T-Point and Bristol Chowk has many drawbacks that were exposed when torrential rain lashed GCR on Wednesday and triggered chaos.Three underpasses were flooded by the rain, one of which at DLF Phase 1 could be cleared only by late Thursday evening, after more than 30 hours of non-stop efforts by fire service personnel to drain the water. Such was the extent of flooding that the entire structure was filled with rainwater, some of which started overflowing onto the main carriageway located more than three metres above the underpass.It was in October 2010 that the project of redesigning Golf Course Road was outsourced to DLF. In June 2012, DLF and Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP).jointly started construction of the 16-lane project and three years later, most of the work on the main carriageways was completed.In March 2017, the first of the three underpasses was opened to traffic at Bristol Chowk; the second opened at DLF Phase 1 a month later; and the one at Genpact Chowk became operational in March 2018.As part of the agreement between HSVP and DLF, the latter was the caretaker of the stretch and the former the owner.Starting at 11 am on Wednesday, each of these three underpasses was flooded and the traffic police had to close them to traffic. Underpasses at Genpact Chowk and Bristol Chowk were drained of flood waters by Wednesday evening, but the one at DLF Phase 1 proved to be more challenging.A DLF executive said the main HSVP drain through which the underpasses’ drainage system is connected was choked and as a result, the rainwater flowed back.“At each of the three underpasses, we have a chamber located below the underpasses where rainwater is stored and is pumped out from our motors towards the HSVP’s master line. On Wednesday, HSVP’s pipeline was choked especially at the line connected to DLF Phase 1 underpass due to which the entire rainwater flowed back and inundated the underpass,” said the executive, who requested anonymity.Starting in 2018, all of HSVP’s drains were transferred to the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA).“We are still examining the reason behind the waterlogging of the underpasses on GCR as it has occurred for the first time at this particular stretch. GCR does not have any drains on the surface and as a result rainwater from across the road flows down towards the underpasses. We are suspecting that the motor pumps installed by DLF were either not working or working at a limited capacity. We are verifying this,” said VS Kundu, chief executive officer of GMDA. Rakesh Kapoor, a resident of DLF 5, said that he had a narrow escape; he managed to navigate his vehicle through the underpass just a few minutes before it was completely flooded. “I have an SUV, which has a high ground clearance due to which I was able to clear the underpass in the nick of time as the level of rainwater suddenly started rising. Soon after I cleared the underpass, I took a U-turn and decided to head back home. On my way, I saw a sedan was stuck inside the underpass, and its occupant had left it midway. I was left completely shocked and appalled. I paid crores of money to purchase a house in a safe area, but I cannot even get a safe stretch of road to drive on during rains. My moving from Delhi seemed futile,” said Kapoor. Nine cars broke down in the waterlogging on Wednesday on Golf Course Road and seven two wheelers got stuck, said Sanjeev Balhara, assistant commissioner of police (traffic). “We removed the cars with the help of cranes and ropes tied to PCR {police control room} vehicles and the personnel helped the motorcyclists to park their vehicles at safe places. Two drivers had to swim to get to a safe spot, leaving their cars in water. One of the luxury cars was removed on Thursday,” he said. Sewa Ram, an urban transport systems design expert and a faculty member at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) in Delhi, said that drainage system of the underpasses in the city needs to be reviewed. “Since their construction, underpasses have regularly flooded each time there is heavy rain. It is obvious that there is an inherent issue there somewhere. Underpasses are located below the surface level and hence, will always remain susceptible to waterlogging. The underpasses are either not or poorly linked to the master drains, or the latter are choked or operating at a minimal capacity, leading to drain water flowing back. Unless a thorough study and survey assessment is done, the situation will remain the same,” he said. Golf Course Road also has few pedestrian facilities and high-speed accidents are common on the stretch. Barring crossing the stretch from the five rapid metro stations on the road, there are no other facilities available to pedestrians, four of whom died in road accidents on GCR last year, according to the Haryana Vision Zero (HVZ) report.In May 2018, two people died and a woman co-pilot with a commercial airliner was severely injured after their cab collided with an SUV that was travelling on the wrong side inside the Bristol Chowk underpass. In January last year, a 30-year old man working as a chef in one of the eateries on GCR died after he and his pillion rider were hit by a speeding cab at the Genpact Chowk crossing. In January, a luxury sedan hit two motorcycles near the Genpact Chowk underpass, injuring four people.Sarika Panda Bhatt, a road safety expert and the programme coordinator of the now-defunct HVZ, said that in July, last year, the district road safety committee recommended the implementation of pedestrian-friendly measures at eight key crossings on the GCR at Bristol Chowk, DLF Phase 1 and DLF Phase 4 traffic junctions, the Sector 42 junction, two points opposite Club Drive, AIT Chowk, Sector 55-56 bus stop and Ghata T-point.Bhatt said that none of the recommendations ,including pedestrian crossings, signage, road markings and pedestrian lights, have been implemented so far.“None of our recommendations were ever implemented on the stretch. A fresh safety audit of the GCR is required to identify all its ailments for once and get these measures rectified immediately or else lives of thousands would continue to be endangered,” said Bhatt.A statement from DLF said Golf Course Road was jointly upgraded by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and the company, and “designed and developed as per international standard, as a toll-free 16 lane expressway to enhance the connectivity of the adjoining sectors to the national highway.”“The idea behind the Golf Course Road has always been to provide the citizens of Gurugram with world class infrastructure.”The statement further said every element including pavements, foot over-bridges (with the exception of one, pending government approval), wide and tall road partitions, was designed to ensure he safety of pedestrians.“While we have put in all our efforts in making it seamless for both commuters and pedestrians, however, the day to day management and policing is beyond our control, and lies with the civic authorities.” the statement said. The statement blamed the flooding of the underpass in DLF Phase I on reverse discharge of rain water from the master drainage system, without apportioning blame. “Despite two consecutive nights of rains, a team of more than 60 people from DLF have been working tirelessly over the past 30 hours, with 2 fire engines, water tanks and pumps, alongside the government authorities, to make the underpass operational by Thursday evening.We were extremely swift in deploying all our resources to clear 6 out of 7 underpasses on Raghavendra Marg, in less than 6 hours time, despite high intensity rainfall which is 6-7 times higher than the designed capacity of the master drainage system of Gurugram,” the company added in the statement. HSVP administrator Jitender Yadav said his agency had nothing to do with maintaining the GCR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/glittering-golf-course-road-at-centre-of-gurugram-s-regular-flooding-woes/story-Zi3nRN7WR7IIXE2m74jCiM.html
21-08-2020||India||Record 900k Covid-19 tests done on Wednesday||Only 0.28% of Covid-19 patients are on ventilator, 1.92%, undergoing treatment in intensive care units (ICUs) and 2.62%, on oxygen therapy, the latest data from the health ministry shows -- indicating that most of the infections are either asymptomatic or mild, and that , in keeping with the trend evident around the world, doctors here are being able to cure most cases that require hospitalisation. The active cases as on Wednesday were 686,395, according to the ministry. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here India on Wednesday tested a record 9 lakh-plus samples for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), with the total number of people who have been tested crossing 30.25 million. Pune’s National Institute of Virology, under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), conducted the first Covid-19 test on January 23, while the first case of the viral outbreak in the country was detected on January 30. “India scales a new peak in daily testing. More than 9 lakh (9,18,470) Covid-19 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours. The positivity rate has come down to below 8% (in the past 2 weeks). The daily testing capacity is likely to reach 10 lakhs (1 million) soon . The tests per million has also seen a sharp rise,” the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW) said in a statement.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “Expanded diagnostic lab network across the country and effective measures to facilitate easy testing have given a substantial boost to the present numbers. As a result of these focused actions, the tests per million (TPM) have seen a sharp increase to 23668. The TPM continues to maintain the constant upward trend,” the ministry added. India has approved 1494 labs for Covid-19 testing (977 government and 517 private labs). While the country’s testing capacity is recording a constant rise, it is the positivity rate of about 8% that experts believe is a cause for concern. Because of increased testing, the positivity rate of Covid-19 recorded a jump from about 4% in April to about 9% in August. Also read: ICMR looks at private medical colleges to ramp up Covid-19 testing infraHowever, since August 1 the positivity rate has hovered between 8.81 and 8.93%. “The positivity rate, which has by and large been constant since August 1, signifies that Covid-19 cases are still being reported, and the transmission cycle has not yet been broken. The virus is still very much in circulation. The positivity rate of 5% or below for a prolonged period of time is what should be aimed at in a bid to rein in the spread of the contagion,” said Dr. Lalit Kant, former head, epidemiology and communicable diseases division, ICMR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/record-900k-tests-done-on-wednesday/story-qY6Gt6tYwh4a5FfxnQBoIL.html
21-08-2020||India||ICMR looks at private medical colleges to ramp up Covid-19 testing infra||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is ramping up molecular testing for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) by approving medical colleges, including private ones, with labs that have the capacity to do Reverse-Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing, the most accurate way to diagnose the viral disease. With 900,000 tests performed on Wednesday, ICMR is inching closer to achieving its target of building enough capacity for India to perform one million tests a day by the end of the month. Currently, about 25-30% of the Covid-19 tests are performed using rapid antigen tests, according to ICMR. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Among the 47 labs that are currently under various stages of receiving ICMR approvals to conduct Covid-19 testing, 46 belong to private medical colleges. RT-PCR is the gold standard of testing for Sars- CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. All the identified laboratories are equipped to perform the test, ICMR said. RT-PCR has essential requirements in terms of biosafety and biosecurity as well as specialized equipment; it needs a sophisticated laboratory to carry out the test, and ICMR has been making efforts to identify and add as many laboratories as possible to conduct it. Currently, 1,494 labs are conducting Covid-19 tests in the country, including 977 labs in the government sector and 517 in the private sector. Experts say RT-PCR may be a complex text to perform, but is the most accurate molecular test available currently, and an important component in enhancing testing capacity. Also read: 68.7k fresh Covid-19 cases take tally near 3 million“RT-PCR is the gold standard of testing . Having said that, rapid antigen is quicker so there is this accuracy vs. speed challenge that we have to face. As far as accuracy is concerned, RT-PCR any given day is more reliable,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases, ICMR. Rapid antigen tests throw up more false negatives (they identify infected people as uninfected, but results are usually available with the hour. In contrast, RT-PCR tests could take three to four days including logistical delays -- something that could work against the principle of quickly identifying and isolating infected people. The maximum number of labs are located at private colleges in two states, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, with the former having 24 lab approvals under process and the latter, 15. The other states with their labs under consideration are located in Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan with one lab each. One college on the list is a government medical college in Maharashtra. Also read: Serum Institute registers its Covid vaccine trial“Several measures are being taken to ensure testing capacity meets the target of one million tests in the coming weeks. The measures include making use of labs of medical colleges with the basic infrastructure to conduct molecular tests that can be mentored and upgraded to equip them to perform Covid-19 tests,” said an ICMR official who asked not to be named. In addition, this person added, work is also afoot to upgrade existing labs by way of increasing testing machines, manpower and shifts to be able to run more samples in a day. The million-tests-a-day target was first suggested in a column in Hindustan Times. Efforts are also being made to make use of some RT-PCR machines installed in other government labs that are being used for performing other molecular tests. “There are about 200 such machines in other labs that can also be deployed for Covid-19 testing. All this is being done to ensure we reach the target of one million as planned,” the official cited above added. “In times of pandemic, it is a good idea to make use of all available resources at hand, and the private sector has come in quite handy both for testing and patient management in Covid-19 response. Almost all medical colleges have a full-fledged microbiology department running and their laboratories are well-equipped to do these tests,” said Dr MC Misra, former director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. “Since we still have a long way to go in this pandemic, the capacity building in whichever way possible must be continued,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-looks-at-private-medical-colleges-to-ramp-up-testing-infra/story-8n56mfHrFd20U5q3ACWmHK.html

Called the ‘New File Management System’, this package would help all departments of the university to deal with different files confidentially and safely online, informed AU officials. For this, the computers in the administrative and the accounts sections of the university would be linked to a separate server, they said. “It is a robust package wherein a person granted access to the system will be able to access it from anywhere. A two-stage authentication has been provided to take care of security. To use the system, the user will have to login using the e-mail ID and password with which the admin has created the account of the user. Then, a second authentication will be done using Google Authenticator App,” said acting vice chancellor Prof RR Tiwari. One would be able to write a note on a file and pass it on to the next person in the hierarchy, who after putting his/her own noting would pass it on to the next person, he added. This package had been developed by a team comprising Sugam Tripathi, Rahul Kumar Mishra and Saumya Srivastava, he said. Prof Tiwari said that each employee had been provided a unique ID code through which the system would be accessed. Any registered user could access the system and work according to his/her role. So, proper tracking of the files would be automatically maintained by the system as the code of each employee was registered, he claimed. The acting VC said that the new system would cut down processing time and increase accountability as it would be easy to track how long a file had been stuck with a particular person in the queue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allahabad-university-gets-refurbished-website-with-extra-safety-built-in/story-F3cN7WmqNWAJaNvyMOYpxK.html
21-08-2020||India||Bihar govt rescues Covid patient allegedly held captive by hospital for failure to clear bills||The Bihar government Monday initiated de-empanelment procedure against a private hospital in Patna after it found serious lapses in its functioning, following a complaint that a Covid-19 patient was held captive for failure to clear hospital bills. The Patna district administration had to intervene to secure the patient’s release later in the evening. The JDM Hospital at Kankerbagh had demanded Rs 6.34 lakh for 20 days of treatment of a 48-year-old man from Patna. His relatives had paid Rs 2.44 lakh, after which they wanted the patient to be discharged, saying the hospital’s charges were inflated and arbitrary. The Bihar government is yet to put a cap on charges though last month it forced private hospitals to initiate treatment of Covid-19 patients. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.“The rates for treatment of Covid-19 patients at private hospitals may be ready by Wednesday,” said Pratyaya Amrit, Bihar’s principal secretary, health. It was Amrit who came to the rescue of the patient after his attendants reached out to him on Monday. He sent a medical team to the hospital to scrutinise the bill and arbitrate the case. The team slashed down the bill to Rs 1.90 lakh. “The hospital had raised exorbitant and frivolous charges in the bill. It had even included the cost of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. The cost of gloves alone came to Rs 8,000 per day. I was told another Rs 85,000 was to cover for the government’s ex-gratia payment to the next of kin of those who die of Covid-19,” said Amber Kaifi, the patient’s nephew. Bihar has announced an ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh to the next of kin of those who die of Covid-19. “The cost of medicines, prescribed in huge quantities was repetitive in the bill. The hospital would not give proper break-up of charges,” he added. The hospital administration, however, denied it. “The patient’s relative had claimed in the media that we are charging them Rs 50,000 per day. As per that calculation, the hospital bill should have run up to Rs 10 lakh. We have raised Rs 6.34 lakh only, which the attendant doesn’t want to pay now,” said Amit Kumar, co-director of the JDM Hospital. “Twenty days of ICU treatment, with 10 days on ventilator support, you tell me what the bill should be?” he asked this reporter. “We are paying our hospital staff double and triple their salary and yet they are reluctant to work in Covid-19 wards. In the instant case, we are not willing to refund any money to the patient’s attendant. In fact, we just want the attendant to pay an additional Rs 70,000 incurred on medicines and tests of the patient,” he said. “If we are forced to refund money to the attendant and not even recover our basic cost, I may have to close down our hospital or even think of committing suicide,” added Kumar. “We got the matter enquired and found that the hospital is not maintaining records properly and is giving provisional bills to patients. An FIR is being filed against the hospital and it is being de-empanelled for treatment of Covid-19,” said Amrit. Patna civil surgeon Dr Raj Kishore Chaudhary said, “This is the second such case in about a week at the hospital. Earlier, it refused to release a body of a Covid-19 patient, forcing us to intervene and sort out the issue.” Later, Kaifi confirmed that he did not have to pay anything beyond Rs 2.44 lakh, which he had already paid to the hospital, as the patient was discharged around 8.30pm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-govt-rescues-covid-patient-allegedly-held-captive-by-hospital-for-failure-to-clear-bills/story-bGkMVkrdGfH08pthfALO7M.html
21-08-2020||Editorials||Biden’s electoral strategy | HT Editorial||United States (US) presidential candidate Joe Biden had one abiding goal during the just-concluded Democratic Party Convention — keeping his flock together. Mr Biden had to motivate his disparate sources of support — young liberal activists, middle-class suburban Whites, minorities, and moderate conservatives — to show up and vote for him in November. The US voter is prone to staying at home, a tendency likely to be exaggerated by Covid-19. The American Left has never been enthused by Mr Biden, and much of the convention saw their icons, such as former first lady Michelle Obama, giving him ringing endorsements. The convention also reached out to the party’s other diverse support groups, in terms of ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation. This is where vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris came into her own.The Democratic Party system backed Mr Biden because it believed only he could appeal to both the converted and the uncertain. Mr Biden also needed to reassure the independent, fence-sitting US voter. Many of these are defectors from the Republican Party, repelled by President Donald Trump’s character. It was no accident the convention had four moderate Republicans and an independent on its speaker roster. Mr Biden’s own acceptance speech kept policy pronouncements in the margins. The focus was on contrasting a future Biden administration with the ethical and ideological morass of another four years of Mr Trump. The almost biblical refrain he used was, bring “light” to the existing “darkness”. Going by media and a smattering of polls, Mr Biden was able to satisfy his base, but the middle will wait until Mr Trump accepts his nomination next week.Mr Biden has maintained a lead over Mr Trump for six months in a row. But national polls are irrelevant in the US’ electoral college system. What matters is who wins the roughly dozen or so swing states and their electoral college votes. In these swing states, the race is much narrower. There is no expectation of a bounce in the polls after this or next week’s Republican Convention. Virtual summits generate less excitement and attract smaller audiences. Both candidates will preach to their own flocks and hope their message spreads further. It says something about the unusual nature of the present elections that the whims of a virus may yet prove the most important factor in deciding the winner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/biden-s-electoral-strategy/story-6cSnhbtIaMPModqz91qLFP.html
